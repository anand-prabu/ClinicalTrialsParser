    <textblock>
      The multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) has remained the major factor contributing to
       prolongation of intensive  and mortality. It is reported that the mortality rates have
      varied between 20% and 100%, depending on number, severity, duration, type and combination,
      and definition of dysfunction. In our study, the investigators explore some comprehensive
      treatment technology to improved  outcomes of MODS patients.

    <description>According to the outcomes of 28-day,all the enrolled patients were divided into survival group and death group, clinical datum of which were collected and analysed. And then these prognosis were evaluated with the current scoring systems [(Acute Physiology and Chronic Health EvaluationⅡ(APACHEⅡ, APACHE Ⅲ), Sample Acute Physiological score(SAPSⅡ), Multiple Organ Dysfunction score(MODS)], the predictive power of which were compared by receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curve. Finally, a binary logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the concerning prognostic factors of MODSE.</description>
