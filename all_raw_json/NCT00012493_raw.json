In this project patient who have recently\n      suffered a cardiac event are being monitored with cardiac monitors for 24 hours up to 4\n      times during the year following their cardiac event.  Similarly a second group of patients\n      with moderate to severe heart failure will undergo similar cardiac monitoring for 24 hours,\n      twice a week separated by 3 months.  In both sets of patients home indoor pollution measures\n      will be continuously made and used to correlate with measures of heart rate variability."

For both groups residence requirements are\n        that they reside within the Greater Boston Area as defined by an outer ring road (Route\n        495) and are willing to be visited at home and have the exposure assessment equipment set\n        up in their home as well as be monitored personally."
