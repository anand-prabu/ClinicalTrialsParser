  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative analgesia is an important part of the anesthetic care. According to the recent
      studies, multimodal analgesia can provide better analgesia &amp; patient satisfaction with fewer
      side effect. For example, combining intravenous, intramuscular or oral analgesics with
      transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block or local anesthetic (LA) infiltration as the
      multimodal analgesia, can furnish a more effective pain control after the abdominal surgery.

      For abdominal surgery, both local infiltration and TAP block target on relieving somatic
      pain. Local anesthetic wound infiltration is easy to perform with low risk. As the
      advancement of ultrasound technology, performing the TAP block also becomes easier, safer
      and more accurate. But whether LA infiltration or TAP block is better for the multimodal
      analgesia regimen remains unclear.

      This study is to compare the postoperative pain score, opioid consumption, side effects, and
      quality of recovery between these two analgesic methods in patients undergoing abdominal
      surgery. The investigators hypothesized that TAP block may be more effective than LA
      infiltration as a part of the multimodal analgesia, and can improve the recovery after the
      abdominal surgery.
