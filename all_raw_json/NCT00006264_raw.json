Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to\n      kill lymphoma cells. Combining these treatments may be effective in treating AIDS-related\n      primary central nervous system lymphoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining zidovudine, ganciclovir, and\n      interleukin-2 in treating patients who have AIDS-related primary central nervous system\n      lymphoma."

Patients also receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV every 12\n           hours on days 1-14 and a combination antiretroviral therapy consisting of nucleoside\n           reverse transcriptase inhibitors (one of which must be AZT), nonnucleoside reverse\n           transcriptase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors. AZT and ganciclovir treatment\n           continues for an additional 7 days if partial response is achieved.\n\n        -  Maintenance therapy: Patients receive IL-2 subcutaneously 3 times a week for 6 months.\n           Patients also receive oral ganciclovir 3 times a day and combination antiretroviral\n           therapy (AZT allowed, but not required). Treatment continues in the absence of disease\n           progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6\n      months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
