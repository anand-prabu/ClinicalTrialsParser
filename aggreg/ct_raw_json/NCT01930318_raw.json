This condition is known\n      as insulin resistance (IR) characterized by hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and lactic\n      acidosis. Surgical IR not only affect glucose metabolism but also influence protein\n      synthesis, then further exacerbate the depletion of the carbohydrate, fat and protein.\n\n      Postoperative pain is a challenging task for patients and surgeons, and it is part of the\n      stress response to trauma and surgery, while the fear of pain can exacerbate the stress\n      response.\n\n      The main aim of this study was to invest whether effective postoperative analgesia can\n      reduce the stress response and insulin resistance."
