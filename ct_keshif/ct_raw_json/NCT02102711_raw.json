            "textblock": "Vitamin A is essential for optimal growth, and development. In the newborn, especially if\n      preterm, it is necessary  for the cellular differentiation, for the health of the anterior\n      eye,  it is a constituent of visual pigment, and it is essential for surfactant synthesis.\n      Immune response Vitamin A supplementation demonstrated to reduces infancy mortality, but\n      very low (<1500g birth weight) and extremely low (<1000g birth weight) preterm infants are\n      born with low body stores of vitamin A and are at high risk of vitamin A deficiency.\n      Nevertheless, optimal vitamin A supplementation for these infants is not clearly defined,\n      despite evidence of benefit of an  early supplementation.\n\n      Prematurity is associate to the risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) which is a disease\n      marked by respiratory compromise associated with high mortality and severe long-term\n      morbidity, as well as  prematurity is associate to the risk for retinopathy, a pathology\n      that may be related to less rhodopsin quantity which seem dependent on vitamin A\n      concentration. Vitamin A can be given enterally, intramuscularly, or intravenously. Recently\n      an oral administration as drops is available resulting particularly convenient avoiding the\n      pain associated with repetitive intramuscular injections, or the discomfort of parenteral\n      administration. Studies of vitamin A in the infant population suggest that plasma retinol\n      concentrations >0.7 \u00b5M/L indicate vitamin A sufficiency, nevertheless preterm infants have\n      lower concentration and concentration < 0.35 \u00b5M/L are very dangerous. Vitamin A deficiency\n      at this level may constitute a problem for preterm newborn, resulting for example, in\n      histological alterations in the respiratory epithelium leading to chronic lung disease,\n      retinopathy of prematurity, patency of the ductus arteriosis, and immune competence\n      deficiency.\n\n      The aim of the present study is to verify efficacy and tolerability of a new oral\n      administration of vitamin A as drops, 3000 IU/kg/die for 4 weeks, in infants < 1500g weight\n      at birth, verifying the competence of the supplementation reaching ideal blood concentration\n      (\u22650.7 \u00b5M/L) and relating the blood achieved concentrations of vitamin A to the outcome in\n      typical pathologies, as BPD and ROP."
