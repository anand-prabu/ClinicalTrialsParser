    <textblock>
      Misoprostol is the primary drug of choice for medical termination. It is not only cheap, but
      also stable at room temperature and easily available worldwide. It is indicated for the
      treatment of gastritis, but is widely used off-label for a variety of indications in the
      practice of obstetrics and gynecology, including medication abortion, induction of labor,
      and the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage. The optimal dosage and route of administration
      have not been well defined and vary with physicians. The potency of misoprostol's effect
      varies with dosage, route of administration and dosing interval; both maternal and fetal
      factors may, to certain extent, affect the abortion interval. This study aims to analyze the
      factors influencing the abortion interval of second-trimester termination of pregnancy using
      misoprostol.
