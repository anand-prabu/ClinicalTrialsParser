  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retrospective study to comply with FDA's post-market surveillance order.  The purpose of the
      study is to contact patients who have received a Biomet metal-on-metal product as their
      primary total hip arthroplasty device.  Patients who have not been revised prior to contact
      will be asked to submit to a blood draw, clinical exam and MRI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to estimate the prevalence of soft tissue changes following
      primary THA surgery in patients having received one of five Biomet implant types; a MOP
      primary THA, an M2a 38, M2a Taper, M2a Ringloc and M2a Magnum MOM primary THA device in
      308-436 total patients at four centers.

      The primary objective of the study is to estimate the prevalence of soft tissue changes in
      unbiased MoM and MoP samples.  Secondary objectives are to evaluate whether the occurrence
      of soft tissue changes is related to any of several potential covariates including patient
      and implant characteristics and time in situ.
