        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects of any race, aged ≥55 and ≤85 years at time of entry into
             study EVP-6124-024 or EVP-6124-025

          -  Informed consent form (ICF) for this extension study signed by the subject or legally
             acceptable representative and an ICF signed by the support person/caregiver before
             initiation of any study-specific procedures

          -  Successful completion (Day 182) of study EVP-6124-024 or EVP-6124-025

          -  No clinically significant change in the judgment of the investigator in the subject's
             medical status during study EVP-6124-024 or EVP-6124-025

          -  In the judgment of the investigator, extension treatment is in the best interest of
             the subject

          -  Fertile, sexually active subjects (men and women) must use an effective method of
             contraception during the study.  Female subjects and the female partner of male
             subjects must be surgically sterile (hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation),
             postmenopausal for at least 1-year, or willing to practice adequate methods of
             contraception if of childbearing potential (defined as consistent use of combined
             effective methods of contraception [including at least 1 barrier method])

          -  Reliable and capable support person/caregiver, who if not living in the same
             household, interacts with the subject approximately 4 times per week and will be
             available to attend clinic visits in person when possible

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant risk of suicidal or violent behavior in the judgment of the investigator

          -  Adverse events from the previous study (EVP-6124-024 or EVP-6124-025) that have not
             resolved, are moderate or severe, judged to be possibly related or related to study
             drug, and considered by the investigator to be a contraindication to extension study
             participation

          -  Any condition that would make the subject in the judgment of the investigator
             unsuitable for the study

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant, nursing, or planning to become pregnant during the
             extension study
