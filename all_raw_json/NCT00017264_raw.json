Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 2-10 patients receive escalating doses of atrasentan until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 1\n      patient experiences dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 35 patients will be accrued for this study."
