Combining more than one drug and giving the drugs in different\n      combinations may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy\n      regimen is more effective in treating ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian\n      tube cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of different combination\n      chemotherapy regimens in treating patients who have stage IIB, stage III, or stage IV\n      ovarian epithelial cancer , primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer."

Patients are stratified according to\n      participating center, age (65 years and under vs over 65 years), and pre-randomization\n      surgery (no debulking vs debulking with macroscopic residual disease less than 1 cm vs\n      debulking with macroscopic residual disease 1 cm or greater vs debulking with no macroscopic\n      residual disease). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 60 minutes on day 1 and topotecan IV over 30\n           minutes on days 1-5 of courses 1-4 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV\n           over 30 minutes on day 1 of courses 5-8.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes\n           on day 1 of courses 1-8.\n\n      In both arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Planned interval debulking surgery should occur after course 3 or 4.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline; on day 1 of courses 3, 5, and 7; at the end of the\n      last course; and at 3 and 6 months after study treatment completion.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 800 patients (400 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 2 years."
