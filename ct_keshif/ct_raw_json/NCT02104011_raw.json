Development of anti-angiogenic therapies is a major and growing field of\n      research in hypervascularized tumors. Angiomyolipomas have been shown to regress after\n      prolonged treatment with mTOR inhibitors (Sirolimus), but with a large proportion of\n      secondary effects. We showed recently that beta-blockers were able to induce regression of\n      infantile hemagiomas. Consequently, we looked for and found, histologically, in a few cases\n      of angiomyolipomas the presence of beta2 receptors.\n\n      The aim of the study is to estimate if beta-blockers could induce regression or\n      stabilization of renal angiomyolipomas in tuberous sclerosis in a pilot study."
