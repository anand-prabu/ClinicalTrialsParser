Subjects must have had an active lice infestation including live lice.\n\n          3. Individuals in otherwise good general health, free of any systemic or  dermatologic\n             disorders which, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or designee, would\n             interfere with the study results or increase the risk of adverse events.\n\n          4. A parent (or guardian) must have signed an Informed Consent Form to allow any child\n             to participate in the study.\n\n          5. Subjects must have been available to stay in the clinic for blood draws. Parents or\n             guardians must have been available to stay in the clinic, with the subject, for the\n             entire duration of the study.\n\n          6. Subjects must have had veins capable of insertion of a Heplock catheter or\n             withstanding multiple blood draws as determined by the Principal Investigator or\n             qualified phlebotomist.\n\n          7. Normal values (at screening) for serum chemistry and hematology for subjects, unless\n             the principal Investigator or qualified medical designee determined that the abnormal\n             value was not clinically significant.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. History of irritation or sensitivity to pediculicide or hair care products or\n             ingredients.\n\n          2. History of known allergy or sensitivity to topical anesthetics including lidocaine\n             and prilocaine.\n\n          3. History of allergy or sensitivity to Heparin.\n\n          4. Systemic diseases that could have interfered with the results of this study as\n             determined by the Principal Investigator or designee.\n\n          5. Any condition or illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator or designee, may\n             have compromised the objective of the protocol or the safety of the subject.\n\n          6. The use of antibiotics or other systemic medications within 2 weeks of the screening\n             visit, which in the opinion of the Investigator or designee could have interfered\n             with the outcome of the study.\n\n          7. Participation in a previous drug study within the past 30 days.\n\n          8. Individuals with any visible skin/scalp condition (other than from an active lice\n             infestation) at the treatment site which would have interfered with the evaluations\n             according to the opinion of the Investigator or designee.\n\n          9. Parents or guardians who, in the opinion of the Investigator, did not understand\n             their child's requirements for study participation and/or may be likely to exhibit\n             poor compliance."
