This research project will test whether Problem Solving Therapy (PST) is\n      successful in preventing major depression for those living with mild cognitive impairments.\n      We will also examine the effect of modest exercise on mood. You will participate in 8 to 12\n      PST sessions over 16 weeks. All treatments are provided at no cost and there is compensation\n      for participation."
