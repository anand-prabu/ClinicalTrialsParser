Inhibition of gastric acid secretion by intravenous\n      proton pump inhibitor infusion can have a positive impact on the prevention of ulcer\n      rebleeding after successful endoscopic therapy. However, the rebleeding rate can still be\n      high in patients with comorbid illnesses even after proton pump inhibitor usage.\n      Hypoalbuminemia has been reported to be a significant predictor of poor prognosis in\n      patients with comorbid illnesses.  Low serum albumin levels are associated with poor\n      prognosis of wound healing and peptic ulcer bleeding; therefore, it is worthy to conduct a\n      head-to-head comparison to validate whether administration of albumin can be helpful in\n      improving the control of bleeding peptic ulcers, especially in patients with comorbid\n      illnesses.\n\n      The albumin level may reflect upstream pathologic processes, such as stress or\n      co-morbidities. Albumin administration may interrupt the downstream chain of poor outcome\n      and thus maintain a favorable homeostasis in critically ill patients, and reduce morbidity.\n      However, the clinical benefit of controlling peptic ulcer bleeding with exogenous albumin\n      remains uncertain, and thus administration of albumin is not widely applied. Accordingly,\n      the investigators conducted this pilot intervention to test whether short-term exogenous\n      albumin administration can improve the control of peptic ulcer bleeding in hypoalbuminemic\n      patients, who are at high risk of recurrent bleeding."
