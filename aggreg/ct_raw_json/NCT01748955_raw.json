It is among the\n      leading causes of disability and is the psychiatric disorder most often associated with\n      suicide. The treatment of MDD with antidepressant medication remains largely trial and\n      error. Little empirical evidence exists to guide the treatment of MDD when suicide risk is a\n      major factor.\n\n      The study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare the effects of\n      paroxetine, an SSRI, versus bupropion, a non-SSRI, on brain activity in depressed patients\n      with a past suicide attempt and/or current suicidal thoughts. Participants are randomly\n      assigned to either paroxetine or bupropion treatment for 8 weeks, with fMRI scans involving\n      a reward processing task at baseline and Week 8. Weekly study visits include interviews with\n      a psychologist, self-report scales, and medication monitoring. All participants will then be\n      offered 4 additional months of open clinical treatment. If original medication assignments\n      prove to be ineffective, participants will have the option to switch to another medication.\n      After completing the study, participants will be referred for ongoing treatment."

Failure to respond to adequate trials of 3 SSRIs or paroxetine or bupropion in the\n             last 2 years (failure to respond to therapeutic trial defined as: at least 2/3\n             maximal PDR dose for at least 6 weeks).\n\n         10.
