Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of carboplatin and irinotecan until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at\n      which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed for at least 30 days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-9\n      months."
