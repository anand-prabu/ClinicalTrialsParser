Second, the investigators wish to encourage a healthy lifestyle through\n      personalized nutrition and fitness advice, delivered as part of a web based program, which\n      will in turn lead to increases in heart healthy behaviors such as increased consumption of\n      heart healthy foods, increased exercise initiation, and more positive attitudes about\n      health. To assess this, the investigators plan to randomize 200 employees with Metabolic\n      Syndrome to either the new web-based diet and lifestyle program, or to care-as-usual, which\n      is the  currently offered MyWellnessAdvantage and WebMD websites. The investigators\n      hypothesize that the web-based group will show greater improvements in physical health (such\n      as weight loss, cholesterol reduction, etc.) as well as increased consumption of heart\n      healthy foods, exercise initiation, and quality of sleep as measured by surveys administered\n      at the 4,8, and 12 month follow-up appointments."
