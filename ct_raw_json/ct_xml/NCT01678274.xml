  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Turner syndrome is a congenital complete or partial lack one of the female sex chromosomes
      affecting 1 of 2000 live born girls.  The syndrome is characterized by an increased
      prevalence of ischemic heart disease, aortic dilation and dissection, hypertension, stroke
      and autoimmune diseases in general.

      Our study aim is:

        -  Using MRI to further characterize and find risk factors leading to aortic dilation.

        -  Using MRI to assess the degree of aortic distensibility.

        -  Using Computed tomography x-ray scanning of the heart and coronary arteries to
           characterize the prevalence and degree of ischemic heart disease and coronary
           anomalies.

        -  Using pressure sensitive ultrasound (applanation tonometry) to assess the degree of
           aortic stiffness when compared to controls using end points as Pulse Wave Velocity,
           Augmentation Index and Central Pulse Pressure.

      Turner syndrome is a congenital complete or partial lack one of the female sex chromosomes
      affecting 1 of 2000 live born girls.  The syndrome is characterized by an increased
      prevalence of ischemic heart disease, aortic dilation and dissection, congenital heart
      defects, hypertension, stroke, ovarian failure, infertility, decreased final height and
      autoimmune diseases in general

      Our study aim is:

        -  Using MRI to further characterize and find risk factors leading to aortic dilation.

        -  Using MRI to describe aortic dimensions

        -  Using MRI to assess the degree of aortic distensibility.

        -  Using Computed tomography x-ray scanning of the heart and coronary arteries to
           characterize the prevalence and degree of ischemic heart disease and coronary
           anomalies.

        -  Using pressure sensitive ultrasound (applanation tonometry) to assess the degree of
