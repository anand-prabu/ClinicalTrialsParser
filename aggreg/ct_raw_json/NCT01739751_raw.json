Patients are recruited for a 3 months individual program promoting daily\n      physical activity enhancement and are randomly assigned either to a  pedometer-based program\n      (experimental group) or to usual care (control group, the measurements at the beginning and\n      at the end of the study are: anthropometrics, Spirometry, dyspnea, quality of life, exercise\n      capacity and the average one week daily steps. Also the number of acute exacerbations during\n      the follow up are recorded."
