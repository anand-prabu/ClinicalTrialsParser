      This is a multi-centered, randomized, controlled study to assess the efficacy, indications
      and adverse reactions of combined administration of nebulized amikacin in patients with
      acute exacerbation of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and to evaluate whether inhaled
      antibiotics are more likely to cause bacterial resistance.

      Objective: To assess the efficacy, indications and adverse reactions of combined
      administration of nebulized amikacin in patients with acute exacerbation of non-cystic
      fibrosis bronchiectasis and to evaluate whether inhaled antibiotics are more likely to cause
      bacterial resistance.

      Methods: Patients with acute exacerbation of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis will be
      randomly assigned to the observer group (participants receive nebulized amikacin BID for 14
      days in combination with standard treatment) or the control group (participants receive
      nebulized 0.9% saline BID for 14 days in combination with standard treatment). The primary
      endpoint was bacterial clearance rate of sputum.

      Expected results: Compared with the control group, bacterial clearance rate of sputum of the
      observer Group will increase significantly.
