  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery still remains the mainstay of treatment for localized colorectal cancer. However,
      nearly 30% of patients with localized colorectal cancer (stage II and stage III) will
      present with recurrence. Tumor progression is mediated by both intrinsic genetic changes and
      by extrinsic epigenetic and host environmental factors, including interactions with the
      immune system. Several studies demonstrated that tumor infiltrating memory T-cells and type,
      density and location of infiltrating T cells are better predictors of disease-free survival
      in patients with CRC compared to the standard TNM staging. These data suggest that tumor
      invasion and progression are more accurately predicted by immune response in the primary
      tumor. In addition, mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient tumors are characterized a priori by a
      higher frequency of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and are associated with significantly
      improved prognosis. Recently, Stotz et al showed that the preoperative lymphocyte to
      monocyte ratio in peripheral blood samples predicts clinical outcome in patients with stage
      III colon cancer. So far there is no comprehensive analysis of the immune-landscape in CRC.

      The aim of the current project is to identify a comprehensive panel of immunomarkers in
      localized colorectal cancer (stage II and stage III) applicable for the detection of
      patients at high risk of recurrence. For the first time, specific tumor-infiltrating immune
      cells, mismatch repair protein expression in tumor tissue and preoperative blood based
      inflammatory markers from routine blood counts in corresponding peripheral blood samples and
      known clinicopathological features will be correlated with outcome in 300 localized CRC
      patients.
