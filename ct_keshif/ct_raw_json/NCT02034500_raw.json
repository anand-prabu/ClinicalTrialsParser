The safety profile of the 1790GAHB\n      vaccine is evaluated in comparison to that of placebo (GAHB-Placebo), constituted by an\n      aluminum hydroxide suspension having the same concentration as study vaccine formulations. A\n      total of 52 eligible subjects will be assigned to one of three sequential cohorts as\n      follows:\n\n      Cohort A) 0.1 \u03bcg ID and 5 \u03bcg IN Cohort B) 1 \u03bcg ID and 20 \u03bcg IN Cohort C) 10 \u03bcg ID, 80 \u03bcg IN\n      and 5 \u03bcg IM Within each cohort, in an observer-blind fashion, subjects will be randomized to\n      receive three vaccinations, four weeks apart, of either 1790GAHB vaccine (at five antigen\n      concentrations) or GAHB placebo. Specifically for IN and ID administration routes, a Data\n      Safety Monitoring Board will be in place to receive a summary of all safety data obtained\n      during one week follow-up post-first vaccination with the lower dose. Based on evaluation of\n      the safety data, the Data Safety Monitoring Board will make a recommendation, as to whether\n      the next cohort should be vaccinated with higher antigen concentration or not.\n\n      Expected duration of the study for an individual subject is 9 months. Each subject will be\n      followed-up for 6 months after the 3rd vaccination"
