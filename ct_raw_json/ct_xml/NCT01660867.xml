  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded, clinical trial

      Subject : 3mo ~ 24mo. aged infants with bronchiolitis

      The effect of 3 % NaCl nebulizer or dexamethasone on admission rate of these infants in ED.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomly assigned to one of three groups

        -  Group I : nebulized epinephrine + 0.9% saline + placebo

        -  Group II : nebulized epinephrine + 3% saline + placebo

        -  Group III : nebulized epinephrine + 0.9% saline + dexamethasone

      Group I received two treatments of nebulized epinephrine mixed 0.9% saline and a total of
      six oral doses of placebo, group II received nebulized epinephrine mixed 3% saline and oral
      placebo, and group III received nebulized epinephrine mixed 0.9% saline and oral
      dexamethasone.

      The primary outcome is hospital admission within 7 days after the day of enrollment
