Patients also receive methotrexate and methylprednisolone\n      intrathecally (IT) on days 1, 4, 9, and 15.\n\n      Patients with a response over 50% proceed to 4-8 weeks of consolidation therapy. This\n      regimen consists of vincristine IV on day 15, cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour followed by\n      methotrexate over 3 hours on day 1, cytarabine IV on days 2-5 and 8-11, asparaginase IV or\n      IM on days 16 and 23, and methotrexate IV over 3 hours on day 15. Patients also receive\n      methotrexate and methylprednisolone IT on days 2 and 16. Patients who achieve complete\n      remission after 4 weeks repeat consolidation therapy for another course.\n\n      Patients then receive 4 weeks of interphase therapy consisting of oral mercaptopurine on\n      days 1 and 22, methotrexate IV over 3 hours on days 1 and 15, and methotrexate and\n      methylprednisolone IT on days 2 and 16.\n\n      Patients with pre-B cell lymphoma then proceed to maintenance therapy. Patients with T cell\n      lymphoma proceed to reinduction therapy. Reinduction A is a 4 week course of chemotherapy\n      administered during months 1, 3, and 5 and consists of vincristine IV on day 1; methotrexate\n      IV over 3 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; methotrexate and methylprednisolone IT on day 2;\n      asparaginase IM or IV on day 2; and oral mercaptopurine. Reinduction B is also a 4 week\n      course of therapy administered during months 2, 4, and 6. This consists of oral prednisone\n      twice a day on days 1-5; cytarabine subcutaneously twice a day on days 1-4; methotrexate IV\n      on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; and oral mercaptopurine.\n\n      Patients then proceed to maintenance therapy, which consists of methotrexate and\n      mercaptopurine once a week. Patients with stage I, II, or III disease continue maintenance\n      therapy for 18 months, while patients with stage IV disease continue this therapy for 24\n      months.\n\n      Patients with stage IV disease with neuromeningeal involvement receive triple intrathecal\n      therapy consisting of methotrexate, cytarabine, and methylprednisolone, then reinduction A\n      for months 1, 2, and 3, then reinduction B for months 4, 5, and 6 (if T cell lymphoma).\n      These patients also receive cerebral irradiation during months 4 and 5. Patients with pre-B\n      cell disease receive cerebral irradiation after intensification therapy.\n\n      Patients with less than 50% response after induction therapy or incomplete remission after\n      4-8 weeks of consolidation therapy, or who have a recurrence of disease are treated with the\n      \"VANDA\" regimen consisting of dexamethasone on days 1-5; cytarabine over 3 hours twice a day\n      on days 1 and 2; mitoxantrone IV over 1 hour on days 3 and 4; etoposide IV over 1 hour on\n      days 3-5; and asparaginase IV over 1 hour or IM on days 7, 9, 11, and 13. Patients also\n      receive triple intrathecal therapy (methotrexate, cytarabine, and methylprednisolone) on day\n      5.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months\n      for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years."
