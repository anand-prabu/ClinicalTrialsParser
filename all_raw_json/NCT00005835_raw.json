Combining chemotherapy with bone marrow or peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of melphalan and buthionine sulfoximine\n      followed by bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating children who\n      have resistant or recurrent neuroblastoma."

The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 84 days and then 2 months later if there is a complete and/or\n      partial response. Patients who continue therapy on other protocols are followed before\n      starting the new therapy. All patients are followed for life for any delayed toxic effects\n      to protocol therapy and secondary malignancies.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-3 years."
