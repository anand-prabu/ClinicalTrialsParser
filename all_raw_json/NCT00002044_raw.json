HIV is both a\n      lymphotropic and neurotropic virus which can affect both the central and peripheral nervous\n      systems (CNS, PNS). There is evidence that the CNS and PNS may harbor the virus in a latent\n      state, with the potential for continuous reinfection of other body systems. Therefore,\n      effective therapeutic efforts against HIV infection should provide effective antiviral\n      activity within the nervous system."
