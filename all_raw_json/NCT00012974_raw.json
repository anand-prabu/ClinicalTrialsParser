            "textblock": "More that 20% of patients in primary care have depressive disorders.  While primary care is\n      the principal venue for treatment for depression, fewer than 25% of depressed patients\n      receive adequate treatment for their depression.  These outcomes can be worse when there are\n      barriers to treatment such as living in a rural area.  Several studies have found that given\n      a choice, about two-thirds of depressed primary care patients prefer psychotherapy or\n      counseling over antidepressant medication.\n\n      This is a controlled, randomized trial in which subjects meeting criteria for major\n      depressive disorder (MDD) from primary care settings in VISN 21 including CBOCs will be\n      randomly assigned to one of two conditions: 1) a 16-session manualized telephone\n      administered cognitive behavioral therapy (T-CBT) delivered over 24 weeks or 2) a\n      treatment-as-usual (TAU) condition.  Telephone-administered cognitive behavioral therapy\n      (T-CBT) is an intervention aimed at improving coping skills and social functioning. It is\n      divided into two phases: 1) an initial treatment phase consisting of 12 weekly sessions\n      aimed at reducing symptoms of depression, and 2) a booster phase in which 4 sessions are\n      provided at increasingly greater intervals to target maintenance of treatment gains. T-CBT,\n      administered by doctoral level psychologists, will be compared to a treatment-as-usual (TAU)\n      condition that controls for the natural course of depression during the course of treatment."
