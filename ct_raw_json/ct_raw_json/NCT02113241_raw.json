Some studies indicate that SGLT2 inhibitors have\n      benefits on blood pressure, triglycerides levels and help to raise the levels of high\n      density lipoproteins cholesterol (c-HDL).\n\n      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of dapagliflozin on metabolic syndrome,\n      insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion.\n\n      The investigators hypothesis is that the administration of dapagliflozin modifies the\n      metabolic syndrome, insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion."
