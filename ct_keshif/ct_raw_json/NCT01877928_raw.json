Assessments will be\n      done before surgery and then at 1, 2 and 24 hours following extubation and will be compared\n      to standard care for perioperative airway support. The study aims to give a broader and more\n      inclusive picture (than the current literature) in terms of whether the Boussignac CPAP\n      system should be considered for utilization by anesthesiologists caring for surgical\n      patients with OSA."
