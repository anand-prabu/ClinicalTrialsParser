III. Correlate\n      the pharmacological parameters with toxicity and response to therapy.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a two arm study. Patients are stratified according to prior nitrosourea\n      administration. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms, with only 1 arm being open at any\n      time. Patients assigned to arm I receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and\n      22. This is followed by a 2 week rest and continues for a maximum of 6 courses. Patients\n      assigned to arm II receive irinotecan on day 1 every 3 weeks for up to 12 courses. Patients\n      in both arms who received prior nitrosoureas receive reduced starting doses of irinotecan.\n      The dosages may be increased once per patient after the first course if toxic effects are\n      acceptable. Arm I closed as of 10/98, Arm II open as of 10/98. Patients are followed every 3\n      months for the first year, every 6 months for the next 4 years, then annually until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 30 patients in each treatment arm in 24 months,\n      for a total of 60 patients."
