To study tumor response in patients with bronchogenic carcinoma-in-situ (CIS) or\n      bronchogenic microinvasive carcinoma.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\n\n      Patients receive HPPH intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. Patients then photodynamic\n      therapy with laser light on day 3. Patients also undergo therapeutic bronchoscopy for\n      endoscopic debridement on day 5.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, 6 months, and\n      then periodically for at least 2 years."
