The main symptoms of pSS are dry eyes and dry mouth, diffuse pain, and\n      fatigue. One third of patients develop systemic features, the most severe being lymphomas.\n\n      Serum IL-6 is increased in serum, saliva, and tears of patients with pSS. IL-6 plays a\n      pivotal role in B-cell activation, a hallmark of the pathogenesis of pSS, and in T-cell\n      differentiation.  Tocilizumab, a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody acts as an IL-6R\n      antagonist. The aim of this randomised double blind placebo controlled trial iss to evaluate\n      the efficacy of tocilizumab for the treatment of pSS."
