A further study\n      may evaluate the effect of chronic DPP4 inhibitor therapy in a population of patients with\n      obesity and pre-diabetes."

            "textblock": "Growth hormone secretion is low in patients with obesity, insulin resistance, and\n      hyperlipidemia. GH therapy in these populations and others has been limited by side effects\n      which include hyperglycemia. Another strategy to increase GH secretion is to enhance\n      pulsatile GH secretion by growth hormone releasing hormone.  Growth hormone releasing\n      hormone (GHRH) has a half life of 5 minutes due to its rapid inactivation by DPP4. An\n      alternative strategy to increase endogenous GH secretion is by inhibiting degradation of\n      GHRH by DPP4. DPP4 inhibitors are currently approved therapies for the treatment of\n      hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. They additionally cause blood\n      vessel relaxation. We therefore propose to test the hypothesis that DPP4 inhibition\n      simultaneously enhances GH secretion while improving blood glucoses and vascular function in\n      patient populations with low GH and increased cardiovascular risk. These preliminary aims\n      serve primarily as a novel \"proof of concept\" study to define the effect of acute\n      pharmacologic DPPIV inhibition on stimulated GH secretion."
