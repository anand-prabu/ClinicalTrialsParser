The\n      information gathered from this study will help understand if patients with higher body\n      weights need a different dosing plan.\n\n      Patients receiving acyclovir as standard of care will be enrolled into this study.  They\n      will have blood draws once before they take acyclovir and 10 times after they take the\n      acyclovir (over a total of 12 hours). These patients will be in the hospital already and\n      will not need to make additional trips back to have blood drawn. A total of about 4\u20145\n      tablespoons of blood will be drawn for this study. 7 obese patients and 7 matched, non\u2014obese\n      patients will be enrolled into this study."
