Patients will receive carboplatin at 35 mg/m2/day IV over 15-20 minutes Monday through Friday, 1-4 hours prior to radiation for 6 weeks (total of 30 doses). Vincristine sulfate 1.5 mg/m2 IV will be given weekly x 6.  Following radiation, patients will receive Maintenance chemotherapy. Patients enrolled prior to Amendment #5 will receive six cycles of cyclophosphamide and vincristine (Regimen A). Patients enrolled after Amendment #5 will receive six cycles of cyclophosphamide, vincristine sulfate and cisplatin (Regimen B)."

Radiation\n      therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining carboplatin and vincristine\n      with radiation therapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy\n      plus radiation therapy followed adjuvant chemotherapy in treating young patients who have\n      newly diagnosed high-risk CNS embryonal tumors."

(Phase I completed as of\n      11-25-03.)\n\n      Within 31 days of definitive surgery, all patients receive vincristine IV weekly for 6 weeks\n      and carboplatin IV over 15-20 minutes (after completion of vincristine infusion) 5 days a\n      week for 6 weeks. Patients undergo radiotherapy (1-4 hours after carboplatin infusion) 5\n      days a week for 6 weeks.\n\n      Cohorts of 6-12 patients receive escalating doses of carboplatin until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 3 of 12\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. (Phase I completed as of 11-25-03.)\n\n      At 6 weeks after completion of radiotherapy, patients are assigned to arm II for\n      adjuvant/maintenance chemotherapy. (Arm I closed to accrual as of 11-25-03.)\n\n        -  Arm I (closed to accrual as of 11-25-03): Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1\n           hour on days 0 and 1, vincristine IV on days 0 and 7, and filgrastim (G-CSF) IV or\n           subcutaneously (SC) beginning on day 2 and continuing for at least 10 days until blood\n           counts recover.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 2, vincristine\n           IV on days 0 and 7, cisplatin IV over 6 hours on day 0, and G-CSF IV or SC beginning on\n           day 3 and continuing for at least 10 days until blood counts recover.\n\n      In both arms, adjuvant/maintenance chemotherapy repeats every 4 weeks for 6 courses.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 8 months, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months\n      for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 162 patients will be accrued for this study."
