Patient is at least 20 years of age and less than 80 years of age with consent is\n             given\n\n          4. In the judgement of an investigator or sub-investigator, the patient is unable to\n             follow verbal instructions\n\n          5. Therapeutic hypothermia using the investigational device can be initiated within six\n             hours of Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC)\n\n          6. Written consent can be obtained from a legally acceptable representative\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Traumatic cardiac arrest (blunt trauma, penetrating trauma, burns, exsanguination,\n             suffocation, smoke inhalation, near drowning, etc)\n\n          2. Accidental hypothermia with core body temperature less than 35.0\u00b0C\n\n          3. Pregnant or of child bearing potential\n\n          4. Patient has given or indicated a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order\n\n          5. Femoral venous access is contraindicated by previous surgey, medical history, anatomy\n             or the like\n\n          6. An inferior vena cava filter is in place\n\n          7. Patient has severe bleeding (Pulmonary hemorrhage, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, etc.)\n\n          8. Intracranial hemorrhage as confirmed by CT scanning\n\n          9. Hemodynamic instability despite use of vasopressor agents and cardiac stimulants\n\n         10. Heparin hypersensitivity\n\n         11. Serious systemic infectious diseases (sepsis, etc.)\n\n         12. Platelet count less than 30,000/mm3\n\n         13. Serious hepatic dysfunction\n\n         14. Serious renal impairment\n\n         15. Using percutaneous cardiopulmonary support (PCPS)\n\n         16. Using continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF)\n\n         17. Therapeutic hypothermia has been otherwise implemented between ROSC and the start of\n             the study (excluding the rapid infusion of non-glucose-containing cold electrolyte\n             fluid, or non-glucose-containing cold plasma volume expander)\n\n         18.

Currently participating in another clinical trial or has participated in another\n             clinical trial within the past six months\n\n         20. in the judgement of an investigator or sub-investigator, participation in this\n             clinical trial is inappropriate for the patient"
