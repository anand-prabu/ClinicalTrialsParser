Treatment, however, is impractical for many physicians to implement during office\n      visits, and there are relatively few providers for NLBP treatment that follow national pain\n      control guidelines.  This study evaluated the efficacy of an on-line intervention using\n      desktop computers or mobile technology to help users self treat NLBP occurrences and to\n      engage in activities to decrease future occurences."
