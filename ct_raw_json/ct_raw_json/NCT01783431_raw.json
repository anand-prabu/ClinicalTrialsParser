The leukapheresis product that is collected from you will be taken to a special lab at MUSC where it will undergo a process that will grow additional dendritic cells under controlled conditions in the lab. These cells will be given together with Poly-ICLC therapy when you begin study treatment. Some days you will receive both Poly-ICLC and dendritic cells, but on other days you will receive the Poly-ICLC by itself.
