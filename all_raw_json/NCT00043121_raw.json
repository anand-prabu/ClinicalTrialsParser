To characterize the pharmacokinetic parameters of capecitabine at the recommended phase\n      II dose for combinations of capecitabine, oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin, as\n      well as for the combination of capecitabine and oxaliplatin.\n\n      II. To observe for and record any antitumor activity.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of capecitabine.\n\n      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium IV, and fluorouracil IV on\n      days 1 and 15. Patients also receive oral capecitabine every 8 hours on days 1-2 and 15-16.\n      Leucovorin calcium and fluorouracil administration is held at dose level 4 and above.\n      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity."
