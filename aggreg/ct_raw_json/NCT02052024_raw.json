The benefits of botulinum therapy are\n      indisputable, however, muscle atrophy is one main adverse effect that may hinder a patient's\n      strength and decrease the ability for the practitioner to accurately administer botulinum\n      toxin to a specific muscle group. This, in turn may cause unintentional weakness of adjacent\n      muscle groups through inaccurate targeting or diffusion of botulinum toxin. Currently, only\n      two serotypes (abbreviated to BTX-A (BOTOX, XEOMIN and DYSPORT) and BTX-B (MYOBLOC),\n      respectively) are used in clinical practice for spasticity. Research has shown that both\n      BTX-A and BTX-B are efficacious in the treatment of spasticity. However, there is no\n      documented literature evaluating if there is a statistically significant difference in the\n      degree of muscle atrophy using BTX-A versus BTX-B."
