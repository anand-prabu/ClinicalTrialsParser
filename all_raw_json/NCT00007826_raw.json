Vaccines made from cancer\n      cells may make the body build an immune response to kill colorectal tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy and/or\n      vaccine therapy in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic colorectal\n      cancer."

Patients are assigned to one of three treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive monoclonal antibody 105AD7 anti-idiotype vaccine (MOAB 105AD7)\n           plus BCG intradermally (ID) weekly for weeks 1 and 2; MOAB 105AD7 ID plus alum adjuvant\n           intramuscularly (IM) weekly for weeks 4 and 6; and then MOAB 105AD7 ID alone monthly\n           for up to 12 months.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive ONYCR1, ONYCR2, and ONYCR3 allogeneic adenocarcinoma\n           cell-based vaccines plus BCG ID weekly for weeks 1 and 2; these vaccines ID weekly for\n           weeks 4 and 6, and then monthly for up to 12 months.\n\n        -  Arm III: Patients receive MOAB 105AD7, ONYCR1, ONYCR2, and ONYCR3 allogeneic\n           adenocarcinoma cell-based vaccines, and BCG ID weekly for weeks 1 and 2; MOAB 105AD7\n           and ONYCR1, ONYCR2, and ONYCR3 allogeneic adenocarcinoma cell-based vaccines ID plus\n           alum adjuvant IM weekly for weeks 4 and 6; and then MOAB 105AD7 and ONYCR1, ONYCR2, and\n           ONYCR3 allogeneic adenocarcinoma cell-based vaccines monthly for up to 12 months.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients (15 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
