Since 4/2010,a clinical OIT program for milk eggs and peanuts is performed at\n      the Institute fir Allergy Asthma  and Immunology at Assaf Harofeh Medical Center with ~500\n      patients so far. Patients with IgE-mediated food allergy that are >4 years old are eligible.\n\n      In this study we intent to follow patients who completed the program. Patients will fill a\n      questionnaire regarding current consumption of the allergenic food, adverse reactions\n      experienced and treatments required including the use of EpiPen. Patients underwent skim\n      prick tests (SPT) for the allergenic food prior to initiation and treatment and will undergo\n      SPT again upon entering the study. Blood tests for IgE, IGG4, basophil activation and\n      cytokines will be obtained.\n\n      Patients who are not consuming the allergenic food regularly will undergo an oral food\n      challenge in clinic."
