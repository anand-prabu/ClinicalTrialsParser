Eligible subjects will have a selected donor site\n      designated as a \"study site\".\n\n      The investigator will identify the test donor site and test location will be considered on\n      the upper anterior thighs as being the most suitable if available. Circumferential donors\n      will be considered acceptable as well.\n\n      Treatment will be initiated in the operation room following debridement and split thickness\n      grafting of wounds. Donors will be harvested at 0.010 - 0.012 in. thickness. Treatment and\n      dressing of test donor site will include hemostasis post harvesting with epinephrine-soaked\n      lap sponges. Once adequate hemostasis is achieved, a Mepilex Transfer Ag dressing will be\n      applied directly to study site. Secondary dressing will include covering with ace wrap.\n\n      Healing should be asses after 10-14 days."
