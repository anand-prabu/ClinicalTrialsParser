  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 trial in China to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of
      Abraxane and gemcitabine administered in patients diagnosed with metastatic pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma.  Approximately 82-246 patients are planned to be accrued.  This study is
      designed to be a Chinese bridging study to complement the Global pivotal study (CA-046).

      The study consists of three parts: (1) Dose evaluation; (2) Single arm to evaluate efficacy
      following an optimal Simon two-stage design; and (3) Randomized 2-arm to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of Abraxane plus gemcitabine versus gemcitabine alone. These 3 parts
      will be carried out sequentially.  The Part 3 randomized 2-arm portion will only be carried
      out if deemed necessary per protocol.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has definitive histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic

          2. Patients must have received no previous radiotherapy, surgery, chemotherapy or
             investigational therapy for the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer.  Prior
             treatment with 5-FU or gemcitabine administered as a radiation sensitizer in the
             adjuvant setting is allowed, provided at least 6 months have elapsed since completion
             of the last dose and no lingering toxicities are present.  Patients having received
             cytotoxic doses of gemcitabine or any other chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting are
             not eligible for this study

          3. Patient has a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥ 70

          4. Initial diagnosis of metastatic disease must have occurred ≤ 6 weeks prior to
             starting Cycle 1 Day 1.  NOTE: the clock for this time interval starts with the date
             of last evaluation confirming pancreatic metastatic disease (either biopsy or imaging
             results)

          5. Patients should be asymptomatic for jaundice prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.  Significant or
             symptomatic amounts of ascites should be drained prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.  Pain

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ upper limit of normal range

               -  Serum creatinine within normal limits or calculated clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73
                  m2 for patients with serum creatinine levels above or below the institutional
                  normal value.  If using creatinine clearance, actual body weight should be used
                  for calculating creatinine clearance (eg, using the Cockroft-Gault formula).
                  For patients with a Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 30 kg/m2, lean body weight should be
                  used instead.

             1 Day 1) as demonstrated by prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time
             (PTT) within normal limits (±15%).  (See also Section 6.2 for Screening PT/PTT
             analysis).
