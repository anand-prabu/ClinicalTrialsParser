The investigators will accomplish this by: 1) Identifying the key elements to\n      capture decisional quality and identifying candidate questions to address these elements,\n      using patient and expert feedback; 2) Pilot testing a preliminary instrument in a diverse\n      patient population to assess measurement properties and select a reduced set of candidate\n      questions for further testing; and 3) Establish the reliability and validity of a new\n      comprehensive decisional quality measure for single and repeated examinations. This will\n      result in a multidimensional decisional quality instrument for patients with CAD that will\n      be ready for implementation into routine care."
