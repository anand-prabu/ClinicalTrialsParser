Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the\n      number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's\n      immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus\n      filgrastim in treating patients who have stage IV prostate cancer that has not responded to\n      hormone therapy."

Determine the response rate (objective and PSA response) and duration of\n      response to estramustine, docetaxel, and carboplatin with filgrastim (G-CSF) support in\n      patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen\n      in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral estramustine 3 times daily on days 1-5. Patients receive\n      docetaxel IV over 1 hour followed by carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 2. Filgrastim (G-CSF)\n      SC is administered beginning on day 6 and continuing until hematopoietic recovery. Treatment\n      continues every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for a maximum of 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 39 patients will be accrued for this study within 10 months."
