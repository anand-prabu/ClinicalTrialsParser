Determine whether infants treated with tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA)\n      have a lower peak direct bilirubin, ALT, AST, glutamyltranspeptidase levels and a reduced\n      duration of cholestasis compared to the nontreatment arm.\n\n      II.  Determine the significance of lower birth weight and longer duration of total\n      parenteral nutrition (TPN) on increasing risk of TPN associated cholestasis and increasing\n      benefit from TUDCA therapy.\n\n      III.  Determine whether TUDCA therapy leads to significant reduction in the appearance of\n      biliary tract sludge and/or stone formation in these infants.\n\n      IV.  Determine whether TUDCA therapy leads to reduced urinary excretion of potentially\n      hepatotoxic bile acids as compared to the untreated arm matched for birth weight and\n      duration of TPN."

Patients are stratified by birth weight.\n\n      Patients are randomized in pairs by birth weight to receive either a placebo in arm I or\n      tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) in arm II.  TUDCA is administered by mouth, nasogastric\n      tube, or gastrostomy tube twice daily. After 2 weeks of therapy, a bile sample is obtained\n      via a duodenal tube.  An ultrasound examination of the liver and biliary tract is performed\n      after 2 weeks and every 3 weeks thereafter until discontinuation of therapy or until\n      presence of biliary tract sludge is noted on 2 consecutive examinations."
