            "textblock": "Introduction: The hospitalization of the elderly is a frequent event that is associated with\n      complications including loss of functionality, which makes it difficult for the person to\n      reinstate to their original context after discharge, increasing the likelihood of\n      rehospitalization.\n\n      Objective : To describe and compare the impact of home-based intervention by  Occupational\n      Therapists (OT) in the likelihood of rehospitalization at 6 months versus usual care in\n      persons older than 60 years after discharge.\n\n      Design : Randomized controlled trial in medical units of the Hospital Cl\u00ednico de la\n      Universidad de Chile (HCUCh) and Hospital de la Fuerza A\u00e9rea de Chile (HFACH)\n\n      Patients: Two hundred and six patients aged 60 years or older admitted for acute or\n      decompensated chronic disease to either HCUCH or HFACH, with a life expectancy greater than\n      6 months, not institutionalized prior to hospitalization or discharge destination , and\n      provided that they have a person of reference after hospital discharge .\n\n      Methods: The control group consists of the usual care regarding post discharge patients, in\n      comparison to the experimental group, which , besides the usual discharge plan, considers a\n      home visit from OT on 2 occasions for 6 months, who will apply the following plan of action:\n      Compliance assessment of pharmacological and non-pharmacological indications, applying a\n      checklist of home safety evaluation and structuring of an occupational routine, education of\n      stimulation strategies, education in recognition of warning signs and proper use of health\n      services. Patients will be recruited between 24 and 48 hours prior to hospital discharge\n      where they will be invited to participate. Informed consent will be retrieved, and\n      demographic information of patients and pre- hospitalization functional backgrounds will be\n      collected during this period, and at discharge by means of Barthel Index (independence /\n      dependence in basic activities of daily living (ADL)), Lawton & Brody Scale (ADL\n      instrumental), Questionnaire Pfeffer Functional Activities ( FAQ), Confusion Assessment\n      Method (CAM) (delirium at discharge), Pfeiffer Questionnaire (Short Portable Mental Status\n      Questionnaire: SPMSQ ) (cognition), and Geriatrics Cumulative Illness Rating Scale disease (\n      CIRS -G) (comorbidity).  Both groups will receive telephone follow-up at 4, 12 and 24 weeks\n      after hospital discharge with intent to evaluate functionality and rehospitalization.\n      Allocators,  medical team giving hospital discharge, pone interviewers, and data analysts\n      will be blind of the intervention allocation.\n\n      Expected Results: the home-based intervention after discharge with OT reduce the rate of\n      rehospitalization in at least 40 % at 6 months in people over 60 years compared with usual\n      care ."
