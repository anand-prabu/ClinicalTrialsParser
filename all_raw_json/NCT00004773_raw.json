Evaluate electrocardiographic parameters, including QT and PR intervals and\n      QRS morphology/duration, across clinical stages in patients with Rett syndrome.\n\n      II.  Characterize abnormalities of cardiac conduction and repolarization. III.  Assess\n      arrhythmias, heart rate variability, and autonomic nervous system function in these patients\n      using 24-hour Holter monitoring.\n\n      IV.  Record events believed to represent seizures with video, electroencephalogram (EEG),\n      and polygraph monitoring in patients who have more than 1 clinical seizure every 5 days.\n\n      V.  Characterize these events with respect to clinical manifestations, EEG correlates, and\n      other physiologic data.\n\n      VI.  Determine the frequency of seizures vs. events without electrographic correlates in\n      these patients.\n\n      VII.  Determine whether Rett syndrome patients have characteristic or unique types of\n      seizures and/or an epileptic syndrome."
