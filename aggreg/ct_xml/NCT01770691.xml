  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is most prevalent among women. SUI is characterized by
      loss of urine from increased abdominal pressures caused by coughing, laughing, sneezing,
      running, lifting or walking. SUI cause women to avoid routine physical activities, thus
      detracting significantly from their quality of life.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of new designs of the TIPI device,
      a conservative, disposable, treatment for temporary management of SUI.

          -  Had ≥ 1 deliveries

          -  Suffering from genuine stress urinary incontinence confirmed by     urodynamic
             testing (Urodynamic stress urinary incontinence) and normal voiding without abnormal
             residual urine

          -  Baseline PWG  (no usage of TIPI device) ≥ 6gr/8hrs

          -  Average reduction of urinary incontinence of at least 70% following 3 days usage of
             the cleared  TIPI G3 device

             consent by signing a written informed consent form.

          -  Successful experience with the use of vaginal tampons

          -  Willing to undergo urodynamic investigation

          -  Normal pap smear within past 24 months

          -  Patient is able and agrees to arrive to the study site area for a period of about 4-6
             hours during 6-12 non consequent study days.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is pregnant, or suspected to be pregnant or is planning to be pregnant during
             the course of the study

          -  Was/is being treated for urinary incontinence by other means such as medications,
             surgical intervention etc. that might influence study results

          -  Vaginal wall prolapse of any type reaching the level of the introitus (grade 2)

          -  Co-morbid condition(s) that could limit the patient's ability to participate in the
