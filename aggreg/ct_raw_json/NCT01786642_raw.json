The investigators will conduct a pilot study\n      corroborating the hypothesis that tracheal supplementation of oxygen during flexible\n      bronchoscopy is advantageous in comparison to nasal cannula supplementation.\n\n      The concept of our trial consists of a mono-centric observational study performed in the\n      endoscopy suite of the Respiratory Division, University Hospitals Leuven. All patients will\n      be given informed consent before inclusion.\n\n      The aim of the present study is to measure the time to correction of O2 saturation when in\n      case of desaturation below 90%, O2 administration is switched from the nasal to the tracheal\n      route at a similar flow rate."
