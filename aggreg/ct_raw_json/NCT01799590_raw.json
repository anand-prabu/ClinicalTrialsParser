Participants who completed the\n      JNS019-JPN-02 study will receive treatment for 52 weeks starting at Visit 4 of the\n      JNS019-JPN-02 study. The present study will consist of 3 weeks of Transfer period (during\n      this period the dose titration will take place and along with dose titration the new\n      treatment will be initiated at 25 milligram per day [25mg/day]), Continuous treatment period\n      (32 weeks), Exit period (up to 3 weeks) and Follow-up period (4 weeks). Participants in the\n      Continuous treatment period will receive topiramate tablets orally in the dose range of 50\n      mg/day to 100 mg/day. Dose can be increased or decreased as per Investigator's discretion.\n      The maximum daily dose will be 200 mg/day. Efficacy will be primarily evaluated by change\n      from Baseline in the number of monthly migraine attacks in Continuous treatment period.\n      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study."
