  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is one of the most deadly cancers because of the predominately late
      diagnosis.  gemcitabine (GEM) is the standard treatment for advanced and metastatic
      pancreatic cancer.  According to preclinical data and few early phase studies, a combined
      use of gemcitabine and cisplatin (CDDP) showed synergistic efficacy against pancreatic
      cancer.  NC-6004, a novel micellar cisplatin formulation, retains the activity but avoids
      the renal toxicity and neurotoxicity caused by the high peak Cmax concentrations of
      cisplatin.  This trial is designed to evaluate the impact of the addition of NC-6004 to
      gemcitabine in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic
      cancer.

      The main hypothesis of this study is that NC-6004 plus gemcitabine combination is superior
      to gemcitabine alone in terms of overall survival in locally advanced or metastatic
      pancreatic cancer patients
