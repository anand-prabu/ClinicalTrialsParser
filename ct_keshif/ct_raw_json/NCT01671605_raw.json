We hypothesize that an inverse relationship exist\n      between the severity of CKD and processes underlying foam cell formation, and that the\n      relationship becomes independent of serum lipoprotein levels as renal function declines. We\n      propose to systematically examine scavenger receptors and cholesterol uptake as well as\n      cholesterol transporters and efflux mechanisms in individuals with normal renal function,\n      patients with moderate CKD and those with ESRD-HD. We further propose to determine if\n      processed contributing to foam cell formation are related to the plasma lipid profile and if\n      the relationship is modified by co-morbidities, such as diabetes, obesity, systemic\n      inflammation which are common in this population and directly influence vascular integrity.\n      These data will be critically important to understand when the abnormality starts and will\n      provide crucial information."
