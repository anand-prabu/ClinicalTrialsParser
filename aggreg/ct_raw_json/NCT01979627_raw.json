However, the transradial approach does not seem suitable\n      for 5-15% of patients undergoing coronary angiography and angioplasty. The ulnar artery\n      which is one of the two terminal branches of the brachial artery is usually larger than\n      radial artery and it may be as a potential approach for cardiac catheterization. Recently,\n      some reports have demonstrated that the transulnar approach may be both feasible and safe\n      for coronary angiography and angioplasty in selective patients.we performed this study to\n      evaluate the safety and feasibility of transulnar approach coronary catheterization in real\n      world non-selective patients."
