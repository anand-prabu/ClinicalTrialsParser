Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of PS-341 until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3\n      or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-31 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
