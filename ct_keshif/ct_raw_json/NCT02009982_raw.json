            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of cardioneuroablation for the\n      treatment of neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS), also known as \"vaso-vagal\" syncope. Syncope is\n      a general term for passing out spells and neurocardiogenic syncope is a specific form of\n      passing out spells caused by sudden drops in heart rate or blood pressure. Although the\n      specific mechanisms of NCS are not well understood, it is believed that some people are\n      prone to developing passing out spells in specific situations such as standing up for a long\n      period of time, pain or nausea. In these situations, the body reacts with a paradoxical\n      reflex which leads to a drop in blood pressure and heart rate and causes passing out.\n      Certain types of medications are used to treat NCS including beta-blockers, midodrine and\n      florinef, among others. However, none of these medications are particularly effective at\n      preventing passing out spells and many people continue to have episodes despite trying\n      different medications.\n\n      Cardioneuroablation is a new form of treatment for NCS. The term ablation means using a wire\n      to make small electrical burns in the heart. Ablation has been used for many years to treat\n      other electrical disturbances in the heart but the use of ablation to treat NCS is a new\n      application. The goal of cardioneuroablation is to identify areas within the heart which are\n      believed to initiate the reflex which triggers the drop in heart rate and blood pressure\n      that leads to passing out. In preliminary studies, it has been suggested that\n      cardioneuroablation may be significantly more effective than medications at preventing\n      passing out spells for people with NCS.\n\n      Hypothesis: Cardioneuroablation of vagal inputs in the left atrium may serve as an effective\n      treatment modality for the prevention of NCS by blunting the initial trigger of the cascade\n      that leads to symptoms and syncope."
