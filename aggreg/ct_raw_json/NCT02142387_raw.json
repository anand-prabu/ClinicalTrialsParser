Practice in pairs (15 min). Practicing the dispatcher and rescuer role in a simulation\n           to enhance learning.\n\n        3. Debriefing. Questions, answers and reflection (15 min).\n\n        4. Homework. Leaflet with tasks like learn how to activate the speaker function on your\n           own phone.\n\n      The main difference between DA-BLS and traditional BLS training is that DA-BLS provides the\n      scenes and interactive experiences on calling EMS and receiving CPR instruction via\n      telephone speaker function, following up the skill training by scenario simulation training."
