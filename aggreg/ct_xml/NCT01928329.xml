      The goal of the proposed pilot study is to determine whether glucose control can be improved
      with Bydureon treatment in patients with type I diabetes (T1D)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site randomized placebo controlled trial of Bydureon in patients with type I
      diabetes (T1D) of at least 2 years duration who may or may not still have detectable levels
      of C-peptide during a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT). Bydureon is a recently approved long
      acting form of Exenatide. Because of the lack of safety data for Bydureon in children, we
      propose to conduct the trial in adults (&gt;18 yrs.).

      Both the subject and the study personnel will be blinded to treatment assignment. The
      randomization will be done, 1;1, by the coordinating site (at Yale). As a secondary
      analysis, we propose to determine whether the presence of residual insulin production
      modifies the drug effect. To do this, we plan to stratify patients for randomization on the
      basis of detectable C-peptide levels. We will therefore wait for the results of the
      C-peptide levels from the enrollment MMTT prior to randomization. The study investigators
      will not be told in which stratum the patient is being randomized and will be blinded to the
      C-peptide results of the MMTT until the conclusion of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Male or female aged 18-60 years who meets the American Diabetes Association standard
             T1DM criteria.

          -  Diagnosis of T1DM at least 2 years from Visit 0

          -  Insulin Requirement of ≤ 0.90 units/kg

          -  Absence of ketoacidosis in the past 6 months

          -  HbA1c of ≤ 9.0%

          -  Menstruating women must have a negative pregnancy test and be willing to avoid
             pregnancy during the study period

          -  Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability or unwillingness to give informed consent

          -  Current or prior use of immunomodulators or systemic steroids in the last 6 months
             that could potentially affect diabetes or immunologic status.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to Exenatide, Liraglutide or any product component.

          -  Participation in an investigational treatment trial within the last 6 weeks before
             enrollment.

          -  1 or more episodes of hypoglycemia (loss of consciousness or requiring the help of
             others) within the last 6 months.

          -  Another condition that would, in the view of the investigator, affect the safety of
             using Bydureon. This might include, among others a history of MEN 2, a history of
             medullary carcinoma of the thyroid or pancreatitis.

          -  Known severe renal impairment, end-stage renal disease or renal transplantation.

          -  Any history of gastroparesis or other severe gastrointestinal disease, pancreatitis,
             thyroid nodules or malignancy with the exclusion of a history of localized basal cell
             carcinoma.

          -  Uncompensated heart failure, fluid overload, myocardial infarction or liver disease
             within the last 6 weeks before enrollment.

          -  Clinically active serious infection.

          -  Positive pregnancy test in menstruating women or lactating females.

          -  Concurrent use of Pramlinitide, other Incretin medications, or other anti-diabetes
             medications other than insulin.
