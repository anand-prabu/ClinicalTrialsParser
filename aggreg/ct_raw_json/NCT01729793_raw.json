The markers will be assessed by blood levels tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha),\n      interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein\n      (hsCRP) at times 0, 45 minutes, 2 hours and 4 hours post-meal.  A full complete blood count\n      (CBC)and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) blood test will also be conducted at times\n      0 and 4 hours post-meal. In addition, a questionaire on Gastrointestinal symptoms will be\n      administered 4 hours post-meal.  The study hypothesis is that some or all of these potential\n      markers of inflammation will increase following the meal, and the amount of increase in\n      inflammation will be attenuated when a digestive enzyme is consumed with the meal compared\n      to the placebo. In addition, it is hypothesized that levels of gastric discomfort as\n      assessed by the questionaire will be reduced with the digestive enzyme compared to the\n      placebo."
