Evidence suggests that the presence\n      of certain autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or systematic lupus\n      erythematosus increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, this evidence is\n      inconsistent for autoimmune disorders and no systematic approach has been previously used to\n      study the relationship between a range of common autoimmune disorders and specific forms of\n      cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction, intracerebral and subarachnoid\n      haemorrhage, or venous thrombosis.\n\n      The investigators will use linked electronic health records to investigate whether commonly\n      diagnosed autoimmune disorders are associated with increased risk of CVD development and\n      whether effects differ in men and women and change with age."
