Increased morbidity and three to four times\n      increased mortality in these patients are well documented, mainly in the cardiovascular\n      field. Pharyngeal surgery, i.e. uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) opens up the airway and was\n      the predominant treatment for OSAS worldwide before continuous positive airway pressure\n      (CPAP) devices became widely available in the 1990s. Since then, the main treatment for OSAS\n      has been CPAP, but an increasing number of patients are also treated with mandibular\n      retaining device (MRD). UPPP as treatment for OSAS has been performed for 30 years. The\n      evidence-grade for the efficacy has so far been very low, and the side-effects and\n      complication rate has raised the question whether there is a place for surgical treatment of\n      OSAS. However, the compliance for CPAP and dental devices are quite low (50-60%), leaving a\n      lot of patients untreated if surgery is not offered.  RCT UPPP is still missing and called\n      for."
