  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sedation is often needed for young children undergoing minor procedures in the emergency
      department (ED). Oral midazolam is one of the most commonly used regimens for children
      undergoing laceration repair but its sedative efficacy was shown to be suboptimal. In only
      one randomized controlled study oral ketamine has been used successfully for procedural
      sedation for laceration repair. A recent study showed that the combination of oral midazolam
      and oral ketamine provided deeper sedation compared with oral midazolam alone. However
      children treated wuth the combination of midazolam and ketamine required longer recovery

      Hypothesis:

      Oral ketamine can provide superior sedation to oral midazolam in children requiring sedation
      for laceration repair.
