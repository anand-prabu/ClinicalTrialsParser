PAD affects 20% of patients over the age of 75. Furthermore, PAD\n      patients are at an exceptionally high risk for cardiovascular events and the majority will\n      eventually die of a cardiac or cerebrovascular etiology.\n\n      Polyphenol could represent a novel therapeutic strategy to counteract atherosclerosis.\n      During the last decades, a growing interest in polyphenols resulted from prospective and\n      epidemiological studies that showed the beneficial effects of these substances on human\n      health. In particular, polyphenols exert their beneficial effect by inhibition of NADPH\n      oxidase (NOX2), an enzyme directly involved in atherosclerosis; thus, the activation of this\n      enzyme leads to an enhanced production of oxidative stress and inflammatory processes.\n\n      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of polyphenols on oxidative stress and\n      inflammation and on surrogate markers of atherosclerosis in PAD patients. Polyphenols,\n      inhibiting NOX2-mediated oxidative stress and immune-mediated process, could represent a\n      novel therapy to reduce the high risk of cardiovascular events in PAD."
