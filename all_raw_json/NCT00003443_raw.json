Evaluate the antitumor activity of bryostatin 1 in chemotherapy naive\n      patients with metastatic or recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, not curable\n      with surgery or radiation therapy. II. Evaluate the safety and toxicity of bryostatin 1 when\n      administered in the prescribed schedule in this patient population. III. Assess cyclin\n      dependent kinase 2 activity, protein kinase C activity, and apoptosis measurements in\n      selected patients with tumors accessible for biopsy following bryostatin 1 therapy.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV over 24 hours once weekly for three weeks followed\n      by one week of rest. Treatment is continued every 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable\n      toxicity or disease progression. Patients with stable disease after two courses may continue\n      treatment or stop treatment at the discretion of the treating physician.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 14-25 patients accrued into this study over 1-2 years."
