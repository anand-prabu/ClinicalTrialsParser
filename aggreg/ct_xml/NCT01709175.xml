  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare once-a-week vs. twice-a-week strength training in
      survivors of breast and gynecologic cancer to determine which is the optimal exercise
      prescription.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a result of cancer and its treatment, survivors of breast and gynecologic cancer are
      reported to have deficits in both physical and psycho-social health. In cancer survivors
      exercise has been shown to improve fitness, increase bone density and lean body mass,
      enhance self-esteem, and reduce fatigue. These changes have a positive effect on the
      survivor's physical functioning and quality of life. However, there are few studies which
      have examined the effects of strength training or studies aimed at determining optimal
      exercise prescription in this population. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare
      two strength training prescriptions (once-a-week vs. twice-a-week strength training) to
      determine which prescription (if any) results in greater benefit for survivors. It is hoped
      that the results of this study will lead to a better understanding of how strength training
      improves the health of survivors and will help inform future exercise guidelines for this
      population.

    <description>Process measures will provide insight about the feasibility of the exercise prescriptions. Included measures are: recruitment (percent of interested survivors who consent); adherence (the number of sessions attended); compliance (the degree to which the survivors follow the exercise prescription); and safety (all adverse events will be recorded)</description>

    <description>Muscular Endurance will be assessed using the standard load test. Participants will lift a weight equal to 50% one repetition maximum as many times as possible. The bench press and leg press will be used to measure endurance of the upper and lower body.</description>
