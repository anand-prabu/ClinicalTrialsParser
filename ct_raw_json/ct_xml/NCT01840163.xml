    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 444 newly diagnosed
      patients with invasive early stage breast cancer, seen by 28-30 surgeons in two SEER
      catchment areas. Patients will be randomized to view our comprehensive decision tool or a
      &quot;state of the art&quot; existing website. The results of this RCT will be highly relevant to
      future breast cancer patients making these decisions and to their clinicians.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer face a series of complex decisions regarding
      locoregional and systemic treatment. Currently many of these decisions do not meet the
      definition of a high quality decision, defined as one that is both informed (i.e., based on
      an accurate understanding of the treatment risks and benefits) and preference-concordant
      (i.e., consistent with the patients' underlying preferences). Moreover, the introduction of
      evaluative tests has made these decisions more complicated for many patients. There is a
      need to improve the quality of locoregional and systemic treatment decisions for breast
      cancer patients, and to help patients understand the role of evaluative tests in this
      decision process. Ensuring patients can deliberate effectively about these decisions, assert
      their views and communicate with their clinicians is likely to improve their overall
      decision preparedness and satisfaction. This study will focus on the third pillar of
      individualized care by evaluating the impact of an innovative decision tool on locoregional
      and systemic therapy decision making for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients. The
      innovative online decision tool has been developed and tested over the past two years by the
      CanSORT team (R21 CA129859). Pilot data suggests that this tool has a positive impact on
      patient knowledge and decision outcomes. The goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of
      this tool, after it is enhanced in collaboration with our Communication and Dissemination
      Core, on the quality of decision making for locoregional and systemic breast cancer
      treatment decision making. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 444 newly
      diagnosed patients with invasive early stage breast cancer, seen by 28-30 surgeons in two
      SEER catchment areas. Patients will be randomized to view our comprehensive decision tool or
      a static version of the tool.
