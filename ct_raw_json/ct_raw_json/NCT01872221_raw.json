During tumor\n      resection, tissue samples will be individualized, based on their multimodal imaging\n      characteristics and sent to the radiobiology laboratory INSERM for biological analysis.\n\n      After surgery, patient will be treated by the standard radio-chemotherapy stupp protocol and\n      will be followed according to standard practices; multimodal MRI will be performed every 2\n      months during the first year and then every 3 months until progression."
