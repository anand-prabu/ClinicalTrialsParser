The\n      national incidence of gestation <37 weeks in India is 14.5%, was 18% in the study area in\n      2011 and was 20% among women with vaginal pH\u22655 in the recently completed Jawaharlal Nehru\n      Medical Collage (JNMC) hospital-based study of clindamycin to reduce preterm birth. Using a\n      two tailed test, \u03b1=0.05, 1-\u03b2=80%, a 17.5% rate of prematurity in women with vaginal pH\u22655, a\n      2.5% refusal and a 7.5% loss to follow-up, assuming 86% of women presenting for antenatal\n      care are 13-20 weeks gestation and 1% otherwise ineligible, and a multiple comparisons\n      adjustment, 1,726 women, half in the clindamycin and half in the placebo group, need to be\n      enrolled to test the primary hypothesis. The effects of clindamycin on spontaneous preterm\n      birth, miscarriage, low birthweight (LBW), neonatal mortality (NMR), maternal and neonatal\n      complications through 42 days postpartum, the utility of vaginal pH\u22655 to identify women at\n      risk for preterm delivery and the costs of preterm birth prevented by oral clindamycin\n      treatment and compliance with the 5-day treatment regimen will also be assessed. This will\n      be the first investigation to test whether oral clindamycin prevents preterm birth in a\n      community-based, developing country setting, where most global newborn deaths occur."
