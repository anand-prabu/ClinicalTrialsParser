However, there is no\n      standard adjuvant therapy after liver resection for the patients with HCC with portal vein\n      tumor thrombus in the main or first branch of the portal vein. Our preliminary results\n      showed that combined interferon-alpha and intra-arterial 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as a\n      postoperative therapy prolonged disease-free and overall survival after liver resection.\n      Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy using low-dose 5-FU and cisplatin is also promising\n      regimen for advanced HCC.\n\n      Herein, the investigators planed the study to evaluate efficacy (two year survival as\n      primary outcome, and overall-survival as secondary outcome) and safety ( as secondary\n      outcome) in hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy with continuous infusion of\n      5-fluorouracil and systemic administration of interferon-alpha or low-dose 5-FU and\n      cisplatin, and to compare the efficacy as randomized control trial."
