  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill children have abnormal utilization of nutrients such as glucose, lipids and
      protein. Protein synthesis is increased mainly in the form of immune and signaling proteins,
      while muscle and structural protein synthesis is decreased.  The  metabolism of sulfur amino
      acids through the splanchnic area and specifically methionine  and cysteine have not been
      investigated in critically ill septic children, despite that sulfur amino acids  have
      important roles in thiol, antioxidant and epigenetic reactions.   Methionine metabolism in
      sick children will be influenced by its rate of utilization through different pathways.
      Our study aims to investigate  the metabolism of methionine and cysteine when both amino
      acids are given by the enteral route in critically ill septic children.  The investigators
      are focused on the rates of transmethylation, remethylation and transsulfuration in
      critically ill septic children, and  if the current standard nutrition maintains methionine
      nutritional balance and functional requirements in critically ill children fed by the
      enteral route.

      This is a prospective, translational study on the splanchnic metabolism of methionine to
      determine the rates of the different pathways and synthesis rates of glutathione when
      critically ill children are fed by the enteral route, and the difference among various age
      groups. The study size will include 45 critically ill septic, pediatric patients (15 infants
      at 1 month-3 years of age, 15 children at 4-12 years of age and 15 adolescent at 13-19 years
      of age), males and females admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at
      Children's Medical Center, Dallas. The minimal subject's weight will be 4 kg. The number of
      subjects includes an expected drop out rate of about 20%, in order to obtain 15 patients
      with complete data in each group. Patients will receive nutritional support as per standard
      care.  This study will yield important knowledge and may lead in the future to changes in
      the current practice on the management of critically ill pediatric patients in the PICU.
