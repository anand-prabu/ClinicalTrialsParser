  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this proposed study is to develop the state of knowledge in the area of
      gender-based violence and reproductive health by conducting a randomized controlled trial to
      improve the health care provider's capacity to screen for intimate partner violence and to
      mitigate associated risk among women health clinic patrons of reproductive age (ages18-44)
      with recent experiences of physical or sexual partner violence in Mexico City and its
      surrounding area.

      The specific research objectives are as follows:

        1. To increase mid-level health care providers' capacity to identify Intimate Partner
           Violence (IPV) and assist women with risk mitigation

        2. Utilizing a randomized controlled trial, to assess the impact of an enhanced health
           care worker screening and counselling program on  (a) past year severe IPV (sexual or
           physical) and injuries from such IPV; (b) reproductive coercion (c) use of
           community-based resources and safety planning; and (d) quality of life; versus minimum
           standard of care

        3. To qualitatively examine which programmatic components may serve as mechanisms for
           observed changes stated in the second objective

        4. To synthesize study findings and a) create recommendations for clinic-based
           intervention programs to address IPV in low and middle income countries and b)
           disseminate information as reports, presentation, and peer-reviewed publications
