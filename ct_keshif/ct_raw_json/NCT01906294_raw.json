From a public health point\n      of view, such a register should monitor naturalistic (i.e., unbiased) use of diabetes\n      treatment in the community and should primarily guide and assist medical professionals to\n      make optimal choices in combating diabetes. The primary focus of this registry is therefore\n      to monitor the medical and lifestyle treatment of diabetes in order to enable comparison of\n      different treatment options and to provide data for future discussions of optimal treatment."
