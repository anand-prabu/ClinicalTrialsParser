To increase mid-level health care providers' capacity to identify Intimate Partner\n           Violence (IPV) and assist women with risk mitigation\n\n        2. Utilizing a randomized controlled trial, to assess the impact of an enhanced health\n           care worker screening and counselling program on  (a) past year severe IPV (sexual or\n           physical) and injuries from such IPV; (b) reproductive coercion (c) use of\n           community-based resources and safety planning; and (d) quality of life; versus minimum\n           standard of care\n\n        3. To qualitatively examine which programmatic components may serve as mechanisms for\n           observed changes stated in the second objective\n\n        4. To synthesize study findings and a) create recommendations for clinic-based\n           intervention programs to address IPV in low and middle income countries and b)\n           disseminate information as reports, presentation, and peer-reviewed publications"
