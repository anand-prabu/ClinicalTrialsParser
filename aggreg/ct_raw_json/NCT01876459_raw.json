Moreover, the distinction between Lewy body disease and Alzheimer's disease is not\n      easy as both diseases can present similar symptoms. Nowadays, routine examinations exist and\n      can improve the diagnosis but there are not specific enough of one of those two pathologies.\n\n      Lewy body disease is characterized by the presence of particular structures in patient's\n      brain, called \"Lewy body\", composed of a protein called \"alpha-synuclein\". The aim of this\n      study is to measure the rate of alpha-synuclein in cerebrospinal fluid. This measurement\n      could allow us to differentiate patient with Alzheimer's disease from those with Lewy body\n      disease."
