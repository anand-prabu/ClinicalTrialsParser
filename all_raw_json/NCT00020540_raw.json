Biological therapy may be an\n      effective treatment for metastatic melanoma and metastatic kidney cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of flt3L combined with CD40-ligand in\n      treating patients who have metastatic melanoma or metastatic kidney cancer."

Determine the maximum tolerated dose of CD40-ligand when combined with\n      fixed-dose flt3 ligand in patients with metastatic melanoma or renal cell cancer.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of CD40-ligand. Patients receive fixed-dose flt3\n      ligand subcutaneously (SC) daily on days 1-14 and CD40-ligand SC daily on days 12-16.\n      Treatment continues every 28 days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable\n      toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3 to 6 patients receive escalating doses of\n      CD40-ligand until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the\n      dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients\n      with progressive disease after 2 courses may be eligible to receive high-dose interleukin-2\n      (IL-2) standard therapy.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5 patients were accrued for this study."
