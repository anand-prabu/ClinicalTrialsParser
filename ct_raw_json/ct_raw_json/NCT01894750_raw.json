We will test three hypotheses comparing 60 older adults with heart failure randomly\n      assigned to either the intervention or a control group:\n\n      Hypothesis 1. Participants in the intervention group will have significantly improved heart\n      failure self-care than control participants.\n\n      Hypothesis 2. Participants in the intervention group will have significantly improved\n      knowledge about heart failure and heart failure self-care than control participants.\n\n      Hypothesis 3. Participants in the intervention group will have significantly better Health\n      Related Quality of Life than control participants.\n\n      A secondary exploratory aim is to assess and describe implementation feasibility of\n      providing a heart failure self-care intervention in a community group setting."
