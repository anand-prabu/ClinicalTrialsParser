Each participant will receive 0.5 mL of each study medication in the taste test. During the taste test each medication in a class will be labeled with a color name so as to prevent any bias from preconceived taste perception. They will record their perception of the medications taste on a visual analog scale (VAS). An anaphlyaxis kit will be on hand in case of emergencies. Between samples participants will cleanse their palate with a saltine cracker and 30 mL of water. 5 different classes of medications will be tested.\nMedications to be sampled and the corresponding dose of the test dose are:\nCephalosporins: cefdinir 12.5 mg, cefixime 10 mg\nPenicillins: penicillin VK 12.5 mg, amoxicillin 12.5 mg\nAnalgesic/antipyretics: acetaminophen 16 mg, ibuprofen 10 mg\nSteroids: prednisolone 1.5 mg, prednisone 0.5 mg\nH2 receptor blockers: famotidine 4 mg, ranitidine 7.5 mg",
