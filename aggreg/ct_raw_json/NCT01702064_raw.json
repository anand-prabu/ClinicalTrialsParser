The first step of the\n      study is to learn the dose of ruxolitinib that is tolerable (bearable). It has already been\n      studied in a number of patients with different bone marrow diseases and is approved for\n      treatment of a disease called Myelofibrosis; however, it is not approved for treatment of\n      CML or in combination with nilotinib. It is given orally (by mouth). Most people tolerate it\n      well. Investigators hope to find out how well patients tolerate it when it is given along\n      with nilotinib (Tasigna) for CML. Nilotinib is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug\n      Association for the treatment of CML. Investigators will be testing different doses to\n      determine how much of the medication people can tolerate (bear) before they develop side\n      effects."

They must\n             also be under treatment with nilotinib as either first or second-line therapy.\n\n          -  PHASE II EXPANSION: Patients must have chronic phase CML and be undergoing treatment\n             with first-line nilotinib for 6-18 months.\n\n          -  Patients must have at least a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) to be eligible for\n             Phase I. Patients must have a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) OR must have been\n             on nilotinib for a minimum of six months in order to be eligible for Phase II of this\n             study.\n\n          -  18 years of age or older and must be able to speak and read English or Spanish\n\n          -  Must not have undergone treatment for any other form of cancer (aside from\n             non-melanoma skin cancer) in the past 5 years\n\n          -  Must be able to provide informed consent\n\n          -  For the phase I component, prior therapy with a Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) other\n             than nilotinib is allowable, however, nilotinib must be the current therapy. There\n             are no restrictions as to how long patients received the alternate therapy, the dose\n             of alternate therapy, or how long they have been receiving nilotinib, assuming they\n             have achieved a CCyR. If patients have not achieved a CCyR, they must have been on\n             nilotinib for a minimum of 6 months. All patients enrolled in this phase must be\n             under the care of a Moffitt Cancer Center physician, and enrollment for this phase is\n             expected to be complete within 6 months. The dose of nilotinib for patients receiving\n             the drug in the second line setting due to failure of a first line TKI is generally\n             400 mg PO BID. In addition, if a patient is unable to tolerate second line nilotinib\n             at 400 mg PO BID their dose may be decreased to 300 mg PO BID.

Should a woman become pregnant or suspect\n             she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should\n             inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol\n             must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of\n             study participation, and 4 months after completion of Ruxolitinib and nilotinib\n             administration.

Women who are breast feeding their\n             infants should discontinue this practice if the mother is treated with ruxolitinib.\n\n          -  Patient currently receiving any drugs considered to be strong CYP3A4 inducers or\n             inhibitors which cannot be discontinued or changed to an alternative drug prior to\n             enrolling on the trial\n\n          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from\n             the study.\n\n          -  Patients receiving nilotinib 200 mg PO BID are not eligible for phase I however they\n             will be eligible for phase II."
