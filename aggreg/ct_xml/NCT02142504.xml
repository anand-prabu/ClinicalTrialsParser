    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the norovirus bivalent virus-like
      particle (VLP) vaccine for further development by assessing the rates of serious adverse
      events (SAEs), unsolicited adverse events (AEs), solicited local and solicited systemic AEs,
      Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) and AEs leading to participant's withdrawal from
      the trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vaccine being tested in this study is called norovirus GI.1/GII.4 bivalent virus-like
      particle (VLP) vaccine adjuvanted with or without monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and aluminum
      hydroxide. The norovirus vaccine is being tested to provide additional safety data to enable
      the vaccine to be further developed. This study will look at the side effects in people who
      take different formulations of the norovirus vaccine.

      The study will enroll approximately 650 subjects. Two independent cohorts will be evaluated
      in this trial. Cohort 1 will evaluate 450 adults in the general United States (US)
      population, and Cohort 2 will evaluate 200 US Marine Corps recruits. Participants will be
      randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the 2 or 3 treatment groups
      (depending on the cohort)—which will remain undisclosed to the subject and study doctor
      during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need).

      Cohort 1:

        -  GI.1/GII.4 (15 µg/50 µg) - MPL (50 µg) and aluminum hydroxide 500 µg + GI.1/GII.4 (15
           µg/15 µg) - aluminum hydroxide (500 µg) booster

        -  GI.1/GII.4 (50 µg/50 µg) - MPL (50 µg) and aluminum hydroxide 500 µg + GI.1/GII.4 (15
           µg/15 µg) - aluminum hydroxide (500 µg) booster

        -  Saline Placebo (dummy inactive injection) - this is a liquid that has no active
           ingredient + GI.1/GII.4 (15 µg/15 µg) - aluminum hydroxide (500 µg) primary

      Cohort 2:

        -  GI.1/GII.4 (50 µg/50 µg) - MPL (50 µg) and aluminum hydroxide 500 µg

        -  Saline Placebo

      All participants will be administered vaccine or placebo on Day 1 of the study. All
      participants in Cohort 1 will receive a booster dose of the norovirus vaccine on Day 365.
      Participants will be asked to record any symptoms that may be related to the vaccine or the
      injection site in a diary card for 7 days after each vaccination.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is up to 18 months for Cohort 1 and 12 months for Cohort 2.
      Participants in Cohort 1 will make 11 visits to the clinic including a follow-up visit 6
      months after the last dose of study medication. Participants in Cohort 2 will make 6 visits
      to the clinic up to Day 72 and will be followed via military medical record database search
      up to 1 year after the last dose of study medication.
