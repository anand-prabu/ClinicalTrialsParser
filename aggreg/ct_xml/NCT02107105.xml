      rectal cancer.

      You may be eligible to take part in this study if you have not yet had surgery for rectal
      cancer or if you had surgery up to 2 years ago.

      If you choose to take part in this study, you will complete 7 questionnaires about your
      quality of life. You will complete the questionnaires before surgery for rectal cancer (if
      you have not yet had surgery), at 6 and 12 months after surgery, and then 2, 3, 4 and 5
      years after surgery.  You will receive and return the questionnaires in the clinic, although
      if you are unable to come to the clinic for your regular follow-up, you may be able to
      receive and return your surveys by mail if recommended by the PI. They should take about
      20-30 minutes to complete.

      In addition, your medical records will be reviewed to learn about what kind of treatments
      you may have had, and whether you have had any complications related to your treatment.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 330 participants will be enrolled on this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

    <description>Primary endpoint of study is the health state utilities at 24 months post-surgery. A health state utility is the degree of preference that individuals or society has for a particular health state or condition.  It ranges from 0 (death) to 1.0 (perfect health. The health state utilities are measured by EQ-5D. A summary index score can be derived from the questionnaires.</description>
