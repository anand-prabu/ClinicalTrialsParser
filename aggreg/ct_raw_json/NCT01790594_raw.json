There would be a benefit to finding new anti-rejection\n      medications that work just as well, but could lesson the amount of antirejection medications\n      you are taking long term.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to find out if the drug NULOJIX\u00ae (belatacept) will minimize the\n      amount of other antirejection medications necessary and thereby reduce the long-term side\n      effects caused by the other medications. The researchers also want to learn more about the\n      safety of this treatment and long term health of transplanted pancreases and kidneys."
