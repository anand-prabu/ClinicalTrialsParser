      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effects of low dose aspirin (100
      mg/day ) with placebo on subjects with subsolid nodules.

      Currently no effective drug to prevent lung cancer in people at increased risk has been
      discovered. In your case these nodules are probably not cancerous but it is not possible to
      exclude that they may become cancers, so they should be monitored with periodic exams to
      evaluate their growth rate. At the moment the growth of your nodules does not have clinical
      relevance, but requires a yearly follow up with low dose CT scan.

      Previous studies have shown  total nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID( use was
      associated with a small reduction in risk of lung cancer, which was strongest for
      adenocarcinoma in men, and in long-term former smokers and of a protective effect of lowdose
      aspirin was seen in the Women's Health Study. Another study found that lung cancer risk was
      significantly lower for aspirin users compared to non-users and prolonged duration of use
      was associated with reduced lung cancer risk.

      We will also be studying the effect of Aspirin on levels of several different substances,
      called biomarkers, in your blood and urine.  These biomarkers may be used to track the
      amount of lung tissue inflammation and the risk of developing lung cancer.  In this study,
      you will get either aspirin 100mg/day or placebo, a pill that looks like the study drug but
      contains no medication. There will be 128 subjects taking part in this study.

      This is a randomized study.  You will be randomly assigned to get a dose of aspirin or
      placebo.

      A placebo is not a drug. It looks like the study drug but is not designed to treat any
      disease or illness.

      It is designed to be compared with a study drug to learn if the study drug has any real
      effect.

      Neither you or your doctor will know whether you are getting aspirin or placebo.

      If the screening tests show that you are eligible, you will be randomized.  When you are
      randomized, the study staff will:

        -  Provide you study medication,

        -  Explain how you will take it, and

        -  Give you  a diary to keep a record of how you are taking the study medication.

      Study Visits and Calls:

      At Month 6 and 12, you will have study visits.  The following tests and procedures will be
      performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam,  including measurement of your height, weight, and vital
           signs (blood pressure, heart rate and breathing rate).

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you are taking and any side effects you have
           experienced.

        -  You will complete a questionnaire about tobacco use.This will take about 10 minutes to
           complete.

        -  At Month 12 only, Blood (about 3 teaspoons)  and Urine ( about 2 teaspoons) will be
           drawn for routine tests and research studies and you will have a CT Scan.

      At Months 1, 3 and 9, the research staff will call you to ask about any drugs you are taking
      and any side effects you have experienced.

      If you stop taking the study drug/placebo before Month 12, the following tests and
      procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam,  including measurement of your height, weight, and vital
           signs (blood pressure, heart rate and breathing rate).

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you are taking and any side effects you have
           experienced.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you are taking and any side effects you have
           experienced.

      Length of Study Participation:

      You may take the study drug/placebo for up to 12 months.  You will be taken off the study
      drug/placebo early if intolerable side effects occur or the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest.

      Tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stopping the study or decide to stop.  The
      doctor will tell you how to stop safely.

      Month 13 Follow-Up Phone Call:

      After you finish taking the study drug/placebo, the research staff will call you to ask
      about any drugs you are taking and any side effects you have experienced.

      This is an investigational study.  Aspirin is commercially available.  The use of Aspirin to
      prevent lung cancer is investigational.

    <description>Primary endpoint is difference of the sum of longest diameters of subsolid (non-solid or partially solid) lung nodules in a person-specific analysis. Target lesions  defined as non solid or partially solid nodules persistent at least after 3 months follow up with LDCT, at least 4 mm in size. Non target lesions include solid nodules (larger than 3.5 mm), new lesions at baseline (e.g., that were not present on prior CT) or non-solid or partially solid nodules &lt; 4mm in size. A two-sided paired t-test will be used to compare the average change in the dimension of sub-solid nodules in the aspirin group compared to the placebo group at 1 year.</description>

             4 and 10 mm with any Volume Doubling Time (VDT) and/or subsolid (non solid or
             partially solid) nodule larger than 10 mm with VDT higher than 400 days and not
             candidate to surgical excision.

          5. All nodules should be persistent at least after three months follow up with ld-CT

          6. All current smokers should accept to receive support for smoking cessation

             institutional limits

          9. Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal
             or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the
             duration of study participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with chronic treatment (at least twice/week for more than 3 months) with
             Aspirin or other NSAIDs (representing 15% of Cosmos 1 population)

          2. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biological composition to aspirin, NSAIDs, COX2 inhibitors

          3. Invasive malignancy (with the exclusion of basal cell carcinoma or skin squamous cell
             carcinoma) diagnosed during the last 2 years before randomization

          4. History of therapeutic doses of anticoagulants including warfarin and low molecular
             weight Heparin (e.g. for prior deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms in the
             preceding year)

          5. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          6. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Aspirin is an agent with the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with Aspirin, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with Aspirin

          7. Individual may not be receiving any other investigational agents, antiplatelet agents
             (e.g. aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix or others)), anticoagulants (e.g. heparin or
             heparinoids, Coumadin, or others), methotrexate, lithium.

          8. Participants with bleeding diathesis, history of gastric/duodenal ulcers,
             NSAID-precipitated bronchospasm, patients unwilling or unable to limit alcohol
             consumption to i.e. less than or equal to 2 alcohol drinks a day.

          9. Participants who in the opinion of the PI will be at higher risk of acetylsalicylic
             acid (ASA)-related complications.
