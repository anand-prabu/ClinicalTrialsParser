The thickness of CIMT is\n      significantly associated with the presence and the extent of coronary disease. Slower\n      progression of atherosclerosis as measured by carotid ultrasound is also associated with a\n      lower risk of nonfatal MI. In a meta analysis, for every 0.0 1-mm-per-year decrease in\n      carotid IMT, there was a significant 18% reduction in the risk of nonfatal MI. Measurement\n      of carotid IMT carries the advantage of being non-invasive and easy to use with a good\n      degree of reproducibility.\n\n      Statins have been shown to slow the progression of atherosclerosis or even to induce\n      regression of atherosclerosis. Change of carotid IMT by statins have been found to correlate\n      with the extent of LDL-C reduction and HDL-C increase however non-lipid effects (e.g.\n      effects on inflammation, calcification ) may also play a role in the beneficial effects of\n      statins on atherosclerosis.Osteopontin (OPN), an acidic phosphoprotein,  and osteoprotegerin\n      (OPG), a member of the tumor necrosis factor-a receptor superfamily, have been recently\n      demonstrated to modulate vascular calcification. Recent studies have shown an association of\n      serum OPN and OPG levels with cardiovascular diseases and vulnerable carotid plaque ."
