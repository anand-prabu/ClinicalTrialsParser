A second aim will be to isolate by\n      cell sorting CD4+CCR5+ T cells for amplified gene expression profiling before and after CCR5\n      inhibition, experiments the investigators believe will elucidate genes associated with\n      downstream activation and inhibition of CCR5 receptor function."
