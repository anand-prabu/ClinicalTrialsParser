These systems consist of a continuous glucose\n      sensor, which sends a signal to a computer program that automatically determines how much\n      insulin to give. The computer program then tells an insulin pump to deliver the insulin.\n      While such systems have been tested under a number of conditions, post-meal blood sugars are\n      difficult to control. Specifically, we will be looking to see if using hyaluronidase\n      improves the ability of the closed loop artificial pancreas to better respond to meal\n      related highs and lows."

Closed-loop control\n      will be achieved using external subcutaneous real-time continuous glucose monitoring and\n      continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion along with a computerized algorithm to link these\n      two processes.\n\n      Specific Aim 1: To examine whether co-formulation rHuPH20 with analog insulin (INS-PH20)or,\n      alternately, pre-administration of rHuPH20 (PH20-preRx) at the time of infusion set\n      placement prior to initiation of closed-loop (CL) insulin delivery will reduce\n      peak-postprandial glucose concentrations and total glucose area under the curve of the meal\n      excursions in short term inpatient experiments.\n\n      Specific Aim 2: To investigate whether accelerated insulin absorption by rHuPH20, delivered\n      as described above, will also result in a reduction of late-post-prandial hyperinsulinemia\n      and late post-prandial hypoglycemia during CL insulin delivery.\n\n      Specific Aim 3: To compare the  insulin accelerator effect of INS-PH20 to that of\n      PH20-preRx, based on  post prandial glucose excursions during closed-loop therapy\n\n      We hypothesize that; utilization of PH20 either as a separate injection (PH20-preRx) or in a\n      co-formulation with insulin (INS-PH20) during CL therapy  will reduce peak-postprandial\n      glucose concentrations and total glucose under the curve of the meal excursion as compared\n      to CL control without any intervention, and we propose that the use of PH20-preRx and\n      INS-PH20 will be well tolerated when delivered in youth and young adults in a closed-loop\n      setting."
