  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants undergoing mechanical ventilation often present with respiratory instability
      which leads to fluctuations in ventilation and oxygenation. In conventional modes of
      mechanical ventilation used in these patients, the ventilator delivers breaths at a set rate
      and a constant peak inspiratory pressure.

      We have demonstrated that spontaneous episodes of hypoxemia in mechanically ventilated
      preterm infants are frequently triggered by a loss in end-expiratory lung volume followed by
      decrease in tidal volume. This is due to a reduction in respiratory system compliance and
      increase in airway resistance.

      Volume Guarantee ventilation is a mode of ventilation in which ventilator measures the
      exhaled tidal volume of each ventilator breath and automatically adjusts the peak
      inspiratory pressure to deliver the set tidal volume. We have previously shown that Volume
      Guarantee reduced the severity and duration of hypoxemia episodes during a period of 2 hours
      in preterm infants The study hypothesis is that Volume Guarantee ventilation will decrease
      the duration of episodes of hypoxemia when compared to conventional mechanical ventilation
      during routine clinical conditions and over longer periods of time.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate the effects of Volume Guarantee on the duration,
      severity and frequency of episodes of hypoxemia in mechanically ventilated preterm infants
      who present with frequent hypoxemia episodes in comparison to conventional ventilation over
      two periods of 24 hours each and under routine clinical conditions.

    <description>The study will consist of two arms. In one arm, a 24-hour period during which the infant receives conventional mechanical ventilation and a second 24 hour period during which the infant receives volume guarantee ventilation.
In the other Arm, a 24-hour period during which the infant receives volume guarantee ventilation and a second 24 hour period during which the infant receives conventional mechanical ventilation.
These two arms will be assigned at random. Both conventional and volume guarantee ventilation will be provided by the same neonatal ventilator (AVEA, CareFusion Inc, Yorba Linda, CA).
During the 24 hour period of conventional ventilation, the infant will receive mechanical ventilation with the settings determined by the clinical team.
During volume guarantee ventilation, the set tidal volume to be maintained by the ventilator will be the average tidal volume delivered by the ventilator prior to start of study.</description>
