Women, over the age of 18 years, with biopsy-proven\n      CAH/EC who are not candidates for surgical management, and therefore are planned to start\n      standard of care treatment with the LR-IUD, will be given oral metformin therapy for 12\n      months, or until disease progression occurs (whichever occurs first), in addition to LR-IUD\n      treatment. Serial endometrial biopsies will be performed, as per standard of care, to assess\n      disease status. We hypothesize that the addition of metformin to standard LR-IUD treatment\n      of CAH and grade 1 EC will result in a complete response (CR) rate at 6 months that is\n      significantly higher than 50% in a population of non-surgical candidates. In addition, we\n      plan to estimate CR rate at 6 months in CAH and EC separately, and in the group as a whole\n      at 12 months. We will also document the rate of patient adherence to long-term metformin\n      therapy."
