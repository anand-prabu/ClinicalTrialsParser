The study was performed in subjects with a\n      Transjugular Intrahepatic Porto Systemic Shunt (TIPSS) in situ at the time of a routine\n      annual patency check to allow blood samples to be taken from the portal vein. The aim of\n      this study is to test the assumption that, in humans, folic acid is biotransformed (reduced\n      and methylated) to 5-MTHF in the intestinal mucosa."
