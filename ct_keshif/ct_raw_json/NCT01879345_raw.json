The multiple-dose phase started 96 h post single-dose.\n      Progression to the 2400 mg dose (Group 2) only occurred if the 1800 mg dose (Group 1) was\n      considered to be safe and well tolerated. An appropriate interval separated the\n      investigation of the two groups in order to permit a timely review and evaluation of safety\n      data.\n\n      Treatment consisted of a single-dose (Phase A) followed by a once-daily dose for 7 days\n      (Phase B). Doses were prepared as follows: Group 1 = 3 tablets of BIA 2-093 600 mg plus 1\n      placebo tablet, or 4 placebo tablets; Group 2 = 4 tablets of BIA 2-093 600 mg, or 4 placebo\n      tablets."
