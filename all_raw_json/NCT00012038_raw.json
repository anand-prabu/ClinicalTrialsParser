Patients are stratified according to\n      concurrent use of anticonvulsant drugs that induce cytochrome P450 (yes vs no drugs or\n      modest-induction drugs).\n\n      Patients receive irofulven IV over 30 minutes on days 1-4 or 1-5 (depending on\n      dose-escalation level). Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression\n      or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients (per stratum) receive escalating doses of irofulven until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at\n      which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is\n      determined, additional patients are accrued to receive treatment with irofulven at the\n      recommended phase II dose.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1 week and then every 2 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18 patients (9 per stratum) will be accrued for the phase I\n      portion of the study. Approximately 17-35 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion\n      of the study within 6-12 months."
