            "textblock": "Rotator cuff tears (injury to the muscle or tendons which stabilise the shoulder) are one of\n      the most common conditions affecting the shoulder. Small and medium sized rotator cuff tears\n      can be managed with arthroscopic or keyhole surgery. Very large or massive tears are\n      difficult to operate on and often have poor rates of healing. As a result surgeons have\n      investigated the use of products to improve the outcome of surgery on massive tears.\n\n      The product that the investigators are currently using to try to improve the outcome of\n      surgery for massive rotator cuff tears is called a patch. The patch provides a scaffold to\n      support the muscles of the rotator cuff. Studies of rotator cuff surgery using similar\n      patches have found that recovery is improved and there is a lower rate of postsurgical\n      problems. The aim of this study is to look at whether using the patch improves pain and the\n      clinical function of the shoulder after surgery. In addition, the investigators would like\n      to understand how the patch works. To do this the investigators will scan (take images of)\n      the shoulder using magnetic resonance imaging to look at the muscle damage in the shoulder\n      before and after surgery."
