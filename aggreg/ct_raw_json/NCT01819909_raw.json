The patient initially is positioned supine to perform shoulder flexion. When the patient can actively elevate in the supine position, one to two pounds of weight is placed in the patients hand and the patient is asked to repeat the maneuver of supine active elevation. When the patient can do this with little difficulty, the head of the bed is elevated approximately 20 degrees from the supine position and the sequence is repeated. Once the patient is able to perform flexion in this elevated head position, the inclination of the patient is increased in 20 degree increments until the patient is able to perform upright sitting shoulder flexion."

            "textblock": "Scapulothoracic substitution for forward elevation is seen clinically when patients have\n      shoulder pain.  The patient uses the trapezius musculature to superiorly elevate the upper\n      extremity instead of using the deltoid and the rotator cuff for upper extremity elevation.\n      Scapulothoracic substitution does not occur in healthy shoulders. Excessive scapular\n      movement can be due to an attempt to substitute for poorly functioning shoulder musculature\n      or tightness of the capsular structures of the glenohumeral joint.\n\n      Pulleys have been used in postoperative shoulder rehabilitation to improve passive as well\n      as active range of motion and develop strength.  Jackins described a series of exercises\n      that are used to improve active range of motion and develop strength without the use of\n      pulleys.  The use of pulleys in the post-operative care for patients who have had shoulder\n      surgery is thought to contribute to excessive scapular motion. To date, there has not been\n      any study that compares the use of pulleys and Jackins' exercises with respect to active\n      range of motion, scapulothoracic substitution, and objective patient outcomes measures.  Due\n      to the lack of level 1 or 2 evidence postoperative rehabilitation studies, a prospective\n      randomized study should be performed on patients that have underwent rotator cuff repair."
