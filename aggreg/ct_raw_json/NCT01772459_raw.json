Despite the numerous advantages\n      of internet-administered questionnaires, it is important to make sure that the internet\n      questionnaires will yield comparable results to the well-established paper and pencil\n      versions. No one has studied internet administration of scoliosis specific questionnaires in\n      adolescents with scoliosis. The investigators will test whether the internet administration\n      of scoliosis questionnaires is as reliable as the traditional paper and pencil version. The\n      investigators predict that the internet-administered questionnaire will provide the same\n      reliability as the paper-administered questionnaires."
