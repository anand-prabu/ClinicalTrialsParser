  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical and economic impact of implementation
      of renal denervation with the Symplicityâ„¢ Catheter System for treatment-resistant
      hypertension in Ontario, Canada.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pragmatic randomized trial of renal nerve denervation for treatment resistant
      hypertension. This is part of a ministry  sponsored MaRS-EXCITE program, to conduct early
      market health technology assessment, in order to determine appropriateness for provincial
      funding. We will assess the effectiveness, safety, economic attractiveness and feasibility
      of implementation of renal nerve denervation for treatment resistant hypertension. This will
      involve a new model of care which will include a multi-disciplinary team approach to these
      patients.  Treatment resistant hypertension is defined as patients with uncontrolled
      hypertension despite being on optimal doses of 3 or more anti-hypertensive medications.
      Patients will be randomized to either standard treatment or renal nerve denervation and
      followed for 6 months to determine impact on blood pressure.

             arteries &gt; 20 mm in length and &gt; 4 mm in diameter without significant fibromuscular
             disease or renal artery stenosis (&gt;50%)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Secondary causes of hypertension:

               1. Primary aldosteronism (secondary to adrenal adenoma)

               2. Chronic kidney disease: creatinine clearance or eGFR &lt; 45 ml/min/1.73mÂ²
                  (measured on 24 hour urine preferably or MDRD)

               3. Pheochromocytoma

               4. Cushing's syndrome

               5. Aortic coarctation (differential in brachial or femoral pulses, systolic bruit)

          -  Type 1 diabetes mellitus

          -  Pregnancy
