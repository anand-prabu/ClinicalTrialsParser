Determine the minimum effective dose of suramin that will reduce resistance to\n      chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small\n      cell lung cancer (phase I).  (Phase I closed to accrual 1/29/02).\n\n      II. Evaluate pharmacokinetic interactions of this drug combination in these patients (phase\n      I). (Phase I closed to accrual 1/29/02).\n\n      III. Determine the objective response rate in patients treated with this regimen (phase II\n      [chemotherapy-naive patients closed to accrual 9/1/03]).\n\n      IV. Determine the time to tumor progression, progression-free rate at 6 months, and 1-year\n      survival of patients treated with this regimen (phase II [chemotherapy-naive patients closed\n      to accrual 9/1/03]).\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients in phase II are stratified according to prior treatment (chemotherapy\n      naive [closed to accrual 9/1/03] vs chemotherapy refractory). Phase I (phase I closed to\n      accrual 1/29/02):\n\n      Patients receive suramin IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 2. Patients also receive\n      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21\n      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of suramin until the target dose is\n      determined. The target dose is defined as the dose at which at least 5 of 6 patients achieve\n      optimal plasma concentrations of suramin and no more than 1 of 6 patients exceed optimal\n      level. Doses of paclitaxel are adjusted until the maximum tolerated dose in combination with\n      suramin and paclitaxel is determined.\n\n      Phase II (chemotherapy-naive patients closed to accrual 9/1/03): Patients receive the target\n      dose of suramin IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 2. Patients also receive paclitaxel IV over\n      3 hours and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence\n      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3-6 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 82 patients (18 for phase I [phase I closed to accrual\n      1/29/02] and 64 for phase II [chemotherapy-naive patients closed to accrual 9/1/03]) will be\n      accrued for this study."
