            "textblock": "This study will look at a method of hormonal birth control, called the NuvaRing, and\n      specific anti-HIV medications, called antiretrovirals (ARVs). Some studies of women who use\n      a hormonal birth control method (specifically oral pills, patches, and injections) and take\n      ARVs have shown that ARVs interact with the hormones released by the birth control\n      medication. These interactions may cause the birth control to be less effective at\n      preventing pregnancy. There is also concern that hormonal birth control can increase HIV\n      spreading to others, but more studies are needed to determine if this is true. The\n      investigators do not know whether the NuvaRing and ARVs interact when they are used\n      together, so this study will look to see if certain ARVs (efavirenz and\n      atazanavir/ritonavir) interact with the two hormones released by NuvaRing. This will help us\n      to determine if NuvaRing is safe and effective for women with HIV infection who are taking\n      ARVs. The study will also include HIV-infected women who are not on ARVs but will use the\n      NuvaRing to show us what the hormone levels are like in a similar group of women not on\n      ARVs.\n\n      Vaginal rings are also currently being studied to deliver anti-HIV medications that may\n      prevent HIV acquisition, and to provide birth control over a longer period of time (more\n      than 1 month). Since vaginal rings will become more commonly used to administer medications,\n      the investigators  want to better understand the potential for drug interactions with drugs\n      given vaginally. This study will also help us understand the potential for drug interactions\n      between ARVs given orally, and other drugs given through vaginal rings, like the NuvaRing.\n      Additionally, this study will help us understand how hormones released from a vaginal ring\n      affect the amount of HIV virus in the genital tract, the bacterial make-up (microbiome) of\n      the female genital track, and the immune system within the genital tract, all of which may\n      affect the chances of spreading HIV."
