No\n      proven way exists to inform or support RA patients who are candidates for biologic therapy.\n      Communicating information about biologic medication is particularly challenging because of\n      the sheer number of risks to disclose, the difficulty explaining the risks of extremely rare\n      adverse events (AEs), and the tendency for people to discount (or underweight) future\n      benefits.\n\n      Dr Liana Fraenkel at Yale University is the Primary Investigator and developer of this\n      theory-based high quality decision support tool to effectively inform RA patients who are\n      candidates for biologics. Dr. Eric Newman will be Principal Investigator for the project\n      which will be conducted at Geisinger Medical Center. All subjects enrolled will complete a\n      baseline survey and then will be randomized to use of the decision support tool or to usual\n      care. Those randomized to usual care will be offered the opportunity to access the tool once\n      enrollment is closed and all follow-up visits have been completed.\n\n      Outcomes will be assessed at two and six weeks after the baseline visit by the Geisinger\n      Telephone Survey and Interviewing Facility. This facility is equipped with 12 computers and\n      runs two shifts a day. The Survey Unit uses a state-of-the-art Windows based Computer\n      Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) system to administer surveys and collect research data.\n      The group holds 12 interviewer licenses for the CATI system. Trained and experienced\n      interviewers are available to make the calls from 9 am to 9 pm Monday through Friday and\n      from 10 am to 2 pm on Saturdays."
