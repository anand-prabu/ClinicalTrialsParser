MRI uses different\n      levels of magnetic fields to create images of the body and organs.  Occasionally,\n      researchers will give patients undergoing a MRI an injection of a contrast substance.  The\n      contrast substance works by brightening areas of the magnetic resonance image.\n\n      In this study researchers plan to use magnetic resonance imaging with contrast substances\n      and exercise on normal volunteers in order to evaluate different aspects of its performance.\n       Information gathered from this study may be used to develop more specific research studies\n      involving MRI...."
