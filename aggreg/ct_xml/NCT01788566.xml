  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how participants with late stage lung cancer do on
      gemcitabine-cisplatin chemotherapy plus necitumumab. The study will also see how safe the
      drugs are in combination and to see how long the medicine stays in the body. The study will
      last approximately 2 years.
