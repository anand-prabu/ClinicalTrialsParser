Participants will undergo a screening session, up to two\n      fMRI scans, and up to three PET scans, as well as cognitive testing at each scan session.\n      For one of the PET scans, a drug (either ketamine or n-acetyl cysteine) will be\n      administered.\n\n      Hypothesis 1: The investigators hypothesize administration of ketamine or n-acetylcysteine\n      (NAC) will lead to a decrease in mGluR5.\n\n      Hypothesis 2: The investigators  hypothesize an improvement in memory and attentional skills\n      after drug challenge.\n\n      Hypothesis 3: The investigators hypothesize an increase in mGluR5 availability and change in\n      MRI measures post drug challenge as compared to baseline, signifying synaptogenesis."
