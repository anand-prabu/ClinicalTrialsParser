            "textblock": "If you agree to take part in this study, you will visit the Windsor Village United Methodist\n      Church 9 times. You will also receive help to quit smoking. You may or may not also be\n      enrolled in an exercise program.\n\n      Visits to the Windsor Village United Methodist Church:\n\n      These visits will be 3, 2, and 1 week(s) before you quit smoking, on your quit day, and 1,\n      2, 3, 4, and 8 weeks after you quit smoking. Each visit may last about 1 hour to 1 \u00bd hours.\n\n      During these visits:\n\n        -  You will complete questionnaires about your feelings, moods, smoking habits, and\n           behaviors (such as physical activity). The questionnaires should take about 45 minutes\n           total to complete.\n\n        -  You will complete a breath test. The breath test is used to find the amount of tobacco\n           smoke that a person consumes. For this test, you will blow air through a tube into a\n           measuring device.\n\n        -  At 3 of these visits, your heart rate will also be tested. For this test, you will put\n           on a wrist watch and a belt band and sit quietly for 5 minutes while the equipment\n           measures your heart rate.\n\n        -  At 4 of these visits, your height, weight, and waist and hip circumference will also be\n           measured. To measure your waist and hip circumference, you may be asked to lift your\n           shirt to expose your stomach area and lower your pants to expose your mid-hip area.\n           Height, weight, and waist and hip circumference measurements take about 10 minutes and\n           are performed in a private area.\n\n      Quitting Smoking:\n\n      You will receive help to quit smoking, including counseling about quitting smoking and a\n      6-week supply of the nicotine patch. The counseling will be over the phone about 1-2 weeks\n      before your scheduled quit day.\n\n      Study Groups for Physical Activity:\n\n      In addition to the visits listed above, you will be randomly assigned (as in a roll of\n      dice) to be in 1 of 3 groups.  You will have an equal chance of being in any group.\n\n        -  Group 1 will not include any physical activity.\n\n        -  Group 2 will start a walking program 2 weeks before their quit day and finish it 2\n           weeks after their quit day.\n\n        -  Group 3 will start the walking program on their quit day and finish it 4 weeks after\n           their quit day.\n\n      All participants (Groups 1, 2, and 3) will wear an accelerometer for 5 weeks during the\n      study. An accelerometer is a small device that you wear on a belt clip or an elastic belt\n      near the hip during the day. It records how active you are.\n\n      You will receive an accelerometer at your study visit 3 weeks before you quit smoking. You\n      will wear it during the following times:\n\n        -  For 14 days in a row beginning 3 weeks before you quit smoking.\n\n        -  For 7 days beginning on the quit date.\n\n        -  For 7 days beginning on the visit 2 weeks following your quit date.\n\n        -  For 7 days beginning on the visit 4 weeks following your quit date.\n\n      You should bring the accelerometer to each study visit so it can be recharged and the\n      information can be downloaded. You will be given a prepaid envelope to return the\n      accelerometer after the last recording.\n\n      Physical Activity Groups 2 and 3:\n\n      If you are in Group 2 or 3, you will take part in a walking program for 5 weeks. You will\n      walk about 150 minutes (about 2 \u00bd hours) a week.\n\n      You will receive a Walking Guide with instructions about how to do the exercises, which will\n      also contain other tips for the walking program.\n\n      Final Visit:\n\n      All participants will take part in a final focus group. This focus group will take place\n      sometime after the study visit 8 weeks after you quit smoking.  This will take about 1 hour.\n      You will be asked what you think about the program, including what you liked, did not like,\n      and how you think it could be improved.  If you want to provide this feedback but you cannot\n      come to the focus group, you may provide feedback in another way (such as a phone interview\n      or you could meet the study staff at the church). These focus groups/interviews will be\n      audio recorded. Your name and identifying information will be deleted from the recording\n      before being transcribed (typed out) by an outside party.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You will be off study after the final focus group visit.\n\n      Additional Information:\n\n      Study staff may call you on your home and/or cell phone or contact you by e-mail to remind\n      you about your study visits and/or to do your walking activity.\n\n      If the accelerometer is lost or stolen, you will not be responsible for the replacement\n      cost, but you should tell the study staff right away.\n\n      If you do not come to the study visits listed above, researchers may call and ask about your\n      smoking status. They may also schedule a visit to your home or office to take a breath\n      sample.\n\n      Your home address may be used to access public information about the area where you live.\n      This is to help researchers learn about how your neighborhood encourages physical activity.\n      The results from this study will only be reported as a group and you will not be\n      identifiable from any products resulting from this study (such as research papers). Your\n      home address will never be released or published in any form.  Your address will be stored\n      separately from other study data, and only the study chair will be able to see the data\n      after the neighborhood information has been collected.\n\n      Other Information:\n\n      If the study staff thinks that any of your responses while on the study suggest signs of\n      severe depression or show you are expressing suicidal ideation, a qualified member of the\n      study staff will be contacted to review your risk of suicide. Based on that review, study\n      staff will take steps to protect your safety, which can range from giving you a list of\n      resources for mental health services to the contacting the police if they feel you are in\n      immediate danger.\n\n      Plan for Data Destruction:\n\n      After the study is complete, the data are analyzed, and the manuscript/s are written, access\n      to the de-identified data files will be limited to the study chair and research staff, who\n      will keep the files on the MD Anderson computer server in case there are any questions about\n      the data. Your data will be kept for 10 years after the study is completed but no later than\n      1/01/2025. After that time, data will be completely deleted.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  The nicotine patch used in this study is FDA approved and\n      commercially available.\n\n      Up to 45 participants will be enrolled in this study.  All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."
