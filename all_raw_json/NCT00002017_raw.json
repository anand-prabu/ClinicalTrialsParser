To enhance measures of immune function with well-tolerated doses of\n      PEG-IL-2, an immunomodulator, in a regimen designed to allow its use in outpatients with\n      normal daily activity (i.e., full-time employment, etc.). Recombinant IL-2 (without PEG\n      modification) was administered to HIV-infected patients by daily intradermal injection. At\n      the low doses used, this was non-toxic, well-tolerated, and gave a systemic response as\n      measured by natural killer cell and lymphokine-activated killer cell activity, but required\n      daily administration. In the current study, the PEG modification of IL-2 is used since it\n      has a much longer prolonged half-life compared with the non-PEG compound, without loss of\n      functional activity."

In the second phase of\n      the study, the PEG-IL-2 is administered for 6-8 weeks using the optimal dosage, frequency,\n      and route determined in the initial phase (probably 2-3 times per week) while local and\n      systemic effects are monitored. These include measures of viral titer, peripheral blood\n      mononuclear cell phenotype, CBC and CD4 counts, and in vitro cytotoxicity assays."
