After each cycle the patient will be evaluated for response.\n      The patient could continue IL-2 therapy for up to 12 cycles. There are 4 dose levels of\n      IL-2. At each dose level 3 patients will be accrued sequentially.\n\n      Treatment with IL-2 should be continued until grade III toxicity or any side effects\n      requiring hospitalization occurs. After the patient returns to baseline pretherapy values or\n      grade I toxicity, the subject will resume IL-2 at 50% of the initial dose. If the patient\n      again goes into grade III toxicity or is in need of hospitalization, IL-2 will be\n      discontinued.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Between 12-24 patients will be accrued."
