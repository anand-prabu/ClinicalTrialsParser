[^14C] is a naturally\n      occurring radioactive form of the element, carbon. This study will increase understanding\n      about how the drug appears in the blood, urine, and stool after it is administered to\n      healthy people.  Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected.\n      This study will last up to 15 days for each participant, not including screening.
