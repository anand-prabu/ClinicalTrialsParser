The study doctor will take blood and tumor samples to look for certain features\n      linked with response to treatment so that they can predict which future patients may benefit\n      from this therapy. The purpose of this study is to see if the drug pazopanib can be used to\n      reduce the amount of pre-metastatic niche in the patient's lymph nodes (a common site for\n      prostate cancer to spread).  Down the line, this may help to prevent prostate cancer from\n      coming back after surgery."
