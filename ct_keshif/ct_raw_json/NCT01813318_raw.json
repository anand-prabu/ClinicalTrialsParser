Despite over two decades of\n      significant pharmacotherapy research, to date no medication has been shown in controlled\n      trials to enhance the core social deficits of ASD. Based upon findings describing the\n      neurobiology of ASD combined with our preliminary results, we believe the novel drug\n      acamprosate will show evidence of reducing social skills deficits associated with ASD."
