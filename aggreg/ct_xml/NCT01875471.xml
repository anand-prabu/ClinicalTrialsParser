        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject must be between 18 and 45 years of age (inclusive)with no presbyopic add.

          2. The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and
             receive a fully executed copy of the form.  This should be recorded on the Case
             Report Form (CRF).

          3. The subject must be willing to wear the study lenses for at least 8 hours per day, at
             least 6 days between visits.

          4. The subject must be a current successful spherical soft contact lens wearer in both
             eyes.

          5. The subject must appear willing and able to adhere to the instructions set forth in
             this clinical protocol.

          6. The subject's subjective refraction must result in a vertex corrected spherical
             contact lens prescription in the range of -1.00D to -6.00D (inclusive) in each eye.

          7. The subject's refractive astigmatism must be less than or equal to -0.75D in both
             eyes.

          8. The subject must have corrective visual acuity of 6/9 (20/30) or better in each eye.

          9. The subject must require a visual correction in both eyes (no monofit or monovision
             allowed).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any ocular or systemic allergies or diseases that may interfere with contact lens
             wear.

          2. Any systemic disease, autoimmune disease, or use of medication, which may interfere
             with contact lens wear.

          3. Clinically significant (Grade 3 or 4) corneal edema, corneal vascularization, corneal
             staining, or infiltrates or any other abnormalities of the cornea which would
             contraindicate contact lens wear.

          4. Clinically significant (Grade 3 or 4) tarsal abnormalities or bulbar injection which
             might interfere with contact lens wear.

          5. Any ocular infection.

          6. Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact
             lens wear.

          7. Currently pregnant or lactating (subject who become pregnant during the study will be
             discontinued).

          8. Diabetes.

          9. Infectious diseases (e.g. hepatitis, tuberculosis) or an immunosuppressive disease
             (e.g. HIV).

         10. Amblyopia

         11. Evidence of lid abnormality or infection (including blepharitis/meibomitis)

         12. Conjunctival abnormality or infection.

         13. Any active ocular disease.

         14. Employee or family member of the staff of the investigational site.
