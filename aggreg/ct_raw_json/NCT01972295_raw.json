To reduce the impact of\n      individual center bias, each site may include up to 45 subjects and each country may\n      included a maximum of 150 patients.  Up to 10 sites in the Asia Pacific region will\n      participate.\n\n      Primary analyses may include, but will not be limited to, the following: procedural\n      complications, incidence of stroke and death.  Descriptive statistics will be used for\n      baseline, procedure and follow-up data collected through the study.\n\n      Each patient will be followed for a period of two years after implant according to the\n      schedule and standard practice at the enrolling centers.  There will be no additional\n      visits, nor procedures, for subjects who participate in the study.  Subjects are expected to\n      be followed at implant, then at one post-implant visit (typically between 1-3 months of\n      implant), and then annually through 2 years post implant.  An intermediate visit may be\n      scheduled in a number of patients, per physician discretion.  In order to reliably capture\n      patient status at study end, a follow-up window of 24 +/- 3 months will be considered\n      acceptable for scheduling the last visit.  For subjects who are not scheduled to visit the\n      clinical for a follow-up, a subject contact (e.g. phone call) will ensure capture of the\n      endpoint related information; however, it is recommended to perform an in-office visit for\n      at least the first annual visit.\n\n      Enrollment is expected to be completed in 21 months; therefore the total study duration is\n      estimated to be 48 months."
