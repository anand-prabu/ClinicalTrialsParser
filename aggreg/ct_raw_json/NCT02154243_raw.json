Our goal is to prospectively study the effects of oral midodrine on the signs and\n      symptoms of orthostatic hypotension in 20 patients and the effects of intravenous fluid on\n      the signs of symptoms of orthostatic hypotension in 10 patients. Midodrine will be\n      administered to patients with suspected low SVR, and an intravenous fluid bolus will be\n      administered to patients with low CO. 120 patients will be consented with a view to studying\n      30 patients who meet the inclusion criteria for orthostatic hypotension. Patients who\n      receive midodrine or the fluid bolus will undergo hemodynamic measurements at 30 min, 1 hr,\n      2 hrs, 3 hrs, and 4 hrs post-intervention. All patients will undergo measurements for blood\n      pressure, arterial augmentation index, and heart rate at baseline (pre-op; holding area) and\n      the time of first PT attempt. Patients will be monitored up to post-operative day 3. The\n      working hypothesis is that midodrine or fluid therapy will significantly raise the mean\n      arterial blood pressure (MAP) by 5 mmHg+ and/or cause a significant change in the\n      Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (characterized by a two-point improvement in symptom\n      score)."
