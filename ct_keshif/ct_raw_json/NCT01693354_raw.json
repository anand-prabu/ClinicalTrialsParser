            "textblock": "It is a matter of fact that in the last decades the Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) population\n      has widely changed. In Italy, for example, more than 50% of the incident dialysis patients\n      are more than 70 year old, with diabetic and hypertension being the major underlying\n      diseases; moreover a great percentage of the patients starts dialysis with a burden of at\n      least 1-2 comorbidities [1]. Online hemodiafiltration (online HDF) has been  recently\n      associated with better patient survival in comparison with standard hemodialysis in two\n      large trials  [2,3]; the overall relative risk of mortality was found to be approximately\n      33% lower in patients treated with online HDF [2,3]. These impressive results were not\n      obtained anyway on the whole population, but in a sub-group analysis. A strong correlation\n      was found between the total convective volume obtained and the mortality risk reduction; HDF\n      was found to be significantly better than standard hemodialysis when a total convective\n      volume of 19-22 L/session (in 4 hours sessions of post-dilution HDF) was achieved.\n\n      These results support the importance of the \"adequate convective dose\" concept in order to\n      improve the patient outcomes especially in frail patients, as recently demonstrated by a\n      large randomised control trial, the MPO study [4], comparing High Flux versus Low Flux\n      dialysis in patients with plasma albumin levels equal to or less than 4 gr/dl ( as a marker\n      of patient comorbidities) and, in a post hoc analysis, in diabetic patients [4].\n\n      Mid-dilution HDF is a variant of classical HDF combining simultaneous pre- and\n      post.-dilution in order to maximise middle and large solutes removal.\n\n      The MILESTONE study would aim to fully demonstrate for mid-dilution HDF the significant\n      mortality risk reduction observed in the recent mentioned studies."
