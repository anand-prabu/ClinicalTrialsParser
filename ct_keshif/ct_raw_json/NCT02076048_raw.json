LCPUFAs are found naturally in seeds, nuts, fish\n      and human breast milk. The body can also make LCPUFAs from shorter-chain fatty acid\n      precursors.\n\n      The researchers in the study have previously found that LCPUFA supplementation during\n      infancy has a beneficial effect on vision and development in the early years of life.\n      However, researchers feel there is a growing need to better understand if there are\n      structural and/or functional changes in the brain that explain these benefits. It is also\n      important to understand if changes in development are still present later in childhood."
