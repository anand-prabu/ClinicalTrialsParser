    <textblock>
      The best way to provide analgesia after total hip arthroplasty is hotly debated.  There are
      two protocols in use at Hospital for Special Surgery(HSS).  Both protocols have their
      proponents, but there are limited data for making an informed choice of protocols. For total
      hip arthroplasty at HSS, epidural analgesia is used most frequently as it reduces pain with
      physical therapy.  However, epidural analgesia can be associated with nausea, pruritis,
      dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension.  These side-effects can slow physical therapy and
      may prolong the time until the patient is ready for discharge. Some surgeons at HSS have
      decided to use a different analgesic protocol, based on a peri-articular injection.  This
      protocol avoids epidural analgesia and systemic opioids.  However, patients are given oral
      opioids as part of a multimodal pain therapy. The investigators propose to compare
      peri-articular injection to epidural patient controlled analgesia (Epidural PCA).   The
      investigators will enroll 90 total patients (45 per study arm). The enrollment period will
      be approximately one year and the duration of the follow-up with study patients will be
      three months following their procedure.
