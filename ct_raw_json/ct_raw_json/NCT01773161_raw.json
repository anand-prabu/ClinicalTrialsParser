This can cause pain and restrict movement at the hip, making\n      sitting in a wheelchair uncomfortable and make personal care difficult. This condition may\n      be treated with surgery. Surgeons use x-rays taken before and after the surgery to determine\n      whether or not the surgery has been successful. However, it is also important to know\n      whether the surgery has improved life from the child or the caregiver's point of view. The\n      investigators will also evaluate if waiting for surgery affects the child. This information\n      will be added to results from a physical exam and an evaluation of the child's x-rays for a\n      more complete picture of how this surgery impacts the lives of our patients.  It is\n      predicted that that the health-related quality of life of children with cerebral palsy will\n      improve following surgery."
