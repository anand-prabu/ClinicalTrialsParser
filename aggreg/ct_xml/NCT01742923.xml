  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with hypertension have an increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction.
      However, poor adherence to treatment with antihypertensives and lipid-lowering agents occurs
      frequently within this patient group. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a
      complex tailored intervention in a hospital setting  will lead to increased medication
      adherence and fewer cardiovascular events when compared to a usual care group.
      Interventions focus on motivational interviewing, medication review and telephone follow up.
