Their affected often have motor and\n      sensory disturbances in the form of hemiparesis with a possible influence on the balance be\n      altered trunk muscles, important components of postural control. The treatment of stroke,\n      covers a wide range of different strategies and approaches physiotherapy, including,\n      specific exercises on the trunk called \"core stability\", performed by the patient with the\n      help and supervision of a physiotherapist specializing in neurology, that are based on\n      coordination, motor and proprioceptive work, especially the lumbar-pelvic. The effectiveness\n      of these last years has been demonstrated empirically, but until now there is no sufficient\n      evidence of the effects of these exercises on sitting balance in respect, and standing up in\n      the subacute phase post-stroke patients. To prove the evidence raises a randomized,\n      multicenter, blinded and where the evaluator will not participate in the analysis and\n      processing is done by intention to treat. Patients will be divided into two groups: control\n      (usual physiotherapy center made\u200b\u200b) and experimental (made \u200b\u200balso 15 minutes workout \"core\n      stability\"). The intervention will have a frequency of 5 days a week for 5 weeks and up to\n      12 weeks. The expected effect is that the experimental group patients develop better\n      postural control at the trunk and this influences the balance in sitting, standing and\n      walking."

These patients show a significant decrease in the performance level of\n      the trunk, compared to healthy individuals of the same age and sex and present asymmetry of\n      the trunk and pelvis.\n\n      Sitting involves the ability to achieve a variety of objects that are in and out of arm's\n      length, as personal daily activities, showering, going to the bathroom and dressing. These\n      arm movements, triggering postural adjustments in the muscles of the trunk and lower\n      extremities, which anticipated the movement always precede the active movement. This\n      anticipative control can be altered in subjects with stroke.\n\n      The trunk seems particularly important for balance, as stabilizes the pelvis and spine. Dean\n      et al, (1997; 2007) and Ibrahimi (2010) showed a beneficial effect on functional scope of\n      practice tasks, sitting in variables dynamic sitting balance, load weight of the affected\n      side and standing. Also in the studies of Howe (2005); Verheyden (2009); Saeys\n      (2011);Karthikbabu (2011) and Kumar (2011) with specific exercises for the trunk, favorable\n      outcomes were obtained compared with standard treatment.
