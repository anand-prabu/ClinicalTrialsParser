            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicity of topotecan\n      when combined with ifosfamide in patients with limited or extensive stage small cell lung\n      cancer. II. Determine the pharmacokinetics of topotecan and correlate with toxicity or tumor\n      response in these patients. III. Determine the effect of topotecan on apoptosis in tumor\n      tissues and correlate the apoptosis-inducing effects with antitumor effects of topotecan in\n      these patients. IV. Determine the response rate, time to progression, and survival of\n      chemotherapy naive limited or extensive stage small cell lung cancer patients treated with\n      ifosfamide and topotecan and then crossover consolidation/salvage therapy with carboplatin\n      and etoposide. V. Determine the response rate, time to progression, and survival of\n      pretreated limited or extensive stage small cell lung cancer patients treated with\n      ifosfamide and topotecan as salvage therapy.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of topotecan (phase I). Patients are stratified by\n      disease stage (extensive vs limited) and prior chemotherapy (naive vs pretreated) in phase\n      II. Induction therapy: Patients receive topotecan IV over 72 hours and ifosfamide IV over 30\n      minutes every 3 weeks. Chemotherapy naive patients with complete or partial response after 3\n      courses, stable disease after 2 courses, or progressive disease at any time receive\n      consolidation/salvage chemotherapy. Pretreated patients continue on induction regimen for a\n      minimum of 6 courses unless disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Phase I: Cohorts\n      of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of topotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)\n      is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6 patients\n      experience dose limiting toxicity. Salvage chemotherapy: Patients with extensive stage\n      disease receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and etoposide IV over 45 minutes on\n      days 1, 2, and 3. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 to 6 courses. Patients with\n      limited stage disease undergoing chest irradiation receive treatment every 28 days for the\n      first course. Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 3 months for 1 year,\n      and then every 4 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-20 patients will be accrued for phase I and\n      approximately 35 patients will be accrued for phase II of this study."
