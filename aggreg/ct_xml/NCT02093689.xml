      OMS302 is a mydriatic/anti-inflammatory combination investigational drug product being
      developed for use during intraoperative lens replacement (ILR). This study evaluates the
      effect of OMS302 on the signs of Floppy Iris Syndrome in subjects with a history of
      tamsulosin exposure who are undergoing ILR.
