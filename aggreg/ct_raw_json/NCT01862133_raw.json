However, realizing that\n      potential can be difficult, particularly with respect sensitive information. Increasingly,\n      patients, patient advocate groups, and even the National Coordinator for Health Information\n      Technology (ONC) are pushing for patients to have more granular control over specifically\n      who can see what personal health information (PHI) in their electronic health records\n      (EHRs).\n\n      This will be a demonstration project aimed at showing the initial feasibility a system\n      allowing patient controls on their EHR data system, Advanced Data Access Control (ADAC).\n      Because of the exploratory nature of the research, the investigators do not have specific\n      hypotheses. The investigators hope that this demonstration and feasibility project will lead\n      to more extensive prospective evaluations of ADAC and other tools for enhancing patient\n      control over access to their EHRs."
