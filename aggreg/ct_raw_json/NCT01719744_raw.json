            "textblock": "ENMD-2076 is an oral drug that works by blocking certain enzymes called Aurora A from\n      working. These enzymes are needed for cells to divide including cancer cells. ENMD-2076 also\n      works by stopping the growth of new blood vessels which would provide the tumor with\n      nutrients for it to grow. It is believed that by blocking Aurora A enzymes from working and\n      stopping new blood vessels from growing, the tumors may stop growing or shrink."
