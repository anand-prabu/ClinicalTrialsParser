Previous studies have shown that the cardiac output varies\n      widely even under normal ambient conditions. Especially the mean frequenices of cardiac\n      compression varies from 60 to 160/min, as well as the now-flow-time. Aim of this study is to\n      investigate how narrowness and movement during a transport affect the CPR-performance.\n\n      For this, we examine the impact of the common transport options (air and ground) on the\n      outcome-varity on a manikin. The subjects for this study are professional rescuers\n      (emergency physicians / paramedics) who perform a 10 minute ALS-CPR in either normal\n      circumstances (resuscitation-room) or during transportation."
