        Heart Failure Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a history of stable cardiomyopathy (ischemic and non-ischemic, greater
             than 1 year duration, ages 20-79 years)

          -  New York Heart Association class I through IV symptoms

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction less than 35 percent (heart failure patients with
             reduced left ventricular ejection fraction) or greater than 50 percent (heart failure
             patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction)

          -  Sedentary, no regular physical activity for at least 6 months prior

          -  Post-menopausal for at least 2 years and follicle stimulating hormone greater than 40

        Heart Failure Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with atrial fibrillation or heart failure believed to be secondary to atrial
             fibrillation

          -  Morbidly obese patients with a body mass index greater than 35

          -  Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, greater than 160/100

          -  Severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance less than 30 by the Cockcroft-Gault
             formula)

          -  Patients with significant non-cardiac comorbidities

          -  Orthopedic limitations that would prohibit them from performing the elbow-flexor
             exercise

          -  Current smoker or smoking history of 15 packs or more per year

          -  Women currently taking hormone replacement therapy

          -  Ages 20-75 years

          -  Sedentary, no regular physical activity for at least 6 months prior

          -  Post-menopausal for at least 2 years and follicle stimulating hormone greater than 40

        Healthy Control Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of cardiovascular related abnormalities or pulmonary abnormalities

          -  Morbidly obese patients with a body mass index greater than 35

          -  Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, greater than 160/100

          -  Anemia with a hemoglobin less than 9

          -  Orthopedic limitations that would prohibit them from performing the elbow-flexor
