TACE involves reaching up to the\n      blood vessel that feeds the tumor through a catheter placed into the groin vessel. Once the\n      physician has defined the vessel going to the tumor, chemotherapy is infused to the tumor\n      and the vessel is blocked, maintaining the chemotherapy for longer time inside the tumor and\n      stopping the blood flow that feeds the tumor. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is\n      a type of radiation therapy that delivers radiation to the tumor cells but does not harm\n      normal liver cells. It is not yet known whether TACE is more effective with or without SBRT\n      in treating liver tumors."
