Adherence will be determined by the\n      specific FTC/TDF drug level measurement(s) outlined in the parent protocol.\n\n      There are two case definitions: a) One-hundred-fifty subjects who seroconvert (become HIV-1\n      positive) and b) any subjects who either develop a protocol-defined renal adverse event\n      (stratified by Division of AIDS [DAIDS] grading) or have a skeletal adverse event (any\n      fracture) while taking FTC/TDF for PrEP.\n\n      Among the estimated 7,000 subjects from Truvada for PrEP observational and clinical studies\n      all cases, defined as subjects who seroconvert and/or develop either renal or skeletal\n      adverse events, will be identified. Randomly chosen controls on Truvada will be selected in\n      a 3:1 ratio, from the same site, with a similar treatment duration."
