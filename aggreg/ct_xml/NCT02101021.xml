  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There will be two phases to this study. The lead-in phase will evaluate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of momelotinib combined with
      nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in adults with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic
      ductal adenocarcinoma. The randomized treatment phase will evaluate the efficacy, safety,
      and tolerability of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine combined with either momelotinib
      administered at the MTD or placebo in adults with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic
      ductal adenocarcinoma as measured by improvement in overall survival (OS), progression free
      survival (PFS), and overall response rate (ORR). Participants will continue study treatment
      until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, or participant's
      refusal of treatment. There will be a screening period of up to 21 days of first dose of
      momelotinib for the lead-in phase or randomization for the randomized treatment phase.
      Following treatment, participants will be followed for safety for 30 days and for survival
      approximately every 6 months for up to 5 years.

    <description>Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) refer to toxicities experienced during the first 28 days of treatment that have been judged to be clinically significant and related to study treatment. DLTs were defined as any of the following:
Grade 4 neutropenia lasting &gt; 5 days
Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia with fever (temperature ≥ 100.5º F)
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia
Grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity, excluding:
Grade 3 nausea or emesis with maximum duration of 48 hours on adequate medical therapy
Grade 3 diarrhea with maximum duration of 48 hours on adequate medical therapy
Alopecia
A treatment-emergent adverse event (AE) that in the opinion of the investigator is of potential clinical significance such that further dose escalation would expose participants to unacceptable risk
