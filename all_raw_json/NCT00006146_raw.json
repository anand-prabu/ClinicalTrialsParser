One possible way of\n      increasing the availability of influenza vaccine for this year is to use a half-dose in\n      healthy adults.  The objective of this study is to determine if the immune system responds\n      to a half-dose the same way it responds to a whole dose.  This study will use the currently\n      approved inactivated influenza vaccine in healthy adults ages 18 to 49 years old.\n\n      If the immune response to the half-dose is not significantly different than the immune\n      response generated to the whole dose, this could be a strategy to extend the amount of\n      vaccine that could be available in this age group."
