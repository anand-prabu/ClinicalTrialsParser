The regimen was\n      repeated every 3 weeks for a maximum of six cycles. Stage IE/IIE patients underwent four\n      cycles induction chemotherapy, followed by involved-field radiotherapy after got CR, PR or\n      SD. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy was done by linear accelerator at 2.0 grays\n      (Gy) per daily fraction with 5-6 weeks. The involved- field radiation (IFRT) dose was 50-56\n      Gy. Refractory/relapsed patients underwent at least two cycles treatments unless there was\n      disease progression or unacceptable side effects, or withdrawal of patient consent.\n      Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) was recommended after they\n      achieved CR."
