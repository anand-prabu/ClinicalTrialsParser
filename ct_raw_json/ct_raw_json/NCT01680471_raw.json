            "textblock": "Sevoflurane is associated with a high incidence of emergence agitation in children. The\n      etiology of emergence agitation is unclear. Some studies proposed that emergence agitation\n      was related to a variable rate of neurologic recovery rate in different brain areas and\n      immaturity of neurons. Inhalation anesthetics have been known to exert transient paradoxical\n      excitatory effects in both animals and human patients, especially in children. The\n      gamma(\u03b3)-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor is the target depressant effect site of most\n      anesthetic drugs including sevoflurane. Midazolam acts on the benzodiazepine binding site of\n      GABAA receptors and results in inhibitory effects on the central nervous system. The effect\n      of midazolam premedication, as well as midazolam administration at the end of surgery, on\n      suppressing emergence agitation has been studied. However, the effect of midazolam on\n      emergence agitation is still controversial. This study aims to figure out the effect of\n      midazolam at the end of surgery on emergence agitation during the recovery period, and find\n      out the proper dose of midazolam with minimum disturbance to patient's emergence time."
