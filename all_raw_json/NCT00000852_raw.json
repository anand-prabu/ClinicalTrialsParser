To measure the distribution and survival of allogeneic\n      lymphocytes in the circulation of HIV-infected patients, and to determine whether their\n      infusion results in enhanced immunity. To determine whether enhanced immunity is passively\n      transferred or actively induced.\n\n      There is evidence that periodic infusion of allogeneic lymphocytes obtained from the\n      peripheral blood of HLA-matched HIV-1 seronegative siblings of patients with AIDS can, in\n      some instances, restore the number of circulating CD4+ lymphocytes. However, more controlled\n      studies are needed to better quantitate the immunologic reconstitution seen with this type\n      of therapy."

A small\n      portion of the lymphocytes obtained at day 0 will be radiolabeled prior to infusion, and two\n      total body scans will be performed. Patients also undergo two tonsillar biopsies. Patients\n      are followed weekly for 16 weeks, then by telephone periodically for 3 years (at 1 year, 2\n      years, 2.5 years, and 3 years)."
