  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significant number of patients relapse and eventually die, particularly if they were
      initially diagnosed with large nodes involvement and/or T3/4 diseases.  When analyses focus
      on patients with ER+/Her2-negative breast cancer, with ≥4N+, 30% had relapsed at 5 years,
      emphasizing the need for new drugs in this setting (PACS01 data, UNICANCER internal data).

      Strong evidence suggests that cross-talk between the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
      (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and ER signaling is linked to
      hormone resistance in breast cancer patients.

      In the present study, we plan to evaluate the benefit from adding everolimus to standard
      endocrine treatments after three years of treatment for patient ER+/HER2- at high risk of
      relapse due to high nodes involvement (≥4) and/or persistent node involvement after
      neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.

      This study is a unique opportunity to prove the efficacy of everolimus in adjuvant setting.
      The study could be practice changing in case of positive results and could allow improving
      outcome of breast cancer patients presenting high risk of metastatic relapse.
