The mask is connected to their anesthesia machine via tubing, or a\n      circuit, through which their anesthetic gases flow.  Some children fight the mask as it can\n      be seen as new and frightening.

            "textblock": "Children presenting for ear tube surgery (bilateral myringotomy and ventilating tube\n      insertion) often suffer from postoperative delirium in the recovery room.  It has been\n      hypothesized this may be a result or side effect of a premedication, midazolam.  Midazolam\n      is frequently administered to children preoperatively as a means of decreasing separation\n      anxiety.  An alternative medication, dexmedetomidine, is sometimes used as an alternative to\n      midazolam and has also been effective in treating postoperative delirium.  In this study the\n      investigators would like to see if there is in fact a measurable difference between children\n      receiving the standard midazolam or dexmedetomidine.\n\n      Patients would be randomized into one of three groups (versed alone, dexmedetomidine alone,\n      or a combination).  Patients included would be those presenting for BMT surgery who are an\n      ASA physical status 1 or 2, not falling into any exclusion criteria.\n\n      Exclusion criteria would be patients with vital signs outside the normal limits as\n      documented under the research plan.  Also to be excluded are those patients with known\n      genetic abnormalities predisposing to a derangement in hemodynamics or challenging airway.\n\n      The anesthesiologists listed as team members are the ones who are involved with this study\n      and would be responsible for providing a standard anesthetic (same technique with\n      inhalational anesthetic agents and intraoperative pain management) so no other variability\n      would need to be taken into consideration for assessment in the recovery room.  The\n      investigators researchers, both anesthesiologists and observers will be blinded during the\n      study.  The pharmacy will have a list of patients who have consented, and then will randomly\n      allocate them into one of the three groups.  Only for analysis will the investigators\n      (myself as the PI and other members) know which patient received which drug or combination.\n      Also, by having the same team members performing assessment of each of the three parameters\n      (1. Pre-op sedation scale, 2. Mask acceptance score, and 3. Post operative emergence\n      delirium scale), there would be good reliability.  A briefing session will be performed\n      prior to the study's commencement showing pictures to the reviewers so there can be an\n      agreed upon assessment.  The MOASS or pre-operative sedation scale as well as the mask\n      acceptance and PAED scale have been utilized and validated in previous studies (10), while\n      the mask acceptance scale has been successfully utilized as well (11, 12, 13).  The\n      investigators goal is to decrease variability by having only two members make observations.\n\n      DESCRIPTION IN LAYMEN TERMS.  Please summarize this study in less than 10 sentences.
