Determine the objective tumor response rate as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in\n      Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria in participants with previously treated non-squamous\n      NSCLC treated with pemetrexed and AUY922.\n\n      II. Evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of pemetrexed and AUY922. III. Evaluate toxicity,\n      including visual toxicity, in participants treated with AUY922 and pemetrexed.\n\n      IV. Analyze tumor-tissue biomarkers for potential correlation with response.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922.\n\n      Patients receive Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes weekly and\n      pemetrexed disodium IV over 15 minutes every 3 weeks.
