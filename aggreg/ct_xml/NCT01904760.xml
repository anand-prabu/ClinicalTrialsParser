  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reconstruction using microvascular free tissue flap has been an important management in
      patients with maxillofacial tumor. It is often characterised as long operation time, more
      traumatic and require restriction of patient's head movement postoperatively in order to
      prevent disruption of microvascular anastomosis. Agitation and delirium are common in
      patients with free flap surgery, which may lead to serious consequences such as self
      extubation, injury or even failure of the flap.

      Dexmedetomidine is a sedative and co-analgesic drug with high specificity for
      α2-adrenoceptor. It is widely used in ICU sedation in general hospital. However its use
      after free flap surgery is not well documented. Furthermore the effect of Dexmedetomidine on
      preventing delirium has not been proved.

      The investigators hypothesized that the use of Dexmedetomidine would reduce emergence
      agitation and prevent delirium in patients after free flap surgery.
