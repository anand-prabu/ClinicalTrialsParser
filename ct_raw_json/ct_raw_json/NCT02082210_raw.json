In Part A\n      of this study, escalating doses of LY2875358 will be given in combination with a fixed dose\n      of ramucirumab to evaluate the safety of the combination. After a recommended schedule and\n      dose range of LY2875358 and ramucirumab has been established, Part B of the study will\n      confirm safety and to see how well certain tumors respond to the combination of study drugs.\n      The average amount of time on study is expected to be about 6 months."
