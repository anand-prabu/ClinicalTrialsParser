According to a survey a quarter\n      of the German population is making use of a smartphone at present.\n\n      An interference between smartphones and the functionality of pacemakers or implantable\n      defibrillators is rather unlikely but cannot entirely be excluded. A systematic study\n      regarding a possible interference between smartphones and modern pacemaker- and ICD-system\n      with a better shielding against external influence has not taken place so far. In this study\n      the investigators intend to investigate any interference between different smartphones\n      produced by different manufacturers and diverse cardiovascular implanted electronic devices."
