The Shockwave Lithoplasty System is indicated\n      to generate sonic shockwave energy within the target treatment site and disrupt calcium\n      within the lesion to allow for subsequent dilation of a peripheral artery stenosis using low\n      balloon pressure. Up to thirty-five (35) subjects will be enrolled and treated with\n      Lithoplasty to yield thirty (30) evaluable subjects complete the study assuming a 15% lost\n      to follow-up rate."
