The objective is to assess among\n      new users the risks of certain events (e.g. contraceptive failure rate, ectopic pregnancy,\n      uterine perforation, and PID) associated with the use of LCS12 compared with the established\n      hormonal IUD Mirena, and compared with established copper IUDs during standard clinical\n      practice. In addition, drug utilization patterns will be described."

            "textblock": "Intrauterine contraceptive methods, such as Mirena and copper IUDs, have a high\n      contraceptive efficacy. LCS12 is a new intrauterine system which, like Mirena, contains\n      levonorgestrel (LNG), but the T-body dimensions and insertion tube diameter of LCS12 are\n      smaller.\n\n      Because there is a lack of comparative data between LCS12 and other intrauterine\n      contraceptives, it is unclear whether there are differences in contraceptive failure rates\n      between LCS12 and either Mirena or copper IUDs. In addition, any transcervical procedure,\n      including the insertion of an intrauterine device, is potentially associated with the risk\n      of infection/inflammation.\n\n      EURAS-LCS12 is a prospective, controlled, non-interventional, active surveillance cohort\n      study with three user cohorts: LCS12, Mirena and copper IUDs. Study participants will be\n      recruited by a network of health care professionals and will be followed up through active\n      surveillance to collect information regarding the outcomes of interest and major safety\n      outcomes.\n\n      All self-reported clinical outcomes of interest will be validated by health care\n      professionals. The primary endpoint is unintended pregnancy. Secondary endpoints are ectopic\n      pregnancy, uterine perforation, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)."
