While HIV patients share the same\n      cardiovascular risk factors and they are often diagnosed with cognitive impairment and\n      frailty, CSVD has not been yet described in this population.\n\n      The global aim is to compare  the prevalence of  CSVD in a well controlled HIV+ population\n      compared to HIV- controls matched with age and sex.\n\n      500 HIV+ patients and 250 age- and sex- matched controls will undergo a screening of the\n      CSVD with a 10 minutes MRI (FLAIR and T2*).\n\n      Prevalence of the CSVD will be compared between HIV+ patients and controls. General and\n      HIV-specific parameters from their electronic medical records will be compared between\n      HIV+/CSVD+ and HIV+/CSVD- patients.\n\n      We are expecting to prove that CSVD is more frequent in HIV+ population."
