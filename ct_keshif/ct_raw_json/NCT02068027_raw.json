Females must be\n             practicing an acceptable method of birth control, or be surgically sterile or\n             postmenopausal (amenorrhea for \u226512 months).  Non-pregnancy will be confirmed (as\n             applicable) by a pregnancy test conducted at the Screening and Randomization Visits.\n             Double-barrier methods, hormonal contraceptives, and abstinence are acceptable birth\n             control methods for this study.\n\n          -  The subject has chronic pain attributable to a symmetrical stocking distribution\n             neuropathy in the lower extremities for at least three (3) months.  A loss of distal\n             sensation and/or tingling paresthesia primarily in the toes and fingers is\n             acceptable, but must be of secondary importance to the distal neuropathic pain.  Pain\n             should be clearly localized to the area of neuropathy (feet) and subjects should be\n             able to distinguish this pain (the target pain) from other painful areas and\n             conditions.\n\n          -  The subject has an average pain score relevant to the target pain in the feet of \u22654\n             on an 11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale over the previous 24 hours at Screening.\n\n          -  The subject has a pain score of at least 2, on the 11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale\n             , within 30 minutes following topical 0.1% capsaicin application with occlusive\n             dressing to the pretibial area.\n\n          -  The subject has a mean daily average pain score relevant to the target pain in the\n             feet of \u22654 on an 11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale during the Baseline Phase.\n\n          -  The subject has met the pain evaluation and scoring criteria at the end of the\n             Placebo Lead-in Phase by having a mean daily average pain score relevant to the\n             target pain in the feet of \u22654 on an 11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale without having\n             a decrease in their pain score greater than 20% compared to the Baseline Phase score\n             in the 11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale .\n\n          -  The subject has been medically stable for at least 30 days prior to the Screening\n             Visit, and in the opinion of the Investigator, is in otherwise good general health\n             based on medical history, physical examination, ECG, and laboratory evaluation.\n\n          -  If taking chronic oral pain medications, the subject must be on a stable regimen for\n             at least 14 days prior to the Baseline Visit with the expectation that the\n             medications, dose(s) and schedule will remain stable throughout the study.  For\n             medications containing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and aspirin,\n             subjects must be on a stable dose for at least 7 days prior to the Baseline Visit.\n             As needed pain medications will be limited to acetaminophen from Day -8 until the end\n             of the treatment period.  Low dose aspirin (81 mg/day) is not considered as analgesic\n             therapy.\n\n          -  Subject is compliant with daily pain assessments during the Baseline Phase and\n             Placebo Lead in Phase of the study by recording their Numeric Pain Rating Scale\n             score at least 5 days and the last 3 days of the previous 7 days.\n\n          -  Subject is alert and has the capabilities of applying topical gel to both feet three\n             times daily.  A caregiver, trained by the study staff to apply study drug, would be a\n             suitable alternative to self-application of the treatment.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  The subject has neuropathy secondary to non-diabetic causes in the opinion of the\n             Investigator (e.g., significant vasculitis, collagen vascular disorder, familial\n             neuropathy, alcoholism, pernicious anemia, hepatitis, malignancy, syphilis,\n             post-herpetic neuralgia, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy, human\n             immunodeficiency virus [HIV], medication-induced neuropathy, vitamin B12 deficiency).\n\n          -  The subject has a significant neurological disorder or a condition that can cause\n             symptoms that mimic peripheral neuropathy or might confound assessment of painful\n             diabetic neuropathy (e.g., stroke with distal neurological deficit, mononeuritis\n             multiplex, lumbar radiculopathy, multiple sclerosis) or has significant asymmetric\n             neuropathic signs and symptoms.\n\n          -  The subject has other sustained pain with intensity at or greater than the bilateral\n             neuropathic pain in the feet/toes.\n\n          -  The subject is using an implanted medical device (e.g., spinal cord stimulator,\n             intrathecal pump, or peripheral nerve stimulator) for the treatment of pain.\n\n          -  The subject has no pin-prick sensitivity to Neuropen testing of non-calloused areas\n             of the foot.\n\n          -  The subject is clinically hypotensive with a resting diastolic blood pressure <60 mm\n             Hg or a systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg.\n\n          -  The subject has recent history (within the past 3 months) or current symptoms of\n             orthostatic hypotension with a sudden fall in blood pressure on standing accompanied\n             by dizziness and lightheadedness.\n\n          -  The subject has a history of foot or toe amputation, or an active foot or toe ulcer.\n\n          -  The subject has any significant or unstable medical or psychiatric condition that, in\n             the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with his/her ability to participate\n             in the study.\n\n          -  The subject has a history of substance abuse disorder as defined by the Diagnostic\n             and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR)\n             within the past year, has current evidence for substance abuse disorder, is receiving\n             medicinal treatment for drug abuse, or tests positive upon urine drug screen for a\n             non-prescribed substance of abuse.\n\n          -

 The subject has a serum creatinine value >2.0 mg/dL or a value for alanine\n             transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) >2.5 times the upper limit of\n             normal at Screening.\n\n          -  The subject was dosed with an investigational drug within 30 days prior to the\n             Screening Visit.\n\n          -  The subject is likely to be noncompliant or unreliable in providing pain ratings as\n             judged by the Investigator.\n\n          -

 The subject has had prior treatment with clonidine topical gel.\n\n          -  The subject is currently taking or has taken clonidine in any form (oral, transdermal\n             patch) over the past 4 weeks.\n\n          -

 The subject is receiving non-oral pain medication(s) (transdermal, topical,\n             subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intrarectal, sublingual, transmucosal)\n             and/or using \"alternative medicine\" products or techniques (acupuncture, naturopathy,\n             homeopathy, etc.) for pain treatment \u22647 days prior to the Baseline Visit.\n\n          -  Subject has a history of malignancy within the past 5 years with the exception of\n             successfully treated non-metastatic basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas of the\n             skin and/or localized carcinoma in situ of the cervix.\n\n          -
