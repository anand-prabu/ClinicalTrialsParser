Patients in phase II are stratified according to\n      use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) (yes vs no) and disease type\n      (glioblastoma multiforme with stable neuro-imaging after radiotherapy vs recurrent malignant\n      glioma). Patients in phase I must be currently receiving EIAEDs.\n\n        -  Phase I: Patients receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes once weekly. Treatment repeats\n           every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CCI-779 until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n        -  Phase II: Patients receive CCI-779 as in Phase I. Patients who are candidates for\n           surgical resection of recurrent disease receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes 2 hours\n           prior to surgery and then once weekly, as above, once recovered from surgery.\n\n      Patients are followed for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for phase I of this study within\n      12 months. A total of 87 patients will be accrued for phase II of this study within 12\n      months."
