Children with\n      Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) are particularly handicapped by atonic-myoclonic seizures.\n      Preliminary data suggest that even when other medications have failed, these seizures may\n      respond rapidly and dramatically to a high-fat-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet.  The purpose\n      of the study is to assess if the classic ketogenic diet is efficacious in reducing seizure\n      frequency, medication toxicity, and improves quality of life."

This study is designed to test, in a carefully controlled fashion,\n      how well the diet works in children with \"drop\" seizures. Children who experience 15 or more\n      drop seizures each day, despite having used at least two medications, may be eligible to\n      participate.  This study requires children to undergo periods of fasting and to maintain a\n      carefully controlled diet.  Parents of participating children monitor their children's diets\n      and keep daily meal and seizure diaries."
