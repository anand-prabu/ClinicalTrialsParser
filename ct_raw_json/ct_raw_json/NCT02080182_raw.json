It is a\n      triple-blind placebo controlled study on a population of 64 patients 1-16 years old that\n      have \"definite\" or \"probable\" diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in \"Mofid\" hospital.\n\n      After randomization, patients will be given acetylcysteine or placebo with dosing according\n      to their weight. Results of treatment are evaluated according to serum procalcitonin, C\n      reactive protein and leukocyte count before drug prescription (baseline) and 5 days after\n      drug prescription. Side effects are also recorded in both groups. Patients will be receiving\n      their routine antimicrobial drugs in addition to acetylcysteine."
