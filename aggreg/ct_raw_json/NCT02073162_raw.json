Each approach has potential advantages and disadvantages.\n      Currently, there is no compelling evidence that one approach is better than the other. This\n      study tests whether giving a volume on the low end of the usual amount (\"restrictive\n      management\") has a different rate of  complications compared to a volume on the high end of\n      the usual amount (\"liberal management\"). This study will compare liberal and restrictive\n      fluid management to determine their effects on major complications after abdominal surgery.\n\n      Those who take part in the study will be visited five times before and after surgery in the\n      hospital.  Once discharged from the hospital, participants will be called 4 times on the\n      telephone.\n\n      Preadmission Clinic/Preoperative Visit\n\n        -  Sign the consent document\n\n        -  Have blood drawn for standard preoperative tests (standard of care)\n\n        -  Have an electrocardiogram (standard of care)\n\n        -  Complete a questionnaire on disability (research)\n\n      Day of Surgery\n\n        -  Have blood drawn if not already done during the first visit (standard of care)\n\n        -  Have an electrocardiogram if not already done during the first visit (standard of care)\n\n        -  Be randomly assigned to either restrictive or liberal fluid management  (research)\n\n      Post-op Day 1\n\n        -  Have an electrocardiogram done (research)\n\n        -  Have blood drawn for standard tests (standard of care)\n\n        -  Have a wound inspection, if there is a change of dressing (standard of care)\n\n        -  Complete a questionnaire about your recovery (research)\n\n      Post-op Day 3\n\n        -  Have blood drawn for standard tests (standard of care) and c-reactive protein, which\n           can indicate infection (for research).\n\n        -  Have a wound inspection, if there is a change of dressing (standard of care)\n\n        -  Complete a questionnaire about your recovery (research)\n\n      Day of Discharge\n\n        -  Have a wound inspection, if there is a change of dressing (standard of care)\n\n           30-Day Follow-up Phone Call\n\n        -  Complete a questionnaire about your recovery (research)\n\n        -  Complete a questionnaire about disability (research)\n\n           3 Month, 6-Month, and 12-Month Follow-up Phone Calls\n\n        -  Complete a questionnaire about disability (research)"
