            "textblock": "People with schizophrenia tend to have problems with attention and concentration. Studies\n      found that these patients are unable to block or gate out non-relevant and distracting\n      information (e.g., noises).  This may lead to brain overload. Cognitive abilities like\n      concentration, memory, and learning may worsen. This ability to filter sensory information\n      has been linked to a gene that affects the way nicotine acts in the brain. Patients with\n      schizophrenia have a high rate of cigarette smoking. 60% to 90% smoke compared with 25% of\n      the general population. It has been suggested that these patients may use nicotine to\n      improve their ability to block out distracting information. Brain wave activity (EEG) in\n      response to sounds has been proved useful in understanding this gating problem. The present\n      study uses EEG measures and performance tasks to find out what a new nicotine-like\n      treatment, which will be added to ongoing treatment medications, does to gating and\n      cognition. It is hoped that this new treatment will improve the way in which patients\n      process information, as this may help them in day-to-day activities."

A secondary objective of this research will assess the acute effects of CDP-choline on cognitive operations. This will be conducted using a test battery assessing seven orthogonal domains of cognition designated by MATRICS as targets for clinical assessment of potential cognitive enhancers for SZ.",
