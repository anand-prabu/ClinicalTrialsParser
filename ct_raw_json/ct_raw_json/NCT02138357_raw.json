Depending on the need for medication titration, there\n      may also be two scheduled telephone contacts.\n\n      Visit 1: This is a screening visit to determine study eligibility. Eligible subjects who\n      choose to participate must undergo medication washout as described in the detailed protocol\n      between visits 1 and 2.\n\n      Treatment period #1 (Visits 2 - 5; day 0 - 28): Baseline measures will be recorded and\n      subjects randomized to treatment order at visit 2 (day 0).  Study medication as well as\n      rescue medication (l-dopa, a non-blinded active treatment to be used within a limited dose\n      range as described in the detailed protocol) will be dispensed. Subjects will begin\n      treatment period #1 immediately after this.  The study medication will be titrated within\n      the allowed range according to subject's reported symptoms during visit 3 (day 7), visit 4\n      (day 14), telephone contact (day 21). Visit 5 will occur on day 28 and will include\n      assessment of outcome measures for the first treatment period. Visit 5 will also mark the\n      beginning of the second treatment period.\n\n      Treatment period #2 (Visits 6 - 8; day 28 - 56):  Procedures will be similar to those\n      described above during treatment period #1. Visit 8 will mark the end of the second\n      treatment period during which outcome measures will be ascertained.\n\n      Follow up visit (Visit 9; day 70): This will be a safety follow-up visit approximately two\n      weeks after visit 8 for review of adverse events."
