Virtual colonoscopy is a combination of a radiologic evaluation of the abdomen and\n      pelvis with intra-colonic imaging.   Previous research supports the concept that CT-C may be\n      an effective substitute for the current OC and address limited compliance for surveillance\n      for CRC survivors."
