The suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus is a key component in controlling\n      circadian rhythms and generates the rhythm of melatonin secretion from the pineal gland and\n      cortisol secretion.

Compared to healthy controls,\n      craniopharyngioma patients have previously been reported with impaired quality of life,\n      increased self-reported general and physical fatigue, increased daytime sleepiness, and\n      increased prevalence of severe sleepiness\n\n      Damage to the hypothalamus by local tumour or its treatment might involve the\n      suprachiasmatic nucleus and thereby melatonin secretion leading to disturbed circadian\n      function causing clinical manifestations in terms of daytime sleepiness and fatigue.\n\n      The investigators aimed to assess the influence of craniopharyngiomas or their treatment on\n      melatonin secretion, and the association with sleep pattern, sleep quality, fatigue, and\n      sleepiness.\n\n      15 patients with craniopharyngioma and 15 gender, age, and BMI matched healthy controls were\n      included.
