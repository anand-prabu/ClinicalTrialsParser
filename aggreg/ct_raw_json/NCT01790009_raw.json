Several\n      well-controlled randomised human intervention studies have shown that cocoa flavanols have\n      beneficial effects on blood pressure, endothelial function  and other biomarkers of\n      cardiovascular health. These vascular improvements have been correlated in time with changes\n      in plasma flavanol metabolites. The health benefits of flavanol consumption are therefore\n      likely dependent on changes in their absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion\n      (ADME). Recent studies have provided detailed information regarding the absorption and\n      metabolism of cocoa flavanols. However, there is a lack of information on whether there are\n      changes in flavanol absorption and metabolism with increasing age."
