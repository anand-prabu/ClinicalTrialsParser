As present, the total postoperative 5-year survival rate of NSCLC\n           is 40%, while only 4%\uff5e15% patients can benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy[1].

            "textblock": "-  In postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, navelbine plus platinum (NP), the most commonly\n           used therapeutic protocol, had more advantages than other 3 generations of new drugs\n           plus platinum. With the continuous implementation of individual therapies for lung\n           cancer, some new drugs became selective to pathological patterns and gene types, and it\n           was unclear whether these drugs would be more effective than conventional drugs in\n           postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. The first- and second-generation of drugs were not\n           observed with survival advantages except the third generation, so what conclusion would\n           be made in selecting individual chemotherapeutic drugs according to pathological\n           patterns? In this study, Pemetrexed plus Platinum were adopted in postoperative\n           adjuvant chemotherapy on patients with adeno-carcinoma, while Docetaxel plus Platinum\n           were performed on those with non-adeno-carcinoma.\n\n        -  Apart from individual chemotherapy on the basis of different pathological patterns,\n           anti-angiogenesis therapy has been quickly developed in recent years, becoming the most\n           effective approach to improve chemotherapeutic efficacy. The main mechanism of\n           anti-angiogenesis drugs includes inhabiting tumor angiogenesis to postpone or inhabit\n           the recurrence of residual tumor through reconstructing the balance of\n           anti-angiogenesis and preventing the growth of micro-metastasis to keep it in resting\n           stage. The effect of adjuvant chemotherapy can be promoted by increasing the drug\n           sensitivity, and survival time can be prolonged though further delaying the time and\n           decreasing the rate of postoperative recurrence and metastasis of tumor by\n           anti-angiogenesis therapy combined with adjuvant chemotherapy. As more attentions are\n           increasingly given to anti-angiogenesis drugs in postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy at\n           present, Endostar, an anti-angiogenesis drug studied independently in China, had\n           favorable effect in treating advanced lung cancer when combined with chemotherapy.\n           Therefore, this study protocol to gather the effect of Endostar on improving the\n           survival of early lung cancer patients by observing its effect on partial NSCLC\n           patients in treatment group when combined with other therapies.\n\n        -  A total of 392 NSCLC patients in phase \u2160B were selected in this perspective,\n           randomized, open and control clinical trial, in which 262 and 130 patients served as\n           research and control groups respectively by 2:1. Patients 4-8 weeks after operation\n           were divided according to different high risk factors. A total of 4-week different\n           chemotherapies (21 d as a course) were given to patients with different pathological\n           patterns in research group, in which adeno-carcinoma group and non-adeno-carcinoma\n           group were treated by Pemetrexed plus Cis-platinum and Docetaxel plus Cis-platinum,\n           respectively. Then, above two groups were randomly divided into two subgroups\n           respectively by 1:1, with subgroup 1 being treated with original chemotherapies while\n           subgroup 2 being added with rh-Endostatin therapy.\n\n        -  High risk factors included poor differentiation (including neuro-endocrine carcinoma),\n           blood vessel invasion, wedge incision, tumor diameter \uff1e4 cm, visceral pleura\n           involvement, ambiguous N staging and incisal edge \uff1c1 cm."
