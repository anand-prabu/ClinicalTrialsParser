            "textblock": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains largely incurable despite advances that have been made\n      in recent years into increasing the complete response (CR) rates. In elderly patients (over\n      the age of 60), CR rates are lower, 40 to 50%, and long term disease-free and overall\n      survival is less than 10%. The therapeutic options for relapsed/refractory AML are\n      significantly limited. Bortezomib has shown promising activity in patients with advanced\n      hematologic malignancies, including those with leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n      Given the available data suggesting efficacy of bortezomib in combination with doxil in\n      patients with relapsed multiple myeloma (MM), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and Non\n      Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) as well as the known sensitivity of AML to anthracyclines and in\n      vitro data demonstrating the sensitivity of multiply resistant AML cells to bortezomib, we\n      are proposing the use of this combination in patients with relapsed/refractory AML or\n      elderly patients who are not candidates for standard induction therapy.\n\n      Using the subcutaneous formulation of bortezomib would provide patients with reduced\n      neurotoxicity and easier schedule due to decreased time in the infusion room and it would\n      decrease overall cost of care."
