    <textblock>
      This observational study will collect data about safety in female patients with advanced
      ovarian epithelial cancer with measurable residual disease after surger y. The treating
      physician has decided to treat the patients with Avastin (bevaci zumab) in combination with
      chemotherapy followed by Avastin monotherapy accordin g to the local label. Data will be
      collected for 72 weeks.
