This will cool the blood in the neck that goes to the brain causing the brain to become cool as well.  The collar is a standard neck collar used for patients after neck surgery with a modification that allows for the placement of a cooling pack in the collar that delivers the cold. The cooling pack is similar to, but not the same as, the cooling packs used for sports injuries.  The cooling packs will be changed every 20 minutes for the two-hour duration of the study.  During the study and for two hours after, we will collect data concerning the brain temperature, body temperature, brain oxygen level and pressure both in the head and in the blood (blood pressure)."

Moribund state where the physician team doesn't believe the patient will survive.\n\n          3. Patients who are being cared for with the intent of making them comfortable.

Known significant carotid artery stenosis (known >50% stenosis by history or\n             incidental hospital imaging).  This will not be specifically tested.
