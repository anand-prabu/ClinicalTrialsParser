            "textblock": "Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) results from autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing\n      pancreatic beta-cells. The onset of clinical symptoms represents the endpoint of a chronic\n      progressive decline in beta-cell function when the number of functional beta-cells descends\n      below the critical mass required for maintenance of euglycemia ([1], [2]). However, the\n      pancreas still retains the ability to produce a substantial amount of insulin. The goal of\n      secondary prevention in T1DM is to avert further destruction of the remaining beta-cells and\n      therefore delay or stop entry into the final stages of the disease associated with end organ\n      damage.\n\n      The rationale for this study is to interfere with the autoimmune beta-cell destruction early\n      on in order to preserve as much residual endogenous insulin production as possible. We plan\n      to administer oral interferon-alpha (IFN-a) on a daily basis, which has been shown to modify\n      the clinical course of diabetes, to alter cytokine release, and reduce expression of T cell\n      activation markers in an animal model ([3]) and a pilot project in humans (S. Brod,\n      University of Texas, unpublished data). The one-year study is designed as a double blind\n      randomized protocol using either 5,000 or 30,000 units of IFN-a versus placebo. Five centers\n      will participate in this protocol (University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston;\n      Dallas; Children's Hospital, St. Paul, MN; Kansas City and NIH, Bethesda, Maryland)."
