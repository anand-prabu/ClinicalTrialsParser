This study also presents a unique\n      opportunity to study both drug and disease mechanisms because unlike many other autoimmune\n      diseases in which rituximab has been used, MG affords the investigation of antigen-specific\n      components that participate in the immunopathology of the disease, namely autoantibodies,\n      autoantibody-producing B cells, and antigen-specific T cells. This work will further our\n      understanding of MG immunopathology and it represents the first step toward gaining a more\n      complete understanding of the immune mechanisms underlying treatment of MG with rituximab\n      leading to new ways to treat the disease.\n\n      The specific aim of this study is to determine whether rituximab is a safe and effective\n      treatment for subjects with MG."
