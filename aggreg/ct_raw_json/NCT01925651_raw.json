The target population\n           comprises patients with indication of post mastectomy radiation (PMRT).\n\n        -  The patients will be divided into two groups: one with high risk of recurrence in\n           subcutaneous, which will be randomized to use 0.5cm bolus every other day or on\n           consecutive days, and one low-risk group, which will be randomized to use bolus 0.5cm\n           on alternate days or do not use bolus. The group with high risk is defined as patients\n           with clinical or pathological tumor invasion of skin. The others will be considered low\n           risk.\n\n        -  Randomization will be made \u200b\u200bso that each group has the same proportion of patients\n           with high body mass index (> / = 30 kg/m2), as this may be a factor in worsening\n           radiodermatitis.\n\n        -  The patients will be followed during treatment and will be evaluated weekly for the\n           radiodermatitis, interruption time of treatment for recovery from the acute effects and\n           expenditures for local care. The evaluation will be done blindly (without knowledge of\n           the utilization of bolus) by trained nurses in the management of radiodermatitis."
