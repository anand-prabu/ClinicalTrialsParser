  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if TauroSept® taurolidine 2% is more efficient
      than saline solution 0.9% as a catheter lock solution in preventing catheter related blood
      stream infections in patients with home parenteral nutrition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Home Parenteral Nutrition has become a mainstay in the support of patients with chronic
      intestinal failure. It requires the presence of a central venous catheter to assure adequate
      venous access. Catheter Related BloodStream Infections (CRBSIs) are frequent. Most CRBSIs
      originate from contamination of the catheter hub and subsequent growth of microorganisms
      embedded within the biofilm that rapidly develops on the inner catheter surface. The best
      preventive measure against the development of CRBSIs is observation of strict hygiene
      guidelines when inserting and manipulating a central venous catheter and in addition to this
      the instillation of antimicrobial solutions like TauroSept® or saline solution 0.9% into the
      catheter lumen (antimicrobial lock). This measure is currently widely used in clinical
      practice.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Benign underlying disease leading to long-term intestinal failure who will receive
             HPN and/or fluids (saline and/or glucose) at least 2 times /week over a
             subcutaneously tunnelled single-lumen Central Venous Catheter (CVC)  (Hickman/Broviac
             or subcutaneous port) for at least one year

               1. Patient receives a new single lumen central vascular access device for HPN (new
                  patient starting HPN or patient already on HPN) allocation to Group I = new
                  catheter group] or

               2. Patient is already on HPN for ≥1 year prior to trial inclusion and has a CRBSI
                  rate (bacterial and/or yeast infections) of &gt;0.3/year and a catheter that has
                  been in place for ≥6 months (allocation to Group II = high risk group).
                  (Previous salvage of this catheter by line-lock antibiotics or other therapeutic
                  interventions is not an exclusion criterion as long as this has been performed
                  at least two months before enrolment in the trial)

          -  Estimated life expectancy ≥1 year

          -  Male or female patient aged 18 - 80 years

          -  Patient is fully able to understand the nature of the proposed intervention and gives
             written informed consent before entering the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  cannot be expected to comply with the trial plan (substance abuse, mental condition)

          -  has significant cardiovascular disease such as unstable angina, acute myocardial
             infarction or recent cerebral vascular accident (within 6 weeks); a cardiac rhythm
             which in the investigators judgment may result in significant hemodynamic effects

          -  has a known hypersensitivity/allergy to taurolidine 2% or saline solution 0.9% and/or
             their excipients.

          -  is pregnant, lactating, or nursing.

          -  has a current bloodstream infection

          -  has any clinically significant abnormalities in blood coagulation requiring
             intervention

          -  has received thrombolytic therapy in the 6 weeks prior to  insertion (aspirin 80-325
             mg daily is acceptable).

          -  has received an investigational drug within 30 days of trial entry

          -  has an antibiotic coated, silver impregnated or antimicrobial cuff catheter

          -  has received a Taurolidine lock previously

          -  has compromised skin integrity, including any infection at the insertion site

          -  has received parenteral or oral antibiotic therapy &lt;2months prior trial inclusion
