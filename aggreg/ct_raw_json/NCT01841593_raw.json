            "textblock": "The purpose of the study is to look at the levels of an HIV medication (raltegravir) in the\n      blood, and how it is affected if raltegravir is taken at the same time as another medicine\n      for high blood pressure (amlodipine). Many patients with HIV will also have high blood\n      pressure, so it is important to know which drugs for each of these conditions can be taken\n      together without affecting how well they work individually.\n\n      Over a 3 week period, subjects will take amlodipine for 2 weeks, and raltegravir for 2\n      weeks, with the middle week being on both drugs. The investigators will look at and compare\n      the levels of these two drugs in the blood after subjects have taken them separately and\n      both together.\n\n      The duration of involvement in the study will be up to 22 days plus a screening visit which\n      will take place up to 4 weeks prior to the start of the study, and a follow up visit which\n      takes place  7-14 days after the last dose of study medication.\n\n      This study is randomised (like flipping a coin) into two groups who will receive the same\n      study medications, but in a different order (this is known as a crossover study). The\n      subject and the study doctor will know which study medications you are taking at all times\n      during the study.\n\n      The subject will need to stay at the study centre all day (12-14 hours) on three occasions\n      during the study."
