A culturally\n      sensitive, lifestyle intervention program was administered via community peer educators to a\n      population of Native Hawaiians with or at risk for diabetes.  The effect of this\n      intervention program on selected outcomes is being compared to a ''standard'' program given\n      to a similar population in a second Native Hawaiian community."
