            "textblock": "Many types of cancer are primarily treated with surgery and patient survival is directly\n      related to the extent to which the tumor is able to be removed. It is often difficult for\n      surgeons to distinguish tumor tissue from normal tissue or to detect tumor cells that have\n      spread from the original tumor site, resulting in incomplete removal of the tumor and\n      reduced patient survival. In addition, in some sites, such as the brain, it is critical to\n      avoid damage to normal tissue around the tumor to prevent adverse effects of surgery on\n      function. We hypothesize that BLZ-100 will improve surgical outcomes by allowing surgeons to\n      visualize the edges of the tumor and small groups of cancer cells that have spread to other\n      sites in real-time, as they operate."
