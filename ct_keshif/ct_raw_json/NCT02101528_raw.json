Torque is the force rotating about an\n      axis and is produced and recorded from the angular motion. Consequently, the peak torque is\n      an index of the muscular strength. Isokinetic testing was introduced as a quantitative\n      measurement of both statistic and dynamic muscular contraction in which all variables\n      involved (resistance, limb velocity, joint position) are under control. This is because\n      isokinetic muscle testing allows objective, valid, and reliable measurement of the force\n      produced by skeletal muscle during exercise at constant velocity and accommodating\n      resistance and it is appropriate for measuring muscle strength and muscle endurance across\n      the disability spectrum.\n\n      Decreased muscle strength has been reported to be a factor contributing to increased\n      incidences of falling in the elderly patients  causing fractures, joint dislocations, severe\n      soft tissue lesions and head trauma.

To account for the influence of the gravity effect torque, data were corrected by the weight of the subject's lower limb at 45\u00b0. Subjects were tested at three fixed angular velocities: 90\u00b0/s, 120\u00b0/s, 180\u00b0/s. The subjects began each isokinetic contraction with the knee flexed at 90\u00b0 and continued through the full range of motion. Peaks torque were obtained from the maximum isokinetic tests and subsequently analyzed.",
