Patients were evaluated at\n      the baseline of the study (T0) as well as 1 (T1), 3 (T3) and 6 months (T6) after the\n      inclusion. The patients were assessed for: pain (VAS); functional capacity (Roland Morris),\n      patient satisfaction (Likert scale); and number of anti-inflammatory pills ingested.\n      Intention-to-treat analysis was also used.\n\n      Hypothesis - abdominal belt will improve pain in chronic low back pain patients"
