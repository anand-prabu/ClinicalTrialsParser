It is a major surgery that can lead to breakdown of proteins in the\n      body and a decreased immune response, both of which increase the risk of illness and death.\n      Poor nutrition status before RC surgery is linked to a higher rate of death after surgery.\n      Therefore, it is important to eat a balanced diet before and after RC surgery to avoid\n      negative outcomes.\n\n      Studies show that patients who drink a nutritional supplement that may enhance the immune\n      system before and after gastro-intestinal surgery may have fewer infections and shorter\n      hospital stays after surgery. Patients with cancer of the colon/rectum, stomach, and\n      pancreas who drank a similar immune-enhancing nutritional supplement before and after\n      surgery also had fewer infections.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to attain pilot data for a larger trial."
