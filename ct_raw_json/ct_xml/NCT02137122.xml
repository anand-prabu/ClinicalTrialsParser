      This study will investigate whether transcranial direct current stimulation enhances the
      effects of cognitive training in healthy older adults.

    <textblock>
      The current study will investigate methods for enhancing cognitive training effects in
      healthy older adults by employing a combination of interventions facilitating neural
      plasticity and optimizing readiness for learning. Adults over the age of 65 represent the
      fastest growing group in the US population. As such, age-related cognitive decline
      represents a major concern for public health. Recent research suggests that cognitive
      training in older adults can improve cognitive performance, with effects lasting up to 10
      years. However, these effects are typically limited to the tasks trained, with little
      transfer to other cognitive abilities or everyday skills. An adaptive pilot randomized
      clinical trial will examine the individual and combined impact of pairing cognitive training
      with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). tDCS is a method of non-invasive brain
      stimulation that directly stimulates brain regions involved in active cognitive function and
      enhances neural plasticity when paired with a training task. We will compare changes in
      cognitive and brain function resulting from CT and CT combined with tDCS using a
      comprehensive neurocognitive, clinical, and multimodal neuroimaging assessment of brain
      structure, function, and metabolic state.
