All patients who enter the study, and begin concurrent\n      chemo-radiation are analyzable for the primary endpoint of the study.\n\n      Assuming that dose-limiting toxicity is not encountered, and both the maximum dose of\n      Cabazitaxel is reached, in Part A of the study, and the maximum dose of Radiotherapy is\n      reached in Part B of the study, the maximum number of patients required is as follows:\n      Clinical Study Protocol - The JET study Date: September 11, 2012 Part A: 3 patients per\n      level x 5 levels, plus 3 patients (for a total of 6) at the highest dose level of\n      Cabazitaxel = 15 + 3 = 18 Part B: 3 patients per level x 3 levels, plus 3 patients (for a\n      total of 6) at the highest dose level of Radiotherapy = 9 + 3 = 12 The total number of\n      patients required is 30. Patients that do not complete concurrent chemotherapy,\n      radiotherapy, and androgen deprivation therapy, for reasons other than DLT will be replaced.\n\n      Given our experience in chemo-radiation studies in a similar patient population, our Centre\n      is anticipated to accrue 3 patients per month."
