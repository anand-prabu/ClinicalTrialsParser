    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the pain reduction rate after 8 weeks treatment of
      NORSPAN® from baseline.

      And secondary purpose are: pain reduction rate after 4 weeks treatment from baseline(week 0)
      the EQ-5D, the pain and sleep questionnaire, physician's overall satisfaction subject's
      overall satisfaction, and safety

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon providing written informed consent, subject will be screened in the study and
      assessment will be performed at that time such as safety laboratory assessments, physical
      examination, vital sign, medical history taking, 24 hours pain intensity score, EQ-5D, pain
      and sleep questionnaire, physician's overall satisfaction and subject's overall
      satisfaction.

      If patient is eligible in inclusion/exclusion criteria at the time of visit 1, the patient
      will receive treatment with NORSPAN®.

      Treatment with NORSPAN®  will be started from 5 μg/h (1 patch a week) for 2 weeks, and
      proper titration (up-titration) will be allowed at visit 2(wk 2) and at visit 3(wk 4)
      according to the investigator's decision.
