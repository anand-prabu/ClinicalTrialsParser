  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is the most common cause of hospitalization in older adults. The month
      after hospital discharge represents a vulnerable period, when patients are at increased risk
      of death and readmission to hospital. Research has shown that certain discharge-planning
      services can reduce death and readmissions, but these have not been widely implemented. In
      this study, we will group evidence-informed discharge-planning services into
      'Patient-centered Care Transitions in HF' (PACT-HF), a model of care that will prepare
      patients for their transition from hospital to home. Through PACT-HF, patients will benefit
      from a comprehensive assessment of their health care needs, learn to recognize and manage
      symptoms of HF, and receive the information and follow-up care needed to optimize their
      health. We will introduce PACT-HF to 16 Ontario hospitals over a number of time periods. We
      will compare the outcomes of patients in hospitals with PACT-HF to those in hospitals
      without PACT-HF. We anticipate that patients hospitalized at the sites with PACT-HF will
      have fewer readmissions, emergency visits, and deaths after discharge; report a better
      quality of life; and feel more prepared for discharge. We also anticipate that overall,
      PACT-HF will reduce health system costs.
