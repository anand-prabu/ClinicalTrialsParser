  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a range of
      single Intravenous (IV) and Subcutaneous (SC) doses of BG00010 in healthy volunteers, and a
      range of multiple subcutaneous (SC) doses of BG00010 in subjects with painful lumbar
      radiculopathy.

      Secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To determine the single IV and SC dose pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of BG00010 in
           healthy volunteers including assessment of    bioavailability by comparing subcutaneous
           (SC) exposure to IV exposure in each subject.

        -  To determine the multiple subcutaneous (SC) dose PK profiles of BG00010 in subjects
           with painful lumbar radiculopathy.

        -  To assess the single IV and subcutaneous (SC) dose immunogenicity of BG00010 in healthy
           volunteers.

        -  To assess the multiple SC dose immunogenicity of BG00010 in subjects with painful
           lumbar radiculopathy.

        -  To assess the potential of BG00010 to reduce pain following multiple SC administrations
           in subjects with painful lumbar radiculopathy.
