  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an inherited disorder of connective tissue with morbidity and
      mortality from aortic dilatation and dissection. The current standard of care is
      beta-blocker (BB) treatment and therapeutic target is heart rate. The degree of aortic
      dilatation and response to BB vary in adults with MFS. However, aortic stiffness is often
      present, and can be a predictor of aortic dilatation and cardiovascular complications.
      Aortic stiffness is a logical therapeutic target in adults with MFS.

      Transforming growth factor beta(TGF-beta) mediates disease pathogenesis in MFS and
      contributes to aortic stiffness. Cross-talk between TGF-beta system and renin-angiotensin
      system (RAS) has been demonstrated. The angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), losartan,
      inhibits TGF-beta activity and reverses aortic wall pathology in a Marfan mouse model. In a
      small cohort study, the use of ARB therapy (losartan or irbesartan) significantly slowed the
      rate of progressive aortic dilatation in patients with MFS, after BB therapy had failed to
      prevent aortic root dilatation. In another study, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor,
      perindopril, reduced both aortic stiffness and aortic root diameter in patients with MFS
      taking standard BB therapy. Renin inhibitor, aliskiren, has not been studied to reduce
      aortic stiffness and attenuate aortic dilatation in patients with MFS.

      This trial is a randomized, open-label  trial of 32 patients with Marfan syndrome, treated
      with 6 months of aliskiren vs. negative controls in patients with MFS under atenolol
      treatment. MRI for aortic pulsed wave velocity (PWV) and distensibility, measurements of
      central BP (CBP) and augmentation index (AIx) will be performed at the beginning and end of
      treatment. A blood drawn for serum markers of TGF-beta, extracellular matrix turnover and
      inflammation will also be performed at 0 and 6 months. We plan to determine whether
      aliskiren decreases aortic stiffness significantly more than negative controls in patients
      with MFS under atenolol treatment.
