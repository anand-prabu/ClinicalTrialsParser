It will investigate, on the one hand, the effect of\n      omega-3 fatty acids on renal function and, on the other, the effect of omega-3 fatty acids\n      on cardiovascular risk markers in renal transplant recipients.\n\n      8 weeks after transplantation, if renal function has stabilized,  patients with a eGFR>30\n      will be randomized to receive either 2,5 g of omega-3 fatty acids (3 capsules of Omacor a 1\n      g) daily or placebo. Baseline measurements will be performed before they start taking the\n      study medication. The same measurements will performed again1 year after transplantation and\n      the patients stops taking the study medication."
