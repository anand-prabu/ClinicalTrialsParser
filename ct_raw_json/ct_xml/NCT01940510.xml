  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single center, open-label, 3-period, fixed-sequence study will evaluate the effect of
      multiple oral doses of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of RO5424802
      in healthy volunteers. Subjects will receive a single dose of RO5424802 on Days 1 and 17 and
      rifampin daily from Days 8 to Day 20.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and female volunteers, 18 to 55 years of age inclusive. Healthy status
             will be defined by absence of evidence of any active or chronic disease following a
             detailed medical and surgical history, and a complete physical examination

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 18 to 32 kg/m2 inclusive

          -  Nonsmoking subjects and former smoking subjects (who have not smoked for the past six
             months before first dosing)

          -  Female subjects must be surgically sterile or postmenopausal for the past year

          -  Male subjects and their partners of childbearing potential must be willing to use two
             effective methods of contraception, one of which must be a barrier method (e.g.,
             condom) during the study and for 90 days after the last drug administration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of childbearing potential, pregnant or lactating women, or males with female
             partners who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Positive urine test for drugs of abuse, alcohol, or cotinine test at screening or
             prior to admission to the study unit

          -  Suspicion of regular consumption of drug(s) of abuse including marijuana

          -  Current smokers or subjects who have discontinued smoking less than six months prior
             to first dosing

          -  History (within three months of Screening) of alcohol consumption exceeding 2
             standard drinks per day on average (1 standard drink = 10 grams of alcohol). Alcohol
             consumption will be prohibited 72 hours prior to entry in the clinical site center
             and throughout the entire study (including the washout period) until discharge

          -  Positive for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV infection

          -  Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 45 days or 5
             half-lives (whichever time period is longer) or 6 months for biologic therapies prior
             to first dosing

          -  Any clinically significant concomitant disease or condition that could interfere
             with, or for which the treatment of might interfere with, the conduct of the study,
             absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of study medication, or that would,
             in the opinion of the PI, pose an unacceptable risk to the subject in this study

          -  History of hypersensitivity to any of the additives in the RO5424802 formulation
             (lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate,
             hydroxypropyl cellulose, sodium lauryl sulphate, magnesium stearate)

          -  Any history of hypersensitivity to or contraindication to the use of rifampin or
             other rifamycins or history of severe drug-related allergic reactions or hepatoxicity
