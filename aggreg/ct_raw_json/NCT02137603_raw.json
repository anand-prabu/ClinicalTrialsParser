There is no current evidence regarding the\n      application of same day discharge protocol in children with intra-operative findings of\n      suppurative appendicitis. The current standard of care for patients who present with\n      intra-operative findings of suppurative appendicitis includes post-operative admission and\n      treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Patients are discharged home once they have met the\n      following discharge criteria: temperature less than 38.5 degrees Celsius, pain control with\n      oral pain medication, and tolerating a liquid diet. Given the evidence in the literature\n      that has shown that same day discharge of patients with acute appendicitis is safe and\n      effective, we propose that fast track surgery protocol can be safely applied to patients\n      with intraoperative findings of suppurative appendicitis. We hypothesize that this will\n      result in a decreased postoperative length of stay, without an increase in 30-day\n      complication rate."
