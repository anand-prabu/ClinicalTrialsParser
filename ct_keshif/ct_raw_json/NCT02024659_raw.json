Visual analogue scales (VAS\uff09of nasal symptoms, endoscopic\n      polyp scores and morning serum cortical levels were assessed pre- and post-treatment. Polyp\n      samples were evaluated for inflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and\n      tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) by immunoassay; collagen by histochemistry;\n      and frequencies of different T cell subsets by flow cytometry. this study is undertaken to\n      evaluate the efficacy of short-term prescription of budesonide inhalation suspension via\n      transnasal nebulization by clinical and immunologic assessments. As outcome parameters for\n      remodeling, differences in the expression of collagen and albumin were investigated before\n      and after budesonide treatment. Meanwhile, TGF-\u03b2, MMPs and TIMPs expression differences in\n      nasal polyps were investigated to explore underlying mechanisms of tissue reconstitution."
