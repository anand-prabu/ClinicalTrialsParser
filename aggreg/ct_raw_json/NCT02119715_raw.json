Phase 1a, 1b trials\n      have shown that pegylated rhG-CSF has decreased renal clearance, increased plasma half-life,\n      and prolonged efficacy in compare with rhG-CSF. The purpose of this study is to determine\n      the safety and effectiveness of pegylated rhG-CSF in preventing neutropenia following\n      chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer."
