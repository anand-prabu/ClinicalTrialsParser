To achieve this goal the\n      investigators will examine the effectiveness and feasibility of home rehabilitation system\n      of upper limb, consisting of ergonomic accessories (hand and arm tutors).\n\n      The quantitative indices will be based on the quantitative clinical measures that are used\n      in regular evaluations of stroke patients and function and range of motion indices as\n      received from the system."
