    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multicenter, and single arm study to investigate the biodistribution and
      shedding of talimogene laherparepvec in subjects with unresected, stage IIIb to IVM1a
      melanoma.  Subjects will be treated with talimogene laherparepvec until the subject has
      achieved a complete response, all injectable tumors have disappeared, clinically relevant
      (resulting in clinical deterioration or requiring change of therapy) disease progression per
      modified World Health Organization (WHO) response criteria beyond 6 months of therapy, or
      intolerance of study treatement, whichever occurs first.

             infection (eg, herpetic keratitis or encephalitis), and/or requires intermittent or
             chronic systemic (intravenous or oral) treatment with an antiherpetic drug, other
             than intermittent topical use will also be excluded
