  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One-handed E-C clamp mask holding technique, two-handed mask ventilation with jaw thrust,
      and two-handed mask ventilation with triple airway maneuver are three common airway
      management maneuvers. Sniffing position may improve ventilation between these three
      maneuvers. The investigators hypothesize that ventilation efficiency may be different
      between these three maneuvers whether the patient is in sniffing position or neutral
      position. The investigators would like to quantify this effect by measuring the expired
      tidal volume, airway pressure, EtCO2 slope and hemodynamic change between these three
      maneuvers during anesthesia induction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mask ventilation is considered a important skill for airway management during general
      anesthesia induction and for apneic unconscious patients. One-handed E-C clamp mask holding
      technique, two-handed mask ventilation with jaw thrust, and two-handed mask ventilation with
      triple airway maneuver are three common airway management maneuvers. However, the efficiency
      of ventilation between these three maneuvers has to be clarified. Besides, whether sniffing
      position or neutral position may improve ventilation between these three maneuvers is to be
      determined. The investigators will collect airway parameters of the patients receiving
      general anesthesia and measure the expired tidal volume, airway pressure, EtCO2 slope and
      hemodynamic change between these three maneuvers during anesthesia induction.
