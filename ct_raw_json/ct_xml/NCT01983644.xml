  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endovascular therapy is increasingly used for patients with moderate-to-severe acute
      ischemic stroke.This study will compare the  efficacy and safety of RECO(a novel,
      self-expanding stent retriever) with the using of intravenous t-PA within 4.5 hours of
      stroke onset.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, intravenous tissue plasminogen activator within 4.5 hours of stroke onset is the
      only proven treatment for acute ischemic stroke. However, recanalization rate within 24
      hours after the administration of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator is low,
      especially when the occlusion site involves a large intracranial artery. The low
      recanalization rate has prompted the development of endovascular therapy.

      RECO is a novel, self-expanding stent retriever, designed to yield rapid flow restoration in
      acute cerebral ischaemia. The proposed study is a multicenter, randomized, prospective,
      parallel-group, open-label clinical trial with a blinded outcome, to test the new approach
      of endovascular thrombectomy, as compared with standard intravenous t-PA.
