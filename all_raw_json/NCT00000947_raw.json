This study also examines the possibility of\n      putting off MAC prevention treatment in patients who respond well to anti-HIV drug therapy.\n\n      Azithromycin is approved for the prevention of MAC disease in people with HIV and low CD4\n      cell counts.  However, some people who have taken azithromycin have been found to carry\n      antibiotic-resistant bacteria (germs that can grow despite the presence of drugs used to\n      kill them).  It is not known whether the risks associated with taking azithromycin outweigh\n      the risk of getting MAC disease."
