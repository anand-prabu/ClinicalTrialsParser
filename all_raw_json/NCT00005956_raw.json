The pulsed DC are administered subcutaneously (SQ) and intradermally,\n      followed by autologous DC mixed with tetanus toxoid (TT) and autologous DC mixed with\n      keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) SQ and intradermally on day 1. HLA-A2 positive patients also\n      receive autologous DC mixed with CMV pp65 peptide SQ and intradermally on day 1. Treatment\n      continues every 3 weeks for a total of 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year or until disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6 patients will be accrued for this study over 6 months."
