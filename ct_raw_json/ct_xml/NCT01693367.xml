  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of Dynamic Locking Screws (DLS)
      used to stabilize the shaft component of distal femur fractures in comparison to standard
      locking screws (SLS). The hypothesis is that DLS will lead to better functional outcomes
      (WOMAC score) due to increased and more symmetrical callus formation and fewer non-unions.

    <description>The TUG measures the time (in seconds) that it takes for an individual to rise from an armchair (chair seat height = 45 cm / 1.5 feet), walk 3 meters (= 10 feet) to a line drawn on the floor, turn around and return to the chair. The time is measured from a seated position (back against the backrest) with a stopwatch started on the command &quot;ready - go&quot; and stopped when the seated position is reached again.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  21 years and older

          -  Closed or open distal femur fracture (AO 33 A1-3, 33 C1-3) including distal femur
             fractures above a total knee arthroplasty

          -  Ability to walk independently prior to injury

          -  Eligible for treatment with ORIF of the distal femur with a large fragment locking
             plate (LISS, LCP)

          -  Willing and able to comply with post-operative protocol and return for follow-up.

          -  Ability to understand the content of the patient information / informed consent form
             and participate in the clinical investigation

          -  Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Additional ipsi- or contralateral lower extremity fracture

          -  Any kind of implant at the ipsilateral proximal femur

          -  Pre-existing malunion or nonunion of the ipsilateral lower extremity

          -  Segmental bone defect requiring bone grafting

          -  More than 4 weeks between injury and surgery

          -  Pathologic fracture due to a disease other than osteoporosis (eg, tumor, metastasis)

          -  Polytrauma

          -  Active malignancy

          -  Any not medically managed severe systemic disease

          -  Recent history of substance abuse (ie, recreational drugs, alcohol) that would
             preclude reliable assessment
