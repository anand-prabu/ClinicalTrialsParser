            "textblock": "Medical education involves the acquisition of a large quantity of information. Lecture-based\n      learning (LBL) is the best known of conventional teaching methods. The main purpose of a\n      lecture is knowledge transfer [1] and its great advantage is that of transferring knowledge\n      from one individual to several or many. Knowledge transfer via LBL is still widely used in\n      international medical congresses, in continuing medical education online via downloading of\n      lectures offered by leading medical schools, and in postgraduate medical education in\n      several countries. We showed that in prospective study of 13 lectures that two thirds of\n      critical care junior doctors identified at best only one of the three main take-home\n      messages of a lecture, suggesting that knowledge transfer is poor during passive format\n      learning.\n\n      In this study, we assess the impact of an intervention including the identification of\n      take-home message of lecture with slides calling \"Learning Objectives\", \"Message\",\n      \"Conclusion\", in the identification of take-home message in critical care junior doctors.\n\n      6 lectures are performed by professor without specific orders. 6 lectures are performed by\n      professor with the intervention. Both groups of professors do not know this study The\n      critical care juniors do not know the intervention. We compare the take-home messages of\n      students with those of lecturer, 1 month after the lecture."
