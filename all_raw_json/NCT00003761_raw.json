Determine the toxicity associated with repeated vaccination with recombinant\n      vaccinia DF3/MUC1 vaccine (rV-DF3/MUC1) in patients with metastatic breast cancer. II.\n      Determine the maximum tolerated dose of rV-DF3/MUC1, based on cellular and humoral immunity,\n      in these patients. III. Determine whether vaccination with rV-DF3/MUC1 is associated with\n      antitumor activity in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study. Patients receive recombinant vaccinia\n      DF3/MUC1 vaccine (rV-DF3/MUC1) intradermally. Treatment repeats every month for 3 courses in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of at least 6 patients\n      receive escalating doses of rV-DF3/MUC1 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the\n      highest dose level to be tested is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at\n      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed monthly for 6\n      months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-28 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2\n      years."
