They\n      hypothesized that previously reported contradictory results regarding the equivalence of\n      SmvO2 and rScO2 might be related to time delay issues and to the measurement technology.\n\n      42 consenting patients undergoing elective off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting were\n      included. 4 disposable oxygenation sensors were applied bilaterally on the patient's\n      forehead for continuous, non-invasive registration of rScO2. The sensors of one monitor were\n      placed just above the eyebrows, and the sensors of the other monitor were placed just above\n      the former sensors. The sensors placement was determined at random by a computerized\n      randomization list. SmvO2 was measured continuously via a pulmonary artery catheter. All\n      variables were recorded continuously.   The study ended at the end of the operation."
