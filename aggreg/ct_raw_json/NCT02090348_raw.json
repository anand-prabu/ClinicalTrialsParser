The secondary\n      objectives of this study are as follows: To describe variation from baseline in fatigue\n      scores effects on motor and cognitive function or Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive\n      Functions (FSMC) and fatigue severity (Fatigue Severity Scale [FSS]) at 1, 3, and 6 months\n      in participants receiving standard of care (SOC) treatment; To investigate changes from\n      baseline in fatigue effects on motor and cognitive function (FSMC) and fatigue severity\n      (Fatigue Severity Scale [FSS]) at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months in participants receiving\n      BG00012; To assess the impact of BG00012 on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including work\n      productivity (Work Productivity and Activity Impairment-Multiple Sclerosis questionnaire\n      [WPAI-MS]), health-related quality of life (Short Form Health Survey [SF-12] or the\n      15-dimensional health-related quality of life [15D HRQoL] questionnaire), depression (Beck\n      Depression Inventory-Fast Screen [BDI-FS]), and sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS])\n      at 6 and 12 months in participants receiving BG00012;  To examine whether an association\n      exists between fatigue and baseline demographics and disease characteristics (e.g., age,\n      sex, disease duration, baseline disease activity, treatment history, expanded disability\n      status scale [EDSS] score, and PROs);  and To assess any changes in fatigue-related\n      medication use."
