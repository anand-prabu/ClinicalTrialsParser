Our hypothesis is that\n      hyperbaric levobupivacaine will provide equal block quality, but better haemodynamic\n      conditions compared to hyperbaric bupivacaine."

Patients with contraindications to regional anesthesia, known\n      allergy, suffering from pregnancy induced hypertension or placenta previa will be  excluded\n      from the study.\n\n      Patients will not be premedicated.  After routine monitorization , IV access and fluid\n      replacement patients will be separated to two groups on a randomised manner.  Under sterile\n      conditions spinal anesthesia will be performed in the sitting position at the level  L3-4 or\n      L 4-5 via epidural-spinal combined including a 27 G spinal needle.\n\n      Group 1 will receive  8 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine plus 20 mcg fentanyl /2ml intrathecally.\n\n      Group 2 will receive 8 mg hyperbaric levobupivacaine plus 20 mcg fentanyl/2ml intrathecally.\n\n      The Hyperbaric form of Levobupivacaine is not available on market , so it will be prepared\n      with the addition of  % 30 dextrose  by another anesthesiologist who will be blinded to the\n      patients.\n\n      Preparation: 2 ml  of  %0,75 levobupivacaine + 0,8 mL %30 dextrose + 0,2 mL of  saline will\n      be mixed. So it will contain  5 mg levobupivacaine and %8 dextrose per ml.\n\n      Hypotension will be defined as a decrease in blood pressure more than % 30 percent of the\n      basal measured systolic arterial pressure. Hypotension will be treated with 250 ml fast\n      saline infusion and if no response with 5 mg of ephedrine IV. A heart rate under 50\n      beats/min will be defined as bradycardia and will be treated with 0.5 mg atropine i.v..  If\n      the anesthesia is not sufficient 10 ml of % 0.25 levobupivacaine wil be administered through\n      the  epidural catheter. The level of  sensory and motor block will be evaluated and recorded\n      every 3 minutes at the beginning and after 15 minutes it will be checked every 5 minutes\n      until the end of surgery. Maximum level of sensory block, time to reach T4 dermatome and\n      time to regression of 2 segments will be recorded.  Nausea-vomiting, pruritus and shivering\n      will also be recorded.  Baby delivery time, which will be defined as the time from spinal\n      medication to clamping of the umbilical cord will also be recorded. Total time of surgery\n      will also be recorded. The time for the first analgesic requirement will be noticed as well.\n      Patient and surgeon satisfaction will also be evaluated."
