    <textblock>
      The proposed phase IIb randomized, open label, dose ranging, safety and immunogenicity study
      will evaluate two different doses of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in two
      groups of participants (55  through 74 years of age). First group vaccine naïve participants
      will be open-label to receive a single injection of 0.5 mL PCV13. Second group of
      participant previously vaccinated with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine
      (PPSV23) will be randomized 1:1 to receive two injections of 0.5 mL PCV13, one dose in each
      arm (Group IIA or Group IIB). Blood samples will be obtained at baseline, at one month and
      six months post-vaccination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IIb open-label immunogenicity and safety study to evaluate dosages of 0.5 mL
      and 1.0 mL (given as two 0.5 mL injections in separate arms) of PCV13 in adults 55 through
      74 years of age previously vaccinated with PPSV23. The study will enroll two groups of
      participants. Group I participants will all receive an open-label dose of 0.5 mL PCV13 and
      will include 294 adults 55-74 years of age who have not previously received 23-valent
      pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23). Group II will be randomized 1:1 to receive 0.5
      mL PCV13 (Group IIA) or 0.5 mL PCV13 in the right arm and 0.5 mL PCV 13 in the left arm
      (Group IIB). Group II will include 588 adults 55 through 74 years of age who previously
      received a single dose of PPSV23 &gt;/=3 years and &lt;/=7 years prior to enrollment. Enrollment
      in both groups will be stratified by age group (55 through 64 years and 65 through 74
      years).The study duration is approximately 18 months. The primary objectives are: to
      determine if two 0.5 mL doses of PCV13 are statistically significantly more immunogenic than
      a single 0.5 mL dose of PCV13 for at least some of the vaccine serotypes among participants
      55 through 74 years of age previously vaccinated with PPSV23, as measured by
      serotype-specific OPA titers 28 days after study vaccination, and is non-inferior to 12
      vaccine serotypes; and determine if two 0.5 mL doses of PCV13 administered to participants
      previously vaccinated with PPSV23 are non-inferior to a single dose of 0.5 mL of PCV13
      administered to vaccine-naïve adults 55 through 74 years of age for the 12 vaccine
      serotypes, as measured by serotype-specific OPA titers 28 days after study vaccination.

             any live vaccine within 30 days prior to enrollment.

          3. Receipt of an allergy desensitization injection within 14 days prior to enrollment or
             planned receipt of an allergy desensitization injection within 7 days following
             enrollment.

             therapy within the preceding 36 months, or receiving treatment with immunosuppressive
             therapy, including systemic corticosteroids, e.g., for cancer, HIV or autoimmune
             disease. If any systemic (oral, parenteral) corticosteroids have been administered
             for treatment of acute illness within 30 days of vaccination, and any long term use
             (&gt;2 weeks) in the 30 through 59 days before vaccination should be excluded. (Topical,
             intranasal, and inhaled corticosteroids are allowed.)

          6. Serious chronic disorders including active or metastatic malignancy, hematologic
             malignancy, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or clinically significant

             visit and prior to vaccination.

         13. Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 170 mm Hg as measured at
             the enrollment visit and prior to vaccination.

         14. Diastolic blood pressure greater than 110 mm Hg as measured at the enrollment visit
             and prior to vaccination.

         15. For Group I, unable to receive a vaccination in the deltoid muscle of the right arm
             and unable to receive a vaccination in the deltoid muscle of the left arm because of
             insufficient muscle mass, need to avoid injections due to prior lymph node dissection
             or radiation, or other factor. For Group II, unable to receive a vaccination in the
             deltoid muscle of one or both arms because of insufficient muscle mass, need to avoid
             injections due to prior lymph node dissection or radiation, or other factor.

         16. Currently on anticoagulant therapy (for example, warfarin, heparin [IV or SQ], or
             dabigatran) or a history of bleeding diathesis that would contraindicate
             intramuscular injection. (Aspirin, clopidogrel, dipyridamole, and nonsteroidal
             anti-inflammatory agents are allowed).

         17. Known clinically significant allergic reaction to prior pneumococcal vaccination (for
             Group II participants) or to a component of PCV13 vaccine (PCV13 is latex free).

         18. Current known abuse of alcohol or drug addiction that in the opinion of the
             Investigator may interfere with the subject's ability to comply with trial
             procedures.

         19. Receipt of any other investigational vaccine or agent within one month before
             enrollment or intent to receive any other investigational vaccine or agent prior to
             the conclusion of the study.

         20. Any medical condition that would, in the opinion of the investigator, place the
             participant at an unacceptable risk of an adverse event or interfere with the
             evaluation of the study objectives.
