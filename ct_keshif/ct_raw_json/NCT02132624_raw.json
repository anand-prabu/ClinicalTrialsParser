Autologous T cells will be gene engineered with the CAR gene using a retrovirus\n      vector. Prior to T cell infusion, the patients will be subjected to preconditioning\n      treatment. After T cell infusion, the patients will be evaluated for 24 months for adverse\n      reactions, persistence of CAR T cells and efficacy."
