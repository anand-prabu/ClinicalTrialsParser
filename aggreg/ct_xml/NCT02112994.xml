  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of sebelipase alfa in a broad population of
      patients with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LALD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of intravenous infusions of
      sebelipase alfa in a more broad population of LALD patients than previously studied.   Such
      patients may have been excluded from enrollment in other studies of LALD because of age,
      disease progression, previous treatment by hematopoietic stem cell or liver transplantation,
      less common disease manifestations, or disease characteristics that would preclude
      participation in a placebo-controlled study. This open-label study will include infants &gt;8
      months, children and adults. Eligible patients will receive sebelipase alfa at a dose of 1
      mg/kg every other week.

          1. Patient will be &gt; 8 months of age at the time of dosing.

          2. Confirmation of LALD diagnosis as determined by the central lab.

          3. Patients &gt; 8 months but &lt; 4 years of age at Screening will have at least 1 of the
             following documented clinical manifestations of LALD:

             Dyslipidemia

               -  Elevated transaminases (ALT ≥1.5x ULN)

               -  Impaired growth

               -  Suspected malabsorption

               -  Other clinical manifestation of LALD

          4. Patients ≥ 4 years of age at Screening will have at least 1 of the following
             documented clinical manifestations of LALD:

               -  Evidence of advanced liver disease

               -  Histologically confirmed disease recurrence in patients with past liver or
                  hematopoietic transplant

               -  Persistent dyslipidemia

               -  Suspected malabsorption

               -  Other clinical manifestation of LALD

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has known causes of active liver disease other than LALD which have not been
             adequately treated.

          2. Patient received a hematopoietic stem cell or liver transplant &lt;2 years from the time
             of dosing.

             irreversible or associated with a high mortality risk within 6 months, or would
             interfere with study compliance or data interpretation.
