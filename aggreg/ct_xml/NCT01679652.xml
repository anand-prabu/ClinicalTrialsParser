      Investigators want investigate the following hypothesis:

        1. Nebivolol increases nitric oxide activity in the systemic circulation and the kidney

        2. The increased activity of nitric oxide during nebivolol treatment can be demonstrated
           by inhibition of NO synthesis with L-NMMA. We expect increased responses in blood
           pressure and sodium excretion is expected during nebivolol treatment compared to
           placebo.

      Beta-blockers are no longer recommended as first line treatment in essential hypertension.
      Evidence mainly based on clinical trails with the non-vasodilating beta-blockers atenolol
      and propanolol points towards that beta-blockers have an increased risk of stroke compared
      to ACE-inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and thiazides. However, this Nebivolol is a
      third generation beta-blocker with vasodilating properties. Nebivolol decreases peripheral
      blood pressure to the same extend as other beta-blockers but in contrast to atenolol
      nebivolol also reduces central blood pressure. Furthermore nebivolol increases nitric oxide
      (NO) availability in forearm vessels, maybe through activation of beta-3 receptors. The
      nitric oxide system plays a central role in both renal sodium and water handling and
      regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure. It has not been investigated if nebivolol
      changes NO availability in the kidney.

      Investigators want investigate the following hypothesis:

        1. Nebivolol increases nitric oxide activity in the systemic circulation and the kidney

        2. The increased activity of nitric oxide during nebivolol treatment can be demonstrated
           by inhibition of NO synthesis with L-NMMA. Investigators expect increased responses in
           blood pressure and sodium excretion is expected during nebivolol treatment compared to
           placebo.

      Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of nebivolol on renal
      handling of sodium and water (Glomerular filtration rate, urine production, free water
      clearance, excretion of proteins from epithelial sodium channels (u-ENaCαβγ) and aquaporin
      channels (u-AQP2) and sodium and potassium excretion), plasma concentrations of vasoactive
      hormones (renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, vasopressin, atrial natriuretic peptide, brain
      natriuretic peptide and endothelin), central blood pressure, pulse wave velocity (PWV) and
      augmentation index, under basal conditions and during inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis
      in patients with essential hypertension.

      Design 25 patients with essential hypertension are recruited in this randomised, cross over,
      placebo-controlled, double blinded study with two treatment periods (nebivolol/placebo).
      Each subject will attend to two examination days. Four days prior to each examination days
      and on the morning of each examination day subjects are given either nebivolol 5 mg pr. day
      or placebo. During treatment periods subject are given a standardized diet. On the
      examination days subject are given L-NMMA, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, and renal
      function, central hemodynamic and vasoactive hormones are evaluated during basal conditions
      and during inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis.

      Perspectives This study is expected to contribute to increasing the knowledge about the
      mechanisms involved in the development and progression of cardiovascular disease.
      Beta-blockers are not recommended as first line treatment in essential hypertension but the
      results from this study may influence clinical treatment of essential hypertension in the
      future.
