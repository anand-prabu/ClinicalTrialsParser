            "textblock": "Cardiovascular disease (disease of the heart and blood vessels) is one of the leading causes\n      of death in Canada. It also carries a financial burden on the Canadian economy with a yearly\n      cost close to $21 billion divided between loss of productivity and healthcare costs. The\n      majority of cardiovascular disease cases (90%) are caused by factors that can be controlled\n      and modified. These factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes (high\n      blood sugar), tobacco smoking, unhealthy diet, obesity, physical inactivity and high alcohol\n      consumption. Such factors are very common and not very well controlled and so individuals\n      who have any of these factors would be at risk of having cardiovascular disease. As such\n      controlling these factors will reduce the risk of having cardiovascular disease and improve\n      the individuals' quality of life. Pharmacists frequently work with patients and their family\n      doctor to provide cardiovascular care. Having a pharmacist involved in cardiovascular care\n      may help patients with cardiovascular disease or at risk of having the disease because they\n      are more accessible and may have more opportunities to educate people about cardiovascular\n      medications. This might lead to better prevention and control of cardiovascular disease.\n\n      Purpose:\n\n      The research study will assess if a community pharmacy cardiovascular risk reduction\n      intervention can help reduce cardiovascular risk.\n\n      Procedure:\n\n      If the individual has an elevated blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, waist\n      circumference or body weight or is physically inactive, have an unhealthy diet, a smoker or\n      taking medications for any of the previously mentioned conditions, the pharmacist will\n      assess the cardiovascular disease risk [risk of having a cardiovascular event (e.g. heart\n      attack or a stroke)] using a computer program. If the individual is at high risk s/he will\n      be asked to take part in the study.\n\n      If the individual agrees to take part in the study s/he will be randomly assigned to either\n      the Usual Care Group or the Advanced Care Group. All participants have an equal chance of\n      being assigned to either group. If assigned to the Usual Care Group, the individual will\n      receive the care and services that would normally be provided by the pharmacist. At 3\n      months, the pharmacist will see the individual who will be offered the Advanced Care at that\n      time.\n\n      If assigned to the to Advanced Care Group, the individual will be asked to meet with the\n      pharmacist every 3-4 weeks over a 3 month period. During these meetings, the pharmacist will\n      conduct an assessment that may include blood pressure, waist circumference, height and\n      weight measurements and talk to the individual about their cardiovascular risk and\n      medications. The individual and the pharmacist will come up with a plan for how to try to\n      lower his/her cardiovascular risk. The pharmacist will discuss this plan with their family\n      doctor. The individual will be asked to conduct some laboratory tests before the 3 months\n      visit; these tests may include HbA1c (a blood test to measure blood sugar control over the\n      last 3 months) and cholesterol to assess the effect of the intervention on cardiovascular\n      risk."

            "textblock": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide accounting for nearly\n      one third of the total deaths. The majority (90%) of the CVD cases are caused by modifiable\n      risk factors. These factors include tobacco smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes,\n      physical inactivity, high fat diet and obesity.\n\n      In Canada CVD rates have decreased drastically over the last few decades, yet it is still\n      one of the leading causes of death. It also carries a financial burden on the Canadian\n      economy with a cost close to $ 21 billion every year divided between loss of productivity\n      and healthcare costs.\n\n      Despite the risks associated with the major CVD risk factors and the treatment advancement,\n      their prevalence is still substantial in North America. Treatment gaps were also reported\n      amongst such factors. Al Hamarneh and colleagues (2012) reported that almost 50% of the\n      community dwelling patients with type 2 diabetes were not at their HbA1c target. Leiter and\n      colleagues (2013) reported that almost half of the patients with type 2 diabetes did not\n      achieve their HbA1c or cholesterol target, slightly more than one third achieved their blood\n      pressure targets and only 13% achieved the composite triple target.\n\n      The guidelines recommend using cardiovascular risk assessment equations to guide CVD\n      prevention and management. Despite being recommended by the guidelines, it has not been\n      integrated in the clinicians' daily routine; in fact the majority of the patients attending\n      physicians' clinics reported that they have never had a cardiovascular risk assessment. This\n      indicates the need for new avenues for the patients to get their cardiovascular risk\n      assessed.\n\n      Community pharmacists are front-line primary healthcare professionals who see patients with\n      chronic diseases more frequently than family physicians; as such, they are well positioned\n      to identify patients at high risk for CVD, determine their CVD risk and assist in their\n      disease management. The efficacy of pharmacists' intervention in chronic disease has been\n      well demonstrated in the literature. Two of the largest randomized controlled trials in\n      community pharmacy setting were conducted by our group. Both studies reported positive\n      impact of the pharmacist intervention on the patients' lipid panel and blood pressure.\n\n      Objectives\n\n      Primary objective\n\n      To evaluate the effect of a community pharmacy-based case finding and intervention program\n      in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events on reduction in estimated risk for major\n      cardiovascular events.\n\n      Secondary objectives\n\n      Clinical:\n\n        -  Improvements in individual risk factors: LDL-cholesterol, blood pressure, HbA1c (among\n           patients with diabetes), and smoking cessation\n\n        -  Achievement of recommended cholesterol, blood pressure and glycemic control targets\n\n        -  Increase in proportion of patients receiving appropriate BP, cholesterol and diabetes\n           medication\n\n      Process:\n\n        -  Increase in number of high risk patients screened for cardiovascular risk\n\n        -  Assess the efficacy of various case-finding mechanisms and vulnerable patient\n           population reach\n\n        -  Assure sustainability by exploring enabling and barrier forces.\n\n        -  Quality of life (EQ5D)\n\n      Methods\n\n      Design: Randomized controlled trial with patients as the unit of randomization\n\n      Setting: Community pharmacists in Alberta for recruitment and follow up, engaging both\n      patients and family physicians\n\n      Patients/Population:\n\n      Inclusion criteria:\n\n      Adults (\u226518 years of age) at high risk for cardiovascular events, including:\n\n        -  Patients with diabetes\n\n        -  Patients with chronic kidney disease (eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73m2)\n\n        -  Patients with established atherosclerotic vascular disease including cerebrovascular\n           disease (prior stroke or transient ischemic attack), cardiovascular disease (myocardial\n           infarction, acute coronary syndrome, stable angina, or revascularization), or\n           peripheral arterial disease (symptomatic and/or ankle brachial index <0.9).\n\n        -  Primary prevention patients with multiple risk factors and Framingham risk score >20%\n\n        -  In order to qualify for inclusion, all patients must have at least one uncontrolled\n           risk factor (i.e., blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, HbA1c, or current smokers.\n\n      Exclusion criteria:\n\n        -  Unwilling to participate/sign consent form\n\n        -  Unwilling or unable to participate in regular follow-up visits\n\n        -  Pregnancy\n\n      Recruitment:\n\n      Pharmacists and pharmacy staff are going to use the following methods to recruit patients in\n      the study:\n\n      \u00b7       Proactive recruitment by case-finding facilitators (trained pharmacy technicians,\n      assistants or pharmacy/medical/nursing students who focus on target prescriptions for oral\n      hypoglycemic, anti-hypertensive and lipid lowering medications). Pharmacists will check the\n      most recent lab results for those patients in the course of routine care. If the patient has\n      not had an eGFR or proteinuria test done over the last 12 months he/she will be given a\n      request to do those tests with a copy sent to his/her family physician.\n\n      If the Patient meets the inclusion criteria for the study the patient will be asked if\n      he/she wants to participate in the study. If the patient agrees on participating he/she will\n      be asked to sign a written informed consent form. After signing the consent form the patient\n      will be enrolled in the study.\n\n      The patient's family physician is going to receive a letter from the pharmacist to inform\n      him/her that his/her patient agreed to participate in this study.\n\n      Randomization:\n\n      Once informed written consent is obtained, the patients will be randomized (via a\n      centralized secure website to ensure allocation concealment) in a 1:1 ratio to either\n      advanced care or usual care groups\n\n      Intervention:\n\n      For all the patients randomized to the advanced care group the pharmacist will complete a\n      Comprehensive Annual Care Plan (CACP) or Standard Medication Management Assessment (SMMA),\n      which will include:\n\n        -  Patient assessment (blood pressure measurement according to CHEP guidelines, waist\n           circumference, weight and height measurements)\n\n        -  Laboratory assessment of HbA1c and lipids (if not done within 3 months)\n\n        -  Individual assessment of CVD risk and education about this risk\n\n             -  Calculation of cardiovascular risk will be facilitated by an online tool in which\n                the pharmacist enters patient demographics such as age, gender, cholesterol, blood\n                pressure, smoking status, diabetes, etc and the system will use the appropriate\n                risk engine based on the patient's medical history. UKPDS, International model to\n                predict recurrent cardiovascular disease and Framingham will be used for patients\n                with diabetes, previous vascular disease, CKD or high Framingham risk (>20%)\n                respectively (see appendix for risk engines score sheets). In the case where a\n                patient has more than one co-morbidity the risk engine estimating the highest risk\n                will be used\n\n             -  Discussion of CVD risk with the patient using the interactive online tool which\n                explains his/her individual cardiovascular risk and targets for intervention\n\n             -  Proving the patient with education on cardiovascular risk factors and healthy\n                lifestyle options\n\n        -  Providing treatment recommendations (C-CHANGE and up to date Canadian clinical practice\n           guidelines)\n\n        -  Prescription adaptation(s), and/or prescribe where necessary to meet lipid, blood\n           pressure and glycemic control targets and smoking cessation.\n\n        -  Regular communication with the patient's family physician after each contact with the\n           patient using the physician contact form which will be developed by the research team\n\n        -  Regular follow-up with all patients a minimum of every 3-4 weeks for 3 months (Interim\n           telephone follow-up may be performed at the discretion of the pharmacist; however\n           telephone follow-up cannot be used for 2 consecutive visits or for the final visit (3\n           months).\n\n      Usual care:\n\n      Patients randomized to the usual care group will receive:\n\n        -  Usual pharmacy care with no specific interventions for 3 months\n\n        -  At the end of the 3 months of the usual care period, all patients will cross over to\n           receive the advanced care outlined above for 3 months\n\n      The analysis of the results from patients who cross over from the usual care group into the\n      advanced care group will be conducted separately on before and after design basis."
