The aim of the study is to compare the clinical\n      efficacy of two ophthalmic solutions containing each one an antihistaminic drug.\n\n      A phase III randomized double-blind clinical trial will be conducted to evaluate efficacy of\n      the ophthalmic solution PRO-118 compared with olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution\n      in allergic conjunctivitis. Patients will be randomized to receive one of the treatments for\n      21 days. Efficacy endpoints will be measured at baseline and at 21 days after treatment."
