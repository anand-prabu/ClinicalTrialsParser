  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, two way cross-over, 12 weeks
      noninferiority study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of FSC 250/50 mcg
      capsule-based inhaler and a multi-dose inhaler administered BID in adults with COPD. The
      primary objective of this study is to establish the non-inferiority of the efficacy of the
      FSC 250/50 mcg capsule-based inhaler compared to the FSC 250/50 mcg multi-dose inhaler
      administered BID. The study consists of 6 phases: Pre-screening, Screening/Run-in (3 weeks),
      Treatment Period 1 (12 weeks), Washout (minimum 4 weeks), Treatment Period 2 (12 weeks) and
      Follow-up (1 week). The total duration of the study for each subject will be at least 32
      weeks.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The TDI focal score is a sum of 3 components: functional impairment, magnitude of task, and magnitude of effort.

    <description>The SGRQ-C is a COPD-specific questionnaire that produces scores for symptoms, activity, and impact. The SGRQ-C is a 40-item COPD-specific questionnaire designed to measure the effect of COPD and its treatment on the subject's health-related QoL. The SGRQ-C ranges from 0 (no impairment of QoL) to 100 (highest impairment of QoL)</description>

    <description>The CAT is an 8-item questionnaire. There are 6 possible answers to each question, which are associated with a score of 0 to 5. The scores from each question are summed to give an overall score. It is a subject-completed instrument designed to provide a simple and reliable measure of health status in COPD for the assessment and long-term follow-up of individual subjects.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female &gt;=40 and &lt;=80 years of age at the time of signing the informed
             consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

        Non-childbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal
        ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea
        (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone &gt;40
        milli international unit per milliliter (mIU/mL) and oestradiol &lt;40 picogram [pg]/mL [&lt;147
        picomole per liter (pmol/L)] is confirmatory); females on hormone replacement therapy
        (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the
        contraception methods (i.e., in accordance with the approved product label and the
        instructions of the physician for the duration of the study from Screening to follow-up
        contact) if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must
        discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrolment. For
        most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks should elapse between the cessation of therapy
        and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. After
        confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study
        without use of a contraceptive method; child-bearing potential and is abstinent or agrees
        to use one of the contraception methods for an appropriate period of time (as determined
        by the product label or investigator) before the start of dosing to sufficiently minimise
        the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until
        at least 2 days post the last dose of study treatment; abstinence from penile-vaginal
        intercourse must be consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.

          -  COPD Diagnosis: An established clinical history of COPD in accordance with the
             following definition by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society.

          -  Severity of Disease:

        &lt;0.70 at Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit) A measured pre-salbutamol/albuterol FEV1
        &lt;50% of predicted normal values at Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit).

        A measured post-salbutamol/albuterol FEV1 &gt;=30% of predicted normal values at Visit 1

          -  Tobacco Use:  Current or prior history of at least 10 pack-years of cigarette smoking
             (e.g., 20 cigarettes/day for 10 years). One pack-year is defined as 20 manufactured

             who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in
             Visit). Former smokers are eligible to enter the study provided they have at least 10
             pack-years smoking history. Subjects making a conscious decision to stop smoking at
             any time during the study and who refrain from smoking for &gt;4 weeks will be
             discontinued from the study. Additionally, subjects who start smoking during the

             (ULN), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;=1.5 ULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5 ULN is
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin is &lt;35%) at Visit 1
             (Screening and Run-in Visit)

          -  Electrocardiogram (ECG) Safety Criteria: The subject must have no ECG abnormalities
             that would, in the opinion of investigator, compromise subject safety, or
             significantly affect subject's ability to complete the trial. As such the
             investigator will determine the clinical significance of any ECG abnormality and
             determine if a subject is precluded from entering the study. At Visit 1 (Screening
             and Run-in Visit), ECG safety criteria must be:

        QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) or QT interval corrected for heart rate
        according to Fridericia formula (QTcF) &lt;450 milliseconds (msec) or QTc &lt;480 msec for
        subjects with a bundle branch block. Investigators will be responsible for ensuring
        appropriate clinical interpretation of ECGs

          -  Able to use the inhaler devices adequately after training

          -  Capable of giving informed consent, which includes compliance with the study
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

             neuromuscular, hepatic, gastric, or haematological abnormalities, or peripheral
             vascular disease. Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk or would affect the
             efficacy analysis if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study

          -  A respiratory diagnosis other than COPD (e.g., lung cancer, bronchiectasis,
             sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, lung fibrosis), including subjects with a diagnosis of
             alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. Allergic rhinitis is not exclusionary

          -  An abnormal and clinically significant chest X-ray film or computed tomography scan

             bilevel positive airway pressure)

          -  Oropharyngeal Examination: A subject will not be eligible for the Run-in Period if
             he/she has clinical visual evidence of candidiasis at Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in

          -  An abnormal and clinically significant 12-lead ECG result. For the purposes of this
             study, an abnormal ECG result is defined as a 12-lead tracing that is interpreted as
             demonstrating (but not limited to) any of the following: Myocardial ischemia,
             clinically significant conduction abnormalities (e.g., left bundle branch block,
             Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), clinically significant arrhythmias (e.g., atrial
             fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia). The study investigator will determine the

             investigational drug half life may be confirmed with the prior investigational study
             sponsor or by consulting relevant study documentation

          -  Allergies: Drug allergy: Any adverse reaction including immediate or delayed
             hypersensitivity to any beta2-agonist, sympathomimetic drug, or any intranasal,

             or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study treatment,
             unless in the opinion of the investigator and medical monitor the medication will not
             interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety

          -  Compliance: A subject will not be eligible if he/she or his/her parent or legal
             guardian has any infirmity, disability, disease, or geographical location that seems
