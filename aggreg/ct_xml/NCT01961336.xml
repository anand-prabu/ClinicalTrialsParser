  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ιt has been suggested that the accumulation of androgens in the micro milieu of the primate
      ovary, plays a critical role in early follicular development and granulosa cell
      proliferation. Increased intraovarian concentration of androgens seems to augment follicle
      stimulating hormone (FSH) receptor expression in granulosa cells and thus, potentially
      leading to enhanced responsiveness of ovaries to FSH. In addition, androgen excess has been
      shown to stimulate early stages of follicular growth and increase the number of pre-antral
      and antral follicles.

      On the basis of these data, it has been hypothesized that increasing androgen concentration
      in the ovarian micro milieu in poorly responding patients might lead to an increase in the
      number and the maturity of oocytes after ovarian stimulation for IVF. Hence, recent efforts
      have been focused on the potential benefit of androgen administration in the probability of
      pregnancy in poor responders undergoing ovarian stimulation for IVF.

      Pretreatment with transdermal testosterone has been suggested as a safe and effective way of
      increasing the intraovarian androgen concentration. Recently, published, randomized control
      trials (RCTs) have evaluated transdermal testosterone in poor responders undergoing ovarian
      stimulation for IVF, with inconclusive results.

      In view of the conflicting or inconclusive data regarding the efficacy of the proposed
      intervention, this study will attempt to explore the role of transdermal testosterone
      pretreatment in poor responders undergoing IVF through a properly designed RCT. The lack of
      a universal definition of poor responders has been identified previously and recently, in an
      attempt to address this issue, universal criteria for the definition of poor ovarian
      response have been proposed following a consensus meeting in Bologna. In the present study,
      the Bologna criteria will be used on the contrary to previous studies.

      Despite the advancement in assisted reproduction technologies, poor ovarian response (POR)
      is still considered to be one of the most challenging tasks in reproductive medicine. Poor
      ovarian response is considered to be an inadequate response to ovarian stimulation, defined
      usually by a low number of oocytes retrieved or a low number of developing follicles in a
      previous or in the running, respectively, in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle. Given the
      severely diminished probability of pregnancy after IVF in these patients, the identification
      of an indisputably efficacious treatment, such as testosterone pretreatment, would be a
      promising alternative for poor responders undergoing IVF.
