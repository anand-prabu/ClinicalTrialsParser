    <textblock>
      To study the safety and performance of the Shockwave Medical Lithoplasty System in subjects
      to demonstrate that the Shockwave device can safely and effectively deliver localized
      shockwave energy for balloon dilatation of calcified, stenotic, infrainguinal peripheral
      arteries.

      Shockwave Medical, Inc. intends to conduct a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, clinical
      study designed to evaluate the safety and performance of the Shockwave Lithoplasty System in
      subjects with moderate to heavily calcified peripheral arteries with 3.50mm to 7.0mm
      reference vessel diameter at the target site.  The Shockwave Lithoplasty System is indicated
      to generate sonic shockwave energy within the target treatment site and disrupt calcium
      within the lesion to allow for subsequent dilation of a peripheral artery stenosis using low
      balloon pressure. Up to thirty-five (35) subjects will be enrolled and treated with
      Lithoplasty to yield thirty (30) evaluable subjects complete the study assuming a 15% lost
      to follow-up rate.
