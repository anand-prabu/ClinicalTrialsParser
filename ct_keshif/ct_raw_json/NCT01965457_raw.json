            "textblock": "The term adenoids describes lymphoid tissue on the superior and posterior walls of the\n      nasopharynx, and their hypertrophy is a common condition of childhood. When enlarged,\n      adenoids can obstruct the nasopharyngeal airway and cause mouth-breathing, hyponasal voice,\n      and snoring. In more severe cases, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may result, which carries\n      potential risk of neurocognitive disturbance, growth failure, and heart-lungs disease.\n      Adenoid hypertrophy can also be associated with otitis media with effusion, possibly through\n      Eustachian tube dysfunction or chronic adenoidal infection.\n\n      Methods for identification of adenoid hypertrophy include the clinical history, examination,\n      imaging (eg, plain lateral x-ray), or by nasal endoscopy witch enable direct visualization\n      of the nasal cavity with dynamic evaluation of any nasal airway obstruction.\n\n      Objectives :\n\n      The aim of this study is to prospectively examine invasive and non-invasive office\n      procedures to assess adenoids hypertrophy, including clinical history,  x-ray imaging, and\n      nasal endoscopy.\n\n      Methods :\n\n      Prospective, observational study in pediatric patients aged 2-18 that will be referred to\n      the otolaryngology pediatric 'Clalit' clinic in Haifa after x-ray imaging and an informed\n      consent.\n\n        1. Nasal Obstruction Index (NOI) The NOI questionnaire for  history and physical exam will\n           be evaluated at the clinic, as described by Paradise grading system.\n\n        2. Plain lateral x-rays Plain lateral X-rays of the patients will be evaluated only if the\n           patients had them at the time of referral. Adenoidal obstruction will be assessed by\n           Fujioka's Adenoid-Nasopharynx ratio.\n\n        3. Fiberoptic nasal endoscopy (FNE) Fiberoptic analysis will be done as an office\n           procedure using a 2.4mm Storz nasal flexible endoscope following an application of\n           Lidocaine gel locally into the nostril and on the endoscope distal end. Adenoidal\n           obstruction will be assessed by Parikh grading system."
