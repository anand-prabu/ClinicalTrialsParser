  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if topical superoxide dismutase is an effective
      treatment of radiation related neck fibrosis, and to determine the quality of life impact
      from radiation related fibrosis in the head and neck cancer patients at Sanford Health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of topical Superoxide Dismutase
      (SOD) on the radiation induced fibrosis in head and neck cancer patients. A prospective,
      blinded, two group control design will be used with pretest and post test quality of life as
      well as objective fibrosis assessment. Patients will be randomized to alternatively receive
      topical SOD or placebo as instructed on twice daily use for 3 months. Pre and post treatment
      quality of life surveys and objective assessment will determine if the topical SOD improves
      neck fibrosis/function and global quality of life.

      This study will increase clinical trial awareness and participation while potentially
      improving the long term functional outcomes of head and neck cancer patients.
