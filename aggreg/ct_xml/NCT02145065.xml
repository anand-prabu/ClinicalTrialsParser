    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pivotal, first in man study will be to evaluate safety and efficacy of
      the novel, microcrystalline paclitaxel coated balloon (mcPCB, PAK, Balton) in the treatment
      of femoro-popliteal restenotic disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although clinically effective, the manufacturing process of first generation PCB coatings
      contributed to inconsistent drug concentrations, particulate formations on the balloon
      surface and their shedding during the interventional procedures. As a consequence
      developments of new PCB coatings have been proposed to address consistency, uniformity,
      small particle drug coverage, which may potentially contribute to improved vessel healing
      profile and improved clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, data on the safety and efficacy of
      this novel coating developments in the clinical setting remain limited. Previously in the
      experimental model, the investigators reported that delivery of paclitaxel via a novel mcPCB
      resulted in low long-term tissue retention of paclitaxel, however displayed reduced
      neointimal proliferation and favorable healing profile. Therefore in current clinical trial
      the investigators will address the feasibility and safety of the mcPCB (PAK, Balton) in the
      treatment of femoro-popliteal restenotic disease in a prospective, randomized manner when
      compared to plain balloon angioplasty (PBA). The efficacy analysis will be observational and
      evaluated post-hoc, with no pre-specified criteria.
