      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate if SWETZ is superior to LLETZ cone in reducing the
      incomplete excision of disease.

    <textblock>
      Cone biopsy is a surgical procedure which objectives the excision of endocervical
      pre-invasive disease located at transformation zone or glandular epithelium. Although cone
      biopsy is considered adequate for the treatment of endocervical dysplastic epithelium ,
      using electrosurgery as opposed to the cold knife technique of cone biopsy has been
      criticized because of the perceived potential for incomplete excision of disease, thermal
      damage and surgical specimen fragmentation, which might increase the risk of missing early
      invasive cancer. Also, incomplete excision margin of disease exposes women to an increased
      risk of residual post-treatment disease.

      The standard procedure, LLETZ - cone, is performed with a large loop electrode of 20-25 mm
      depth.

      The experimental intervention is SWETZ, a method of excision using a 1cm straight disposal
      of 0.20 wire to remove the endocervical transformation zone or glandular disease.

      Both procedures were previously studied in another clinical trial(NCT00995020), but the
      histological analysis were inconclusive for many outcomes. SWETZ were superior to LLETZ cone
      to acquire complete excision of disease, with no statistical significance, probably due to
      the small sample size.

      This study objectives a better histological analyses of the surgical specimens related to
      incomplete excision, thermal damage and fragmentation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were eligible if the colposcopist decided that a cone biopsy was indicated.

          -  Common indications for a cone biopsy included:

               -  High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion in a type 3 transformation zone,

               -  suspicion of micro-invasive or invasive carcinoma and

               -  suspicion of glandular disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were excluded if pregnancy, coagulation disorders and cervicitis were
             present or if they refused to participate in the study.
