            "textblock": "Background: Inadequate representation of elderly cancer patients in randomized clinical\n      trials (RCTs) leading to a lack of external validity thereby an uncertainty regarding\n      benefit-risk balance of cancer treatment in elderly, especially chemotherapy.\n\n      Hypothesis: The eligibility criteria explain only a part of the under-representation of\n      elderly patients in trials. We make the assumptions that 1) Among the eligible, the\n      invitation to participate in a trial and inclusion are inversely related to age, 2) Among\n      the eligible, there are patients, practitioner, or organization factors that would explain\n      the non inclusion of elderly patients.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n        1. To assess, in elderly patients with colorectal cancer, the proportions of patients:\n\n             1. eligible at least to one RCT\n\n             2. invited to participate\n\n             3. included\n\n        2. To identify factors associated with the non-invitation and the non-inclusion in RCT.\n\n      Material and methods:\n\n      Study design: A multicentric prospective cohort survey Population: all patients aged 65\n      years or more with a colorectal cancer followed in one of the participating centers.\n\n      Data collection:\n\n        -  At baseline: Patient characteristics (including SOCIO-demographic, oncologic and\n           geriatric data) will be collected. Organization factors (e.g. clinical research team)\n           will be collected.\n\n        -  Follow-up: the patient will be followed for potential invitation and inclusion in one\n           RCT. Reasons of non-invitation or non-inclusion will be assessed.\n\n      Number of subjects needed: 751 Number of centers : 6\n\n      Ethical aspects: each patient will give his oral informed consent. The International Review\n      Board of Mondor Hospital (CPP Ile-de-France IX) gave its approval in December 2012."
