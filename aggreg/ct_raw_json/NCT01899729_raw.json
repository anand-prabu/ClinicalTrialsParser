            "textblock": "IMO 8400 is a second-generation oligonucleotide antagonist of endosomal Toll-like receptors\n      (TLR) 7, TLR8 and TLR9. These TLR react to complexes of exogenous nucleic acids (as might be\n      encountered during infection) and endogenous nucleic acids (as might be released during\n      tissue damage during autoimmune disease). In vitro and in multiple animal models of\n      autoimmune disease, IMO-8400 blocks immune activation mediated through TLR7, 8 and 9. In\n      Phase 1 studies (Protocol 8400-001) IMO 8400 has been administered to healthy adults by SC\n      injection at single-doses and multiple-doses (4 weeks) up to 0.6 mg/kg. All treatments were\n      well-tolerated, with mild injection site reactions and no pattern of systemic reactions or\n      laboratory changes.\n\n      The current study represents the first clinical trial of IMO-8400 in patients with active\n      autoimmune disease. Moderate to severe plaque psoriasis was chosen for this 12-week proof of\n      activity trial based on a prior 4-week study using a first generation TLR7 and 9 antagonist\n      which demonstrated clinical improvement in this patient population."
