  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prognosis in patients with glioblastomas (the most aggressive high-grade glioma) remains
      unfavourable. Tools for improving brain tumor surgery, in particular for gliomas, are
      increasing. There seems to be an agreement that achieving extensive resections, when done
      safely without jeopardizing neurological function, improves survival.

      Ultrasound is currently used as a tool for providing 2D or 3D images for the purpose of
      tumor localization and resection control. For the use in resection control the resection
      cavity is filled with saline to provide acoustic coupling between the ultrasound transducer
      and tissue. However, attenuation of acoustic waves is very low in saline compared to the
      brain and this difference in attenuation is the cause of artifacts that may severely degrade
      the ultrasound images. Such artifacts are seen as high-intensity signal at the resection
      cavity wall and beyond, potentially masking small tumor remnants and generally making the
      interpretation of images more difficult.

      This research group has developed an acoustic fluid intended for use in the resection cavity
      instead of saline. Tests in laboratory measurements have shown that the fluid reduces
      artifacts and has the potential to enhance ultrasound image quality in brain tumor surgery.
      The investigators expect that the acoustic fluid will make it easier to detect small tumor
      remnants near the end of an operation, thus increasing success of glioma surgery. The
      purpose of this study is to test the fluid during surgery for histopathologically proven
      glioblastoma to assess safety and efficacy.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A glioblastoma is suspected when there is a solitary brain tumour with ring-like
             contrast enhancement and oedema with no recent history (last 3 years) of primary
             tumour elsewhere

          -  In cases where histopathology is not known from previous biopsy or resection (i.e.
             diagnosis is suspected based on MRI findings and not from previous surgery) a tissue
             sample for frozen section is necessary. The fluid will only be used in cases where
             glioblastoma is suggested from this preliminary histopathological assessment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Intended biopsy only (meaning: cases not suitable for resection)

          -  Other entities than glioblastoma is suspected

          -  Allergy to diary products and marine products

          -  Hypersensitvity to egg protein

          -  Hypersensitivity to soya or peanut protein

          -  Hypersensitvity to glycerol
