  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of low blood sugar and hypoglycemic seizures at diabetes camp has been reduced
      thanks to overnight blood glucose level testing.  The timing of the overnight blood test is
      often arbitrary and it is unclear when the highest frequency of nocturnal hypoglycemic
      events at camp are occurring. It is also unclear what the most appropriate treatment for
      nocturnal hypoglycemia is: simple carbohydrates, or mini-glucagon.

      In this study, we will use Continuous Glucose Monitors that will send subject data securely
      to a remote computer located in the medical cottage at camp throughout the night.  Study
      staff will monitor the computer and will intervene on low blood sugar as it occurs in real
      time.  On half of the nights, campers will receive mini-glucagon for low blood sugar, and on
      the rest, they will receive standard carbohydrate treatment.

    <description>Subjects glucose data are remotely monitored at night using the University of Virginia (UVA) Diabetes Assistant (DiAs) Android Platform. Study staff intervenes with a fingerstick blood glucose measurement when sensor value falls below 70mg/dL.  If fingerstick value is less than 70 mg/dL, hypoglycemic treatment is administered as below.
Administer mini-glucagon as treatment for nocturnal hypoglycemia.  Administer 0.01 cc per number of years in age via insulin syringe, subcutaneously.  This amounts to 1 unit per age, for example: an 8 year old gets 8 &quot;units&quot; glucagon.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and using daily insulin therapy for at least
             one year

          -  Age 7-21 years

          -  Attendee of Camp De Los Ninos or Conrad Chinnock

          -  Come to camp with a consent already signed after having talked to study staff about
             the study, or at the onset of the camp meet with study staff and sign the consent
             before the first night at camp.

          -  Using multiple daily insulin injections (Lantus) or on an insulin pump (any brand)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cystic fibrosis

          -  Medications such as current use of oral steroids or other medications, which in the
             judgment of the investigator would be a contraindication to participation in the
             study.

          -  History of adhesive allergies which would interfere with sensor wear.
