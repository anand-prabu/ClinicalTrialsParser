  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is an inflammatory disease that imposes a significant burden affecting an estimated
      300 million persons and 20% of all children worldwide.  It is one of the most common chronic
      diseases of childhood and is a leading cause of school absenteeism.  There continues to be a
      great need for clinical trials in asthma but traditional clinical trials are expensive and
      reasons cited by patients for non-participation are extra inconvenience and logistical
      barriers.  Study designs which are patient centered and reduce trial costs are needed.  The
      long-range goal of this application is to transform the paradigm of clinical research into a
      more efficient and cost-effective enterprise by capitalizing upon current widely used mobile
      electronic means of communication and information transfer.

      This innovative project is a streamlined clinical trial that will run concurrently with a
      nearly identical traditional clinical trial, &quot;Long-acting Beta Agonist Step Down Study&quot;
      (LASST) which will allow for direct comparison of processes and outcomes between the
      streamlined and traditional approach.  Children 12 to 17 years old with asthma will be
      randomized to participate in this project (streamlined trial) or LASST (traditional trial).
      In this proposal we will: measure comprehension of study information using an original
      questionnaire, Research Participant Assessment (developed at Nemours), following a parental
      permission/assent process delivered over the internet in a dynamic interactive multi-media
      format (Specific Aim 1); measure the efficiency of participant driven data entry from home
      into a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) online database using the iPad, and quality
      of spirometry with the EasyOne Plus handheld meter with remote coaching using the iPad
      (Specific Aim 2); test whether the streamlined approach has a &quot;trial effect&quot;  by comparing
      the differences in Asthma Control Test (ACT) scores following 12 weeks of study drug
      treatment in children randomized to this project compared to LASST.  We will collect effort
      reporting data to compare personnel costs between the trials.  If this streamlined project
      lacks a &quot;trial effect&quot; and reduces costs compared to LASST, the methodologies would be
      generalizable to studies which include adults and other diseases.
