They are asked to\n      complete the sequence, identify pictures, explain what is happening, etc.  There is no\n      personality testing involved.  Part of the standard IQ testing is done but no IQ score is\n      obtained.  Age appropriate testing is done for each child.\n\n      The MRI is an enclosed machine.  We have the child sit in a simulator after the\n      neuropsychological testing to see what it will be like, including the sounds, etc.   You\n      will be given a video about MRI testing to view as well.  The staff that does this has been\n      doing this for years in a wide variety of children, young, developmental delayed, etc.  The\n      staff does this WITHOUT sedation.  Some children cannot sit still through the entire series.\n       We need to get six, 10 minute scans.  Children are allowed movement such as the need to\n      wiggle their toes and move in between each scan.\n\n      The Neuropsychological Testing can be scheduled in the late afternoons if it is more\n      convenient for your family.  This visit may take 3-4 hours.  The MRI scanning can be\n      scheduled after 5pm and may take up to 2 hours depending on the child's cooperation.  You\n      maybe asked to repeat the Neuropsychological Testing and MRI scanning 24 months later."

Fifty to 60 children\n      between the ages of 3 to less than 10 years with Type 1 diabetes mellitus will have\n      neuropsychological testing and a nonsedated MRI scan of the head performed.   The study will\n      compare the results from those with diabetes to a control group of 20-30 children between\n      the ages of 3 to less than 10 years without Type 1 diabetes mellitus.  The control subjects\n      will have neuropsychological testing and a nonsedated MRI scan of the head performed as\n      well.  All subjects maybe asked to repeat the neuropsychological testing and nonsedated MRI\n      scan of the head 24 months later.   The children with Type 1 diabetes mellitus will not have\n      any changes made to their current diabetes regimen.  The children with Type 1 diabetes\n      mellitus should continue to check blood glucose values as required by their doctors and\n      bring their meter(s) for downloading to each visit.  The child should also tell his/her\n      doctor about the frequency of severe low and high blood glucose values to his/er doctor as\n      routinely asked.\n\n      Participant  Schedule:\n\n        1. One visit for 3-4 hours at the Stanford Medical Center to complete neuropsychological\n           testing and to become familiar with the MRI scanner.\n\n        2. Subjects who need to become more familiar with the MRI scanning process will view a\n           video tape at home.\n\n        3. One visit for 1-2 hours at Stanford Medical Center to have the MRI scan of the head\n           completed.\n\n        4. Subjects may have the neuropsychological testing and MRI scan repeated 24 months from\n           time of the initial testing and scan.\n\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n\n      To take part in the study, the child must meet the following inclusion criteria:\n\n        1. Be between the ages of 3 to 10 years.\n\n        2. Have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for at least 6 months.\n\n        3. Do not have plans to move out of the area within the next 36 months.\n\n      Exclusion Criteria:\n\n      A history of head trauma with any loss of consciousness cystic fibrosis prematurity (born\n      less than 30 weeks of gestation) significant developmental delay (lack of single word speech\n      or ability to walk independently by 18 months of age) neurologic disease independent of\n      diabetes (eg seizure disorder or medical contraindication to MRI procedure (eg metal\n      appliances such as braces).\n\n      Compensation: There will be no cost to the subjects to participate in this research study.\n      Participants will be compensated for their time.
