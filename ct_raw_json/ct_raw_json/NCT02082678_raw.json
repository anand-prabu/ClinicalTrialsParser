Ondansetron or placebo will be given at 0.5 milligrams twice a day for the first 4\n      weeks.

Pill\n      counts will be conducted, and a list of current medications and doses will be recorded at\n      each visit. Participants will be compensated at each appointment with a bus pass, gift\n      cards, and a monetary incentive for compliance. Participants will be evaluated by both the\n      research assistant (RA) and principal investigator (PI) at each visit.\n\n      The HAMD and Timeline Followback will be given at each visit as the primary outcome\n      measures. Cognitive assessments will be performed at baseline and week 12."
