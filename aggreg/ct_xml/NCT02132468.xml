    <textblock>
      This protocol will investigate the safety, symptoms and biomarker response of subjects with
      biopsy-proven well-differentiated, low-to-intermediate-grade, unresectable, or metastatic
      GI-NETs with elevated biochemical markers who have relapsed during or after receiving prior
      standard of care therapies, including octreotide, chemotherapy or targeted therapy.
