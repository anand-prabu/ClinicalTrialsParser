There, patients are evaluated by geneticists, rheumatologists, cardiologists, and ophthalmologists. Systematic slit-lamp examination, cardiac ultrasonography, and radiological investigations are also performed. A skin punch biopsy was used to establish a fibroblast cell culture. We determined mRNA levels for FBN1 and compared it to the clinical involvement."
