There is a group of people suffering\n      from neck pain with a reduced ability to maintain an upright posture showing a forward head\n      position and an altered muscle function.\n\n      The aim of the study was to evaluate a motor control intervention for patients with\n      persistent neck pain and a forward head posture.\n\n      This pilot study used a Single System Experimental Design (SSED) with an A-B-A-design and\n      multiple baselines.\n\n      The tailored motor control intervention addressed the faulty postural alignment and the deep\n      muscles of the cervical spine."
