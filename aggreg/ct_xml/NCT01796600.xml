    <textblock>
      ConeBeam scanner (CBCT) is a widely technique used for dental and maxillofacial imaging.
      Patients can be set up in a sitting or a laying position in the, Newtom 5G CBCT allowing for
      an analysis of the distal appendicular skeleton. The investigators' hypothesis is that the
      cone-beam scanner could detect and characterize fractures of the extremities similarly to a
      multidetector CT (MDCT). 150 patients over 18 years requiring a CT scan for a suspected
      distal limb fracture or a preoperative assessment will be enrolled. The primary endpointis
      based on the ability of cone-beam scanner to properly characterize the type of fracture
      using a classification derived from Maurice E. Müller (AO) classification. Secondary
      endpoints will concern the depiction of the fracture, the assessment of the soft tissues
      near the fracture, quality of images, inter and intra-operator reproducibility and tolerance
      of the patient for the examination. Patients will have a MDCT considered as the reference
      exam, then a CBCT. Exams will be anonymized and read twice by two trained radiologists with
      3-6 week intervals. The inter-observer agreement for the diagnosis of fracture type between
      the two techniques will be evaluated by a kappa coefficient. The evaluation of diagnostic
      performance will be achieved by studying the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive
      value and positive predictive value, and its likelihood ratio. Kappa test will be performed
      to evaluate the consistency of the characterization of the fracture and the evaluation of
      soft tissue near the fracture. A Student t test will be performed for paired data if
      distributions are normal, a Wilcoxon test if not. To assess patient's tolerance, the
      percentages of (painful, not painful) will be calculated for each technique and will be
      compared using the Chi2 test (or Fisher's exact test if the chi can not apply).
