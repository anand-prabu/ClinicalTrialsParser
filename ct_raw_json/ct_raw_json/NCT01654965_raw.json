To describe the toxicities of ARQ 197 and IV topotecan at each dose studied.\n\n      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetic behavior of ARQ 197 given concurrent use of IV\n      topotecan.\n\n      IV. To document all clinical responses to ARQ 197 with IV topotecan.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of tivantinib and topotecan hydrochloride.\n\n      Patients receive tivantinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21, topotecan\n      hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5, and pegfilgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on day\n      6. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks."

abstinence) prior to study entry and\n             for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect\n             she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should\n             inform her treating physician immediately;

while inhibitors/inducers of these cytochrome P450\n             isoenzymes are not specifically excluded, investigators should be aware that ARQ 197\n             exposure may be altered by the concomitant administration of these drugs; caution\n             should be applied when CYP2C19 inhibitors such as omeprazole, fluvoxamine,\n             fluconazole, ticlopidine, rabeprazole, fluoxetine, and moclobemide, or strong CYP3A4\n             inhibitors such as atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole,\n             nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, ciprofloxacin, telithromycin,\n             troleandomycin (TAO), or voriconazole, are used as concomitant therapy; because the\n             lists of these agents are changing, it is important to consult an updated list; as\n             part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on\n             the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to\n             be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or\n             herbal product\n\n          -  History of congestive heart failure defined as class II to IV per New York Heart\n             Association (NYHA) classification;
