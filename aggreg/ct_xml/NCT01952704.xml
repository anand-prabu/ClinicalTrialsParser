  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aerobic exercise holds a multitude of health benefits. Studies in mice have shown that
      aerobic exercise improves memory, and increases the volume of the hippocampus, the brain's
      primary memory center. Only two studies have been conducted in humans, one in healthy
      elders, and the other in a schizophrenia population. So far, there has never been an aerobic
      exercise trial in traumatic brain injury (TBI) to look at hippocampal volume and memory as
      outcomes of interest. The proposed project is a randomized controlled trial of aerobic
      exercise in persons with TBI. We will conduct a 12-week (36 sessions) program of aerobic
      exercise (stationary cycling), versus a control condition of non-aerobic exercise
      (stretching), in memory-impaired TBI patients to a) increase hippocampal volume and b)
      improve memory. Importantly, we also expect benefits of aerobic exercise on the level of
      brain function. Specifically, we will look at 'functional connectivity,' which refers to how
      efficiently remote regions of the brain 'talk' to each other. TBI is an ideal population to
      benefit from aerobic exercise, given the young age at which many individuals sustain TBI,
      which allows for benefits of aerobic exercise to be maximally realized in a population with
      sufficient neurofunctional reserve. The expected benefits of aerobic exercise (increased
      hippocampal volume, improved memory) from this intervention stand to have a meaningful
      impact on people with TBI, including improved health, productivity, independence, and
      quality of life. And, unlike current treatments for memory impairment (e.g., pharmacological
      agents, cognitive rehabilitation), aerobic exercise is a cost-effective, all natural,
      readily-available treatment for memory problems.
