  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study will investigate inhalation therapy of NaCl 3% compared to standard therapy with
      no inhalation in the treatment of moderate to severe bronchiolitis. The impact on length of
      hospital stay will be analyzed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute viral bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory tract infection in the first
      year of life and leads to a large number of hospital admissions. The only recommended
      treatment is supportive. However many different types of drug inhalations have been studied
      but their efficacy remains controversial.

      Our study will compare recommended supportive therapy to supportive therapy combined to
      hypertonic saline (NaCl 3%) inhalations in the treatment of moderate to severe
      bronchiolitis. This will be the first study to use a true control group with no inhalation.
