To obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of the Yoga Skills Training (YST) for\n      improving the targeted outcomes (primary: fatigue; secondary: depressive symptoms) as\n      compared to the attention control (AC).\n\n      II. To explore potential mediators (psychological stress, circadian disruption,\n      inflammation) and moderators (gender, dose of the YST, outcome expectancies) of the effects\n      of the YST on targeted outcomes.\n\n      III. To qualitatively assess perceived efficacy of the interventions and acceptance of daily\n      measurement through semi-structured interviews in a subset of 20-30 participants.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\n      ARM I (YST intervention): Patients undergo YST intervention comprising four individualized,\n      30 minute in-person sessions that instructs skills to enhance mindfulness and promote\n      relaxation during outpatient chemotherapy sessions in weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8. Patients\n      practice awareness - noticing the current state and establishing relaxed breathing for 5\n      minutes; movement - 7 minutes of gentle movements coordinated with the breath (such as\n      raising and lowering the arms); breathing practice - 3 minutes of inhaling cool air as if\n      through a straw; and meditation - 5 minutes of focus on letting go of physical and mental\n      tension. Patients are given a handout describing the YST and audio recording with devices to\n      play the recording to encourage patients to practice daily. Strategies to increase adherence\n      to home practice will be implemented and patients will be asked to keep  home practice logs.\n\n      ARM II (attention control): Patients attend four 30-minute in-person sessions with an\n      interventionist in weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8. During these sessions, patients are encouraged to\n      discuss their experiences while receiving chemotherapy and do not receive instruction of\n      movement, meditation or breathing practices. Patients will also be asked to write brief\n      diary entries daily at home.\n\n      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 4 weeks."
