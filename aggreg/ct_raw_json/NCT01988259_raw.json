Each patient will be tested before surgery, postoperative as well\n      as 3 and 12 month follow-up.\n\n      Hypothesis is that patients after MIS-approaches perform better in their\n      head-neck-coordination as patients with open approaches."

The participant will be asked to track the specified target by controlling his/her head-neck angle (position tracking) or moment (force tracking). The head position or force during these trials will represent the output signal for the motor control system. These signals will be collected and analyzed in the time and frequency domain to assess error in head-neck motor control.",
