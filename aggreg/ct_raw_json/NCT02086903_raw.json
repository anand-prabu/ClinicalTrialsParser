Moreover, Asian subjects exposed higher active metabolite and stronger\n      pharmacodynamics response than European subjects with same oral dose of antiplatelet agent.\n      However, previous report comparing the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor and Clopidogrel in\n      healthy Asian ethnicity is lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the\n      pharmacodynamic responses of a lower Ticagrelor dose  using laboratory platelet function\n      tests in  healthy Korean volunteers."
