    <textblock>
      This study will acquire data on hair growth of the head that is the result of treatment with
      a non-heat generating, laser product.  This data will come from counting of terminal hairs
      before treatment begins and after treatment is completed.  The treatment regime is every
      other day for 16 weeks.
