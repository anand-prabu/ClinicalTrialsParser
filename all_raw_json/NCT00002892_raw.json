Determine the effects of adjuvant low-dose extended-duration interferon alfa\n      on disease-free and overall survival in patients with completely resected malignant melanoma\n      at high risk of recurrence. II. Determine any correlation between patient age or sex and the\n      effects of interferon therapy on disease-free and overall survival. III. Describe the toxic\n      effects of this treatment. IV. Evaluate the economic implications of implementing effective\n      interferon therapy in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients will be stratified by age, sex, disease status\n      at entry, and participating institution. Patients are randomized to observation only or to\n      receive interferon alfa by subcutaneous injections 3 times weekly for 2 years, or until\n      disease progression or toxicity intervenes. Patients are followed monthly for 6 months,\n      quarterly for 18 months, and every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,000 patients will be entered over 5 years."
