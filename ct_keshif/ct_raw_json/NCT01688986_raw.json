The EPR is a registry established to collect and store DNA samples from\n      20,000 volunteers from North Carolina and to serve as a resource to scientist investigating\n      genotype-driven translational research of chronic conditions. Under this new protocol, we\n      will administer a health and exposures survey to all EPR subjects. The information collected\n      in the survey will be used to better characterize the EPR population thus making it more\n      useful to NIEHS researchers. The survey contains approximately 200 questions. Data from the\n      survey will help researchers develop hypotheses, design follow-up studies, and select\n      appropriate subjects.\n\n      The survey will be administered to EPR subjects using a modified version of the Dillman\n      Total Design Method (TDM) for surveys. This method requires following specific\n      time-dependent steps for survey administration that incorporate both self- and phone\n      administration and other types of phone and mail contact. The goal of TDM is to maximize\n      subject response rates."
