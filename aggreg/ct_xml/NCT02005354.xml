    <textblock>
      The approach of this study will be to answer the question does high-frequency stimulation
      Trans-Cutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) alleviate the pain experienced during
      the bone marrow sampling procedure in addition to the standard analgesia given (ie. local
      anaesthetic with or without inhaled nitrous oxide).

      Null hypothesis: TENS does not alleviate the pain experienced during the bone marrow
      sampling procedure in addition to the standard analgesia given

      Patients in whom a bone marrow biopsy is planned will be randomised to one of two groups - a
      control-TENS group where the TENS machine will be set at the lowest sensory threshold and an
      intervention-TENS group where the TENS machine will be set at a recognised analgesic level
      (&gt;50 Hertz (Hz) and below the pain threshold for the patient) (Bennett et al. 2011).  The
      identity of the TENS type will be concealed from both the patient and the doctor performing
      the biopsy.  The primary outcome will be pain and this will be recorded by the patient
      immediately after the procedure using a validated numerical scale (0-10).  All patients will
      receive standard pain relief (ie. local anaesthetic with or without inhaled nitrous oxide).

      The benefit of this study is to establish whether or not TENS can benefit patients as an
      additional, safe, non-invasive and inexpensive method of pain relief during this frequently
      painful procedure.

    <description>To establish the effect of high-frequency stimulation TENS on the pain experienced by patients undergoing a bone-marrow biopsy, using standard technique with local anaesthetic.
The perception of pain will be measured using a pain scale directly after and 24 hours after bone-marrow sampling in patients randomly allocated and blinded to the use of intervention-TENS (IT) or control-TENS (CT) in addition to local anaesthesia.</description>

    <description>The Intervention-TENS group will have 2 electrodes applied proximal to the painful area along neuro-anatomical distribution (electrode-one placed 5cm superior and 2cm medial to the posterior superior iliac spine and electrode-two placed 5cm medial to the posterior superior iliac spine) in the same way as the control-TENS group.
The concealed electrical parameter in this group will be within the therapeutic window, that is, well above the sensory detection threshold but below the pain threshold giving a &quot;strong but comfortable sensation&quot;.  From previous studies, this is likely to be 50-110Hz.
The device will be activated prior to entry into the treatment room and 2 minutes before administration of local anaesthetic and for 2 minutes after removal of the biopsy needle.  This will cover the expected duration of pain as assessed in the pilot study.
All patients will receive standard pain relief (ie. local anaesthetic with or without inhaled nitrous oxide)</description>

    <description>Patients in the CT group will have 2 gel-electrodes applied proximal to the sampling area (usually the right posterior superior iliac crest).
The Control-TENS device will be identical in appearance to the &quot;Intervention-TENS&quot; device with a functioning display panel.  The concealed electrical parameter in this group will be titrated to and set at the sensory detection.
All patients will receive standard pain relief (ie. local anaesthetic with or without inhaled nitrous oxide)</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the
             study.

          -  Male or Female, aged 18 years or above.

          -  Participants are those medical patients seen in the haematology outpatients clinic
             for whom a bone-marrow trephine biopsy is deemed necessary either for diagnosis,
             staging or disease monitoring purposes. Participants are either new patients or
             routine follow ups.

          -  Participant is able (in the Investigators opinion) and willing to comply with all
             study requirements.

          -  Participant is willing to allow his or her General Practitioner to be notified of
             participation in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any known adverse reaction to high-frequency TENS or electrode gel pads

          -  Any significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may
             either put the participants at risk because of participation in the study, or may
             influence the result of the study, or the participant's ability to participate in the
             study.
