Courses repeat every 28 days\n      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tipifarnib until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 9 additional patients are treated\n      at the MTD.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-34 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2\n      years."
