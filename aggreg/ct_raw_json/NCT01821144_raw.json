In this study, the investigators will educate\n      children on how to reduce salt intake, and the investigators will empower children by asking\n      them to deliver the salt reduction message home to their families, particularly children\n      need to persuade the person who does the cooking for the whole family to cut down on the\n      amount of salt used during food preparations. The study will involve children aged about 11\n      years, and their parents and grandparents in Northern China."
