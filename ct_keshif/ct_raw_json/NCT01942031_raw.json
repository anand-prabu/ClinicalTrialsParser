Secondary prevention is proven efficient but observational studies have\n      shown that a number of patients are lost to follow up and do not receive recommended\n      prevention. The aim of the study is to 1) describe, by analyzing register data, the\n      detection rate of patients with hospital diagnosis of stroke, TIA, and atrial fibrillation\n      in the primary care center where they are listed. The analysis is done by sex, age, and\n      socioeconomic status. Furthermore, rate of dispensed prescriptions of secondary preventive\n      drugs are analysed for the identified population. 2) in a randomized controlled study\n      evaluate if collegial feed back and targeted information of secondary prevention to the\n      intervention group can improve the detection rate and the medication of the patients listed\n      at the participating primary care centers."

A data set is presented by different means; 1) in\n      written reports, directly to the head of each primary care center in the intervention group\n      2)in oral presentation on training sessions for the physicians in each training ares.\n      Measures of detection rates of diagnosis and dispensed prescriptions of secondary preventive\n      drugs are made before start of the project and after one year. The control group, ie the\n      primary care centers not receiving feed back, are measured in the same way and thus provide\n      a control group. The hypothesis being that with visibility of the problem, it is easier to\n      improve care wich is what all health providers aim to do.\n\n      Outcome measures is percentage of patients with stroke (ICD code I60, I 61, I63, I64) and\n      transitory ischemic attacks(G45) who are dispensed prescribed secondary preventive\n      medication and death."
