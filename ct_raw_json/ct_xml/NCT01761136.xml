    <textblock>
      A randomized trial was conducted in 680 healthy infants with Hib vaccine of two brands. The
      different sub-groups were selected randomly based on the plan to inoculate vaccines in the
      upper arm deltoid or vastus lateralis muscle. The safety and immunogenicity were assessed
      after three or two doses.
