The scale PANSS (Positive and Negative\n      Syndrome Scale) is used for monitoring  psychopathological symptoms during the study.\n\n      Scales BADS, DAFS-R, ILSS-BR respectively assess executive functions, functionality and\n      basic and instrumental activities of daily living. The neuropsychological evaluation\n      includes a battery to measure attention, executive functions, memory and estimated\n      intellectual efficiency.\n\n      Statistical analysis to be used: ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)for repeated measures; data are\n      also calculated to messure clinical efficacy, effect size and needed number to treat."
