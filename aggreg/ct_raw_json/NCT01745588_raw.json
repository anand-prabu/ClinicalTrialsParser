To do this, the investigators want to compare two\n      types of treatment using pomalidomde. This is a randomized trial which means that the\n      decision as to which treatment the patient will receive will be made by a computer, much\n      like flipping a coin.\n\n      All patients start by receiving 4 cycles of clarithromycin, pomalidomide and dexamethasone\n      (ClaPD). After 4 cycles, half of the patients will undergo an autologous stem cell\n      transplant followed by pomalidomide (Group 1). The other half of the patients will continue\n      to receive ClaPD for 9 cycles to be followed by pomalidomide maintenance. (Group 2).\n\n      At the end of the study, the two groups will be compared to see if there is a difference in\n      disease outcome."
