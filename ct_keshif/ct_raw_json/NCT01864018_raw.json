Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and\n      dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing\n      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Ixazomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by\n      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving cyclophosphamide together with\n      ixazomib and dexamethasone may be an effective treatment for multiple myeloma."
