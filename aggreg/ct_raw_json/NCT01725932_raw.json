We have developed culturally sensitive CBT during the\n      last few years in Pakistan. Pakistan has high rates of depression. And there is currently a\n      need to develop and test evidence based treatments which are culturally sensitive and cost\n      effective. IN this project we will be assessing the effectiveness of a culturally sensitive\n      CBT based self help intervention for depression in Pakistan against care as usual, using a\n      randomized controlled design."
