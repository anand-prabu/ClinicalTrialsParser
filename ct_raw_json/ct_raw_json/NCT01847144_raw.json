Understanding mechanisms of\n      altered response to treatment could aid treatment selection and assist the design of new\n      medications with lower nonresponse rates.\n\n      This study will examine the physiological mechanisms and potential clinical/biomarker\n      predictors of altered response to sulphonylurea and DPPIV inhibitor glucose lowering\n      medication and answer fundamental methodological questions for the future study of variation\n      in treatment response in Type 2 Diabetes. Participants will withdraw sulphonylurea therapy\n      for up to 2 weeks with assessment of baseline characteristics and glycaemic response.\n      Participants will then enter an optional extension where they receive sulphonylurea or DPPIV\n      inhibitor therapy in crossover fashion."
