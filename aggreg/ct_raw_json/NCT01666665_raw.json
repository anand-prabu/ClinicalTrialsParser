Insulin and metformin have demonstrated anabolic activity with minimal associated\n      side effects.  However, it is unknown whether the beneficial effects arise from tight\n      euglycemic control or direct effect of insulin action.  We hypothesize that during acute\n      hospitalization, administration of metformin at a dose titrated to maintain blood glucose\n      between 80-180 mg/dl will accelerate wound healing and recovery in children with severe\n      thermal injury and will have beneficial long-term effects on muscle strength, immune\n      function, and wound healing."
