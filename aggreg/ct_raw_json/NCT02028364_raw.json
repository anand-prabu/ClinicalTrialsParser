Tumour, metastatic lesions and blood samples will be\n      collected during the treatment period. Genomic analysis on metastatic tumour tissue\n      specimens and \"liquid biopsies\" will help to identify patients who benefit of this treatment\n      regimen. The main objective is to evaluate if early metabolic response (MR) using FDG-PET/CT\n      is associated with progression free survival (PFS) this population."
