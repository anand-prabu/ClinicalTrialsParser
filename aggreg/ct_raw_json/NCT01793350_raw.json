Up to 15 subjects will receive BC-DN-01 in Study Phase 1 and up to 120\n      subjects will receive BC-DN-01 or placebo in Study Phase 2.\n\n      In Phase 1, a BC-DN-01 dose delivering 160mg benfotiamine/day (80mg twice daily) will be\n      administered for the first 7 days.  On visit day 0, patients will commence study treatment.\n      Patients will be interviewed by phone on day 3 and return to clinic on day 7 for safety\n      assessments. If the drug is well-tolerated and no significant adverse events experienced,\n      the total daily BC-DN-01 dose will be increased on days 7-14 to 320mg benfotiamine/day\n      (160mg b.i.d.).  Patients will be interviewed by telephone on day 10 and return to clinic on\n      day 14 for safety assessments.\n\n      Once the safety profile has been determined in Phase 1 as acceptable, the Phase 2 study will\n      be initiated to evaluate clinical efficacy of BC-DN-01. Phase 2 is a randomized,\n      placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel study.  Participants receive placebo or BC-DN-01\n      based on 1:1 randomization.  Each patient will apply 4g of the study medication to each leg\n      twice-a-day administering 320mg benfotiamine dose/day for 12 weeks.\n\n      Participants will be evaluated in the clinic at baseline and at 4, 8, and 12-week time\n      points; study staff will interview the patients by telephone on weeks 2, 6, and 10.\n\n      The primary endpoint of the phase 2 trial is reduction in DPN pain measured by the Brief\n      Pain Inventory. Phase 2 patients will be invited to give written consent to take part in\n      biopsy sampling and additional gene expression analysis."

Based on conservative but\n      approximate drop-out estimates of 20% in Study Phase 1 and 30% in Study Phase 2, up to 15\n      subjects will receive BC-DN-01 in Study Phase 1 and up to 120 subjects will receive either\n      BC-DN-01 or placebo in Study Phase 2.  It is anticipated that the enrolment of 135 subjects\n      will allow for 12 and 84 evaluable in Study Parts 1 and 2, respectively.\n\n      Patient screening for study eligibility, randomisation, treatment administration, and safety\n      and efficacy evaluations will be conducted at clinic visits in a qualified clinical research\n      facility.  It is anticipated that  up to fifteen patients will be enrolled in the Phase 1\n      portion of the study intended to evaluate the safety and tolerability of daily, escalating\n      doses of BC-DN-01 for two weeks. This portion of the study is not blinded and\n      non-randomized.  Upon completion of Phase 1, results will be used for the decision to\n      initiate the Phase 2 portion of the study.  It is anticipated that up to one hundred twenty\n      (120) patients will be enrolled in Phase 2 and randomized to receive either placebo or a\n      fixed BC-DN-01 dose for twelve weeks.  Phase 2 will be double-blind to minimize bias.\n\n      All clinical safety measurements, observations, reported adverse symptoms, and laboratory\n      safety data for each patient will be reviewed and clinically relevant findings reported to\n      the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) at the end of the Phase 1 and the end of the Phase 2\n      trials.  The decision to continue trial conduct will be made by BioChemics, Inc., and may be\n      based on recommendations provided by a study continuation/study termination opinion by the\n      DSMB.  At no time will individual patient data or commentary thereon, from the blinded Phase\n      2 portion of the trial be shared by the DSMB with BioChemics, Inc. personnel or their study\n      conduct partners.\n\n      This study is not formally powered to test a statistical hypothesis.  The primary objective\n      is to determine the magnitude of pain relief following a daily administration of 16g\n      BC-DN-01 (320mg benfotiamine) compared to Placebo (Phase 2).  This value will be used to\n      determine the sample size needed in future clinical trials to ensure adequate analytical\n      power to demonstrate efficacy.\n\n      Phase 1\n\n      Patients considered eligible for enrolment to the phase 1 study will be required to comply\n      will all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, including:\n\n        -  Consented to phase 1 trial participation\n\n        -  Met the protocol criteria for inclusion and exclusion (except inc criterion #8, #9 and\n           exc criteria #3))\n\n        -  Have not taken neuropathy pain medication for at least 2 weeks\n\n      Visit 1 (Screening) After providing written informed consent patients will undergo a\n      physical examination, including leg and feet assessment, vital signs measured and safety\n      blood samples taken including serum pregnancy test for women of child bearing potential.\n\n      Visit 2 (Baseline - Day 0) Patients will undergo a physical examination, including leg and\n      feet assessment, vital signs measured and safety blood samples taken including urine\n      pregnancy test for women of child bearing potential.\n\n      Patients will be dispensed BC-DN-01 study medication to provide 1 week of treatment, of 2g\n      doses per leg, twice daily giving a total dose of 160mg benfotiamine/day (80mg b.i.d.).

At that time, those\n      patients, will be required to comply will all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria,\n      including:\n\n        -  Consented to phase 2 trial participation\n\n        -  Met the protocol criteria for inclusion and exclusion\n\n        -  Have not taken neuropathy pain medication for at least 2 weeks\n\n      Phase 2 is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel study in up to 120\n      patients.  Study participants will receive either placebo or BC-DN-01 based on 1:1\n      randomisation (at least 42 evaluable patients per treatment arm).  Each volunteer patient\n      will apply 4g of the study medication to each leg twice-a-day administering 320mg\n      benfotiamine dose/day for 12 weeks.\n\n      The primary endpoint of the phase 2 trial is the reduction in pain level associated with DPN\n      as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI).  The duration of pain reduction will also be\n      assessed.\n\n      The secondary efficacy endpoints include the evaluation of Sural and Peroneal motor nerve\n      conduction velocities, Neuropathy Symptom Score, Neuropathy Disability Score, ,\n      Intra-epidermal nerve fibre density in the legs of these patients, hyperaesthesia and\n      changes in lack of sensation in the leg and foot. Xerosis and changes in diabetes-related\n      skin pathology, such as infiltration by inflammatory cells and mast cell degranulation as\n      well as changes in the gene expression profiles of these tissues will also be assessed.\n\n      Visit 1 (Screening) After providing written informed consent patients will undergo a\n      physical examination, including leg and feet assessment, vital signs measured and safety\n      blood samples taken including serum pregnancy test for women of child bearing potential.\n\n      Visit 2 (Baseline - Day 0) Patients will undergo a physical examination, including leg and\n      feet assessment, vital signs measured and safety blood samples taken including urine\n      pregnancy test for women of child bearing potential.\n\n      Patients will be randomised to a 50:50 BC-DN-01:placebo arm and dispensed study medication\n      to provide 4 weeks of treatment, of 4g doses per leg, twice daily giving the equivalent\n      total dose of 320mg benfotiamine/day (80mg b.i.d.). The first dose of study medication will\n      be given by the study nurse, to demonstrate the correct way to apply the cream.\n\n      Visits 3 (Week 4) 4 (Week 8) and 5 (Week 12) Patients will undergo a leg and feet\n      assessment, vital signs measured and safety blood samples taken including urine pregnancy\n      test for women of child bearing potential.\n\n      Patients will be asked to complete questionnaires regarding DPN pain, sensory tests and\n      visual assessments of the skin on your legs and feet will be made Patients will undergo a\n      nerve conduction velocity test, which tests how fast electrical signals move through the\n      nerves on the leg.\n\n      Patients will be contacted on weeks 2, 6, 10 and 14 by telephone to be interviewed to\n      discuss the medication, general health and any adverse events since the last clinic visit."
