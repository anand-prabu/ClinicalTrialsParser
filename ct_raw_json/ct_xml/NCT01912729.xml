      The mission of this project is to develop novel systems of care that can provide
      efficacious, scalable, cost-effective, participant friendly technology assisted behavioral
      interventions (TABIs) for the prevention of depression in adolescents. The investigators
      define TABIs as interventions that use information and telecommunications technologies such
      as the internet, mobile or traditional phones, computers and/or other technologies to
      support and deliver psychological and behavioral interventions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is common, debilitating, costly, and frequently begins in adolescence or young
      adulthood. RCTs of face-to-face (FtF) therapy show efficacy, but this often does not
      translate to clinical practice. Barriers to treatment are the norm: More that 75% of
      depressed adults and youth cannot access care due to structural barriers (cost,
      transportation problems, time constraints, lack of available services,etc.). To overcome
      barriers, internet treatments have been examined but effect sizes remain modest, ranging
      from d=.25 to d=.61 due at least in part to low levels of utilization and adherence.

      The first aim of this project will be to conduct focus interviews and usability testing of
      three technologies with adolescents: &quot;Networked Peer Support&quot;, &quot;Smart Phone Application&quot; and
      &quot;Virtual Humans&quot;. All three technologies use similar methods that involve adaptation of
      technologies followed by usability and beta-testing.

      The second aim of this project will be to complete a field trial of the intervention based
      on feedback received from the focus interviews and usability testing.

      The objective of this study is:

        1. To collect qualitative data from focus interviews with adolescents on their
           telecommunication technology usage patterns, and the ways in which telecommunication
           technology can support behavior change.

        2. To develop and beta test a networked peer support website, smart phone applications,
           and a web-based virtual human to prevent depression in adolescents.

        3. To collect pilot data on adherence and usability of the applications, websites and
           tools.

        4. To collect pilot data on the efficacy of a web-based intervention with a social network
           to reduce risk of depression
