            "textblock": "Rationale:\n\n      A Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA) does not cause permanent damage of brain tissue, but the\n      risk of a subsequent ischemic stroke in the short term is high. Timely recognition of TIA\n      would result in early treatment and reduce the risk of ischaemic stroke, and other adverse\n      cardiovascular events.\n\n      To improve the management of TIA adequate diagnosis is of imminent importance. However the\n      diagnosis is notoriously difficult, for both GP and neurologist.\n\n      Adequate biomarkers for brain ischaemia could improve the early diagnosis and thus the\n      subsequent management of TIA.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n        1. To assess the added diagnostic value of biomarkers beyond the clinical assessment\n           (medical history, signs and symptoms) in patients suspected of TIA.\n\n           Secondary objectives\n\n        2. To assess the prognostic value of biomarkers in patients with an established diagnosis\n           of TIA.\n\n        3. To assess the time delay and factors related to delay in patients suspected of TIA.\n\n      Study population:\n\n      350 adult persons suspected of TIA from primary care.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      Recruitment of patients will be performed at the general practices of 200 GPs in the\n      vicinity of 4 to 5 participating hospitals. During a home visit a research nurse collects a\n      blood sample, and takes two health-related questionnaires. Participants will be referred by\n      their GP to the regional TIA outpatient clinic for additional investigations, including\n      brain imaging. The diagnostic accuracy of a set of biomarkers will be assessed with the\n      'definite' diagnosis of TIA by a panel of neurologists as the reference standard."
