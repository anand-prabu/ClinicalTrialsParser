Dose cohorts receive drug sequentially, the lowest-dose cohort receiving the\n      drug first. Dose escalation may not proceed to the next higher-dose cohort until all\n      patients from the prior lower-dose cohort have completed the 4-week follow-up after the\n      multiple dosing, adverse events are within the described bounds, and the FDA has reviewed\n      the safety information from the treated cohort and approved the dose escalation. The drug is\n      administered 4 times within the 8 weeks of the study period. Weekly visits are required.\n      Patients receive financial compensation."
