It is\n      variable in function: the location and the extension of the tumor, of the general state , of\n      age, of the socio-economic class and the pain. The health consequences of a malnutrition are\n      very important: aggravation of the state of health, complications of treatment,\n      hospitalization, alteration of the quality of life and decrease the survival, and the\n      treatment response.\n\n      Nutrition being very important in patients, there are recommendations for the nutritional\n      care of these patients, formulated by the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and\n      Metabolism. The investigators do not know to what extent these recommendations are respected\n      in practice and their influence on the nutritional status and the quality of life of\n      patients.\n\n      The investigators therefore propose to assess the conformity of the nutritional care\n      patients in clinical practice in relation to the European recommendations and in a second\n      time to assess the influence of this compliance or non-compliance on the nutritional status\n      clinical and biological of cancerous patients under chemotherapy, on their quality of life,\n      on their response to treatment and on their survival.\n\n      The investigators will try to identify factors that may be linked to the non-compliance such\n      as the characteristics of the cancer disease, socio-demographic characteristics of the\n      subject and the factors related to the structure in which it is supported."
