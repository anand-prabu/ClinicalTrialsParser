            "textblock": "Introduction: Within the emergence of the Internet and for the purposes of providing\n      psychiatric services across distances, the provision of mental health service via video\n      counseling has become a possible way of mental health service delivery. An appropriate\n      systematization of the propaedeutic methods in psychiatry, according to the interactive\n      resources of telemedicine, and a standardized assessment based on clinical records turn this\n      method to a viable alternative for service delivery all over the world. The main benefit of\n      video counseling is an increased access to care services. But, so far, there is still\n      limited research regarding to the effectiveness of telepsychiatry in the management of\n      mental illnesses.\n\n      Objective: To verify the applicability of psychiatric attendance via Interned-based\n      videoconferencing, comparing various quality characteristics between this method and\n      face-to-face attendance, on the basis of a one-year follow-up study with a randomized\n      clinical trial (RCT) design.\n\n      Material and methods: 100 patients of the Institute of Psychiatry (IPq) between 18 to 55\n      years old with depressive disorders are randomly allocated to a control (monthly\n      face-to-face consultation with the attending psychiatrist) or intervention group. The\n      intervention group will have consultations with the attending psychiatrist through\n      internet-based videoconference. For reasons of patient safety, consultations at baseline,\n      and after 6 and 12 months will be realized in a face-to-face form for all patients. At\n      baseline, and after 6 and 12 months mental health, satisfaction with treatment, therapeutic\n      relationship, and medical compliance will be assessed. Depression will be assessed at\n      baseline, and after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months."
