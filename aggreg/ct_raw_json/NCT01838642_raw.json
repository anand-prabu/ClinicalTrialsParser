After one year on study, tumor response will be assessed every 16\n           weeks.\n\n        -  Patients will have a biopsy of their MTC for molecular analysis prior to initiating\n           treatment with ponatinib. Patients will also have a biopsy of their MTC at the time of\n           tumor progression, should that occur."
