II. Determine\n      the nature, degree, and duration of toxic effects of PZA in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive pyrazoloacridine IV over 3 hours every 3 weeks. The minimum\n      treatment period is 2 courses with tumor restaging at 6 weeks. Patients with complete\n      remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) may continue on treatment until refractory (PR) or\n      for at least 3 additional courses (CR). Patients with stable disease continue on therapy for\n      at least 2 more courses. Patients are followed until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 24\n      months."
