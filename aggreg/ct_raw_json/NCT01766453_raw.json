Participants will be provided with a heart rate monitor during their exercise sessions and have the option to perform the aerobic training on a treadmill, upright bike, elliptical machine or recumbent bike as long as heart rate is kept within the prescribed training intensity.  Intensity, duration, resting and exercise heart rates will be recorded for each exercise session for the duration of the intervention to ensure compliance to the exercise program."

Intensity will be controlled through the rate of progression through the Surya Namaskar beginning at a low speed and increasing the rate of movement over the 12 week period. This group will attend exercise sessions under the supervision of a Certified Yoga Instructor. The intensity of yoga will be tracked through heart rate monitors worn by participants. By using a form of yoga that is more intense in its activity and more rapid in posture changes this form of yoga as it is the most likely type to illicit changes in VAT and CVD risk factors."

            "textblock": "South Asians have one of the highest rates of heart disease of all populations and a unique\n      and deleterious obesity phenotype of increased body fat and inner-abdominal compared to\n      those of European background. We have subsequently identified that this unique phenotype\n      accounts for much of the increased heart disease risk in South Asians, with the greater\n      amounts of inner abdominal fat being particularly implicated. In addition, South Asians in\n      Canada have substantially lower levels of leisure-time physical activity.\n\n      At present, we do not know the answers to the following questions:\n\n        1. Is a conventional (standard) physical activity program that has proven effective at\n           reducing inner abdominal fat and heart disease risk factors in populations of European\n           background be effective in South Asians?\n\n        2. Is an alternative physical activity program commonly practiced by South Asians (such as\n           yoga) be effective at reducing inner abdominal fat and heart disease risk factors in\n           South Asians? In this study, we will perform a randomized controlled trial of three\n           conditions\u2014gym-based standard exercise program (SE),yoga exercise program (YE) and\n           non-exercise control (NE).We will recruit 75 post-menopausal South Asian women with\n           abdominal obesity and assign them randomly to one of the three groups (25 per group).\n\n      We anticipate that both the SE and YE programs will be superior to the NE group in terms of\n      reducing VAT and CVD risk factors. Such findings will demonstrate that exercise is an\n      effective method that favourably modifies the obesity phenotype of excess VAT in South\n      Asians, and should be central to health promotion and disease prevention strategies."
