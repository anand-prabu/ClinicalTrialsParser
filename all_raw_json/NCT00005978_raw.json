Giving the drugs in different ways may kill more tumor\n      cells. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Peripheral stem cell\n      or bone marrow transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by\n      chemotherapy or radiation therapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of combination\n      chemotherapy when given before stem cell transplant and radiation therapy in treating\n      patients with neuroblastoma that has not responded to previous treatments."

Patients are stratified according to glomerular\n      filtration rate (at least 100 mL/min vs 60-99 mL/min).\n\n      Patients undergo peripheral blood stem cell harvest or bone marrow harvest at least 2 weeks\n      prior to treatment with 131 I-MIBG.\n\n      Patients receive 131 I-MIBG IV over 120 minutes on day -21; melphalan IV on days -7 to -5;\n      carboplatin and etoposide IV continuously over 96 hours on days -7 to -4; autologous\n      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation IV over 15-30 minutes on day 0; and filgrastim\n      (G-CSF) subcutaneously or IV starting on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover.\n      Radiotherapy is administered to the primary tumor site and metastatic sites twice daily for\n      7 consecutive days within 6 weeks of transplantation or once blood counts have recovered.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 131 I-MIBG, carboplatin, and etoposide\n      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose\n      preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at day 84, and then 2 months later if there is a complete response\n      and/or partial response. Patients who continue therapy on other protocols are followed\n      before starting the new therapy. All patients are followed for life for any delayed toxic\n      effects related to study therapy, secondary malignancies, disease status, and survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-60 patients (15-30 per stratum) will be accrued for this\n      study within 2-3 years."
