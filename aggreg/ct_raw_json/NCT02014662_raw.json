The primary measure will be limb force\n      (assessed electronically from the ergometer), previous studies have demonstrated that\n      functional measures return fairly rapidly, usually between 2-4 days. Additionally, several\n      biomarkers of muscle function  will be measured over 22 days, as well as changes in protein\n      synthesis in biopsy samples Deuterium-labelled water (D2O) will be consumed by  all study\n      participants from Day-3 through Day 22 to aid in quantifying newly synthesized proteins."
