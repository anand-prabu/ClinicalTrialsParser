            "textblock": "To develop an effective combined cognitive therapy (CT) plus drug treatment for patients\n      with drug-resistant depression (DRD) (i.e., depression that is refractory to medication). To\n      develop a manual for combined treatment for DRD that integrates three existing forms of CT\n      (CT for depression, CT for personality disorders, and CT for anxiety disorders), and that\n      specifies interventions for combining CT and medication when two therapists (psychotherapist\n      and pharmacotherapist) provide the treatment. To obtain outpatient, randomized control,\n      pilot data on the clinical value of the combined CT plus drug treatment, using the standard\n      antidepressant desipramine (DMI), to obtain effect sizes and to determine if the treatment\n      merits further investigation in a clinical trial. To develop a therapist adherence measure\n      for the combined treatment.\n\n      Patients receive 1 of 2 treatments: CT plus DMI (n = 18) or DMI plus Clinical Management (n\n      = 12). The first 6 of the 18 CT plus DMI patients are treated in a pre-pilot phase before\n      randomization begins. All treatments continue for 6 months. The major assessment battery is\n      administered at intake, 3 months, 6 months, and follow-up 6 months later. All treatments are\n      closely monitored via audiotapes and supervision for purposes of developing and refining the\n      CT plus drug treatment. The audiotapes are also used for development of the adherence\n      measure. The primary outcome measures are Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores, Beck\n      Depression Inventory scores, percent of patients who achieve clinical remission of symptoms,\n      and percent showing attrition from treatment. Compliance with the treatment regimens is also\n      a targeted and measured outcome variable."
