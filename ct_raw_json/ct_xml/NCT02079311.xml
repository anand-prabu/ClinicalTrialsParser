  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation is undertaken to investigate if patient warming with BARRIER® EasyWarm
      active self-warming blanket differs compared to active warming with forced air warming in
      terms of core body temperature perioperatively.

      A non-inferiority, prospective, open-labelled, randomized, parallel investigation.

      Randomized subjects will receive active warming with BARRIER® EasyWarm or with forced air
      warming. All subjects may receive rescue warming if their core temperature falls below
      35.5°C. Rescue warming is optional and defined as the institution's standard of care to
      prevent hypothermia.

      The primary purpose is to investigate if there is a clinically relevant difference in core
      body temperature between the two treatment groups.

      A total of 60 subjects will be included in the investigation, i.e. 30 subjects in each
      treatment group. The number includes a 30% drop-out rate.
