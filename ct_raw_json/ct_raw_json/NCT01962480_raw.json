            "textblock": "Introduction: Closure of the hernia gap in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair before mesh\n      reinforcement has gained increasing acceptance among surgeons despite creating a\n      tension-based repair. Beneficial effects of this technique have sporadically been reported\n      but no evidence is available from randomized controlled trials.\n\n      The primary purpose is to compare early postoperative activity-related pain in patients\n      undergoing ventral hernia repair with closure of the gap with patients undergoing standard\n      laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (non-closure of the gap). Secondary outcomes are cosmesis\n      and hernia-related quality of life (QoL).\n\n      Material and Methods: A randomized, controlled, double-blinded study is planned. Based on\n      power calculation we will include 40 patients in each arm. Patients undergoing elective\n      laparoscopic umbilical, epigastric, or umbilical trocar-site hernia repair at Hvidovre\n      Hospital and Herlev Hospital, who meet the inclusion criteria, are invited to participate.\n\n      Conclusion: The technique with closure of the gap may induce more postoperative pain, but\n      may be superior with regard to other important surgical outcomes. No studies have previously\n      investigated closure of the gap in the setting of a randomised controlled trial."
