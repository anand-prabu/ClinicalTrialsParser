To measure liver stiffness with sonoelastography in adults with suspect diffuse liver\n           disease who will undergo nonfocal liver biopsy as part of their routine clinical care.\n\n        2. To assess the sensitivity and specificity of sonoelastography for the detection and\n           staging of liver fibrosis.\n\n        3. To obtain sonoelastography values of the liver in healthy children (control subjects)."
