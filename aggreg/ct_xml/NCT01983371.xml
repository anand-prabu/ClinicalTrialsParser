      The purpose of this study is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ferumoxytol-enhanced
      MRI in detecting lymph nodes that have been invaded by tumor cells in patients with
      colorectal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the accuracy of ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI in detecting lymph
      nodes that have been invaded by tumor cells in patients with colorectal cancer.  This study
      will be performed in addition to any ongoing routine care and will not serve as a substitute
      for any imaging tests that would be routinely performed prior to surgery.
