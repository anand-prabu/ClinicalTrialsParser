  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how the body and the cancer react to an investigational
      drug called carfilzomib, including measuring the amount of the study drug in the blood at
      certain times following dosing. This study is being done in people with normal kidney
      function and those with end-stage renal disease to see if they respond differently to the
      study drug.

      Specifically, the purpose of this study is to assess the influence of End-stage Renal
      Disease (ESRD) on area under the curve (both area under the curve, from time 0 to the last
      concentration measured [AUC0-last] and area under the curve, from time 0 extrapolated to
      infinity [AUC0-inf]) of carfilzomib 56 mg/m2 at Cycle 2 Day 1 (C2D1) in subjects with
      relapsed multiple myeloma
