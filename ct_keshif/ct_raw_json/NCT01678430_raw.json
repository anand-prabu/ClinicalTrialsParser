            "textblock": "Chlorambucil (Chl) has been the mainstay of CLL treatment for half a century. However,\n      frontline treatment has improved considerably over the last decade, first by the advent of\n      fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide (FC), and more recently by the addition of the anti-CD20\n      antibody, rituximab, to FC. Although FC-based regimens are considerably more effective than\n      Chl, they are also associated with greater toxicity which makes them inappropriate for less\n      fit patients. This is an important consideration, given that CLL predominantly affects older\n      people who tend to have more co-morbidity. Although a single-arm phase II study (Roche\n      MO20927; NCRI CLL208) has shown that R-Chl is safe and effective, there are no phase III\n      data proving the benefit of adding an anti-CD20 antibody to Chl. This question is currently\n      being addressed by a phase III RCT of Chl with or without ofatumumab (GSK OMB110911 /\n      COMPLEMENT-1 / NCRI CLL7). Ofatumumab is a fully human anti-CD20 antibody that binds to an\n      epitope distinct from that of rituximab and produces more complement-dependent cytotoxicity.\n      The RIAltO trial is a direct follow-on to the NCRI CLL7 phase III RCT trial in less fit\n      patients and therefore the Ofatumumab dose has been selected to mirror the regimen used in\n      that trial."
