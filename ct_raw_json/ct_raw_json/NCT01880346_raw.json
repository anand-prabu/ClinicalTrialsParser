Patients with Cystic Fibrosis have a hard time absorbing certain foods and\n      often have low vitamin D levels. Studies show that vitamin D may help fight infections\n      common in Cystic Fibrosis. The investigators would like to see if a powder pill form of\n      vitamin D will work better than a pill mixed with oil.  Each person will randomly receive\n      either a powder pill or an oil based pill. Blood will be tested while during a 3-4 day\n      hospital stay. The investigators plan to enroll no more than 24 patients with CF from Emory\n      University Hospital for this study."
