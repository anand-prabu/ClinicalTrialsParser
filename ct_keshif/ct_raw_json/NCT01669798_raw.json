Unfortunately, relapse\n      therapy is not curative and treatment is only palliative. Recently two phase II trials\n      demonstrated that anti-angiogenic therapy with bevacizumab alone or in combination with\n      chemotherapy in women with recurrent disease had response rates ranging from 16-24% with an\n      acceptable toxicity profile. However, resistance can develop to VEGF inhibition. Therefore\n      other novel anti-angiogenic agents, such as BIBF 1120, should be evaluated in the treatment\n      of ovarian cancer."
