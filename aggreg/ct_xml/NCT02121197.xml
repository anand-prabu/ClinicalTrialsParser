        300-400 patients who have received at least 2 Ozurdex injections for the treatment of DME,
        were followed for at least 6 months after the last injection and with a minimal BCVA of
        20/200 at baseline (before Ozurdex treatment).

             (e.g. advanced glaucoma, corneal opacity)

          -  Previous ocular trauma or surgery other than cataract extraction

          -  Intravitreal triamcinolone ≤6 months before baseline

          -  Intravitreal bevacizumab, ranibizumab, or pegaptanib &lt;1 months before baseline
