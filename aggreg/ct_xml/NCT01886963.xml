  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to assess the efficacy of the Spy Elite System (LifeCell
      Corporation, Branchburg, NJ, USA) in planning tissue advancement flaps and reducing wound
      complications after complex ventral hernia repairs. Complex ventral hernia repairs are
      associated with a high rate of wound complications. To a large degree these complications
      are caused by creating tissue advancement flaps to close the abdomen, which can compromise
      the blood supply to the skin and subcutaneous tissues. The current standard of care for
      assessment of blood perfusion to the flaps is a surgeon's clinical judgment. It is, however,
      often inaccurate.  The Spy Elite System was developed to address this problem. The Spy Elite
      System is a device that enables surgeons to visualize and evaluate tissue perfusion in real
      time. It can help the surgeon to identify optimal flap design and reduce the risk of
      postoperative wound complications related to tissue ischemia. The primary goal of this study
      is to evaluate the efficacy of Spy Elite System to aid a surgeon in creating tissue flaps
      with adequate blood supply through a prospective, randomized clinical trial. The Spy Elite
      System has been used successfully for assessing the viability of mastectomy flaps in breast
      surgery and has been shown to be extremely sensitive in predicting mastectomy flap necrosis.
      However, no clinical trial has been conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of the Spy
      Elite System for assessing the viability of abdominal subcutaneous flaps in complex ventral
      hernia repairs.
