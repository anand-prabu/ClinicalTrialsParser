Bipolar Spectrum Disorder (or sub-threshold bipolar\n             disorder) is operationalized as having severe mood disturbance, which meets DSM-IV\n             Criteria A for bipolar disorder but displays fewer elements in Criteria B (only\n             require 2 items for elation category and 3 for irritability)\n\n          4. Subjects must score \u2265 20 on the YMRS (Young Mania Rating Scale)\n\n          5. Subjects and their legal representative must have a level of understanding sufficient\n             to communicate intelligently with the investigator and study coordinator, and to\n             cooperate with all tests and examinations required by the protocol.\n\n          6. Subjects and their legal representative must be considered reliable reporters.\n\n          7.

For concomitant therapy used to treat ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity\n             Disorder), subjects must have been on a stable dose of the medication for 1 month\n             prior to study enrollment, and the dose of the ADHD therapy cannot change throughout\n             the duration of the study.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Investigator and his/her immediate family; defined as the investigator's spouse,\n             parent, child, grandparent, or grandchild.\n\n          2.

Any other concomitant medication with primary central nervous system activity other\n             than specified in the Concomitant Medication portion of the Protocol.\n\n          8.
