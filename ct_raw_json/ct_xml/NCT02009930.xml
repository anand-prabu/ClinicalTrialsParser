      Hypothesis: Enlisted military members with 10 or more years of service and at least one
      cardiovascular risk factor will demonstrate a higher risk of future cardiac events as
      assessed by coronary artery calcium scoring than the risk calculated by the Framingham Risk
      Score.

    <textblock>
      While the military is making strides towards improving the health and habits of service
      members, there are many aspects of the military culture that negatively affect the
      cardiovascular health of military members.  Smoking/tobacco use, poor eating habits with
      Meals Ready-to-eat (MRE) and ready access to fast food establishments on base, inconsistent
      exercise, the socioeconomic status of enlisted members and the stress of deployment are all
      factors that contribute to increased risk of cardiovascular disease during military service.
       Currently the calculation of a patient's Framingham risk score is the most commonly used
      method of calculating a patient's cardiovascular risk, and this calculation is based on age,
      smoking history, blood pressure, and lab values and compares it to a general population's
      risk.  By the use of a cardiac CT scan, a Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) score can be
      calculated and used to estimate the degree of atherosclerosis already present in each
      patient's coronary arteries, and thus establishing their risk of future cardiovascular
      events.  CAC scoring is a more patient-specific way of identifying cardiovascular risk.  The
      purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence of atherosclerosis in enlisted military
      members with at least 10 years of service and one or more cardiovascular risk factor and to
      determine if their risk of a cardiovascular event is higher than predicted by the Framingham
      score.  If CAC scoring is demonstrated to be more accurate, particularly if it is more
      likely to detect risk, it may be used in the future to better risk stratify this population
      of the military.  The CAC results in patients could also be a motivating factor to create
      changes in the military culture to attempt to mitigate these risks and create a healthier
      fighting force.
