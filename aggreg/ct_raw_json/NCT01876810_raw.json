            "textblock": "Animal studies have shown that drugs acting as agonists at alpha-type peroxisome\n      proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR\u03b1) suppress nicotine self-administration, attenuate\n      relapse to nicotine-seeking behavior in the reinstatement model, and block nicotine-induced\n      neuronal firing and dopamine release in reward pathways of the brain. These results have\n      been demonstrated with synthetic PPAR\u03b1 agonists and with fibrate drugs (clofibrate,\n      fenofibrate), which are used clinically to treat elevated cholesterol and triglycerides\n      levels. Thus, PPAR\u03b1 is a potential target for the treatment of tobacco addiction. This is\n      the first human study to investigate whether a fibrate drug (gemfibrozil, Lopid\u00ae) can reduce\n      nicotine reward and aid smokers in becoming tobacco abstinent.\n\n      The objectives of this study are:\n\n        1. to investigate the effect of gemfibrozil on laboratory measures of nicotine\n           reinforcement and cue-elicited craving\n\n        2. to screen for the ability of gemfibrozil to aid smoking abstinence during a brief quit\n           attempt\n\n        3. to examine the validity of using laboratory measures of tobacco dependence to predict\n           smoking abstinence and possible gemfibrozil-related increases in smoking abstinence\n\n      This outpatient study will be conducted at the Center for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH)\n      in Toronto, Canada. This site will enroll 40 adult smokers who intend to quit smoking in the\n      next 3 months.\n\n      The study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design comparing the effects of\n      gemfibrozil and placebo. The study will comprise two 2-week medication phases with a washout\n      period of at least one week.  At the end of the first medication week laboratory measures\n      will be taken and during the second medication week participants will make a quit attempt\n      and abstinence will be assessed.\n\n      Outcome measures include laboratory assessments of nicotine reinforcement and smoking cue\n      reactivity. The measure of nicotine reinforcement is the percentage of nicotine cigarette\n      puffs chosen during a forced-choice task. Measures of cue reactivity include tobacco\n      craving, mood, and autonomic responsivity. Other measures are days of smoking abstinence\n      during the quit-attempt weeks. Abstinence is assessed by self-reports of no smoking and by\n      breath carbon monoxide < 5 ppm on clinic visits. Other assessments of abstinence include\n      self-reported tobacco craving and withdrawal."
