The study\n      will assess the use of the autoinjector inside the clinic setting and outside the clinic\n      setting. The study will also assess the safety and tolerability of belimumab administered\n      subcutaneously (SC) via the autoinjector. Subjects will self-administer belimumab SC into\n      the thigh or abdomen using the autoinjector device for 8 weekly doses. Subjects will return\n      for a follow-up visit 4 weeks after the last SC dose of belimumab. All injections will be\n      assessed by the investigators for success based on direct observation and/or the subject\n      diary. A total of 118 subjects (treated with at least one dose of study drug) are planned to\n      be enrolled in this study."
