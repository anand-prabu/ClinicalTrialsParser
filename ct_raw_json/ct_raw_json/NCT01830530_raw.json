To assess the efficacy and safety of combination of telmisartan 80 mg with nifedipine\n           GITS 30 mg in preventing a possible excessive BP increase in hypertensive subjects\n           exposed to high altitude.\n\n      The following data will be collected during the study at the different steps:\n\n        -  Clinical history\n\n        -  Symptoms and adverse events questionnaire\n\n        -  Conventional BP and heart rate (HR) measurement - seated measurements with a validated\n           oscillometric device will be performed after at least 5 minutes rest on non-dominant\n           arm; two measurements will be performed 1-2 minutes apart and their average will be\n           used in the analyses\n\n        -  Vital signs:\n\n      respiratory rate - will be measured manually over 60 seconds body height and weight, waist\n      circumference blood oxygen saturation  (SpO2)\n\n        -  Lake Louise Score\n\n        -  24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM; AND TM2430, AND, Japan)\n\n        -  Echocardiography\n\n        -  Arterial properties assessment\n\n        -  Six minute walking test (6MWT)\n\n        -  Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test (CPET) in a subgroup of subjects\n\n        -  Polysomnography with a portable device\n\n        -  Pulmonary function tests (only at sea level baseline visit)\n\n        -  Fluid balance chart\n\n        -  Blood and urine analyses: Visit 1: electrolytes, creatinine, estimated glomerular\n           filtration rate (eGFR), glycemia, renin, angiotensin, aldosterone, plasma\n           catecholamines, 24 h urinary sodium excretion, carbonic anhydrase activity and\n           isoenzyme expression (in 50 randomly selected subjects), samples for genetic studies.\n           Visit 2: electrolytes, creatinine, eGFR.
