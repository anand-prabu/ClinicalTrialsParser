Metformin has been shown to\n      decrease cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance,\n      but the mechanism of cardiovascular protection is unknown.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the reversibility of subclinical cardiovascular\n      abnormalities in obese adolescents with insulin resistance after a six-month course of\n      Metformin. The investigators hypothesized that the beneficial effects of Metformin will be\n      progressive and sustained after six months of therapy."
