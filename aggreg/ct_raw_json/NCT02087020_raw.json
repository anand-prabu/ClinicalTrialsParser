Debridement, antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR)\n      is recommended in early infections (< 4 weeks) and stable implants. Aims: To define the\n      success rate of DAIR in early infections and to identify predictors for success. Material\n      and methods: In a retrospective cohort study we included patients with hip- or knee\n      arthroplasties reoperated for an early PJI at Danderyd Hospital 2007-2012. Logistic\n      regression analysis was used to identify risk factors affecting success rate. Primary\n      outcome variable was the success of the DAIR treatment. Secondary outcome variable vas risk\n      factors for treatment failure."
