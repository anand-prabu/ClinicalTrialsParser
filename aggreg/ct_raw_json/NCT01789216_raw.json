The intervention will begin within\n      48 hours of admission and continue for no longer than two weeks or up to the time of\n      definitive fixation.\n\n      Group 1: standard pain management, plus up to two weeks of oral placebo, plus intravenous\n      and oral placebo for 48 hours at each surgical procedure.\n\n      Group 2: standard pain management, plus up to two weeks of oral non-steroidal\n      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (meloxicam), plus intravenous NSAIDs (ketorolac) and oral\n      placebo for 48 hours at each surgical procedure.\n\n      Group 3: standard pain management, plus up to two weeks of oral pregabalin, plus intravenous\n      placebo and oral pregabalin for 48 hours at each surgical procedure.\n\n      Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the effect of standard pain management (Group 1) vs. standard pain\n      management plus pre and peri-operative NSAIDs (Group 2 - meloxicam + ketorolac) in the\n      treatment of severe lower limb fractures.\n\n      Hypothesis 1a:  When compared to patients who received standard of care pain management,\n      patients treated with NSAIDs will: (1) have reduced post operative opioid utilization; (2)\n      report reduced levels of persistent pain; and (3) have noninferior rates of surgery for\n      nonunion.\n\n      Hypothesis 1b: When compared to patients who received standard of care pain management,\n      patients treated with NSAIDs will benefit from (1) improved post operative pain control; (2)\n      improved pre operative pain control; (3) reduced lengths of stay; (4) reduced pain\n      interference; (5) improved functional outcomes; (6) lower levels of depression and\n      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); (7) improved overall health status; and (8) have\n      noninferior rates of analgesic treatment related side effects.\n\n      Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the effect of standard pain management (Group 1) vs. standard pain\n      management plus pre and peri-operative pregabalin (Group 3) in the treatment of severe lower\n      limb fractures.\n\n      Hypothesis 2a : When compared to patients who received standard of care pain management,\n      patients treated with pregabalin will: (1) have reduced post operative opioid utilization;\n      (2) report reduced levels of persistent pain; and (3) have noninferior rates of surgery for\n      nonunion.\n\n      Hypothesis 2b: When compared to patients who received standard of care pain management,\n      patients treated with pregabalin will benefit from (1) improved post operative pain control;\n      (2) improved pre operative pain control; (3) reduced lengths of stay; (4) reduced pain\n      interference; (5) improved functional outcomes; (6) lower levels of depression and\n      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); (7) improved overall health status; and (8) have\n      noninferior rates of analgesic treatment related side effects.\n\n      Specific Aim 3: Estimate the incremental cost effectiveness of each adjunctive analgesic\n      therapy relative to standard of care analgesic therapy in the treatment of severe lower limb\n      fractures.   Costs will be estimated from both the health care provider perspective and the\n      societal perspective.  The time horizon for cost-effectiveness analysis will be based on the\n      actual period of observation .  Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be calculated\n      for: (a) study group 2 (NSAIDS - meloxicam + ketorolac) relative to standard of care; and\n      (b) study group 3 (pregabalin) relative to standard of care. For purpose of\n      cost-effectiveness analysis, the effect will be measured as unit change in specific outcome\n      metrics at 12 months (or longer period as available) compared to baseline.  The following\n      cost-effectiveness metrics, all relative to standard of care, will be reported:\n\n        1. incremental cost per unit change in the Brief Pain Inventory\n\n        2. incremental cost per unit change in the Short Muscular Function Assessment (SFMA)\n\n        3. incremental cost per unit change in health state preference (\"utility\") as derived from\n           the VR-12\n\n      PTOA Pilot Study: Additional funding was received from NIH to conduct a pilot, observational\n      study of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA), leveraging current resources of the Pain\n      study.  PTOA is an important outcome in the population to be enrolled in the Pain study.\n\n      The aims of the PTOA Study are to: (1) measure the incidence of PTOA and chronic pain for up\n      to 24 months following fracture reduction surgery and (2) quantify the extent to which\n      fracture severity and post-reduction contact stress are related to the development of PTOA.\n      Accomplishment of these aims will require (1) for all patients in the Pain study:  complete\n      a PTOA survey at 12 months and at any subsequent visits that are conducted as part of\n      standard of care and provide access to all standard of care imaging studies completed during\n      the study period and (2) for a subset of 60 pilon fracture patients enrolled in the Pain\n      study for whom post-operative CT scans are not standard of care, obtain additional consent\n      for completion of a study-funded post-operative CT scan and 24 month radiographic study."
