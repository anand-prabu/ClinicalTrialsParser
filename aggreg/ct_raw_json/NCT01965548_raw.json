For\n      exsanguinating patients, open splenectomy is still the proper choice of treatment if the\n      spleen is a significant source of bleeding. However, for hemodynamic stable patients with\n      splenic injury, non-operative management (NOM) is an alternative, assuming they have no\n      other indication for surgery (peritonitis).\n\n      Non-operative management includes observation and/or splenic artery embolisation (SAE), but\n      the indications for observation and SAE varies between trauma centers. The greatest\n      advantage of NOM is the preservation of splenic function.\n\n      In the investigators hospital splenic artery embolisation was introduced in 2007. The\n      investigators want to describe the treatment  of splenic injuries in their hospital, to see\n      if the number of splenectomies has been recduced after 2007, and to see if SAE has also been\n      used in transferred trauma patients."
