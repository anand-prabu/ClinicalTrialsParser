            "textblock": "Individuals with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) have a defective protein, which is known as the\n      cystic-fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). The CFTR transports salt and hydrates\n      mucous. CFTR defects may result in the accumulation of thick mucous in the sinus cavities.\n      As a result, the tiny hair-like structures that sweep mucous out of the sinuses cannot\n      function properly, which can lead to recurrent infection and swelling of the sinus walls.\n      When symptoms are persistent for more than 12 weeks, this is known as chronic rhinosinusitis\n      (CRS). The symptoms that are associated with CRS are nasal discharge, congestion, facial\n      pain or pressure and reduced sense of smell. CRS in non-CF patients affects a large number\n      of individuals in Canada and has been found to be associated with poor quality of life. In\n      the CF population the life expectancy is increasing but chronic disease like CRS is becoming\n      increasingly prevalent. Investigators currently do not know the impact that CRS has on the\n      health-related quality of life in adults with CF and how many suffer from symptoms. The\n      investigators aim to determine the impact of CRS among adults with CF, in order to gain a\n      better understanding of chronic disease among these individuals. The investigators strongly\n      feel this research will improve the referral processes between Respirologists and\n      Otolaryngologists, thereby improving treatment and quality of life for patients."
