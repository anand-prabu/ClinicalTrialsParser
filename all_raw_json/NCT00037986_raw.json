To measure the effects of audiological intervention on selected domain specific (i.e.,\n           Communicative, Interpersonal, and Social roles) and overall functioning using the\n           WHO-DASII, a generic health measure conceptually grounded in the ICIDH-2 model of\n           disablement and functioning.\n\n        2. To measure the effects of audiological intervention on selected domain specific (i.e.,\n           Role Functioning-Emotional; and, Social Functioning) and overall functioning using the\n           MOS-SF36V, a generic health measure currently utilized in the Veteran's Health\n           Administration.\n\n        3. To determine the accuracy with which measures of audibility (SII), hearing handicap\n           (HHIE), and, hearing disability (APHAB) predict domain specific and overall\n           functioning, and life-satisfaction as measured by the WHO-DASII and the MOS-SF36V will\n           be evaluated.\n\n        4. To compare hearing aid treatment effects as measured by changes in WHO-DASII domain\n           specific and overall functioning scores to those measured by changes in disease\n           specific instruments examining similar constructs.\n\n        5. To compare hearing aid treatment effects as measured by changes in MOS-SF36V domain\n           specific and overall functioning scores to those measured by changes in disease\n           specific instruments examining similar constructs.\n\n        6. To determine and compare cost-effectiveness of hearing aid intervention as calculated\n           using WHO-DASII and MOS SF-36V outcome data.\n\n      The long-term research objective is to compare the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of\n      audiologic intervention with those of other health care interventions commonly associated\n      with the veteran population (e.g. mental health, cardiology, pulmonary, orthopedic, etc.)."
