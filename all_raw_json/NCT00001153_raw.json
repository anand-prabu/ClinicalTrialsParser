The degree of ocular pigmentation is\n      assessed clinically by estimating the melanin content of the iris, retinal pigment\n      epithelium, and choroid.  Visual function is measured in the conventional manner to study\n      central vision, and electrophysiological methods to detect a misrouting of the visual\n      pathways.  The purpose of this study is to document the visual deficit and the pigmentary\n      changes of patients with albinism, to observe their natural course, and to determine whether\n      misrouting of the visual pathways is present and is correlated with pigmentation."
