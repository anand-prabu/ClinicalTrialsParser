  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PF-05180999 is a novel phosphodiesterase-2 (PDE2) inhibitor.  The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of multiple doses of PF-05180999
      administered twice daily over 14 days.  Exploratory measures of PDE2 inhibition will also be
      evaluated in blood and blister fluid.

    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes.  Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

    <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (Vz/F) is influenced by the fraction absorbed.</description>
