  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we will use a multi-modal imaging approach of MRS and fMRI to comprehensively
      assess the biological changes in the brain associated with EFV-based regimen (EFV/FTC/TDF),
      specifically alterations in the brain circuitry, function and local neurochemistry, and
      their correlation with neuropsychological function.  In a cohort of HIV-infected patients
      who are clinically stable on the commonly use regimen of EFV/emtricitabine (FTC)/truvada
      (TDF) or Atripla, we propose to replace the EFV component with a new integrase inhibitor,
      elvitegravir (EVG) boosted with cobicistat (COBI), given as the EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF Single
      Tablet Regimen (STR)  to evaluate the EFV-related neural alterations. This is a
      multidisciplinary study which involves a team of infectious disease experts in the field of
      HIV, neuroradiologists with expertise in fMRI and MRS techniques to study various central
      nervous system and psychiatric disorders and a psychiatrist with experience and expertise in
      research on abnormalities of affective and motivational processing in the context of
      neuropsychiatric disorders. We will utilize the established clinical research platform in
      the Infectious Disease outpatient clinical practice at the Brigham and Women's Hospital,
      where there is currently have many ongoing HIV-related studies and a large panel of
      HIV-infected patients motivated to be involved in clinically relevant research. We propose
      to use advanced neuroimaging to measure biologically changes in the brain associated with
      long-term EFV use with the following specific aims:

        1. Determine changes in neurometabolites measured by MRS in the brain associated with
           long-term EFV use

        2. Assess for alterations in neural activity correlated with affective symptoms associated
           with EFV vs STR use using fMRI, and their associations with changes in neurometabolites
           assessed by MRS, and with changes in cognition assessed by Trail Making and Digit
           Substitution Tests.

        3. Determine changes in emotion, cognition and sleep quality after switching from EFV to
           STR, and how they correlate with subject treatment preference.

      This clinical study will extend our current understanding of EFV neurotoxicity by further
      defining the nature of these biological changes.  Further elucidation of the neurobiological
      underpinnings of EFV-induced CNS toxicity will have clinical relevance in improving the
      quality of life and drug adherence of HIV-infected patients on ART, especially among older
      patients or those with baseline neuropsychiatric disorders, whom at baseline are more
      vulnerable to neurocognitive decline from long-term HIV infection.
