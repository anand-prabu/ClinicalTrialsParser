Of these higher\n      menaquinones, MK-7 was suggested to be the most effective form with respect to intestinal\n      absorption, biologic half-life time, and efficacy on circulating biochemical markers. MK-7\n      is a natural product that is found in cheese, curd, and the Japanese food natto. Therefore,\n      a nutrient enriched dairy product has been developed containing MK-7. The efficacy of this\n      new product will be investigated on vitamin K status and on general health markers."
