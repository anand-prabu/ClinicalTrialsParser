To compare the safety and tolerability\n      of the different treatment regimens.

To study the emergence of resistance to\n      ZDV, lamivudine (3TC), stavudine (d4T), delavirdine (DLV), and indinavir (IDV) in treated\n      patients. To correlate the antiviral and immunologic activity and emergence of drug\n      resistance with pharmacologic parameters of study drugs. To delineate the pharmacokinetic\n      interactions of IDV and DLV. [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/19/97: To delineate the possible\n      development of cellular resistance to nucleoside analogs and the consequences of switching\n      nucleoside study drugs on intracellular phosphorylation.] To document rates and patterns of\n      adherence over the course of the study, from day of randomization through 48 weeks. [AS PER\n      AMENDMENT 8/24/98: To define long-term durability of the virologic activity of the different\n      treatment regimens, as defined by the proportion of patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA levels\n      that remains below the limit of detection. To define long-term tolerability of the different\n      treatment regimens.] Although a change in reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors is\n      recommended when adding or changing protease inhibitors in a treatment regimen, the choice\n      of available RT inhibitors is often limited by prior exposure, toxicity, or pharmacologic\n      interaction with the protease inhibitors. This study addresses the question of whether to\n      continue 3TC or substitute the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) DLV\n      when adding IDV to therapy for patients previously treated with ddI or d4T plus 3TC who have\n      greater than 500 copies/ml of plasma HIV-1 RNA. Although the activity of DLV as monotherapy\n      or in combination with nucleoside  reverse transcriptase inhibitors is of limited duration\n      due to rapid emergence of resistance, it is possible that DLV will contribute significantly\n      to the activity of 3-drug regimens that include a new RT inhibitor plus a protease\n      inhibitor."
