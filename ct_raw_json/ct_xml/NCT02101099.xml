  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine if more force is used during colonoscopy when patients
      receive monitored anesthesia with propofol versus conscious sedation.  Force measurements
      will be performed using the  colonoscopy force monitor  (CFM).  This device measures the
      magnitude and direction of force applied to the  insertion tube of a standard colonoscope
      during colonoscopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized factorial design of colonoscopy with either propofol administered anesthesia or
      conscious sedation.  Twelve experienced endoscopists from community and academic centers
      will perform colonoscopy using either propofol or conscious sedation on a group of 12
      patients for each endoscopist for a study total of 144 patients.  An equal number of male
      and female patients will be included in each group.

        All adult male and female patients between the ages of 30 and 75 presenting to the
        participating sites for screening or diagnostic colonoscopy to be performed by any of the
        investigators will be considered for inclusion.

        Exclusion Criteria:
