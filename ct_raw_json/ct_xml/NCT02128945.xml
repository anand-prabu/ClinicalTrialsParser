  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The application of positron emission tomography with lymphoproliferative diseases today
      provides diagnostic and therapeutic information of major importance , especially in terms of
      speed and quality of response to treatment. The radiopharmaceutical used in clinical
      practice for this exam is fluorodeoxyglucose 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose
      fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]-FDG) . However , the uptake of this tracer is not elective in
      lymphoid tissues , with a lack of specificity. In addition , the avidity of this tracer is
      unequal according to the histological subtype (lack of sensitivity).

      To try to improve the results of this clinical exploration of lymphoid malignancies, the
      investigators developed a new radiopharmaceutical ( [18F] - fludarabine ). The idea of
      transforming the fludarabine radiopharmaceutical is based on the existence of a fluorine
      atom in the molecule and the pharmacokinetic characteristics of this drug. The
      [18F]-Fludarabine is a new radiopharmaceutical reproducing the same dosage formulation of
      fludarabine , a drug used for the treatment of certain types of lymphoproliferative
      diseases, especially those where the tumor cells have a low proliferation kinetics . This
      drug is used in therapy in particular pharmacokinetic effect for a high affinity for the
      lymphoid tissue . Preclinical results on normal and lymphoma xenograft -bearing mice showed
      a specificity restricted to lymphoid tissue fixation with [18F]-Fludarabine compared with
      [18F]-FDG .

      Based on these encouraging results , the investigators propose in this work to explore the
      Dosimetry and Biodistribution of [18F] - Fludarabine in human lymphoproliferative diseases :
      1)A first group of patients with non-Hodgkin's large cell lymphomas in which it already has
      a wealth of experience in exploration [18F]-FDG, and 2) a second group of patients with
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia, where the results of the exploration [18F]-FDG are considered
      disappointing and did not, for this reason, experienced clinical development.
