Determine the toxicity of\n      this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene IV over 5\n      minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a minimum of 2 courses in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding\n      disease after completion of course 2 receive additional courses. Patients are followed every\n      3 months for 5 years, and then annually thereafter until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 16-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 1\n      year."
