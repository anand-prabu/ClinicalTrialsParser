Since they are at risk for\n      accelerated trajectories to drug dependence once drug use begins, low-income racially\n      diverse populations pose particular concern for public health policy makers and drug-use\n      prevention efforts.  The study will be the first to standardize drug screening and\n      primary-care clinician delivered brief intervention among racially diverse \"at risk\" drug\n      users, that is users with casual or frequent use without the physiological or psychological\n      manifestations of dependence, to reduce their 'at risk' use of drugs, and it may effectively\n      interrupt their pathway to dependence."

            "textblock": "The Quit Using Drugs Intervention Trial (QUIT) will be the first randomized controlled trial\n      in the U.S. that is powered to detect the effect of a primary care clinician delivered brief\n      intervention protocol for reducing 'at risk' drug use and drug-related harm among low-income\n      adult patients (ages 18 and older) at 2 safety net clinics in Los Angeles County.  For this\n      small trial, we will sample patients with 'at risk' use of drugs (marijuana, crack/cocaine,\n      amphetamines/methamphetamines, inhalants, sedatives or sleeping pills, hallucinogens, and\n      opiates), the most commonly used serious drugs among patients at our clinic sites.  \"At\n      risk\" drug use is defined in this study as current use (past 90 days) of drug measured as a\n      self-reported total score of 4 to 26 on the WHO Alcohol Substance Involvement Screening Test\n      (ASSIST).  A total of 8,000 patients will be approached for screening to yield a 12-month\n      effective sample size of 200 eligible patients per condition (1) an intervention condition\n      or (2) a control condition involving care as usual. In the intervention condition, very\n      brief (less than 5 minutes) clinician advice regarding quitting drug use will be followed by\n      two 2 and 6 week post-visit drug health education sessions on quitting drug use and\n      cautioning against use of other 'at risk' substance use such as alcohol and tobacco.\n      Patients assigned to the control condition will receive standard care for drug use at the\n      baseline visit with their clinician, which will be followed by two post-visit telephone\n      health education sessions that will be of equal duration as the intervention sessions but\n      will address healthy eating, physical activity, and seat belt use. Follow-up assessments\n      will be conducted at 3 month post-randomization. The framework for the QUIT project is the\n      Social Action Theory, and the brief intervention protocol is based on NIDA's principles on\n      prevention research and the utility of the 5 A's approach for assisting behavioral changes\n      among patients (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) in the clinic setting. If found to be\n      effective in the community health center setting, this clinician and telephone drug-use\n      health education program could become a model for health promotion activities. that would be\n      expanded to all 'at risk' substance use and shared between community health centers."
