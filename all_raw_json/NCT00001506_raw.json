This protocol was developed to allow subject enrollment for\n      teaching purposes and to allow for second opinions regarding relatively complicated\n      patients. The latter function promotes a critical link between the NCI, CCR Dermatology\n      Branch and the local and national extramural medical communities.\n\n      Objective\n\n      Primary:\n\n      - To provide clinical material to fulfill the educational mission of the\n\n      Dermatology Branch.\n\n      - To learn about the natural history of selected dermatologic diseases.\n\n      Secondary:\n\n        -  To screen patients for inclusion in other protocols.\n\n        -  To assist in the diagnosis and/or management of patients with rare skin diseases and\n           congenital or genetically linked skin conditions.\n\n      Eligibility\n\n      All subjects regardless of age, gender, or racial/ethnic group with dermatologic disease or\n      systemic disease with cutaneous manifestations.\n\n      Design\n\n      Patients enrolled in this protocol will be evaluated and treated according to generally\n      available, standard procedures and therapeutic modalities.
