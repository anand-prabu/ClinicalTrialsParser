Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or\n      die. Combining chemotherapy with bone marrow transplantation may allow the doctor to give\n      higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation in\n      treating patients who have hematologic cancer."

Patients age 18 and over undergo TBI twice a day on days -6 to -4. All patients\n      then receive cyclophosphamide IV daily on days -3 and -2. Males with acute lymphocytic\n      leukemia, high-grade lymphoma, intermediate-grade lymphoma, or marrow or CNS involvement\n      receive radiotherapy boost to the testes. On day 0, patients receive infusion of bone marrow\n      from unrelated donors with 1 of the following: 1 HLA-A or B non-cross-reactive group\n      mismatch; 1 HLA-A or B cross-reactive group mismatch; or an HLA-A, B, and C match with an\n      HLA-DRB1 or DQB1 mismatch.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years."
