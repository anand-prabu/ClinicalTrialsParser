Patients are stratified by\n      center, prior hormone replacement therapy before diagnosis, and concurrent tamoxifen\n      therapy. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive one of the following: Women with an intact uterus whose last\n           menstrual bleeding has occurred within 2 years receive continuous oral cyclic\n           estradiol-norethindrone combination comprising estradiol only on days 1-12, estradiol\n           plus norethindrone on days 13-22, and then estradiol only on days 22-28. Women with an\n           intact uterus whose last menstrual bleeding occurred more than 2 years prior to study\n           receive continuous daily oral estradiol-norethindrone combination. Women who have had a\n           hysterectomy receive continuous daily oral estradiol only.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive one or more non-hormonal therapies (e.g., clonidine, beta\n           blockers, psychological support, physical exercise, acupuncture).\n\n      Treatment in both arms continues for 2 years in the absence of disease progression. Patients\n      may continue their randomized treatment regimen at the discretion of the treating physician.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed 3 times during the study and then every two years thereafter.\n      Gynecological health is assessed at 3 months, 6 months, and one year during the study and\n      then annually for at least 5 years. Breast cancer is assessed every 6 months for 3 years and\n      then annually thereafter or at the discretion of the treating physician.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,300 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-6\n      years."
