            "textblock": "The metabolic syndrome is a common condition in which different degrees of hypertension,\n      impaired glucose tolerance, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and central fat accumulation, as well\n      as prothrombotic and proinflammatory states cluster together in the same individual. The\n      modified National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines\n      defined the metabolic syndrome subjects as individuals with 3 or more following criterion:\n\n        1. Waist circumference: in male \u226590 cm and female \u226580 cm\n\n        2. Raised triglycerides: > 150 mg/dL\n\n        3. Reduced HDL cholesterol: <40 mg/dL in males, <50 mg/dL in females\n\n        4. Raised blood pressure: systolic blood pressure >130 or diastolic blood pressure  >85\n           mmHg\n\n        5. Raised fasting plasma glucose: (FPG)>100 mg/dL\n\n      Changes in macronutrient composition have been used to promote weight loss and enhance\n      insulin sensitivity, independent of an emphasis on overall calorie ingestion. Protective\n      effects of fish intake on the development of insulin resistance has been reported in\n      prospective epidemiological studies. Further, long chain omega-3 PUFAs supplementation may\n      improve insulin sensitivity in patients with impaired glucose tolerance and in patients with\n      T2DM.\n\n      However, this has not been clearly demonstrated in an intervention trial in Taiwan.\n      Furthermore, the effect of supplementation of long chain omega-3 PUFAs on metabolic risk\n      factors and insulin resistance, except for demonstrated benefit in terms of decreased\n      triglycerides, needs further investigation among Asians.\n\n      This 13-week, randomized controlled study will assign approximately 200 subjects meeting\n      criteria for the Metabolic Syndrome (50 each) to the following four arms 1) Standard Taiwan\n      Diet plan; 2) Herbalife meal replacement diet program (Low fat diet); 3) Standard Taiwan\n      Diet plan plus healthy oil supplement (Herbalifeline\u00ae) and 4) Herbalife meal replacement\n      plan (Low fat diet) plus healthy oil supplement (Herbalifeline\u00ae). All participants will meet\n      with a registered dietitian to assist them with their diet efforts.\n\n      In this study, we aim to study the effects of low fat diet with reduced omega-6 PUFAs alone\n      and the same low fat diet with omega-3 fatty acids supplementation on cardiometabolic\n      profile and circulating fatty acid profiles in subjects with the metabolic syndrome."
