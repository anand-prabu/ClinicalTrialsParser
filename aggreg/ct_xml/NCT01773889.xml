  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that adding pegylated IFN (IFN)a-2b to denileukin
      diftitox improves the potential of denileukin diftitox alone to deplete regulatory T cells
      (Tregs) and will thereby boost tumor immunity in patients with advanced-stage epithelial
      ovarian cancers, enhancing treatment efficacy.
