This can lead to the\n      worsening of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, sleep apnea, coronary artery disease\n      and osteoarthritis.  The medical management of obesity involves dietary counseling and\n      education, behavioral counseling with goal setting, and exercise. Patients with short sleep\n      periods in the range of 5 to 7 hours per night are often heavier than normal sleepers even\n      after controlling for other factors. We hypothesize that the addition of focused counseling\n      on healthy sleeping to counseling on healthy eating (dieting) and healthy exercise can help\n      women lose weight."
