Treatment repeats every 2\n      weeks for a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
