Furthermore, the\n      application of high-dose methotrexate-based regimen is complex, needing be hydrated,\n      alkalified and detoxified, and treatment-related toxicity mortality is severe[3,4]. In an\n      attempt to improve upon these poor results and reduce treatment-related side effects, we\n      will treat about 15-20 PCNSL patients with temozolomide concurrent chemoradiotherapy at the\n      outset and then adjuvant chemotherapy for 6 cycles with temozolomide, nedaplatin,\n      vincristine, as part of front-line therapy.
