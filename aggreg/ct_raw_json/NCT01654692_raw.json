            "textblock": "Immunotherapy, chemotherapy and chemotherapy combinations are currently the most effective\n      accepted systemic treatments for metastatic melanoma. However, significant and prolonged\n      responses are rare.\n\n      The trial will determine the additional benefit achieved from adding fotemustine to the\n      anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody,ipilimumab .\n\n      It is assumed that the mechanism by which ipilimumab augments the effects of chemotherapy in\n      animal models relies on the ability of the cytotoxic agent to induce apoptosis of tumor\n      cells. These apoptotic cells then can function as potent inducers of an immune response\n      against any non-tolerized antigen that they contain. Thus, the chemotherapy may be creating\n      an in vivo autologous tumor vaccine. Ipilimumab prevents the down regulation of this immune\n      response, allowing for tumor rejection. Animal models evaluating the combination of\n      anti-CTLA4 antibody and chemotherapy  have given only a brief acute treatment with\n      chemotherapy - presumably adequate to induce some tumor apoptosis, but inadequate to induce\n      significant prolonged tumor rejection.\n\n      Since patients with metastatic melanoma generally require therapy within a relatively short\n      period of time, this protocol will allow for the use of fotemustine. Standard dosing of\n      fotemustine will be used to optimize the chance for tumor control."
