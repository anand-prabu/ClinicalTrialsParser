A comparable evidence-based HIV/STI prevention intervention for adolescents\n      is not available in Brazil; this application targets this need. To address this public\n      health need and opportunity, we propose to a) adapt a U.S. efficacious family-based HIV\n      prevention intervention for youth with MHD (STYLE; R01MH63008; PI: Brown) within the three\n      types of settings providing most of the care to adolescents with MHD in Brazil; and b) pilot\n      test the intervention to examine the acceptability, feasibility, and implementation\n      parameters of the resulting Brazil intervention (STYLE-B) within these settings, and to\n      determine key research parameters in preparation for an implementation randomized clinical\n      trial (RCT). Using quantitative and qualitative methods we will explore the contextual\n      influences on sexual risk behavior of Brazilian youth ages 13-24 with MHD to inform\n      intervention adaptation.  The investigators will then pilot-test STYLE-B with a sample of\n      male and female youth age 13-24 years (n=144) with MHD who are in MH treatment in four\n      community-based sites.  Youth/caregiver dyads will receive a full-day group session, return\n      in two weeks for an adolescent/caregiver dyad session, and participate in a half-day group\n      session three months later. Acceptability and feasibility will be assessed using process\n      measures after each session. The investigators will assess change in sexual risk behavior\n      outcomes from baseline to 3-months post-intervention. The investigators will elucidate\n      factors influencing intervention adoption (e.g., recruitment, referrals; resources; climate,\n      readiness and capacity for intervention) within the three service systems for youth with MHD\n      in Brazil. The investigators will develop digital web-based interactive technology to train\n      intervention facilitators in preparation for the RCT."
