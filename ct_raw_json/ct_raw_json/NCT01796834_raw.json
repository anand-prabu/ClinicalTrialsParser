Feasibility will be assessed via: a) the interest\n      of patients in taking part in an MBSR program; c) the effectiveness of strategies for\n      recruiting patients with diabetes into the study; d) rates of participant compliance with\n      the MBSR; and, e) patient compliance with the program evaluation plan.\n\n      Estimate the effect of a MBSR program for patients with diabetes. It is expected that MBSR\n      program participants will evidence a trend toward better clinical outcome measures of HbA1c,\n      blood pressure, and standardized measures of diabetes self-management, perceived stress,\n      depression, self-efficacy, and quality-of-life.\n\n      Secondary Objective: To explore the experience of people with diabetes who participate in an\n      MBSR course through the use of semi-structured interviews."
