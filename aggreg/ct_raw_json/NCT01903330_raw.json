To evaluate radiographic response, progression free survival and overall survival of\n           patients with recurrent malignant glioma treated with the ERC1671 regimen plus\n           bevacizumab\n\n        2. To evaluate safety and tolerability of ERC1671 plus bevacizumab among patients with\n           recurrent glioblastoma.\n\n        3. To characterize of the immune response to ERC1671 vaccination in adult patients with\n           relapsed glioblastoma.  The patient's immune response evaluation will include cytotoxic\n           T lymphocytes (CTL) (cluster of differentiation 3+ (CD3+)/cluster of differentiation 8+\n           (CD8)+) and Treg (cluster of differentiation 3+/cluster of differentiation 4+\n           (CD4+)/cluster of differentiation 25+ )CD25+/cluster of differentiation 127low\n           (CD127low)) populations. Cytokine analyses should initially be limited to interferon\n           (IFN)-\u0263, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-6).\n\n      If this study demonstrates that the combination regimen of ERC1671 in combination with\n      bevacizumab is associated with encouraging anti-tumor activity among patients with recurrent\n      glioblastoma multiforme, further assessment of this regimen in a phase III study will be\n      considered.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a blinded Phase II study of ERC1671 in combination with bevacizumab in\n      patients with relapsed, bevacizumab naive glioblastoma. The patients who will be randomized\n      (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive either ERC 1671 in combination with GM-CSF and cyclophosphamide\n      or a placebo control, in combination with bevacizumab. The study will be double blinded.\n\n      ERC1671/GM-CSF will be intradermally administered, while cyclophosphamide is orally\n      administered. GM-CSF dose is 250 \u00b5g/m\u00b2 and cyclophosphamide dose is 50 mg/day. Bevacizumab\n      is administered as standard of care at 10 mg/kg.\n\n      The treatment cycles will be 28 days long."
