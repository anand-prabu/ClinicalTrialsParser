The fluorescence surgery consists in\n      a injection of indocyanine green around the primary tumor, or, when already excised\n      (excisional biopsy), the biopsy site at the beginning of the surgery.  Patient performs, in\n      a standard fashion, the lymph scintigraphy prior the surgery and is injected at the same\n      time a blue die similarly the indocyanine green. Immediately after the indocyanine infusion,\n      the injection site is massaged and a near infra red light (NIR) is focused over it. An\n      appropriated   infra red camera is positioned over the lymphatic pathway, searching for the\n      fluorescence and localizing the sentinel node at the basin. The skin is opened and the\n      sentinel node is resected. The success or not in localizing the sentinel node is pointed and\n      the standard techniques are applied - gamma probe and surgical location of a blue lymph\n      node. All sentinel node characteristics are noted as number, which technic identified it,\n      time, location. Later information will be gathered as histological status, surgical\n      complications, recurrence and survival."
