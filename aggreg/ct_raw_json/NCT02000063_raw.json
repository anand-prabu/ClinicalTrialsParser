To assess the incidence of HCV re-infection following prior treatment induced clearance\n           or spontaneous clearance of recently acquired chronic HCV infection.\n\n        3. To determine predictors of HCV re-infection following recently acquired HCV infection\n           treatment.\n\n        4. To determine frequency and predictors of new mixed and superinfections in ATAHC\n           subjects with persistent viraemia.\n\n        5. To add to a tissue repository of serum and PBMCs from well-characterised patients\n           treated for recently acquired HCV infection to allow future examination of the role of\n           other variables that may potentially impact on the prognosis and outcomes of early HCV\n           treatment."
