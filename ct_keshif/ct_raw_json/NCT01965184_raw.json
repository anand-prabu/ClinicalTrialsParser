CBT will be compared to\n      Supportive Psychotherapy (SPT) and participants of this study will be randomly assigned\n      (like the flip of a coin) to receive CBT or SPT.  Participants will be also asked to\n      complete functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrophysiological (EEG) tasks\n      (recordings/images of brain activity) before and after treatment. CBT is a behavioral\n      intervention that consists of 12 one-hour long, weekly sessions. During CBT children are\n      taught various skills for coping with frustration and parents are taught various strategies\n      for managing situations that can be anger provoking for their child. This study is conducted\n      to examine whether reduction of behavioral problems including anger outbursts, irritability,\n      aggression and noncompliance after CBT may be paralleled by changes in areas of the brain\n      responsible for emotion regulation and social perception."

T-Score > 65 on the parent-rated Aggressive Behavior Scale of the Child Behavior\n             Checklist (CBCL).\n\n          3. Unmedicated or on stable medication for aggression, ADHD, anxiety, or depression for\n             at least 6 weeks, with no planned changes for duration of study.\n\n          4. Children can speak English sufficiently enough to participate in CBT and study\n             assessments.\n\n          5. Children should have 1) no metal medical implants, 2) a body weight of less than 250\n             lbs. and 3) no claustrophobia. [These are necessitated by the safety requirements of\n             the fMRI.]\n\n          6. Children should be able to meet fMRI data quality requirements at baseline [to enable\n             pre- to post-treatment comparison.]\n\n          7. Families can commute to the Yale Child Study Center in New Haven, CT for weekly\n             visits.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. IQ below 85.\n\n          2. Children across various DSM diagnoses will be eligible for participation. However,\n             significant levels of psychopathology that require immediate clinical attention such\n             as severe depression or psychosis will be exclusionary because it will require\n             alternative treatments.\n\n          3. Significant medical condition such as heart disease, hypertension, liver or renal\n             failure, pulmonary disease, seizure disorder, brain injury based on medical history\n             which can interfere with participation in the study.\n\n          4. Concurrent psychotherapy can continue, but CBT for aggression is exclusionary.\n             Subjects will be asked not to initiate any new child psychotherapy during the study."
