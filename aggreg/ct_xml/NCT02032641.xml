  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of the 1064nm Neodymium yttrium
      aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser (Laser Genesis, Cutera TM) in the treatment of surgical scar
      after direct brow lift.

    <textblock>
      Patients who undergo a direct brow lift may participate in this study. Participants will
      receive laser treatment on one of the two surgical wounds (side of treatment will be chosen
      randomly by an independent source). Treatment parameters will be 500 spots and 10-14
      megajoules (mJ) depending on skin type.  The opposite side brow scar will not be treated
      until 1 month after the study is completed (if the patient elects to treat the contralateral
      brow after study completion this will be done at no charge to the patient). This treatment
      will be given at 2-4 week intervals for 6 treatments. Photographs will be taken at each
      visit, and they will be assessed based on different parameters by an examiner, as well as
      judged by the patient based on overall appearance.

    <description>The treatment was administered by manually scanning the rapidly pulsed laser in an even, painting motion throughout the entire treatment zone. The eyebrow hairs were covered with white tape to prevent inadvertent alopecia. The laser handpiece was oriented perpendicular to the skin at all times, at a distance of 1-2 cm. Patients were instructed throughout to give verbal feedback regarding if the area was &quot;too hot&quot; as an additional safeguard against epidermal damage. Each patient had one scar treated with Laser Genesis, and the other side was observed without treatment until 1 month after study completion. In patients who achieve a cosmetic improvement in the scar appearance from treatment, contralateral treatment will be offered post study completion.</description>
