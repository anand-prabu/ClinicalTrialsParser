Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to\n      hepatic or renal dysfunction (albumin less than 2.5 g/dL, direct bilirubin less than 1.0\n      mg/dL, any AST, and creatinine normal vs direct bilirubin 1.0-7.0 mg/dL, any AST, and\n      creatinine normal vs creatinine 2.5-5.0 mg/dL, albumin 2.5 g/dL or greater, AST less than 3\n      times upper limit of normal, and direct bilirubin less than 1.0 mg/dL).\n\n      Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2\n      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, at\n      least 6 evaluable patients are treated at that dose."
