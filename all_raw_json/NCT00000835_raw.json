The presence of gag gene products in\n      addition to envelope glycoprotein should assist in humoral and cellular immunologic\n      responses to internal HIV-1 viral proteins. The pseudovirion vaccine has been tested in\n      preclinical trials in mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, and nonhuman primates with good safety and\n      immunogenicity profile."
