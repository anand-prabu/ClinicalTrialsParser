            "textblock": "A Difficult intubation is still one of the most daunting challenges in anesthesiology. One\n      of the tools used to assist with a difficult tracheal intubation is the GlideScope (GS)\n      (Verathon, Bothell, WA, USA).  The GS is a video laryngoscope that has a 60 degree angle\n      blade with a built-in high-resolution camera and a light source assembled beside it. The\n      image is transmitted onto a mobile bedside monitor. It has been widely used in medicine for\n      over a decade. The GS was designed to provide an improved view of the glottis during\n      difficult intubations without alignment of the oral, pharyngeal and tracheal axes, as it is\n      able to \"look around the corner\" to facilitate the intubation.\n\n      The standard technique of the GS intubation involves a midline laryngoscopy followed by the\n      insertion of a styleted endotracheal tube (ETT) once an adequate view of the vocal cords has\n      been achieved. The ETT insertion process requires the operator to look away from the monitor\n      during the laryngoscopy while maintaining the blade position in order to insert it into its\n      initial position.\n\n      An alternative GS intubation technique has been described for cases in which there is\n      limited mouth opening, a big tongue or other anatomical impediments. In these cases the ETT\n      is inserted under direct vision as a \"fish hook\" at the side of the mouth before the GS\n      blade is introduced into the oropharynx.\n\n      There are several advantages to this alternative technique. The first advantage is that this\n      technique of ETT insertion would minimize the laryngoscopy time as a part of it is performed\n      before the blade is introduced and the stimulating effect occurs. This technique thus has\n      the potential of reducing the sympathetic response. Minimizing oropharyngo-laryngeal\n      stimulation time would theoretically attenuate the hemodynamic response."
