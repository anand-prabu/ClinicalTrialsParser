      A multicenter, phase IV, interventional study to assess the efficacy and safety of TARGIN
      (Oxycodone/Naloxone) Korean patients with CIPN (Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy)
      who need opioid combination treatment with existing pregabalin of last dose prior to study
      enrollment without changing.

      The investigators will assess study objectives as below.

      Primary objective

        -  To assess the pain reduction rate after 4 weeks treatment from baseline (week 0)

      Secondary objectives

        -  To assess the FACIT-GOG/NTX

        -  To assess physician's overall satisfaction

        -  To assess subject's overall satisfaction

        -  To assess safety

      The investigators have a hypothesis that Targin will show favorable efficacy &amp; safety
      profile for CIPN patients.

    <textblock>
      This will be a multicenter, phase IV, interventional study to assess the efficacy and safety
      of TARGIN (Oxycodone/Naloxone) Korean patients with CIPN(Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral
      Neuropathy) who need opioid combination treatment with existing pregabalin of last dose
      prior to study enrollment without changing.

      Upon providing written informed consent, subject will be screened in the study and
      assessment will be performed at that time such as safety data(AE/SAE) including laboratory
      results, physical examination, vital sign, medical history taking, 24 hours pain intensity
      score, FACIT-GOG/NTX, physician's overall satisfaction and subject's overall satisfaction.
      If patient is eligible in inclusion/exclusion criteria at the time of visit 1, the patient
      will receive treatment with TARGIN. Re-screening, study drug dose interruption is not
      allowed. The duration of study drug dose interruption is defined as for 1 week.

      Treatment with TARGIN  will be started at 10/5mg twice daily for 4 weeks, and proper
      titration (up-titration) will be allowed at each visit according to the investigator's
      decision. Dose titration up to a maximum of TARGIN 40/20mg twice daily will be permitted
      during study period.

      The up-titration will be considered by investigator's judgement as followings; (1) if the
      rescue medication was used more than 2 times per day, on average or (2) based on the daily
      average NRS, if the NRS was changed to worsen since the previous visit, (3) Investigator's
      judgement by considering any titration needed situation (e.g. dose, frequency of rescue
      medication).

      Safety laboratories will be obtained at baseline (visit 1) and study end (visit 4) in a
      local laboratory. The laboratory values within 4 weeks prior to baseline (visit 1) will be
      allowed to use at study visit 1.

      The rescue medication is the 5mg of IRcodonTM.

      Patients will be withdrawn from the study if the following circumstance require study drug
      discontinuation:

      Failure of pain control (Failure of pain control will be decided by investigators judgement,
      e.g. there is poor pain control or lack of efficacy despite 2~3 times of up titration.)
      Adjustment of the other analgesics due to AE except TARGIN or IRcodonTM Adjustment of the
      other major pain management modality (e.g. chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, non-surgical
      interventional therapy, etc.) Withdrawal of informed consent Pregnancy Any other significant
      risk to the patient's safety in the clinical judgement of the investigator
