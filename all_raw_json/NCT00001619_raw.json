            "textblock": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic tool that creates high quality images of\n      the human body without the use of X-ray (radiation).  MRI uses different levels of magnetic\n      fields to create images of the body and organs.  Occasionally, researchers will give\n      patients undergoing a MRI an injection of a substance called gadolinium.  Gadolinium works\n      by brightening areas of the magnetic resonance image, thereby improving the contrast.\n\n      In this study researchers will use magnetic resonance imaging and contrast substances, like\n      gadolinium, on normal volunteers in order to evaluate different aspects of its performance.\n      Information gathered from this study may be used to develop more specific research studies\n      involving MRI."

The results will be used to evaluate the performance of\n      various pulse sequences, gradient coils, and RF coils on human subjects and will provide\n      essential ground work for specific patient protocols."
