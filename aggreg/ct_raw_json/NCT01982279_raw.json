Each\n      serie of measurement was composed of three consecutive weeks an identical lunch was served\n      in four preschool canteens reaching 236 children. The first lunch was a control session. For\n      the CC situation (week 2), thirty minutes before the lunch children were offered a preload\n      (137 kcal). For the EAH situation (week 3), ten minutes after lunch children were exposed to\n      palatable foods (430 kcal). Food intake was measured at the individual level. Maternal\n      eating behaviour and feeding practices were measured by questionnaires. Child's height and\n      weight were measured by a medical doctor."
