Among\n      novel rehabilitation interventions, MT was found to be beneficial and comparatively\n      low-cost. MT reduced motor impairment possibly in part of recruiting the premotor cortex or\n      balancing the neural activation within the primary motor cortex toward the affected\n      hemisphere. However, the benefits in certain aspects of outcomes are under debate. Another\n      treatment, MG, can be used to normalize muscle tone, suppress muscle spasticity, enhance\n      residual volitional activity of hand and arm, or even increasing walking speed. In addition,\n      providing MG stimulation might result in plastic changes in the primary motor cortex, and\n      induced a long-lasting modulated effect on motor cortical excitability. The possible\n      mechanism of brain plasticity underlying MG is collective with the mechanism behind the MT.\n      Adding MG to MT might augment the cortical reorganization. In sum, combining MT with MG may\n      supplement the disadvantage or uncertain effects of MT and broaden the benefited outcomes."
