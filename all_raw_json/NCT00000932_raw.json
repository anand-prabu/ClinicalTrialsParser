When used\n      at an early stage of HIV disease, however, the clinical benefit of HAART is uncertain.  Many\n      questions still remain regarding the optimal use of antiretroviral therapies, such as the\n      timing of initial antiretroviral therapy and the composition of the best combination regimen\n      to use initially or after virologic failure. Randomized trials of different starting\n      antiretroviral regimens (e.g., FIRST [CPCRA 058]), different regimens after initial\n      virologic failure (e.g., PIP [CPCRA 057]), and different management strategies for HIV\n      infection (e.g., bis-POM [CPCRA 039], NvR [CPCRA 042], GART [CPCRA 046], and IL-2 VL/Dose\n      [CPCRA 059] are being conducted by the CPCRA. [AS PER AMENDMENT 2/28/01: The MDR-HIV (CPCRA\n      064) protocol is now included as an example of a different management strategy for HIV\n      infection, whereas the bis-POM (CPCRA 039) protocol is no longer included.] This study\n      provides a mechanism for long-term monitoring of patients enrolled in these trials as well\n      as antiretroviral-naive patients who are either starting treatment or electing to defer\n      treatment.\n\n      Patients are divided into 3 groups. Group A consists of patients currently enrolled in or\n      currently being followed in an ongoing qualifying study (see Purpose for CPCRA trials which\n      qualify). Group B consists of patients previously enrolled in but not currently being\n      followed in a qualifying study. Group C consists of antiretroviral-naive patients not\n      enrolling in a qualifying study (i.e., patients starting treatment outside the FIRST study\n      or patients deferring treatment). Patients in Group A undergo monitoring of selected\n      clinical and laboratory parameters (including plasma HIV RNA levels and CD4 cell counts)\n      once every 4 weeks beginning after completion of all follow-up appointments for all other\n      protocols in which they were enrolled. Patients in Groups B and C undergo monitoring of\n      selected clinical and laboratory parameters (including plasma HIV RNA levels and CD4 cell\n      counts) once every 4 months. Patients are followed for at least 5 years. [AS PER AMENDMENT\n      2/28/01: Patients who are not being followed in a qualifying protocol and are antiretroviral\n      naive at enrollment or were previously enrolled in the FIRST (CPCRA 058) protocol undergo\n      blood draws at enrollment and then annually for measurement of plasma HIV levels by a\n      CPCRA-approved laboratory and future CPCRA-approved, HIV-related research. Patients who\n      relocate to a non-CPCRA affiliated site are asked to sign a consent for ongoing release\n      (every 4 months) of their medical records from their new health care provider to the CPCRA.]"
