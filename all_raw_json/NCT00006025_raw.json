Patients are stratified\n      according to concurrent enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) (e.g., phenytoin,\n      phenobarbital, carbamazepine, or primidone) (yes vs no).\n\n      In phase I of the study, patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-5 and irinotecan IV\n      over 90 minutes on days 1 and 14. Treatment continues every 28 days for up to 1 year in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients concurrently on EIAEDs undergo dose escalation of irinotecan. Cohorts of 3 to 6\n      patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is\n      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 6 patients\n      experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      In phase II of the study, patients receive the same treatment as in phase I at the MTD.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months\n      for 1 year, every 6 months until progression, and then every 4 months for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for phase I within 10 months and\n      48 patients will be accrued for phase II within 6-8 months."
