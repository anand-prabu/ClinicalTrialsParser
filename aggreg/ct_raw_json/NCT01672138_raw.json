            "textblock": "Back ground: Pulmonary vein antrum isolation (PVAI) as a lone procedure, is known to have\n      limited success rate in terms of long-term recurrence-free survival in non-paroxysmal atrial\n      fibrillation (NPAF) and additional ablations isolating extra-PV triggers seem to improve the\n      outcome (1). The extra-PV triggers include complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs)\n      and triggers from other sites such as left atrial posterior wall, superior vena cava, left\n      atrial appendage, ligament of Marshall and coronary sinus (1, 2). These are known to be\n      independent predictors of late AF recurrence following catheter ablation (3, 4, and 5). In a\n      meta-analysis of several studies comparing long-term efficacy of different ablation\n      strategies, Li et al have reported superior success rate of combined CFAE ablation and\n      standard PVAI in maintaining long-term sinus-rhythm (6). Similarly, earlier studies have\n      demonstrated better ablation outcome in NPAF when non-PV triggers sites were isolated along\n      with PVAI (5, 7). However, limited data is available showing a comparison of the lasting\n      efficacy of the above three procedures when used in different combinations.\n\n      Hypothesis: The combined ablation strategy including PVAI, ablation of CFAE and extra-PV\n      triggers has the highest likelihood of maintaining long-term sinus rhythm in patients with\n      NPAF."
