  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to investigate the levels of angiogenic factors and anti-angiogenic
      factors in the aqueous humor of patients with diabetic retinopathy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, case-control study included 50 patients(50eyes)  with severe
      nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy or proliferative diabetic retinopathy and 50 patient
      with nondiabetic retinopathy or cataract. Aqueous humor was taken before injection of
      anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agent or pars plana vitrectomy for other retinal
      disease. Angiogenic and non-angiogenic proteins were analyzed.
