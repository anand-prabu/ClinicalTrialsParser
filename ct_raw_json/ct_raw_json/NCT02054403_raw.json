            "textblock": "Rationale: Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) causes high rates of blindness, either by\n      means of a painful attack of acute angle closure glaucoma or unnoticed over a period of many\n      years. Patients with angle closure are particularly at risk but can be detected during an\n      ophthalmological examination and sent for early preventive (laser) intervention. Current\n      practice shows that patients at risk of PACG are frequently missed during routine\n      examinations. Moreover, new imaging techniques like swept source optical coherence\n      tomography (SS-OCT), are emerging with which the angle of the anterior chamber can be imaged\n      in great detail with no burden for the patient. These techniques are already used in\n      clinical practice and replace and complete part of the ophthalmic examination. However, in\n      Caucasians, it is not yet known to what extent angle closure is detected in regular care and\n      can be detected with this OCT device. There are few published data concerning angle closure\n      and PACG in Caucasians and its characteristics.\n\n      Objective: To quantify the presence of angle closure by gonioscopy in patients at risk of\n      angle closure on SS-OCT. Secondary objectives are to quantify the presence of an increased\n      intra-ocular pressure during the day or after dark provocation, to quantify morphometric\n      details of the anterior chamber, structural changes, and corneal endothelial cells and to\n      quantify the functional changes of the visual field.\n\n      Study design: prospective, observational, descriptive study. Study population: Caucasian\n      patients, presenting at the outpatient clinic of the University Eye Clinic Maastricht, aged\n      40 to 80 years, who are diagnosed with angle closure on SS-OCT.\n\n      Intervention (if applicable): Not applicable. Main study parameters/endpoints: The main\n      study parameter is assessment of the anterior chamber angle according to gonioscopy.\n      Secondary study parameters are  the presence of an increased intra-ocular pressure (IOP)\n      (>21 mmHg) during the day or after dark provocation (IOP rise from baseline), morphometric\n      details of the anterior chamber, structural changes of the retinal nerve fiber layer, number\n      of corneal endothelial cells and functional changes of the visual field Hypothesis: It is\n      hypothesised  that, based on its resolution and ease of use,  SS-OCT is a suitable imaging\n      technique to identify patients with or at risk of angle closure. It will be of value as an\n      additional diagnostic instrument and may even replace gonioscopy."
