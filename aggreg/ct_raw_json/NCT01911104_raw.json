The primary endpoint of the study is the maximal capacity for mitochondrial ATP\n           synthesis measured using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).\n\n        2. The principal secondary endpoint is the relationship between exercise-induced changes\n           in mitochondrial function in vivo and exercise mimetic-induced changes in mitochondrial\n           function in vitro.\n\n        3. The principal tertiary endpoint is the relationship between the basal promoter\n           methylation status of key genes involved in fuel metabolism and known to be activated\n           by exercise in skeletal muscle tissue and cells and the exercise-induced response in\n           mitochondrial function.\n\n      As exercise has an array of metabolic effects, and we are well positioned with our\n      cutting-edge methodologies here at the Translational Research Institute (TRI), we will also\n      measure whole body insulin sensitivity and metabolic flexibility by\n      hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, substrate oxidation and energy expenditure in the whole\n      room calorimeter/metabolic chamber and intramyocellular lipid content."
