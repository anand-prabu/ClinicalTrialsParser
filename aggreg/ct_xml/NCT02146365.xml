      One possible mechanism of protection from pneumococcal disease with a killed whole cell
      vaccine is  by altering the carriage of pneumococcus germs in the nose and throat of those
      who get the vaccine.  This study will look at nasal swabs from toddlers who received a
      killed whole cell pneumococcal vaccine (PATH-wSP) in VAC-010 and compare them to nasal swabs
      from toddlers of the same age who did not receive the PATH-wSP vaccine. This information
      will be used to help further develop the PATH-wSP vaccine. The research will be done in
      Kenya at one site in Kisumu (KEMRI). The study will enroll healthy Kenyan toddlers (12-15
      months of age) who are participating in the VAC-010 study (N=250) and whose parents provide
      consent for this study. In addition 50 healthy Kenyan toddlers of similar age who did not
      participate in the VAC-010 study will also be enrolled.

      The toddlers will be followed for 6 months and will have 5 study visits. During those study
      visits each toddler will have their nose and back of their throat swabbed. The material from
      the swab will be analyzed for the presence and type of pneumococcal and other germs. At the
      last visit, one blood sample (5 ml or approximately 1 tsp) will be obtained.

      There will be no direct benefit to the participants other than direct and immediate medical
      care as needed.

      Parents of all participants will provide written informed consent.
