Histologically confirmed diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma (dose-escalation and MTD\n             expansion components).\n\n          2. Subjects in the dose-escalation component can have had up to 1 prior line of systemic\n             therapy.  Subjects with pancreatic carcinoma to be enrolled in the MTD expansion\n             cohort must have untreated, measurable metastatic disease.\n\n          3. Unresectable disease or subject refused surgery.\n\n          4. Progressive disease if treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery or\n             immuno-therapy.  If prior radiation was given, the measurable disease should be\n             outside the radiation port.\n\n          5. Measurable disease as assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria (Appendix A).\n\n          6. Age \u2265 18 years.\n\n          7. ECOG performance status of 0 - 1.\n\n          8. No prior systemic therapy, immunotherapy, investigational agent, or radiation therapy\n             within the last 4 weeks.  Radiation therapy for symptomatic relief is allowed within\n             the last 2 weeks.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Serious infection requiring treatment with systemically administered antibiotics at\n             the time of study entrance, or an infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy\n             within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n\n          2. Prior treatment with nab-paclitaxel.\n\n          3. Pregnancy or lactation.\n\n          4. Expected non-compliance.\n\n          5. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active\n             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III\n             or IV), cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness, social situations that would\n             limit compliance with study requirements.\n\n          6. Subjects who have had any anticancer treatment prior to entering the study and have\n             not recovered to baseline (except alopecia) or \u2264 Grade 1 AEs, or deemed irreversible\n             from the effects of prior cancer therapy. AEs > Grade 1 that are not considered a\n             safety risk by the Sponsor and investigator may be allowed upon agreement with both,\n             including residual neuropathy.\n\n          7. Subjects who had been treated with ADI-PEG 20 previously.\n\n          8. History of seizure disorder not related to underlying cancer."
