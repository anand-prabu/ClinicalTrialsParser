  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Allena-Mente study is a randomized, controlled, single-blind trial assessing the
      efficacy of cognitive stimulation (CS) compared to an active control group, participating to
      sanitary education lessons (AC). This non-pharmacological intervention is delivered to Mild
      Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and cognitively healthy individuals with first-degree relative
      with dementia (NDFAM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The experimental protocol was set up with a pilot study on healthy elderly individuals. Data
      from this pilot study will be excluded from the statistical analysis.

      Sample size: a priori power analysis was performed to evaluate the sample size required for
      the study. MCI and NDFAM were considered separately for sample size calculation. For power
      calculation a two-tailed test was used and a significance level (α) and test power (1-β)
      were set at 0.05 and 0.8/0.9, respectively.

      Randomization: The individuals belonging to MCI and NDFAM subgroup were randomly assigned to
      CS or AC group. The randomization was performed by a statistician blind to participants
      characteristics using the Random Allocation Software. Allocation ratio was set at 1:1,
      stratification was performed for birth cohort (≤1937 and ≥1938), education level (years of
      education ≤5 years and &gt;5 years).

      Participants provided written informed consent before study participation.

    <description>Walking speed measures the ability to perform a dual action task. Single task: participants walk back and forth along an indicated distance of 5 meters with no pausing.
Dual task: participants perform the same movement as in the single task while listing personal names in a loud voice (female names for men and male names for women) The span between time needed to perform the dual and the single task is registered.</description>

    <description>Participants are pooled in small groups (6-8 individuals). Each group participates to ten twice weekly meetings. Each CS session is run by one trained operator. One observer participates to the sessions to guarantee homogeneity between different operators. Exercises are structured with an increasing cognitive complexity and are tailored to the characteristics of the group.
Meetings (each lasting about 2 hours) have a common structure:
body awakening (10 minutes)
cognitive stimulation (1 hour and a half) scheduled as follow:
temporospatial orientation
attentional abilities
one of the following cognitive areas: language, executive functions, verbal and visual memory (encoding, consolidation, retrieval)</description>
