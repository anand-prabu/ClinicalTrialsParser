However, frequently occurring large HCC tumors\n      are still representing a dosimetric challenge in spite of modern high sophisticated RT\n      modalities. This interventional clinical study has been set up to evaluate the value of\n      different fiducial markers, and to use the modern imaging methods for further treatment\n      optimization using physical and informatics approaches.Radioopaque fiducial markers or\n      electro-magnetic transponders will be implanted into or in close proximity of the tumor.\n      During a radiotherapy treatment session image and/or signal acquisition will be performed by\n      ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or by specialized signal\n      detectors The data will help to characterize tumor and organ motion during one treatment\n      session which may in fact have impact on dose distribution"
