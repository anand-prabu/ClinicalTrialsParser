These patients don't need immediate surgery for this problem.\n      Treatment of this kind of back pain with spinal stenosis usually includes physical therapy\n      exercises and steroid injections. Both treatments are usually helpful in patients with back\n      pain with spinal stenosis. However, physicians and other healthcare providers don't know\n      which treatment is better to give first. The purpose of this research is to answer that\n      question. Patients enrolled in this study will receive both treatments: physical therapy\n      (PT) and a steroid injection (\"shot\"). However, patients may get the shot first followed by\n      PT, or they may have PT first, followed by the shot. Their time in this study will last up\n      to 6 months, and there  will be five outcome measurements (via visits or telephone). All\n      study visits will take place at the Atlanta VA Medical Center (Atlanta VA). Investigators\n      hope to enroll about 120 subjects from the Atlanta VA. Enrolled patients will be randomized\n      using a randomization computer program."
