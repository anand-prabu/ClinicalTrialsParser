It can not be\n      considered as a rational neither for the indication to treatment, nor to assess its\n      potential efficacy.\n\n      The overall objective of this work is to improve the conditions leading to the therapeutic\n      decision and the procedures for monitoring girls with idiopathic central precocious puberty."
