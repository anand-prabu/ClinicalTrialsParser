Each subject\n      will participate in all four treatment periods per part; Subjects may not enrol in both\n      Parts A and B.\n\n      This study is being conducted to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of two extended release\n      fixed dose combinations (FDC) oral formulations of metformin and glimepiride at two doses,\n      500mg/1mg and 1000mg/2mg, with each FDC formulation to be administered orally as a single\n      dose and compared with the commercially available formulations of metformin extended release\n      (XR) (GLUCOPHAGE \u2122 Sustained Release [SR]) and glimepiride immediate release (IR) (AMARYL\n      \u2122).\n\n      Part A of study will evaluate the bioavailability of a formulation comprising a film coated\n      tablet containing release controlling polymers; and Part B will evaluate the bioavailability\n      of a formulation comprising a tablet coated with release controlling polymers.\n\n      In each part there will be 4 treatment periods. During each period, subjects will be\n      randomized sequentially to receive a single dose of a reference treatment of 500 mg\n      metformin XR / 1 mg glimepiride IR; and a reference treatment of 1000 mg metformin XR / 2 mg\n      glimepiride IR; and an FDC tablet containing 500 mg metformin XR and 1 mg glimepiride XR;\n      and an FDC tablet containing 1000 mg metformin XR and 2 mg glimepiride XR.Serial PK sampling\n      for up to 36 hours and safety assessments will be performed. Each period will be separated\n      by a washout period of at least 5 days and a follow-up visit will occur 14 days after the\n      last dose of study drug."
