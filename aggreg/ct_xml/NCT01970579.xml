      The aim of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the paclitaxelreleasing balloon
      catheter SeQuent® Please P to treat de novo and restenotic lesions in the superficial
      femoral artery and the proximal two segments of the popliteal artery with reference
      diameters ≥ 4mm &amp; ≤ 7mm and lesion lengths ≥ 4 cm &amp; ≤ 27 cm. It is the intention of this
      trial to treat suitable target lesions with DCB only.

    <description>Treatment of target lesion with study balloon (coated). Diameter of treatment balloon = RVD
Each study balloon must only be used once (except postdilatation is necessary which may be done with the same balloon used for the initial dilatation)
Treatment balloon must be 20 mm longer than lesion length (to assure balloon overlap of 10 mm proximal and distal to lesion)
If two treatment balloons are necessary overlap between the balloon must be 10 mm
Inflation pressure 7-10 atm
Intraluminal defects or haziness should be treated with additional inflations and/or aggressive anti-platelet agents or bailout stenting</description>

             and to show sufficient compliance in following the study protocol

          -  Patients must agree to undergo the 6-month angiographic and clinical follow-up

          -  Patients must agree to undergo the 1 and 2 year clinical follow-up

          -  Patient is able to verbally acknowledge an understanding of the associated risks,
             benefits, and treatment alternatives to therapeutic options of this trial. The
             patients, by providing their informed consent, agree to these risks and benefits as
             stated in the patient informed consent document.

          -  Peripheral lesions in the native SFA or popliteal artery with reference vessel
             diameters between ≥ 4.0 and ≤ 7.0 mm, lesions lengths ≥ 4 cm and ≤ 27 cm as
             angiographically documented

          -  Diameter stenosis pre-procedure must be ≥ 70%

          -  Target lesion in the SFA or popliteal artery (first two proximal segments)*.

             * as far as applicable distance of the target lesion to a previously implanted stent
             should be about 1cm

          -  Vessels must have adequate runoff with at least one vessel to the foot.

          -  Treatment of max. two lesions is permitted.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with Rutherford class 5 or 6

             aneurysm

          -  Patients with any type of surgical/interventional procedures within 4 weeks prior to
             or planned after study intervention (if those may interfere with the peripheral study
             intervention and/or patient's ability to perform the follow up examinations)

             months
