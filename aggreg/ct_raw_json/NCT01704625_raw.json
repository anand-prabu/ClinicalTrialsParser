He/ She may give the patient medications to treat the headache.\n\n      The investigators will also ask  permission to evaluate and treat the headache using\n      osteopathic evaluation and Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT). The bedside evaluation\n      and treatment will be performed by an emergency medicine resident.  Osteopathic evaluation\n      and OMT is not standard of care for this condition. The investigators also may call the\n      patient in 7 days to see how they are doing.\n\n      The investigators wish to see if emergency medicine physicians can use osteopathic\n      evaluation and OMT to reliably treat headaches. The results of the examination and treatment\n      will be recorded, but will not be used to change treatment or to change additional tests.\n      The investigators wish to see whether in the future they can use OMT in certain cases\n      instead of or in conjunction with medications. The investigators plan on asking 50 patients\n      to participate."

The resident will then obtain informed consent from the patient and\n      will then take an envelope containing a piece of paper stating whether the patient is to\n      receive the actual osteopathic treatment or if the patient will receive placebo/sham\n      treatment.\n\n      Treatment will be performed by osteopathic emergency medicine residents.  Each resident has\n      undergone training in Osteopathic Manipulative Techniques (OMT) in their respective medical\n      schools and has fulfilled the requirements for competency in these techniques for\n      graduation.\n\n      The osteopathic treatment group will have performed on them 3 standardized osteopathic\n      manipulative treatments. These treatments are muscle energy to the occipital area; muscle\n      energy to the paraspinal muscles bilaterally and facilitated positional release without\n      axial compression. If at any time the patient is unable to tolerate a treatment secondary to\n      pain that particular study will be stopped.  At no time will the patient's medical treatment\n      in the emergency department be delayed to perform OMT.For example, if the patient's nurse\n      enters the room with medication, the study will be stopped and patient will not be included\n      in the study.   The sham group will receive 3 sham treatments.  The patient consent form and\n      information as to whether or not the patient received osteopathic manipulative treatment\n      will be kept in a locked file. The information will be transferred to a password-protected\n      computer file.\n\n      After the standardized treatment or sham treatment is performed, the resident will leave the\n      patient and the providing physician will then ask the patient to draw a vertical line on the\n      VAS to again rate their pain.\n\n      The providing physician will then place the data form into the envelope that also contains\n      the information about whether the patient received the osteopathic treatment vs. the sham\n      treatment, without seeing the actual information.\n\n      Data will then be analyzed and kept in a password-protected file."
