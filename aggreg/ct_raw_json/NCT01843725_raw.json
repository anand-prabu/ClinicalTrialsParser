Endothelial cell division takes place during new\n      blood vessel formation, including tumour angiogenesis. Frequent administration of most\n      cytotoxic agents at low doses is thought to increase their putative antiangiogenic activity.\n\n      This strategy lowers the toxicity and theoretically the risk of emergence of drug-resistant\n      tumour cells compared to classic maximum tolerated dose (MTD)-based chemotherapy."
