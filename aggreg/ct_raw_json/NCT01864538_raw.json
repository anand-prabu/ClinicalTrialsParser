            "textblock": "Hypoxia is an independent marker of a poor prognosis for subjects with metastatic melanoma\n      (Simonetti 2012, Lartigau 1997). Hypoxic melanoma cells are more likely to exhibit a\n      stem-cell like phenotype with an associated increased propensity for invasion, angiogenesis,\n      and metastasis formation compared to normoxic cells. Moreover, this phenotype is also\n      associated with treatment resistance. TH-302, a hypoxia activated prodrug (HAP), was\n      designed to target the hypoxic nature of tumours while having a minimal effect on normoxic\n      tissue. TH-302 belongs to a class of alkylating agents that have significant experimental\n      and clinical activity (Brock 1989). Preclinical data support the hypothesis that TH-302\n      targets hypoxic regions of tumours and is also able to kill tumour cells in normoxic regions\n      as a result of cytotoxin diffusion, leading to significant effects on tumour growth (Meng\n      2011). TH-302 has been investigated in over 700 subjects with solid tumours or hematologic\n      malignancies, including subjects with metastatic melanoma. In this subset a disease control\n      rate of 63% (3 subjects with partial responses and 9 subjects with stable disease out of a\n      total of 19) was observed in an early phase clinical trial of TH-302 (Weber 2010).\n      Predictive biomarkers for response and toxicity have yet to be identified for subjects with\n      advanced melanoma treated with TH-302. Optimal patient selection may be critical to maximize\n      the clinical benefit. A predictive biomarker approach will be investigated to try to\n      identify subjects most likely to benefit from TH-302. Given the hypoxia-targeting mechanism\n      of TH- 302, it is believed that hypoxia biomarkers will be the most informative for\n      identifying subjects likely to benefit from TH- 302; however, additional biomarkers\n      including DNA repair biomarkers will also be investigated. In addition, this approach will\n      also have potential to synergise with future immunotherapeutic approaches as suppressive T\n      regulatory cells are thought to reside within hypoxic niches within the tumour\n      microenvironment that would be amenable to targeting by TH-302."
