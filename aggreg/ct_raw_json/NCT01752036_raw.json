Other studies may be used with principal investigator approval.\n\n          -  The patient must have undergone surgical resection resection (gross total, subtotal,\n             or biopsy) of the spinal lesion(s) no more than 12 weeks prior to SRS treatment.\n\n          -  Treating physician must deem that SRS is appropriate treatment for the metastatic\n             spinal lesion(s).\n\n          -  Each SRS target must be the equivalent of \u22643 vertebral levels\n\n          -  The patient must have a Karnofsky Performance Score of 40 or greater\n\n          -  If a woman is of child-bearing potential, a negative urine or serum pregnancy test\n             must be demonstrated prior to treatment.

Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while\n             participating in this study she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n\n          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent\n             document.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Prior radiation or radiosurgery to the involved level of the spine\n\n          -  Spine disease from leukemia, lymphoma or myeloma\n\n          -  No prior malignancy is allowed except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous\n             cell skin cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ, or other cancer from which the patient\n             has been disease free for at least 1 year.\n\n          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,\n             ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina\n             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would\n             limit compliance with study requirements will be excluded.\n\n          -  Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded.
