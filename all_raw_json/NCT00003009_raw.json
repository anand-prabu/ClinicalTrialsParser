            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Define the safe and tolerance of an inhaled interleukin-2 (IL-2) administered\n      once or twice a day. II. Determine blood levels of IL-2 and whether there is detectable\n      stimulation of immune cells in patients receiving inhalation IL-2. III. Determine whether\n      there is any shrinkage of pulmonary lesions of patients treated on this study.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a two arm, escalating dose study of interleukin-2 (IL-2). In Arm I patients\n      in cohorts of 3-6 are administered daily inhalations of IL-2 over 15 minutes on Monday\n      through Friday for 4 consecutive weeks. At least 3 patients are treated at each dose level,\n      and all patients in a cohort are observed for at least 2 weeks before escalating to a higher\n      dose in absence of dose limiting toxicity. Escalation stops when maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. In Arm II the initial dose is 25 percent of the MTD determined in Arm I\n      administered by inhalation twice daily on Monday through Friday for 4 weeks. Subsequent\n      patient cohorts receive doses escalated by 33 percent above the previous dose level.\n      Responding patients continue treatment cycles of 4 weeks with 2 weeks of rest until they\n      develop progressive disease or intolerable toxicity. Stable patients may stay on treatment\n      for a maximum of 4 cycles.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 12-15 and a maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this\n      study."
