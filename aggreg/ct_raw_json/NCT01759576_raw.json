Volunteers will be\n      assigned to 1 of 5 groups (depending on kidney function): group 1 will have normal kidney\n      function; group 2 will have mild kidney impairment; group 3 will have moderate kidney\n      impairment; group 4 will have severe kidney impairment; and group 5 will comprise volunteers\n      requiring hemodialysis. Volunteers in groups 1 through 4 will receive a single dose of\n      canagliflozin on Day 1. Volunteers in group 5 will receive a single dose of canagliflozin\n      following dialysis and then, approximately 10 days later, they will receive a second dose\n      before dialysis. Volunteers in groups 1 through 4 will participate in the study for 27 days.\n      Volunteers in group 5 will participate in the study for 40 days."
