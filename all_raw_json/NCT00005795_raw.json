Determine the rate of response (complete or partial remission), duration of\n      response, relapse free survival, and overall survival of patients with relapsed or\n      refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or untreated older patients or those with secondary\n      AML when treated with arsenic trioxide. II. Evaluate the toxicities of this agent in this\n      patient population. III. Measure degree of apoptosis induced and/or differentiation in\n      pretreatment and posttreatment AML cells.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours daily for up to 60 days, or\n      until bone marrow blasts are less than 5%, followed by 4-6 weeks of rest. After the first\n      course, additional courses of arsenic trioxide last 25 days. Treatment continues for a\n      maximum of 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n      Patients with a complete response (CR) receive 1 additional 25 day course after achieving\n      CR. Patients are followed monthly for 6 months, every 2 months for 6 months, every 3 months\n      for 12 months, and then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
