An alpha 2 agonist Dexmedetomidine has an\n      analgesic effect and vasoconstructive effect on the periferal blood vessels. Our hypothesis\n      was dexmedetomidine makes a better surgecal conditions during the surgery and reduce the\n      postoperative analgesic consumption. We administered the infiltrated dexmedetomidine or\n      lidocaine plus adrenaline to the both side of the nasal septum 10 minutes before the\n      surgery. Bleeding scores (Fromm and Boezaart Bleeding Scores) were recorded during the\n      surgery. And postoperative analgesic consumptions were recorded in first 24 hours after the\n      surgery."
