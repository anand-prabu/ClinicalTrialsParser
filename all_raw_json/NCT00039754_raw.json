Administration of a radiotherapy agent that targets the bone, such\n      as Holmium-166-DOTMP, in conjunction with melphalan and an autologous stem cell transplant,\n      may improve the patient's chance of responding to treatment.  The purpose of this study is\n      to determine the amount of Holmium-166-DOTMP that localizes in the bone and in normal\n      organs, and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Holmium-166-DOTMP in the treatment of\n      patients with multiple myeloma."
