But, use of these\n      treatments has been shown to cause musculoskeletal (joint/muscle) side effects that\n      sometimes cause patients to discontinue the use of them.  Also, Vitamin D deficiency is a\n      well know cause of a wide array of musculoskeletal issues. There is evidence that Vitamin D\n      supplementation may help prevent arthralgia while on AI's.  Therefore, the investigators\n      want to see if giving a higher dose of Vitamin D could decrease the incidence of AIA as\n      compared to a standard dose of Vitamin D.  The investigators believe that this could\n      possibly result in patients continued treatment with AI therapy for hormone receptor\n      positive breast cancer."
