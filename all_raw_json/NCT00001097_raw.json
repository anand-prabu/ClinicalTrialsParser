However,\n      not all patients show the same amount of improvement with HAART. Doctors believe that\n      results may depend on how strong a patient's immune system is before starting HAART.\n      Long-term effects of HAART in children and young adults have not yet been studied."

            "textblock": "Recent adult clinical trials involving combination HAART, including a protease inhibitor\n      (PI), have demonstrated improvements in somatic immune system functioning. [AS PER AMENDMENT\n      2/27/01: More recently, similar success has been demonstrated with a PI-sparing regimen,\n      zidovudine, lamivudine, and efavirenz.] Not all individuals, however, experience the same\n      level of immune reconstitution, and oftentimes any improvement is short-lived. Adolescent\n      patients may have a greater potential for immune restoration because of residual thymic\n      tissue and therefore may experience greater long-term virus-free states as compared to adult\n      patients. This study examines the duration of virologic efficacy HAART has on the adolescent\n      HIV-positive population.\n\n      Patients begin study by initiating a HAART regimen of a minimum of 3 drugs, at least 1 of\n      which must be a PI [AS PER AMENDMENT 2/27/01: or efavirenz (EFV)]. A variety of drug\n      combinations are used; therefore, patients are grouped according to the classes of drugs in\n      their respective regimen (e.g., 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs] plus 1\n      PI; 2 NRTIs plus 2 PIs; 1 or 2 NRTIs plus 1 PI plus 1 nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase\n      inhibitor [NNRTI] [AS PER AMENDMENT 2/27/01: ; and 2 NRTIs plus EFV]). At the time of HAART\n      initiation, patients undergo immunologic and virologic assessments in order to determine\n      baseline values. Then, to determine the virologic success or failure of HAART, HIV-1 RNA\n      measurements are taken and compared to initial baseline values. Virologic success equals\n      undetectable HIV-1 RNA at Week 12 [AS PER AMENDMENT 2/27/01: and confirmed at Week 16] or a\n      significant (greater than 1 log) decrease in HIV-1 RNA from baseline to Week 12 [AS PER\n      AMENDMENT 2/27/01: and confirmed undetectable HIV-1 RNA before the next scheduled visit\n      (Week 24)]. Patients are followed for a minimum of 3 years of maintained viral suppression\n      or until they have demonstrated virologic failure. From these values, any correlation that\n      may exist between HIV-1 RNA values and HAART can be deduced. Patients with virologic failure\n      on the initial HAART regimen may be allowed to change to a second HAART regimen. [AS PER\n      AMENDMENT 2/27/01: Patients with virologic success on the second HAART regimen are followed\n      for a minimum of 3 years.] Patients with virologic failure on the second HAART regimen or\n      who voluntarily discontinue HAART are followed using an abbreviated schedule for 3 years."
