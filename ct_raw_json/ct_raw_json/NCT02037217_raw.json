            "textblock": "A feasibility Study to Evaluate Safety and Initial Effectiveness of ExAblate Transcranial\n      MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) treatment of patients with medication-refractory\n      movement disorders, namely Essential Tremor (ET).\n\n      This study is designed as a prospective, single site, single arm, nonrandomized study.\n      Assessments will be made before and three months after MRgFUS for clinical symptom relief,\n      quality of life (QoL) improvements, and safety of MRgFUS in the treatment of ET. Similarly,\n      QoL measures will be obtained using Quality of Life in Essential Tremor (QUEST)\n      questionnaire. Relative Safety will be evaluated using a common description of Significant\n      Clinical Complications for patients treated in this study. This study will be performed on\n      the 3T MR scanners.\n\n      The ExAblate system is a medical device that involves a focused ultrasound system and an MRI\n      scanner. ExAblate delivers a pulse of focused ultrasound energy, or sonication, to the\n      targeted tissue. In this particular study the targeted tissue is a unilateral thermal lesion\n      created in the ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus.\n\n      The treatment begins with a series of standard diagnostic MR images to identify the location\n      and shape of tumor to be treated. The ExAblate computer uses the physician's designation of\n      the target volume to plan the best way to cover the target volume with small spots called\n      \"sonications\". These treatment spots are cylinder shaped. Their size depends on sonication\n      power and duration. During the treatment, a specific MR scan, which can be processed to\n      identify changes in tissue temperature, provides a thermal map of the treatment volume to\n      confirm the therapeutic effect. The thermal map is used to monitor the treatment in\n      progress, and confirm that the ablation is proceeding according to plan, thus closing the\n      therapy loop.\n\n      The ExAblate transcranial operates a helmet-shaped transducer (currently utilizing\n      1000-element phased array transducer) positioned above the subject head. The ExAblate\n      transcranial system also includes means to immobilize the subject head, cool the interface\n      water, and software for CT analysis and phase correction computation.\n\n      The ExAblate transcranial system is an experimental device and is being investigated in this\n      study."
