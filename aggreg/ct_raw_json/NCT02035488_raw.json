            "textblock": "Rationale: Bronchiectasis is a persistent and frequently progressive condition characterized\n      by dilated and thick-walled bronchi retaining sputum. The main symptoms of bronchiectasis\n      are cough and chronic sputum production. There is a state of constant colonization with\n      bacteria, which frequently causes exacerbations. The presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is\n      an unfavorable prognostic indicator and is associated with increased sputum production, more\n      extensive bronchiectasis on HR-CT of the thorax, more hospitalizations and reduced quality\n      of life. Until now, most patients with non-CF bronchiectasis who are colonized with P.\n      aeruginosa receive inhaled tobramycin every other month, by use of a nebulizer. However,\n      this delivery system has several disadvantages, like a low lung deposition and pollution\n      with tobramycin in the surrounding environment. With an efficient dry powder inhaler (DPI),\n      a three to six fold higher lung deposition compared to a nebulizer can be obtained. Therapy\n      with a DPI is also less time consuming compared to nebulisation. Nebulised tobramycin is\n      used most in routine care; there is also one, rather poorly characterized DPI for tobramycin\n      available, though this DPI is not registrered for non-CF bronchiectasis. We will investigate\n      dry powder tobramycin (DP tobramycin) in a novel device in patients with non-CF\n      bronchiectasis colonized with P. aeruginosa.\n\n      Objective: The main objectives are to investigate the pharmacokinetic properties of DP\n      tobramycin at different dosages together with the local tolerability of DP tobramycin via\n      the Cyclops\u00ae at different dosages.\n\n      Study design: single center, single ascending, single dose, response study. Study\n      population: 8 patients with non-CF bronchiectasis\n\n      Main study parameters:\n\n      The following pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated: actual dose (dose minus\n      remainder in inhaler after inhalation), AUC0-12 (area under the curve from 0 -12 h), Cmax\n      (maximum plasma concentration), Tmax (time to maximum plasma concentration), Ka (absorption\n      rate constant), T1/2 el (terminal elimination half-life), CL/F (clearance following\n      pulmonary administration (F= bioavailability)).\n\n      Local tolerability of DP tobramycin is determined by scoring adverse events, specifically\n      coughing, and lung function measurement.\n\n      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group\n      relatedness: All participants included in this study are patients recruited from the\n      outpatient department of pulmonology. To investigate safety, lung function tests will be\n      performed and the occurrence of adverse events will be scored."
