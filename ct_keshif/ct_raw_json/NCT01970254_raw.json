However,\n           if you are scheduled for a blood draw in the next 1-2 months, this can be done at that\n           time.  If this blood draw has been done within 90 days before enrollment, it will not\n           be repeated.\n\n        -  You will fill out questionnaires about your risk of having hepatitis B, C, and HIV.\n           You will also answer questions about your demographic information such as your age,\n           race, and sex.  This should take about 10 minutes to complete.\n\n        -  If your cancer doctor asks for information about your enrollment in the study, this\n           will be provided to your cancer team.\n\n      Study Visit:\n\n      If the tests show you do not have hepatitis B, C, or HIV infection, you will be mailed a\n      letter with the results of the testing.\n\n      If you are found to have hepatitis B, C, or HIV infection, the study staff will contact you\n      and your cancer doctor. You will receive further evaluation by medical staff in the\n      Departments of General Internal Medicine, Infectious Diseases, or Gastroenterology,\n      Hepatology and Nutrition, to determine whether you need antiviral medication and further\n      medical care during chemotherapy treatments. The study staff will inform your cancer doctor\n      if you need antiviral medication.  The study staff will work closely with your cancer\n      doctor(s) to avoid any delays in treatment.\n\n      You may have the following tests and procedures at a baseline visit (about 4 weeks after\n      enrollment) and at Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 (+/- 4 weeks):\n\n        -  If it has not been done in the last 2 weeks, blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be\n           drawn for routine tests and to test for hepatitis B.\n\n        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will be asked about any side effects and\n           symptoms you may have had.\n\n      If the questionnaire shows that you may have had contact with someone who had hepatitis B,\n      you may be contacted for further evaluation by medical staff in the Department of General\n      Internal Medicine to determine whether you need further medical care during chemotherapy\n      treatments.  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn\n      for follow-up tests.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      If you do not have one of these infections, your active study participation will be over\n      after the baseline visit.\n\n      If you have hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV infection, you will remain on the study as long\n      as you are benefiting, until 12 months after your chemotherapy treatment ends, or until the\n      study closes.  Researchers may continue to check your medical record for up to 18 months\n      after study enrollment or for up to 12 months after your chemotherapy treatment ends. If you\n      are still receiving chemotherapy when the study closes, you will have the option to continue\n      with your care off of the study.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Researchers are investigating whether all patients or\n      selective patients should be tested for hepatitis B, C, and HIV.\n\n      Up to 3,441 participants will be enrolled in this study.  All will take part at MD Anderson."
