Also, chronic pain is\n      accompanied with sleep disorders, depression, and anxiety, thereby impairing quality of life\n      and increasing societal costs. Pregabalin is one of proven and marketed oral medicine to\n      manage the chronic neuropathic pain in diabetic patients. This study is designed as a\n      randomized controlled trial  to demonstrate that the efficacy of KW21052 in pain reduction\n      measured by the weekly mean pain score on the numerical pain rating scale (NRS) at the 8th\n      week of intervention is inferior to that of Lyrica."
