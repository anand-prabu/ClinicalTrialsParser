The\n      presence of lacerations, swelling, ecchymosis, occlusal disturbances, or broken, avulsed, or\n      missing teeth will  noted, and the mandibular movements, maximal interincisal opening, and\n      nerve function will be recorded. Palpation of the mandible for areas of tenderness, segment\n      mobility, bony crepitus, and tooth mobility will be also perform . Radiographic images\n      (panoramic and posteroanterior) will be taken to evaluate the fracture. Immediately\n      preoperatively, each patient will be given a standard dose of 1.5 g of Unasyn* and 8 mg of\n      Epidron** intravenously.\n\n      -Surgical Technique:\n\n      After placement of arch bars, the fracture line will be exposed through extraoral a\n      submandibular (Risdon) incision. Only the amount of soft tissue stripping necessary to\n      visualize, reduce, and stabilize the fracture will be performed. Mobile teeth or teeth with\n      apices that will be exposed in the fracture will be removed.\n\n      All a fracture site will be identified, reduced, and after obtaining satisfactory occlusion,\n      temporary maxillomandibular fixation will be placed  using either Erich's arch bar or Ivy\n      loop eyelet wiring.\n\n      Fixation in group A will be achieved  using a  3D curved strut  miniplate* (Fig 1) ,\n      installed  and  stabilized with  monocortical  screws.   The  3D plate will be place  in\n      such a way that a horizontal bar is perpendicular and a vertical bar is parallel to the\n      fracture line.  While in group B fixation will be perform by  A single  non compression\n      miniplate with 4-hole 2-mm  using 2-mm monocortical screws.\n\n      In both group fixation will be carried out through extraoral submandibular approach and\n      placed in the neutral zone of the  mandibular angle  (between tension  and  compression\n      areas).\n\n      After fixation  of the fracture, intermaxillary fixation will be  removed . And  the\n      incisions will be close in layers by absorbable suture while the skin closed by 5-0 nylon\n      sutures. No drains will  placed. and the occlusion will checked .\n\n      -Postsurgical Management:\n\n      Antibiotics will be continued through the preoperative period and for 5 to 7 days after\n      surgery. And other medication to control swelling and pain will be administered.\n      Chlorhexidine mouth rinse will be provided for all patient  until removal of arch bars. Soft\n      diet will be strongly recommend for 2 weeks then Pasty diet  will be gradually regained .\n\n      -Postoperative Evaluation :\n\n      Radiographic follow-up (in the form of posteroanterior and panoramic radiographs) will used\n      to evaluate the patients immediately and 2 and 4 months postoperatively. Patients  returned\n      7 days  after  surgery for clinical evaluation . The patients will be examined\n      radiographically for accuracy of the reduction, screw positioning, adverse reactions in the\n      vicinity of screw placement, and bone healing.  the  complications encountered will be\n      recorded by  treatment scoring system and treated. The clinical evaluations will be\n      performed by  1 surgeon at  each  institution.\n\n      The patients will also evaluated clinically for infection, nonunion, pain,  hypoesthesia,\n      and malocclusion. Malocclusion will assessed based on patient complaints. Criteria for\n      infection will  based on either of the following conditions: 1) purulent discharge from an\n      incision and 2) serosanguineous drainage and a wound culture positive for a known pathogen.\n      All the patients will evaluated postoperatively by a single assessor.\n\n      -Statically analysis :\n\n      Student's  t test will be  used  to compare 3D and Champy's miniplate fixation.
