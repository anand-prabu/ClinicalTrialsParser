      This study is a German, prospective, multicenter, controlled, cluster-randomized,
      interventional comparative study evaluating the efficacy and benefits of integrated PDM care
      by measuring HbA1c levels in patients with Type 2 Diabetes. Patients will be randomized into
      two groups to use Accu-Chek Smartpix software and Accu-Chek Smartpix device.
