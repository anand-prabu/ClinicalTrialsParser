Until few years ago, mostly\n      non-mosaic KS was considered as a model of a complete male infertility although few KS\n      (4-8%) have an oligospermia. Recent studies in adult with non-mosaic KS reported the\n      possibility of sperm retrieval by testicular biopsy (TESE) in around 50% cases and more than\n      some pregnancies have been obtained after TESE with Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI).\n      Since 1997, more than one hundred births are described.\n\n      As some studies shown a decrease of successful sperm retrieval with the increasing of age,\n      we plan to compare the potential of sperm retrieval between two groups \"adult\" (23-55 years)\n      and \"young\" after the onset of puberty (15-22 years). The study will be performed by\n      searching spermatozoa on two seminal analyses spaced out 3 months followed by a testicular\n      biopsy if the azoospermia is confirmed on semen analyses."
