      Introduction: Dyspnea and fatigue determine exercise intolerance in heart failure (HF)
      subjects, hampering performance in activities of daily living. In this context, noninvasive
      ventilation (NIV) has been used to minimize such impairment, increasing functional capacity
      Aim: To evaluate the impact of NIV on exercise performance in HF individuals. Methods: A
      randomized crossover clinical trial with allocation concealment consisted of two
      experimental phases: NIV and control, 7 days apart of each other. During NIV phase, 30
      minutes of bi-level ventilation was performed. Any type of ventilator support was offered
      during control phase. Functional capacity was assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise test on a
      treadmill.

    <description>Cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPET ) was performed with symptom-limited ramp protocol (Silva et al . , 2003 ) treadmill ( Centurium 300 Micromed, Brazil ) through ErgoPC Elite ® software associated with electrocardiogram ( Micromed , Brazil ) with 12 channels . The test was performed under standard conditions of temperature, pressure and humidity ( STPD ) , breath-by - breath, being voluntary breathing in a face mask leak during exercise . Before each test the calibration of the equipment for pressure and gas volume was carried out. To ensure that patients reached the maximum effort during the examination were considered tests where patients present a respiratory exchange ratio ( R) ≥ 1.1 ( ARENA , et al 2011) .</description>

    <description>Ventilatory support with bilevel positive pressure was held for 30 minutes with the volunteer sitting comfortably. A fan with two pressure levels (Vivo 40 Bi-Level, General Electric Company), which was attached to the face of the individual through a face Macara ( Respironics), was initially adopted one of 15 cmH2O IPAP and EPAP was used 5 cmH2O, making admissible pressure of 10 cm H2O, where the IPAP would be increased, subject to the comfort of the patient until the patient reached a tidal volume of 6-8 ml / kg, not exceeding the maximum of 20 cmH2O for IPAP.</description>
