The ideal\n      PD biomarker would be one that is easily assayed in a convenient biological sample, varies\n      proportionally with disease severity, is abnormal during the pre-symptomatic phase of the\n      illness, and is unaffected by drugs or other interventions used to treat PD. The existence\n      of a sensitive biomarker with these properties would enable much more effective disease\n      modifying research that would likely be able to take advantage of smaller and potentially\n      shorter trials."
