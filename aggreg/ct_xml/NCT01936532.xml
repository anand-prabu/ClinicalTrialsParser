  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      MLN9708 in combination with Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in patients with newly diagnosed
      multiple myeloma. The patient population will consist of adult men and women younger than 66
      years, who have a confirmed diagnosis of MM who meet eligibility criteria.

      Following the screening period, patients will be enrolled and treated then, they will
      receive induction therapy (3 cycles), a systematic Peripheral Blood Stem Cell harvest. After
      Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation, patient will enter in the consolidation phase
      (early and late one) 2 months after transplantation. Finally, patients follow a Maintenance
      therapy (start 1 month after the last cycle of consolidation) during 12 months.
