One way to strengthen these responses may be to have a safe and\n      effective vaccine, which will boost immune responses that are specific to HIV."

In these patients, a prime-boost\n      vaccine strategy may induce both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. The hypothesis of this\n      study is that the vaccine strategy selected will be both safe and immunogenic in the patient\n      population being tested.\n\n      Patients continue antiretroviral medications throughout the course of this study. All\n      patients receive intramuscular injections of ALVAC-HIV (vCP 1452) and recombinant soluble\n      gp160 MN/LAI-2 on Days 0, 30, 90, and 180. Patients are monitored for safety 30 minutes\n      after each immunization and by telephone contact within 72 hours of each vaccination. In\n      addition, each patient records adverse events in a diary. Patients have regular physical\n      exams, pregnancy tests, and blood drawn for virologic and immunologic assessments. The\n      induction of HIV-specific responses will be measured."
