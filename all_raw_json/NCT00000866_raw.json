To evaluate the immunogenicity\n      of priming with TBC-3B by the scarification, intradermal, and subcutaneous routes, followed\n      by booster immunization of MN rgp120 HIV-1. To compare the immunogenicity of priming with\n      TBC-3B in vaccinia-naive individuals to vaccinia-immune individuals.\n\n      In prior trials evaluating alternative methods of vaccine administration, scarification has\n      been found to be an imprecise method of administration and allows only 1.0 - 2.5 microliters\n      of immunogen to be given. Since it is not feasible to produce vaccine at concentrations\n      higher than 10 to the 10th pfu/ml, this method limits the maximum deliverable dose.\n      Intradermal and subcutaneous injection routes allow larger volumes of vaccinia to be given,\n      i.e.: up to 200 microliters intradermally and up to 100 ml subcutaneously. In the present\n      study, the initial priming dose will be the same administered by all 3 methods; however, the\n      second priming dose administered at 2 months intradermally and subcutaneously will be 2 logs\n      higher in order to achieve boosting of immune responses, particularly to gag and pol\n      components of TBC-3B."
