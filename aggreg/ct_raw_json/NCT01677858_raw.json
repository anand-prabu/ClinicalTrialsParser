This\n      information will be valuable in assessing the dose intensity impact on the suppression of\n      multiple myeloma in the relapsed setting.\n\n      Finally, this protocol will eliminate the requirement for fluid administration with\n      carfilzomib after Cycle 1 and will reduce the time that is required to treat the patient in\n      clinic.
