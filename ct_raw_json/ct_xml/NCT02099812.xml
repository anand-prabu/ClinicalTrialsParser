  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low socioeconomic status (low SES), as defined by educational attainment and income, has
      been associated with obesity in industrialized nations. Low SES has been related to
      impulsive decision-making characterized by steep devaluation of future outcomes (delay
      discounting, DD) and a greater motivation to obtain food (food reinforcement, FR). DD and FR
      have been shown to interactively predict ad libitum energy intake in laboratory studies,
      such that participants exhibiting high FR as well as high DD consume the most food. Obesity
      often results from energy intake in excess of physiologic needs, and thus a plausible
      mechanism is that low SES environments increase FR and DD, leading to overeating and
      obesity. The primary aims of this study are to determine whether FR and DD interact to
      predict BMI, and whether differences in FR and DD mediate the relationship between low SES
      and obesity, in a large sample of US adults of varying BMI. In addition, whether high FR and
      high DD are related to unhealthy food purchasing and eating behaviors will be assessed. It
      is anticipated that high FR and DD will be related to unhealthy food purchasing and eating
      behaviors.
