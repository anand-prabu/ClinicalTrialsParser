Volunteers assigned to Group BA will be given Treatment B: digoxin and\n      canagliflozin once a day for 7 days. A washout period (when no medication is given) of at\n      least 14 days will follow the first 7-day treatment period. Following the washout period,\n      volunteers will be assigned to the treatment that they did not receive during the first\n      treatment period.
