This study will expand understanding of the nature, scope,\n      etiology and consequences of firefighter fatigue and increase our ability to develop\n      guidelines that can be generalized across fire departments throughout North America. This\n      study could provide an avenue to make lasting policy improvements that could enhance the\n      safety, health, and performance of firefighters."

            "textblock": "Firefighters work some of the most challenging schedules known under highly stressful and\n      demanding conditions. The need to work frequent extended shifts leads to acute and chronic\n      sleep deficiency as well as disruption of circadian rhythms. Firefighters on-call overnight\n      are also particularly susceptible to sleep inertia, the neurocognitive impairment\n      experienced immediately upon waking. In addition, it is likely that a significant proportion\n      of firefighters suffer from undiagnosed sleep disorders, which further impair sleep and\n      exacerbate fatigue.\n\n      The proposed fatigue countermeasure aims to increase sleep opportunities, and thereby\n      improve firefighter safety and health. We will be conducting a station-level, randomized\n      clinical trial of policies designed to maximize sleep opportunities during current 24-hour\n      shifts to improve alertness, performance, health and safety in firefighters.\n\n      We will leverage the comprehensive fatigue management program we developed and the web-based\n      technology we implemented in previous FEMA projects, and will continue to offer our\n      web-based education program and sleep disorders screening. By conducting a collaborative\n      study involving sleep medicine clinicians, sleep researchers, a consultant on alarms,\n      together with the representatives from the management, and union leadership of the fire\n      department, we expect we will develop a sleep optimization program with a high probability\n      of success and test the hypotheses that increasing the sleep opportunity of firefighters\n      will improve the alertness, performance, safety and physical and mental health of\n      firefighters. The results of this study will provide policy makers with the scientific\n      evidence they require to develop effective fatigue countermeasure programs for firefighters.\n\n      We will be conducting a randomized clinical trial, providing the most rigorous evaluation\n      possible in an operational setting. Half the fire stations in a department will be randomly\n      assigned to complete the intervention, termed Operation Fight Fatigue, in the first year of\n      the study. The other half of the fire stations will complete the intervention in the second\n      year. In this way, all firefighters will have the chance to benefit. We expect the fatigue\n      countermeasure intervention to improve the alertness, performance, health and safety of\n      firefighters. We will be evaluating a cost-effective intervention to improve the safety and\n      health of firefighters in departments throughout the United States."
