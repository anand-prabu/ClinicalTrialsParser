This\n      study will also determine how well CUDC-101 is absorbed into the blood after being given\n      orally, assess CUDC-101 blood levels and what happens to the study drug in the body, and\n      study how the body reacts to the study drug and what effects it has on tumors.  CUDC-101 has\n      been administered to cancer patients as an intravenous (IV) infusion in other research\n      studies, but has not been studied when given orally."

Serious infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy within 14 days prior to study\n             treatment.\n\n          6. Known gastrointestinal condition that would interfere with swallowing or the oral\n             absorption or tolerance of CUDC-101.\n\n          7. Ongoing diarrhea of any grade (per NCI CTCAE v4.03).\n\n          8. Uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease, including myocardial infarct or\n             unstable angina within 6 months prior to study treatment, New York Heart Association\n             (NYHA) Class II or greater congestive heart failure, serious arrhythmias requiring\n             medication for treatment, clinically significant pericardial disease, or cardiac\n             amyloidosis.\n\n          9.
