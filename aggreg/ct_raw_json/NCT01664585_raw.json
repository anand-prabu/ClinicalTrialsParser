In addition, reduced pain and frequency of headache may\n      increase the objectively measured daily physical activity of chronic headache patients."

            "textblock": "Tension-type,migraine and cervicogenic headache are the most common reasons for visits to a\n      primary care physician among working women. Headache has major economic impact due to\n      patients' absence from work, and pharmacy claims. Neck symptoms induce three percent of all\n      visits to a primary care physician and 1 % of all costs in health care, and moreover,\n      institutionalizing increase costs of treatment. Active treatment may offer cost-effective\n      option for outpatients. In addition, there is no data showing how much headache/neck pain\n      restricts participation in physical activity (PA) or other activities in society.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether specific therapeutic exercises reduce\n      cervicogenic headache cost-effectively, and simultaneously improve neck function and quality\n      of life. The other aim is to evaluate the effect of exercises on daily PA in women with\n      chronic headache.\n\n      The following hypotheses will be tested:\n\n        1. Specific therapeutic exercises based on individual training reduce cost-effectively\n           cervicogenic headache and improve neck function, and quality of life on women at\n           regular work during a 6-month intervention\n\n        2. The intervention increases general physical activity of women with cervicogenic\n           headache\n\n        3. The intervention assists them to manage the headache by way of exercising during the\n           follow-up.\n\n        4. Physical activity of women with chronic cervicogenic headache is lower than average in\n           Finnish population.\n\n      The HEADEX intervention study is a randomized controlled trial. Volunteers, women at regular\n      work and having ongoing status with chronic migraine and/or cervicogenic headache will be\n      recruited using newspaper advertising, from the register of Finnish Migraine Society and\n      occupational health care services in Helsinki, Tampere and Jyvaskyla. The study sample is\n      restricted to women, as the headache is much more common in women. After recruitment, the\n      eligibility of patients to participate is screened. In total, the aim is to obtain 120 women\n      to participate. The two subsequent baseline assessments and follow-up of headaches with the\n      diary between two months before the beginning of the intervention enable ensuring intensity\n      and type of the headache and that it is chronic. Randomisation is centralised but the\n      intervention will be accomplished and clustered in three study centres. Sample size has been\n      estimated for the primary outcomes. The number of participant will be 60 women in treatment\n      and 60 control group.\n\n      The 6 months exercise intervention consists of 6 supervised progressive exercise training\n      sessions and home training program, and the participants are instructed to increase their\n      PA. The main emphasis of the exercise program is to improve and relearn postural and\n      movement control of neck, and later on strengthen the postural muscles. The exercise\n      intervention consists of six supervised progressive exercise training sessions to teach\n      rehabilitative training technique with similar home training program. Before the\n      intervention, information on work ergonomics will be enquired and if needed, changes will be\n      recommended. The control group will receive Transcutaneous Nervous Stimulation treatment (6\n      times) as a placebo treatment (intensity 0), and recommendation to maintain their PA at\n      previous level. The follow-up is identical for both groups, and information on exercise\n      frequency is collected up to 24 months follow-up."
