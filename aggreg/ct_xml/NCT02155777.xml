    <textblock>
      Use of oral contraceptives (OCs) reduces a woman's risk of ovarian cancer very significantly
      and the protective effect continues for at least 25 years after use of OCs is stopped; the
      mechanisms of how this occurs are not understood. We are proposing here to directly study
      the effect of OCs on the fallopian tube and inclusion cysts within the ovary - sites from
      which most ovarian cancers are thought to arise - in order to better understand the
      mechanistic basis for OC protection against ovarian cancer. We think the protection results
      from reduced cell proliferation.  It will lay the foundation for further studies to ensure
      that the protection against ovarian cancer afforded by 'traditional' OCs is not lost with
      alterations in OC formulation, and, if possible, to guide development of OC formations to
      improve further on the protection afforded by OCs.

    <textblock>
      Five-year survival for invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (ovarian cancer) is less than 50%
      because most women are diagnosed at an advanced stage. However, there is an effective
      chemoprevention strategy.  Meta-analysis of epidemiological studies shows an approximately
      40% reduction in risk of ovarian cancer with 5 years of oral contraceptive (OC) use. The
      protective effect increases significantly with duration of OC use and continues for at least
      25 years after use of OCs is stopped. The mechanism(s) underlying this protective effect are
      not understood. One hypothesis is that protection is achieved by blocking ovulation, but
      growing evidence suggests that it may be related to promoting a favorable progestagenic
      environment.  OC use would protect if the hormonal exposure while on OCs was less
      stimulatory to the possibly different types of cells of origin of ovarian cancer than the
      hormonal exposure in normal ovulatory cycles. Exposure to progestins is higher while on OCs
      than in normal cycling and this could explain the protective effect. We propose that a major
      source of the protection from OC use is due to their significantly reducing cell
      proliferation in the fallopian tube fimbriae (FTF) and in ovarian cortical inclusion cysts
      (CICs), two likely cells of origin for ovarian cancer. Proliferating cell populations are
      more susceptible to carcinogenic effects with the rise in cancer risk with cell
      proliferation being secondary to increased chances of mutation and progression. FTF
      proliferation has been reported to be almost confined to the follicular phase of the
      menstrual cycle with virtually no proliferation within a few days after ovulation and our
      preliminary data show the same pattern - OCs could thus protect against ovarian cancers
      arising in the FTF by mimicking the luteal phase of the cycle when progesterone exposure is
      high. Whether such changes occur in CICs is not known. Cell proliferation within different
      types of CICs during the menstrual cycle has not been studied. The effect of OCs on
      proliferation within the FTF and CICs has also not been studied. We are proposing to
      determine the effect of a 'traditional' high progestin dose OC on cell proliferation in the
      FTF and CICs in women undergoing a risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RR-BSO),
      and to compare these proliferation rates to the rates during the normal menstrual cycle of
      women also undergoing an RR-BSO. The results of this study will provide crucial information
      regarding the relationship between OC use and protection against ovarian cancer. It will lay
      the foundation for further studies examining the effects of lower progestin dose OCs and OCs
      with newer progestin formulations. Our long-term goal in studying the mechanism of OC
      protection is to determine whether it is likely that the protection against ovarian cancer
      afforded by OCs will be lost with alterations in OC formulation in terms of dose or type of
      progestin used, and, if possible, to guide development of OC formations to improve further
      on the protection afforded by OCs.
