The NMES has positive effect on peripheral muscle function,\n      exercise capacity and breathlessness in activities of daily living in COPD patients who had\n      an abnormal body composition or who were too dyspneic to leave their home. A nonrandomized\n      uncontrolled study has shown that application of NMES at home for improved exercise capacity\n      in  patients with better-preserved muscle mass. Evidence from a preliminary study without\n      applying sham NMES revealed that NMES applied as complementary to ambulatory respiratory\n      rehabilitation program increased quadriceps strength, quality of life and six minute walk\n      distance in severe to very severe patients.\n\n      Despite documented benefits of NMES in COPD patients, the place of NMES as an adjunct to\n      pulmonary rehabilitation in COPD patients who were able to do regular endurance and strength\n      training on is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of\n      NMES plus quadriceps muscle training (NMES group) and sham NMES plus quadriceps muscle\n      training (control group) on muscle function, dyspnea, fatigue, exercise capacity, health\n      related quality of life, activities of daily living, and self-efficacy in patients with COPD\n      who are eligible and able to participate in endurance training."
