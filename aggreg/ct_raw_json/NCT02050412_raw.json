For this purpose, a small amount of cat fur in solution with distilled water will\n      be placed onto the volar aspect of both forearms after the skin has been scratched with a\n      scratch lancet. The distilled water in which the cat hair was solved before will serve as\n      negative control.\n\n      This procedure will be repeated with fur of the three different areas of the cat, always\n      using triplicates (nine samples per cat).\n\n      From each of the 20 cats, nine samples will be tested on 20 subjects (one cat/subject)."
