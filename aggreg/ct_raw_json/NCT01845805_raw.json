CA 19-9 elevation is defined as two levels >\n      the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) taken at least 2 weeks apart.  These levels\n      should be measured after adjuvant therapy has concluded or upon the decision that adjuvant\n      therapy will not be offered.  Patients will be randomized to one of two arms.  Randomization\n      must occur within 3 months of finishing adjuvant therapy or from the decision that adjuvant\n      therapy will not be offered.  Group A, the treatment arm, will be started on CC-486 (oral\n      azacitidine).  Group B, the control arm, will receive no additional therapy.  CA 19-9 will\n      be followed monthly and CT scans every 2 months in both arms. When patients have visible\n      disease recurrence on imaging, CC-486 will be stopped and both groups will start first-line\n      chemotherapy (possibly abraxane or gemcitabine).\n\n      GOALS:\n\n      To improve progression free survival in high risk patients with resected pancreatic\n      adenocarcinoma who have node positive disease, margin positive disease, and/or elevation in\n      CA 19-9 treated with CC-486 (oral azacitidine)as compared to observation after completion of\n      adjuvant therapy.\n\n      To improve response rates to first-line chemotherapy (partial and complete response) after\n      recurrence in patients treated with CC-486 after completing adjuvant therapy.\n\n      To improve overall survival in patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with\n      CC-486.\n\n      To evaluate resected pancreatic cancer tissue and biopsies at time of recurrence for\n      epigenetic and genetic alterations to determine the pharmacodynamic effects of CC-486.\n\n      To evaluate resected pancreatic cancer tissue to identify predictive signatures of possible\n      recurrence and the benefit of hypomethylating therapy."
