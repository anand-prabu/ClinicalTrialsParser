MYD88 is a key\n      linker protein in the signaling pathway of Toll Like Receptors (TLRs) 7, 8, and 9, and\n      IMO-8400 is an oligonucleotide specifically designed to inhibit TLRs 7,8, and 9.  The\n      scientific hypothesis for use of IMO-8400 to treat patients with Waldenstr\u00f6m's\n      macroglobulinemia depends on the inhibition of mutant MYD88 signaling in the TLR pathway,\n      thereby interrupting the proliferation of cell populations responsible for the propagation\n      of the disease."
