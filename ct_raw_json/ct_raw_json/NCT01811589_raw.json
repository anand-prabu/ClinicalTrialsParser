Ultrasound or neuronavigation are used in order to\n      improve to placement. However, they are associated with significant technical efforts  and\n      increased time.\n\n      In this study a simple instrument assisted by a smart phone application software is used in\n      order to achieve precise placement of ventricular catheters. The results are compared with\n      the standard free-hand procedure. Patients requiring a  ventricular catheter are randomized\n      to one of the two treatments. The primary outcome parameter is a qualitative and\n      quantitative assessment of the position of the ventricular catheter on a post-operative\n      image. The evaluation of the primary criteria is performed by a radiologist blinded to the\n      randomization arm."
