No significant ovarian pathology as judged by physical exam and radiological studies;\n\n          2. Patient's general condition and prognosis deemed favorable for surgery and\n             chemo/radio therapy;\n\n          3. No other major medical illness,\n\n          4. Oncologist approval for the ovarian stimulation and egg retrieval.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        Age > 42 Subjects who do not meet the inclusion criteria will be ineligible for\n        participation in this study."
