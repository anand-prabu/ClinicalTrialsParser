Test cycle includes screening/import period (2 weeks), open treatment\n      period (8 weeks), a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized withdrawal period (8 weeks),\n      the main outcome measures are pain intensity (NRS score 11 point scale) and stool type (\n      Bristol type). And secondary endpoints included overall symptoms sensory scores, defecation\n      frequency, abdominal distension, mucous stool and quality of life parameters (IBS-36 scale).\n      After the end of the treatment period, the participants whose pain intensity and stool type\n      are effective subjects into a randomized withdrawal period, analysis and comparison of the\n      difference between treatment group and placebo group withdrawal rate and curative effect\n      index score reduces."
