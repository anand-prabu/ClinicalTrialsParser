The\n      primary end point is to demonstrate that SYNERGY II in patients \u226575 years old is associated\n      with a lower rate of the composite rate of major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events\n      (all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, ischemia-driven target lesion\n      revascularization) and a similar risk of stent thrombosis than bare metal stent at one year."
