      This study is a randomized controlled trial in patients with insomnia. Eligible subjects
      will be randomly assigned to self-help treatment with telephone consultation (SHTC),
      self-help treatment without telephone consultation (SH), or waiting-list control. The
      subjects will receive self-help treatment once per week for 6 consecutive weeks. In addition
      to self-help treatment, the subjects in SHTC group will receive telephone consultation once
      per week for 6 consecutive weeks.
