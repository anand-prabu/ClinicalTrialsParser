Known infection with hepatitis B or C, or history of human immunodeficiency virus\n             (HIV) infection, or subject receiving immunosuppressive or myelosuppressive\n             medications that would in the opinion of the investigator, increase the risk of\n             serious neutropenic complications\n\n          6. History of allergy or hypersensitivity to nab-paclitaxel or gemcitabine or any of\n             their excipients\n\n          7.
