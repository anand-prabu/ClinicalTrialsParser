In particular the past decade has garnered a great interest in cellular therapy\n      for treating Type2 diabetes mellitus. The pertinent questions in regenerative medicine today\n      are to know about the homing, survival, differentiation and functionality of the cells and\n      based on these to find out the adequate administration methods and choose the optimal dose\n      and cell types. Various modalities have been used in the preclinical and clinical trials.\n      These include MRI,optical imaging in the form of bioluminescence and fluorescence, quantum\n      dots, SPECT and PET/CT imaging. However the methods which are suitable for stem cell\n      tracking in small animals are not easily translated for human trials. In humans PET/CT\n      imaging with its reasonable resolution and unique ability to combine anatomical and\n      functional imaging is considered to be the best bet yet. Hence we intend to label the\n      autologous bone marrow derived stem cells with PET tracer F18-FDG and carry out\n      biodistribution studies, our ultimate aim being to study how in vivo distribution of the\n      cells affect therapeutic efficacy."
