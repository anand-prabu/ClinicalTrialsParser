  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IV investigational trial is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a 2-week
      treatment of fluticasone propionate nasal spray (FPNS) vs. cetirizine on allergic nasal and
      ocular symptoms and quality of life in adult subjects with SAR. It is hypothesized that FPNS
      provides greater nasal symptom relief than cetirizine. The primary measure used to test this
      hypothesis is the change from baseline over two weeks in reflective total nasal symptom
      score (rTNSS) compared between FPNS and cetirizine. Approximately 648 subjects will be
      randomized into a 1:1:1:1 ratio of treatment allocation across approximately twenty-five to
      thirty-five sites in the US during the 2013 fall allergy season. All subjects will be
      outpatients. The total duration of study will be approximately 21 days including 7 days of
      screening period, and 14 days of treatment period.

    <description>rTNSS will be based on subjects' ratings of their rhinitis symptoms in an electronic diary. The TNSS is the sum of the 4 individual symptom scores for runny nose, nasal congestion, nasal itching and sneezing where each symptom is scored on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild, 2= moderate, and 3 = severe) with a maximum sum of 12.

             Visit 1.

          -  Adequate exposure to local fall pollen: Subject resides within a geographical region
             where exposure to the local fall pollen to which they are sensitized is expected to
             be moderate or greater during the study period. Subject does not plan to travel
             outside the geographical region where exposure to local fall pollen to which they are

             inclusion/exclusion criteria (including prohibited allergy medications).

          -  Subjects should not have travelled outside the local pollen region for more than 48
             hours during the run-in period.

        body system (e.g., tuberculosis, psychological disorders, eczema, uncontrolled asthma).
        Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put
        the safety of the subject at risk through study participation or which would confound the
        interpretation of the study results if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study.

        A severe physical obstruction of the nose (e.g., deviated septum or nasal polyp) or nasal
        septal perforation that could affect the deposition of intranasal study drug.

        individual investigator.

        Current or history of glaucoma and/or cataracts or ocular herpes simplex. Physical
