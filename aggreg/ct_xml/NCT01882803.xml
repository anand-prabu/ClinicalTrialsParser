  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IPI-145 as a monotherapy in
      subjects with iNHL (FL, MZL, or SLL) that is refractory to a rituximab containing
      chemotherapy regimen or RIT.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm safety and efficacy study of IPI-145 administered orally
      to subjects who have been diagnosed with iNHL (FL, MZL, or SLL) whose disease is refractory
      to rituximab and chemotherapy in combination or RIT.

      Approximately 120 subjects will receive 25 mg IPI-145 BID over the course of 28-day
      treatment cycles for up to 12 cycles.

      After completing 12 treatment cycles of IPI-145, subjects may continue to receive additional
      cycles of IPI-145 for up to a total of 2 years of treatment.  However, to receive additional
      cycles of IPI-145 beyond 12 cycles, subjects must have evidence of response (CR or PR)
      according to the IWG criteria1 by the end of Cycle 12.
