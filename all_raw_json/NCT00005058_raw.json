            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Measure blood flow of primary breast lesions and corresponding lymph nodes by\n      Power Doppler Ultrasound (PDU) and compare this information with metastatic potential and\n      patient survival in women with primary breast cancer. II. Correlate intratumor/-nodal blood\n      flow with pathological variables using standard histology and special stains in this patient\n      population. III. Correlate intratumor microvessel density with total tumor blood flow and\n      with the presence of axillary lymph node metastases using this diagnostic method in these\n      patients. IV. Correlate tumor blood flow with various markers of angiogenesis using this\n      diagnostic method in these patients. V. Compare tumor blood flow as measured with PDU before\n      and after contrast enhancement in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a diagnostic study. Patients receive ultrasound contrast agent IV. An\n      ultrasound probe with Power Doppler facility is swept over the skin surface in a standard\n      fashion before and after contrast enhancement. Blood flow data is acquired over the volume\n      of the mass and/or lymph nodes using a video recorder. The scanning time ranges between 5 to\n      15 minutes depending on the size and exact location of the breast mass and axillary lymph\n      nodes. Within 1 week of the ultrasound, patients undergo surgery and the mass and axillary\n      lymph nodes are removed.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 200 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
