  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, multicohort, two-part study to confirm the dose and
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of ritonavir-boosted elvitegravir (EVG/r) in HIV-1
      infected, treatment-experienced subjects aged 4 weeks to less than 18 years of age. The dose
      of EVG will be determined by intensive pharmacokinetic sampling at Day 10. The safety and
      antiviral activity of EVG will also be evaluated.

The PI/r contained in the background regimen must be one of the following: lopinavir/r (Kaletra), atazanavir/r, darunavir/r, tipranavir/r, or fosamprenavir/r. For subjects &lt; 2 months old, only lopinavir/r is allow. Use of additional antiretrovirals in background therapy may be allowed.
Participants with HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL will receive their current PI/r as background regimen
Participants with HIV-1 RNA &gt; 1,000 copies/mL will receive a newly constructed PI/r background regimen  selected by the investigator.</description>
