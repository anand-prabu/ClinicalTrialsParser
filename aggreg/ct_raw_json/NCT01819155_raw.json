Each\n      child will receive two doses of one of the three study vaccines, with each dose given 28\n      days apart. Each child will be followed closely for safety after each dose for the period\n      from one month post-dose two to 3 months post-dose two. For determination of immune response\n      to vaccination or background influenza infection, 3 mL of blood will be obtained at three\n      time points: pre-vaccination, 28 days post-dose one (prior to receipt of dose two), and at\n      28 days post-dose two. Serum anti-influenza antibodies produced against virus strains\n      contained in the vaccine will be detected using hemagglutination inhibition assay."
