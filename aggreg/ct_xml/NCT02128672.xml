  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been used for almost 30 years to treat many intractable
      back pain conditions.   It has demonstrated efficacy in the co-called Failed Back Surgery
      Syndrome (FBSS) and a recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated significant
      superiority of SCS over conventional medical therapy to treat patients with FBSS.  Another
      trial has demonstrated superiority of SCS over repeat surgery in the same patient
      population.  However, the ability to reliably capture the low back with paresthesia coverage
      has remained challenging and elusive despite numerous strategies designed to overcome this
      limitation.  Strategies that have been introduced but so far with limited success include
      transverse multiple lead stimulation, high frequency stimulation, peripheral field
      stimulation, and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulation.  To date, none of these strategies
      have been able to reliably overcome the long-term problems of paresthesia capture and pain
      relief of the low back.

      This proposal describes a new spinal stimulation technique designed to improve the
      likelihood of low back stimulation by targeting the nerve supply to the two most commonly
      affected pain producing structures in the back, the facet joints and the intervertebral
      disks.    The technique has proven to be feasible in a cadaver model with ease of lead
      placement at the desired targets
