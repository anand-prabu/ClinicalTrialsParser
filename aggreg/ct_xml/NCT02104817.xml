  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double-blind, well-controlled (corn oil), parallel group design
      that will enroll approximately 13,000 patients with hypertriglyceridemia and high risk for
      CVD to be randomized 1:1 to either corn oil + statin or Epanova + statin, once daily, for
      approximately 3-5 years as determined when the number of MACE outcomes is reached.
