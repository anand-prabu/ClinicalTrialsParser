EOC is a brief (30 minute) face-to-face intervention, followed\n      by six weeks of ongoing telephone counseling/case management designed to help eligible\n      out-of-treatment methadone patients re-enter treatment.  Several studies have shown those\n      patients who voluntarily re-enter treatment improve significantly following re-enrollment."
