        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have been diagnosed with chronic, intractable pain of the trunk (NRS â‰¥ 5) which has
             been refractory to conservative therapy for a minimum of 90 days.

          -  Be an appropriate candidate for the surgical procedures required in this study based
             on the clinical judgment of the implanting physician

          -  Be 22 years of age or older at the time of enrollment

          -  Be willing and capable of giving informed consent

          -  Be willing and able to comply with study-related requirements, procedures, and visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a medical condition or pain in other area(s), not intended to be treated with
             SCS, that could interfere with study procedures, accurate pain reporting, and/or
             confound evaluation of study endpoints, as determined by the Investigator

          -  Have evidence of an active disruptive psychological or psychiatric disorder or other
             known condition significant enough to impact perception of pain, compliance of
             intervention and/or ability to evaluate treatment outcome, as determined by a
             psychologist

          -  Have previous spinal cord stimulation trial or is already implanted with an active
             implantable device(s) (e.g. pacemaker, drug pump, implantable pulse generator)

          -  Have a current systemic infection, or local infection in close proximity to
             anticipated surgical field

          -  Pregnant or plan to get pregnant during the course of the study or not using adequate
             contraception.

          -  Be participating in another clinical study that may influence the data collected for
             the study
