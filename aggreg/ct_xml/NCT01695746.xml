      This observational study will evaluate the use in clinical practice and efficacy of Mircera
      (methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta) in stage III-IV chronic kidney disease patients
      not on dialysis receiving Mircera for the treatment of chronic renal anemia. Eligible
      patients will be followed for 24 weeks.
