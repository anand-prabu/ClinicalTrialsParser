The\n      primary hypothesis is that the DANA Brief exam will be more sensitive for detecting\n      continued impaired cognitive performance than the ANAM during recovery after a concussion."

Service members with TBI can experience notable\n      neurological impairments-e.g., attention disturbances, memory and language deficits, and\n      delayed reaction time. Cognitive performance can still be impaired 2-4 weeks after\n      concussion with no overt physical symptoms. Thus, there is a critical need to have an\n      efficient means to determine the incidence of cognitive deficits in service members exposed\n      to or injured by blasts. To that end, this study plans to evaluate the ANAM and the DANA to\n      determine which neurocognitive test more reliably and accurately detects cognitive\n      impairments during the recovery period from a concussion."
