  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a large nationwide population study, with 10 year follow-up, of the effect of
      diabetes, metabolic control and a large number of glucose-lowering medications, on total and
      site-specific cancer incidence and survival.

      The study is based on electronic medical records from the largest Israeli health maintenance
      organization in Israel, Clalit Health Services. 2,301,990 insurees age 21 years old or above
      at study entry, January 2002 will be included. Four study groups will be established
      according to the prevalence of diabetes and/or cancer on that date: neither diabetes nor
      cancer; prevalent diabetes but not cancer; prevalent cancer but not diabetes; both diabetes
      and cancer prevalence. Subjects free of diabetes at study entry will be followed for
      diabetes incidence, and all four groups will be followed until December 2012 for study
      outcomes. The cohort data file will be linked to the Israel National Cancer Registry for
      cancer morbidity.

      We will compare, after adjustment, all and site-specific cancer rates between individuals
      with and without diabetes; and investigate if metabolic control, as indicated by HbA1c and
      blood glucose levels, is related to cancer risk. Using time-dependent Cox proportionate
      hazard models, we will then evaluate differences in outcomes that associate with the use of
      one or a combination of glucose-lowering treatments, while stratifying by those who were
      already diagnosed with diabetes at study entry, and those diagnosed during follow-up. Data
      for a large number of potential confounding variables, including BMI, plasma glucose, HbA1c,
      hormone replacement therapy and comorbidities will help mitigate allocation bias. The
      accessibility and uniformity of the healthcare provided by Clalit Health Services, as well
      as data on cancer screening tests, will minimize the risk of surveillance bias.

        The cohort will include all individuals who were aged 21 years or older at study entry,
        January 1, 2002, and who were insured by Clalit Health Services, from one year prior to
        study entry, until the end of the study period, December 31, 2012, or until death, for
        those who did not survive until the end of follow-up.
