The multimodal analgesia results in the use of smaller doses of\n      opioids and lowering opioid-related side effects.\n\n      Non-opioid analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), propacetamol (prodrug\n      of acetaminophen), nefopam are often given along with opioids as part of multimodal\n      analgesia after major surgery.\n\n      NSAIDS, commonly used non-opioid analgesics, have gastro-intestinal, renal, and cardiac side\n      effects.\n\n      In contrast, propacetamol or nefopam, two drugs with central analgesic effects, can be\n      safely used as analgesic adjuvants with opioid after nephrectomy, because these drugs do not\n      alter renal function or cause hemorrhagic complications.\n\n      Recent study demonstrated that the antinociceptive properties of paracetamol (intravenous\n      acetaminophen) associated with the analgesic effectiveness of nefopam could explain the\n      observed synergy of the combination.\n\n      The aim of this randomized, double-blinded study is to compare the opioid-sparing effect and\n      analgesic efficacy, as well as quality of recovery, of nefopam-propacetamol combination and\n      propacetamol in patients undergoing laparoscopic nephrectomy."
