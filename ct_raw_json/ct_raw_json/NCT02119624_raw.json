They will have an EKG and psychiatric interview.\n\n        -  Participants will have one or two clinic visits.\n\n        -  Participants will be asked about their alcohol drinking.\n\n        -  They will choose a snack and alcoholic beverage that they must drink in 5 minutes.\n           After their breath alcohol content (BrAC) is zero, they will play a game in the MRI\n           scanner.\n\n        -  The scanner is a metal cylinder that takes pictures of the brain. Participants lie on a\n           table that slides in and out of the cylinder. They will be in it for about 90 minutes,\n           lying still for up to 20 minutes.\n\n        -  During the MRI, participants will play a simple computer game to earn food or drink\n           points under different threats of electric shock. Points can be exchanged for food or\n           alcohol after the game. Sometimes, participants will receive a mild electric shock\n           through a metal disk on the wrist. Electric shocks will only happen if the participant\n           tries to earn a reward point.\n\n        -  After the MRI, participants use their points for another drink and snack. They will\n           stay at the clinic until their BrAC is low, usually within 3 hours. Participants cannot\n           drive themselves home.\n\n        -  Participants will have a follow-up phone call the next day."

            "textblock": "Objective: Continued drug seeking despite knowledge of adverse consequences is a hallmark of\n      addiction. To model this behavior, we will refine the parameters of a modified Monetary\n      Incentive Delay (MID) task that will allow us to investigate neural substrates of\n      approach-avoidance conflict resolution. We will then use this task to investigate functional\n      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain activation during pursuit of reward in heavy and\n      light drinkers.\n\n      Study Population: Healthy non-treatment-seeking heavy drinkers and healthy light drinkers\n      aged 21 to 60.\n\n      Design: The study will require 1 to 2 visits. Subjects will play a modified MID task called\n      Reward Incentive Delay with Shock (RIDS) to measure motivation to earn cue reward points in\n      conditions that are signaled to be safe or associated with a threat. After playing the RIDS\n      task subjects will be able to self-administer alcohol and/or food based on the reward points\n      earned during the task.\n\n      Outcome measures: The outcome measures are differences in behavioral task performance and in\n      blood oxygenation dependent level (BOLD) signal measured using standard fMRI techniques and\n      analyzed using AFNI software."
