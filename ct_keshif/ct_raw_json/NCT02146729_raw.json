It has been demonstrated that percutaneous pedicle\n      screw fixation has fared well for patients in the short term; however, it is unclear whether\n      the outcomes are equivalent or inferior/superior compared to open treatment.\n\n      The authors seek to establish a high-level evidence base to determine clinical patient\n      outcomes, radiographic outcomes, as well as cost-effectiveness data in comparing\n      thoracolumbar burst fracture patients treated with percutaneous pedicle screws, open\n      treatment, and brace treatment. Additionally, the authors seek to establish data relating to\n      patient occupational data, complications, and need for further surgery (revision/removal of\n      hardware), as well as short-term variables relating to hospital visit (length of stay,\n      estimated blood loss, time under fluoroscopy)."
