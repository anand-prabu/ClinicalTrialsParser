Anthracycline resistance is defined as tumor progression during treatment or within 3\n             months of last dose in the metastatic setting, or recurrence within 6 months in the\n             neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting\n\n          3. Taxane resistance is defined as recurrence within 4 months of the last dose in the\n             metastatic setting or within 12 months in the adjuvant setting\n\n          4. Having progressed on anti-HER2 or hormonal therapy if they have HER2 positive or\n             hormone-receptor positive breast cancer\n\n          5.

Any other hemorrhage/bleeding event \u2265 CTCAE Grade 3 within 4 weeks of first dose of\n             study drug.\n\n         10. Serious non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.\n\n         11. Major surgery, open biopsy or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks of first\n             study drug.\n\n         12. Inability to complete informed consent process and adhere to the protocol treatment\n             plan and follow-up requirements.\n\n         13. Concurrent severe illness such as active infection, or psychiatric illness/social\n             situations that would limit safety and compliance with study requirements.\n\n         14. Currently on anti-coagulation therapy with Coumadin, and cannot be switched other\n             forms of anti-coagulation.\n\n         15.
