Patients at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Medicine Clinic who are\n      randomized to the intervention arm will be given three printed tools, one when they check in\n      to the clinic and the other two when they check out. The Electronic Health Record (EHR)\n      triggers the printing of these tools, and the receptionist hands them to the patient.\n      Patients receive either English or Spanish language materials depending on the preference\n      determined in the screening process and stored in their EHR.\n\n      Specific Aims\n\n        1. Refine and Field Test an EHR strategy for generating and distributing low literacy\n           prescription information for English and Spanish-speaking patients\n\n        2. Assess the process of the EHR intervention and its fidelity for providing prescription\n           information for patients at the point of prescribing and dispensing medications.\n\n        3. Evaluate the effectiveness of the EHR strategy to improve medication understanding,\n           reconciliation, regimen consolidation, and adherence compared to standard care.\n\n      In addition, we will be powered to also investigate our strategy's impact on intermediary\n      clinical outcomes including systolic blood pressure, HbA1c, and LDL cholesterol."
