        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients who have been diagnosed with initial or relapsed primary minimal-change
             nephrotic syndrome

          -  patients whose urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR) is more than 3.0

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients whose eGFR is less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2

          -  patients who were treated with immunosuppressants, such as tacrolimus, cyclosporine,
             cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), mizoribine (Bredinin), levamisole, azathioprine,
             mycophenolate mofetil, or rituximab, within two weeks before the study

          -  patients to whom more than 10 mg prednisolone or an equivalent dose of steroid was
             administered daily within two weeks before the study

          -  patients who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to be pregnant or to breastfeed
             within six months after the study completion, or who cannot or do not want to use any
             contraceptive method

          -  patients who are hypersensitive to the investigational drug or to macrolide, such as
             azithromycin, clarithromycin, or roxithromycin

          -  patients who were treated with a live vaccine within four weeks before the study

          -  patients whose liver panel laboratory test result is three times the normal range, or
             acute hepatitis patients whose serum bilirubin has been clinically significantly
             higher than 3.6 mg/dL for more than 1 month

          -  patients who have a significant general disease that makes it inappropriate for them
             to participate in this study as adjudged by the investigator (e.g.,
             cardiovascular-acute myocardial infarction, heart failure [classified as more than
             New York Heart Association {NYHA} class III], hepatic/gastrointestinal/neurologic
             disease, blood disorder, cancer, infection, renal disorder other than minimal-change
             nephrotic syndrome, rheumatic arthritis with pneumonia interstitials)

          -  patients who have genetic problems such as galactose intolerance, Lapp lactose
             deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption

          -  patients to whom another investigational drug was administered within 30 days from
             the enrollment in the study

          -  patients who participated in the past phases of this study
