      RATIONALE: Adjuvant chemotherapy has been proven to reduce significantly the risk for
      relapse and death in women with operable breast cancer.In the North American Inter-Group
      factorial trial design (CALGB 9741) the concept of dosedense adjuvant chemotherapy was
      further tested in patients with node-positive breast cancer.Weekly paclitaxel after standard
      adjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide improves disease-free and overall
      survival in women with breast cancer.Investigators asked if dose-dense 2-week intertreatment
      intervals (supported by the use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) were better than
      the conventional inconvenient weekly intervals.
