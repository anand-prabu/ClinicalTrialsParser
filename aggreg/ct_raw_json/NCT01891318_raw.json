To determine the safety (risk of acute and long-term toxicities) of neoadjuvant\n      radiosurgery at escalating doses followed by surgical resection of brain metastases.

(Phase II)\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To determine the rate of distant brain failure when brain metastases are managed with\n      neoadjuvant radiosurgery followed by surgical resection.\n\n      II. To estimate the rate of salvage surgery, whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), or\n      stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for patients treated with neoadjuvant radiosurgery followed\n      by surgical resection.\n\n      III. To estimate neurocognitive outcomes for patients treated with neoadjuvant radiosurgery\n      followed by surgical resection.\n\n      IV. To determine the rate of radiation necrosis/steroid dependency. V. To estimate quality\n      of life for patients treated with neoadjuvant radiosurgery followed by surgical resection.\n\n      VI. To determine the radiobiologic impact of neoadjuvant radiosurgery for resected brain\n      metastases.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of radiosurgery followed by a phase II\n      study.\n\n      Patients undergo radiosurgery on day 0. Within 2 weeks, patients undergo surgical resection.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months."
