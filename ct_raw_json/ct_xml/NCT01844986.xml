        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patients with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed, high risk advanced
             (FIGO stage III - IV) BRCA mutated high grade serous or high grade endometrioid
             ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer and / or fallopian-tube cancer who have
             completed first line platinum based chemotherapy (intravenous or intraperitoneal).

          -  Stage III patients must have had one attempt at optimal debulking surgery (upfront or
             interval debulking).  Stage IV patients must have had either a biopsy and/or upfront
             or interval debulking surgery.

          -  Documented mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 that is predicted to be deleterious or
             suspected deleterious (known or predicted to be detrimental/lead to loss of
             function).

          -  Patients who have completed first line platinum (e.g. carboplatin or cisplatin),
             containing therapy (intravenous or intraperitoneal) prior to randomisation:

          -  Patients must have, in the opinion of the investigator, clinical complete response or
             partial response and have no clinical evidence of disease progression on the post
             treatment scan or rising CA-125 level, following completion of this chemotherapy
             course.  Patients with stable disease on the post-treatment scan at completion of
             first line platinum-containing therapy are not eligible for the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutations that are considered to be non detrimental (e.g.
             &quot;Variants of uncertain clinical significance&quot; or &quot;Variant of unknown significance&quot; or
             &quot;Variant, favor polymorphism&quot; or &quot;benign polymorphism&quot; etc).

          -  Patients with early stage disease (FIGO Stage I, IIA, IIB or IIC)

          -  Stable disease or progressive disease on the post-treatment scan or clinical evidence
             of progression at the end of the patient's first line chemotherapy treatment.

          -  Patients where more than one debulking surgery has been performed before
             randomisation to the study.  (Patients who, at the time of diagnosis, are deemed to
             be unresectable and undergo only a biopsy or oophorectomy but then go on to receive
             chemotherapy and interval debulking surgery are eligible).

          -  Patients who have previously been diagnosed and treated for earlier stage ovarian,
             fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.

          -  Patients who have previously received chemotherapy for any abdominal or pelvic
             tumour, including treatment for prior diagnosis at an earlier stage for their
             ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. (Patients who have received
             prior adjuvant chemotherapy for localised breast cancer may be eligible, provided
             that it was completed more than three years prior to registration, and that the
             patient remains free of recurrent or metastatic disease).

          -  Patients with synchronous primary endometrial cancer unless both of the following
             criteria are met: 1) stage &lt;2 2) less than 60 years old at the time of diagnosis of
             endometrial cancer with stage IA or IB grade 1 or 2, or stage IA grade 3 endometrioid
             adenocarcinoma OR ≥ 60 years old at the time of diagnosis of endometrial cancer with
             Stage IA grade 1 or 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Patients with serous or clear cell
             adenocarcinoma or carcinosarcoma of the endometrium are not eligible.
