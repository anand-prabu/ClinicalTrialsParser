Patients\n      are stratified according to neurotoxic chemotherapy (active vs nonactive and discontinued vs\n      completed) and neurotoxic chemotherapeutic agents (vinca alkaloids vs taxanes vs\n      platinum-based compounds vs combination of two or more of the above agents). Patients are\n      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive titrating doses of oral gabapentin twice daily and then three\n           times daily for 3 weeks. Patients then receive a fixed dose of oral gabapentin three\n           times daily for 3 weeks. Patients cross-over to therapy as in arm II at week 8.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive titrating doses of oral placebo and then a fixed dose of oral\n           placebo as in arm I. Patients cross-over to therapy as in arm I at week 8.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then at the end of weeks 6, 8, and 14.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
