Both\n      Ipilimumab and SRS are used alone for the treatment of melanoma that has spread. Standard of\n      care uses both of these treatments but not together. By using them together, we expect\n      better treatment of melanoma, but there might be an increase in side effects.\n\n      \"Ipilimumab\" is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of\n      melanoma that has spread throughout the body. It works by activating your immune system to\n      fight off cancer.\n\n      \"Stereotactic radiosurgery\" (SRS) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for\n      the treatment of melanoma in the brain or spine. It uses radiation to treat tumors without\n      needing to cut or use stitches.\n\n      The use of combining SRS and Ipilimumab in this research study is investigational. The word\n      \"investigational\" means that this combination is not approved for marketing by the Food and\n      Drug Administration but is allowed for use in this research study."
