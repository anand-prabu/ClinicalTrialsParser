The visual appearance of granulation\n      tissue will be recorded at each visit for the purpose of examining the relationship between\n      wound bed appearance and progress towards healing. In support of this longer treatment\n      regimen with Santyl, a recent animal study found that application of Santyl for 12 weeks was\n      safe and well tolerated. Therefore, the present study is designed to test the hypothesis\n      that daily treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) with Santyl for up to 12 weeks will\n      result in more rapid development of granulation tissue than DFU treated with supportive\n      care."
