Patients will be accrued only from and treated at MSKCCand The Rockefeller University/Center for Clinical & Translational Science . The study will assess autologous LCs presenting CT7, MAGE-A3, and WT1 after electroporation with CT7, MAGE-A3, and WT1 mRNA. Twenty patients will accrue to the study and ten will receive vaccines at 9x10^6 LCs per dose (i.e., combination of 3x10^6 CT7 mRNA-electroporated LCs + 3x10^6 MAGE-A3 mRNA-electroporated LCs + 3x10^6 WT1 mRNA-electroporated LCs) and another ten who will not receive any LC vaccines but will otherwise undergo identical cytoreduction, ASCT, and standard supportive care. At approximately 3 months after ASCT and as deemed clinically appropriate,  patients will start lenalidomide maintenance therapy, which is now standard to delay disease progression."

The stem cells collected for the transplant will also be used to grow\n      dendritic cells in the lab. The dendritic cells will carry the antigens. These cells then\n      will be injected under the skin. The investigators will do lab studies before and after the\n      vaccination to find out if the vaccine is working."
