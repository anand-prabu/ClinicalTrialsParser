The use of raloxifene may be an effective way to\n      prevent breast cancer in premenopausal women.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of raloxifene in preventing invasive\n      breast cancer in premenopausal women."

After the observation period, participants receive oral raloxifene once daily for 2\n      years.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed 1 week prior to study drug administration and at 6, 12, 24 and\n      36 months after study drug administration.\n\n      Participants are followed for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 41 participants will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
