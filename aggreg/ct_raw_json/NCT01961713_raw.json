Some early studies indicate the amount and type of CTCs in\n      the blood can help determine the status of the tumor itself and the way it is responding to\n      treatment.  In this study, the investigators will compare the number of CTCs in the blood at\n      different time frames before and after surgery to remove the prostate."
