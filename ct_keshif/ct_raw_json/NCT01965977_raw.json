            "textblock": "High-intermediate or high risk in IPI has a long-term chance of cure in the range about 50%\n      in patients with DLBCL treated by R-CHOP. These high risk patients should be considered for\n      additional new treatment to standard R-CHOP or investigational approaches in the context of\n      clinical trials that are designed to ensure that potentially curative therapy.\n\n      Bortezomib has shown activity in vitro against DLBCL-derived cell lines. Single-agent\n      bortezomib or chemotherapy combined bortezomib are feasible in follicular, mantle cell,\n      marginal zone lymphoma and DLBCL with manageable toxicities. Bortezomib enhances the\n      activity of chemotherapy in non-GCB but not GCB DLBCL, and provide a rational therapeutic\n      approach based on genetically distinct DLBCL subtypes.\n\n      High CR/CRu rate with bortezomib with standard R-CHOP suggests it may be a good backbone for\n      additional maintenance leading to durable response. However, there is no study of bortezomib\n      as maintenance therapy after treated with R-CHOP in high risk patients with DLBCL. So we\n      applied additional bortezomib as maintenance therapy in order to assess improving efficacy\n      and survival rates in high risk patients with non-GCB DLBCL who had been confirmed CR after\n      treated with R-CHOP."
