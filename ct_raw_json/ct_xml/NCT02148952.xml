  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the impact of a checklist-based childbirth safety
      program (the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program) on reduction of severe maternal, fetal,
      and newborn harm in institutional deliveries in north India.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program is a quality improvement program designed to
      support health workers to deliver evidence-based practices to women and newborns around the
      time of institutional childbirths. At the program's core is the Safe Childbirth Checklist, a
      31-item list of essential practices that target the major causes of maternal and newborn
      mortality in low-resource settings globally. The program was developed over 3 years by a
      partnership of WHO and HSPH, working with a large international network of experts and
      stakeholders in maternal, fetal, and newborn health. Pilot testing of the program at a
      public-sector birth center in south India demonstrated dramatic improvements in health
      worker adherence to essential childbirth-related clinical care standards. The current study
      is a matched-pair, cluster randomized trial to measure the efficacy of the program in
      reducing severe maternal and newborn harm. This trial will be conducted at approximately 120
      health facilities in Uttar Pradesh, India.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For measuring outcomes, inclusion criteria are all mothers admitted to a study site
             for childbirth and newborn babies who are to be followed-up. In case a mother or baby
             from an enrolled site is referred out to another facility (before or after delivery)
             the mother-baby dyad will be included in the study and the outcome will be allocated
             to the referring facility

          -  For a smaller subset of birth events (approximately 1,800 deliveries total), health
             worker practices will be observed to measure the impact of the SCC program on
             delivery of essential practices, as a secondary outcome. A convenience sample of
             women who agree to observation and their babies cared for by the health workers
             around the time of childbirth at the facility during data collectors' duty hours will
             be included in this component of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Mothers who have been referred into the facility by an inter-facility transfer.

          -  Mothers being managed for abortion.

          -  Mothers who refuse consent for follow-up
