Patients are assigned by chance to two treatment conditions 1) Control\n      condition (General Psychiatric Management; Gunderson & Links, 2008) and 2) MOTR-condition.\n      The investigators hypothesize better results in the MOTR-condition, as compared to the\n      control condition in terms of symptom reduction pre-post.\n\n      The conduct of the study represents a significant contribution to the understanding and\n      enhancement of relationship aspects in the treatment of patients diagnosed with Borderline\n      Personality Disorder which may be of potential benefit for these patients."
