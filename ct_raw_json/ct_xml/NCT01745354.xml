  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Direct intratumoral injection of SD-101 with local radiation is safe in patients with
      relapsed or refractory lymphoma after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive low dose radiation to all bulky or symptomatic lymph nodes on days -2
      and -1. SD-101 will be administered intratumorally to the single largest palpable node
      within 24 hours after completion of radiation, on day 0. Two additional intratumoral SD-101
      injections will be performed on days 7 (+/- 2 days) and 14 (+/- 2 days). This is a dose
      ranging study using a 3+3 design with a definition of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) which our
      group has found acceptable in the past. The first cohort of patients will receive a SD-101
      dose of 0.3 mg per injection. The dose will be escalated to 1 mg and 3 mg based on dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT).
