            "textblock": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common dementing disorder of later life, is a major cause\n      of disability and death in the elderly.  Although a number of theoretical causes exist, the\n      etiology of AD is still unknown.  Consequently, the focus of treatments has been palliative,\n      designed to ameliorate AD symptoms.  Recent efforts, however, have revealed some surprising\n      data suggesting that cholinesterase inhibitors (AchEIs), used over the last decade, and\n      recently released memantine (an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist), may confer\n      protection to neurons.  Thus, they may offer a slowing of cognitive decline and/or\n      improvement in behavioral symptoms associated with memory impairment.\n\n      Over the last decade, it has been well documented that mild cognitive impairment (MCI)\n      increases the risk of conversion to AD and that coincident depression and MCI (Dep-MCI)\n      further increases the risk 2 to 3 fold.  The primary focus of this line of investigation is\n      to treat the very high risk to dement patient population with Dep-MCI, before they develop\n      AD, in the hopes of delaying AD onset.\n\n      Memantine had not been studied in DEP-MCI patients.  Since treatment of these patients with\n      combined antidepressant and AChEIs has been associated with cognitive improvement in pilot\n      studies, we explore whether treatment of DEP-MCI with memantine in addition to\n      antidepressant treatment would benefit cognitive performance and lead to a low rate of\n      conversion to dementia.  We evaluate the cognitive and antidepressant benefit of combined\n      open-label es-citalopram and memantine treatment over 48 weeks in a DEP-CI sample."

The research plan\n      includes: i) Obtaining a baseline psychiatric and neuropsychological test profile, ii) If\n      currently on an ineffective antidepressant, having a one week washout (3 weeks for\n      fluoxetine), iii) A treatment trial beginning with a two-week es-citalopram lead-in period.\n      At two weeks, memantine (Namenda) is added starting at 5 mg/day and increased until the\n      maximum dose of 20 mg/day is reached by six weeks. The study psychiatrist administers: the\n      24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D); the Clinical Global Impression (CGI, 1-7\n      scale) initial severity and subsequent change ratings separately for depression, cognition,\n      and overall clinical status; the Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) for somatic side\n      effects.  A trained technician administers the neuropsychological battery at baseline, 12,\n      24 and 48 weeks.  If the patient is an antidepressant non-responder during the first\n      12-weeks, the es-citalopram is changed to an alternative antidepressant, as clinically\n      indicated by the treating psychiatrist.  The patient remains on the memantine for the entire\n      48-weeks, irrespective of antidepressant response.\n\n      This will tell us about the efficacy and tolerability of es-citalopram+memantine on both\n      cognitive and depressive symptoms in Dep-MCI patients and will potentially have broader\n      public health implications because Dep-MCI is a wide-spread clinical problem where\n      management needs to be improved."
