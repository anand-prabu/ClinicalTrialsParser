All patients will\n      be treated during a single session, and real/sham SNAG will be applied from a sitting\n      position with the belt, and in a flexion direction. Two kinematic-algorythms (ROM and Speed)\n      from a validated kinematic spine model will be used and recorded with an opto-electronic\n      device (BTS-Elite). Pain at rest and during flexion, as well as functional disability and\n      kinesiophobia will be recorded by self-reported measures. These outcomes will be blindly\n      evaluated before and after treatment to compare both groups with \" Two-Way-ANOVA \" statistic\n      with for factors; time and groups."
