    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The evaluation of right ventricular sensing performance is based on the assessment of consecutive intrinsic beats documented with markers on an IEGM (intra-cardiac electrogram). The evaluation of ventricular sensing performance is based on the data to be collected during the 3-month follow-up. The appropriate pacing performance in the right ventricle results from the evaluation of &quot;capture&quot; at the end of the 3-month follow-up.</description>

    <description>Comparison of the manually measured pacing threshold of the SD01 lead system to the Linox SD lead at 3-month follow-up. The idea is that the pacing threshold will be similar within a suitable range.</description>
