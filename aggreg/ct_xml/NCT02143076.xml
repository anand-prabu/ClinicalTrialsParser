  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Youth diagnosed with sickle cell disease (SCD) may have difficulty taking medication as
      prescribed (adherence). Hydroxyurea (HU) is one medication that youth may take to help
      manage SCD.  Electronic adherence monitoring is widely considered the gold standard in
      objective adherence measurement. These monitors provide continuous, real-time records of
      medication adherence and reveal problematic behavior patterns, including underdosing,
      overdosing, delayed dosing, &quot;drug holidays&quot; (i.e. where individuals do not take medications
      for a specified interval of time), and &quot;white coat&quot; adherence (i.e., a pattern of drug
      adherence as a function of time where individuals display good adherence immediately before
      and after clinic attendance with worsening adherence in the period between).

      Overall, electronic adherence measures are considered valid, reliable, and accurate, with
      clear advantages over pharmacy refill records, physician estimates and self-report measures.
      Currently, only one electronic measure capable of monitoring medications in both pill and
      liquid form is being manufactured: WisePill and WiseBag. While data are limited regarding
      its validity and reliability, preliminary data support the use of Wise technology to measure
      adherence to medication. The current study will determine the Wise device's ability to
      feasibly measure adherence to liquid and solid form HU medication in a pediatric SCD
      population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study will evaluate HU adherence using an electronic storage device (Wise
      device) compared to caregiver report, youth report, lab values, and pill-count adherence
      measures. The investigators will ask participants to store their medication in the Wise
      device and answer questions about their use of the device during normal clinical care
      visits.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

        -  To examine feasibility of the WISE device by estimating a) rate of consent to the
           study, b) rate of WISE device use, c) rate of WISE device failure, and d) the perceived
           acceptability of using the WISE device, as reported by caregivers and youth.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

        -  To estimate the association between HU adherence as measured by the Wise device, to a)
           caregiver-report, b) youth-report, c) lab values, d) pill-count, and e) Medication
           Possession Ratio (MPR) adherence measures.

      Evaluation of study outcomes will be stratified by age group:  (1) infants/toddlers, ages
      0-7 years; (2) school age, ages 8-12 years; and (3) teen, ages 13-17 years.

      At study enrollment, participants will be asked to complete one questionnaire and will
      receive instructions on how to use the Wise device. They will be asked to use the Wise
      device over the following two months. A study team member will contact each participant by
      phone within seven days of study enrollment to monitor participant use of the Wise device
      and to answer any questions. Participants will be asked to return the Wise device in two
      months at their normal clinic care visit. At this visit, participants will be asked to
      complete two more questionnaires and, as part of standard clinical care, a pill count/bottle
      weight will be completed by the pharmacy.

    <description>Adherence will be determined and compared between: a) adherence indicated by Wise device, b) adherence indicated by caregiver and youth-report, c) adherence indicated by lab values, d) adherence indicated by pill count/bottle volume, and e) adherence indication by medication possession ratio (MPR).
Each participant's Wise adherence will be calculated as: [(number of device openings รท medication prescribed) x 100] where larger percentages suggest better adherence (range: 0-100%). Descriptive statistics for Wise device adherence and other adherence measures, including mean and standard deviation, median and interquartile range, will be estimated. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and intraclass correlations between different adherence measures will be calculated to measure the associations between HU adherence measures for the entire sample as well as for each age group.</description>
