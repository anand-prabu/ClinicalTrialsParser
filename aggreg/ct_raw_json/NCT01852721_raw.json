            "textblock": "Among the few studies that have addressed gender differences in response to a nutritional\n      program promoting the Mediterranean diet, none has used a theoretical model of dietary\n      adherence. Accordingly, the Self-Determination Theory suggests that the different behavioral\n      types of regulation are associated with one of the three forms of motivation which are\n      intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation and amotivation. The use of the\n      Self-Determination Theory as a theoretical model of adherence will provide original data on\n      the potential contribution of self-determination to gender differences in adherence to an\n      intervention promoting the Mediterranean diet. The purpose of this study is to document\n      gender differences between men and women in diet adherence and in changes in specific\n      dietary intakes and energy density in response to a 12-week nutritional education program\n      promoting the Mediterranean diet in both the short term (immediately after the end of the\n      intervention) and longer term (3 and 6 months after the end of the intervention).\n      Considering that previous studies have shown that women were more likely than men to  take\n      action to improve eating habits, rated higher their knowledge of nutrition than men and\n      also indicated that they read product labels more frequently than men, we hypothesize that\n      both in the short and the longer term, women will have a better adherence to recommendations\n      promoting the Mediterranean diet than men namely because of higher self-determination. Data\n      will be collected before and after the 12-week nutritional education program, as well as 3\n      and 6 months after the end of the intervention."
