They will be randomly assigned to either\n      light or high- or low-dose negative ions. Each treatment must be taken consistently for five\n      weeks at the same time every day, after which treatment is temporarily suspended to\n      determine whether symptoms return. Participants will then have the opportunity to try the\n      alternate active treatment to determine which works best for them. On two occasions,\n      participants will provide saliva samples, used to determine the level of melatonin, a\n      hormone that becomes active at night and indicates whether a person's internal circadian\n      clock is \"in sync\" with the day-night cycle or is early or late. This diagnostic test for\n      melatonin, which is not yet readily available in medical practice, provides our research\n      participants with unique information that can be used to optimize the timing of future\n      treatment."
