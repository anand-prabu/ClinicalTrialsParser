Calcitriol may help carboplatin kill more cancer cells by\n      making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of carboplatin plus calcitriol in\n      treating patients who have prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy."

Determine the palliative response in patients\n      with cancer-related pain treated with this regimen. III. Determine the response in patients\n      with bidimensionally measurable disease treated with this regimen. IV. Determine the\n      duration of prostate-specific antigen, palliative, and measurable disease responses in\n      patients treated with this regimen. V. Determine the survival of patients treated with this\n      regimen. VI. Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. VII.\n      Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral calcitriol on day 1 and carboplatin IV over 60 minutes on day\n      2. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease\n      progression. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 4 weeks until disease\n      progression. Patients are followed every 4 weeks until disease progression and then every 3\n      months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-36 patients will be accrued for this study."
