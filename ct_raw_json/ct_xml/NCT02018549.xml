      Phase IIa, single center, open-label, single-arm study, to evaluate the inspiration profile
      through the NEXThaler device in adult COPD patients with varying degrees of airflow
      limitation

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As this is an exploratory study, a total of 70 to 80 completed patients, ensuring the
      following distribution in terms of COPD Stage as per GOLD 2013 (updated) spirometric
      classification of disease severity, are deemed to be  sufficient for assessing the
      inhalation profile through the NEXThaler®:

        -  10 to 20 COPD GOLD Stage I patients

        -  20 patients in each of the COPD GOLD Stage II to IV. Assuming a screening
           failure/drop-out rate of 10%, a maximum of 89 patients will be screened in order to
           reach the required number of completed patients.

      All the analyses will be performed separately for the first and the second inhalation.
      Results stratified by disease severity and overall will be presented.

    <description>The study duration per patient is only one visit. At visit 1 the patient after having signed the ICF and after having assessed the eligibility criteria should perform two evaluable inhalatory manoeuvres through the device instrumented with an acoustic monitoring system (microphone). The sounds captured by the microphone are sent to a PC which acquire it for analysis of the profile. Each manoeuvre lasts few seconds. After having completed the manoeuvres and have the same assessed as good by the Investigator, the study is completed. All the procedures are expected to be performed within a couple of hours for each patient.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent obtained from the patient and/or the legal representatives

          2. Inpatients and outpatients of both sexes, aged ≥ 40 years

          3. Documented clinical diagnosis (within the past 6 months) of COPD with varying degrees
             of airflow limitation based on Spirometric classification of disease severity
             according to GOLD 2013 (updated) guidelines with a smoking history of at least 10
             pack years (pack-years = the number of cigarette packs per day times the number of
             years). Current smokers and ex-smokers are eligible

          4. A cooperative attitude and ability to use DPIs and to be trained in the proper use of
             the NEXThaler® as confirmed by the activation of the training device BAM

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant women confirmed by a positive pregnancy test or nursing (lactating) women
             (if applicable)

          2. Diagnosis of asthma

          3. Diagnosis of restrictive lung disease

          4. Allergy to any component of the placebo treatment

          5. Inability to comply with study procedures or treatment

          6. Significant unstable medical history of and/or treatments for cardiac, renal,
             neurological, hepatic, endocrine diseases, or any previously documented laboratory
             abnormality indicative of a significant underlying condition, that may interfere with
             patient's safety, compliance, or study evaluations, according to the investigator's
             opinion.
