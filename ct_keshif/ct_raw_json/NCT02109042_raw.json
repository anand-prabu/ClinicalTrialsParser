Information about any side effects\n      that may occur will also be collected.\n\n      This study will also be looking for special markers called \"biomarkers\" that can be used to\n      study osteoporosis and/or the effects of the study drug.\n\n      There will be 2 parts to this study.  The first part will last approximately 6 weeks and the\n      second part will last approximately 7 weeks."
