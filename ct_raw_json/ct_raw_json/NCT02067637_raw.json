The investigators objective\n      is to characterize some of these effects in the cancer population. To achieve this goal, the\n      investigators propose the following specific aims:\n\n      Specific Aim 1: To compare markers of ovarian reserve between cancer survivors and healthy\n      controls.\n\n      Hypothesis: Cancer survivors will have lower serum Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) and antral\n      follicle count (AFC), and higher Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) than healthy controls.\n\n      Specific Aim 2: To compare cardio-metabolic, endocrine and bone profiles between cancer\n      survivors and controls using a combination of anthropometric measures, fasting serum\n      markers, and urinary markers of bone health.\n\n      Hypothesis: Cancer survivors will have higher total cholesterol and lower 25-OH vitamin D\n      than healthy controls.\n\n      Specific Aim 3: To evaluate potential associations between ovarian reserve and markers of\n      metabolism, obesity, and tumor bone health in young female cancer survivors.\n\n      Hypothesis: As BMI and total cholesterol increases, serum AMH will decrease.\n\n      Specific Aim 4: To compare quality of life markers, as assessed by validated instruments,\n      between cancer survivors and controls using recommended scoring techniques.\n\n      Hypothesis: Cancer survivors will have lower quality of life markers as compared to\n      controls.\n\n      The investigators will conduct a prospective study to characterize the quality of life and\n      cardio-metabolic, endocrine, and bone profiles of female cancer survivors using a\n      combination of anthropometric, serum, urinary, and ultrasonographic markers in combination\n      with QOL instruments."
