  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment for tongue cancer. However, surgery-induced
      immunosuppression has been implicated in the development of post-operative septic
      complications and neoplasm metastasis. General anesthesia is considered to not only suppress
      surgical stress, but also affect the immune function directlyï¼Œsuch as altering the number
      and activity of immune cells. It is reported that some anesthetics increase susceptibility
      to tumor metastasis, apparently by suppressing natural killer cell activity. Different
      anesthetic techniques and anesthetics used in anesthesia have shown different effects on
      immunity. Many of the studies were animal trials or performed in vitro; in addition, most
      are focused on a single drug. To date, there is little published prospective clinical
      research designed specifically to investigate the effects of different general anesthetic
      technique on immune function in patients with oral malignant tumors. The aim of this study
      is going to characterize the immune response of patients undergoing surgery for tongue
      cancer under 3 types of general anesthesia.
