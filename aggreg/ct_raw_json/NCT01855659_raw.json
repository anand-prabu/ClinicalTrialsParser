            "textblock": "Peak Inspiratory Flow Rate (PIFR) is defined by the fastest flow rate noted during the\n      inspiratory cycle.\n\n      Inhaled medication plays an important role in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary\n      disease (COPD), with dry powder inhalers (DPIs) increasingly replacing metered dose inhalers\n      (MDIs). DPIs are interesting as they do not require the need for coordinate actuation of the\n      MDI device with inhalation or the use of a large spacer device 1-3. Several DPIs are\n      available for the administration of inhaled corticosteroids, as well as bronchodilators,\n      with each of them corresponding to a different type of inhaler (e.g. Diskus\u00ae, Turbuhaler\u00ae,\n      Aeroliser\u00ae, etc.). During the inspiratory effort the patient generates a pressure drop with\n      a consequent airflow across the DPI. This inspiratory flow has to be high enough to\n      disaggregate and adequately disperse the drug powder into an aerosol cloud of drug particles\n      and to guarantee an optimal deposition of the medication in the lung. Such peak inspiratory\n      flows (PIFs) are not only dependent on a patient's inhalation effort but also on the\n      internal resistance of the device.\n\n      It has been shown that optimal deposition of medication with DPIs is not achieved in some\n      patients with low inspiratory flow rates, such as children or patients with COPD, especially\n      during acute exacerbations. In such conditions the use of a DPI with low internal resistance\n      has been suggested, ensuring an optimal deposition despite the lower flow rate. In addition,\n      many clinicians are nowadays confronted with an important number of COPD patients who are\n      aged >70 yrs"
