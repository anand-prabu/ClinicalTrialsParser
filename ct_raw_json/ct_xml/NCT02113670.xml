  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 11 million women in the United States suffer from stress urinary incontinence
      (SUI), the involuntary leakage of urine during everyday activities that put temporary stress
      on the abdomen and bladder, such as laughing, coughing, and walking. For women with SUI,
      this pressure often causes urine to leak involuntarily. SUI affects women of all ages
      including young mothers, pre-menopausal women, and seniors, and can result in significant
      emotional distress.  Current solutions for SUI include disposable pads, behavioral treatment
      (pelvic floor physical therapy) and surgical intervention. Patients with SUI who failed
      conservative treatment and wish to be further treated by a surgery may require further
      work-up by urodynamic study in which abdominal leak point pressures (ALPP) defined and
      reflect the severity of SUI.

      There is continuous need to develop less invasive treatments for SUI that could minimize the
      use of pads, could be an alternative to painful, costly surgical procedure.  The Trendlines
      Group lab solution is a non-surgical alternative in the treatment of SUI. The concept of the
      future treatment solution is based on simple physics: injecting a small amount of gas (CO2
      or air) into the urinary bladder, which eliminates or greatly reduces involuntary urinary
      leakage. The gas bubble acts as a &quot;shock absorber&quot; to reduce the temporary pressure increase
      in the bladder that causes urinary leakage. The concept for the new treatment has been
      tested in a lab environment using lab jig tests and pig urinary system (bladder and
      urethra). The lab tests showed significant improvement in the bladder pressure when the
      treatment was implemented by suspending the stress pressure to a level that will not cause
      urine leakage.
