            "textblock": "Can thrombin generation measurement predict the risk of venous thromboembolism in acute ill\n      patients\n\n      Traditional coagulation tests do not assess the whole coagulation system.  Thrombin\n      generation assays measure the ability of plasma sample to generate thrombin following in\n      vitro activation of coagulation. In contrast to the classical clotting assays, thrombin\n      generation reflects and integrates all pro and anticoagulant reactions that regulate the\n      formation and inhibition of thrombin.\n\n      The aim of our study is to investigate whether thrombin generation would be able to predict\n      a hypercoagulable state in acute ill patients admitted in the internal medical departments\n      and how it correlates with the Padua prediction score, a score that could assists the risk\n      for venous thromboembolism in hospitalized medical patients.\n\n      In total 300 patients are planned for inclusion in this trial. After signing an informed\n      consent a blood sample will be obtained from each participant. We will measure the thrombin\n      generation over time in plasma assessed by the calibrated automated thrombogram (CAT)."
