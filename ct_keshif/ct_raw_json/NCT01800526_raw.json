            "textblock": "Two primary processes dominate the complications associated with sickle cell disease (SCD):\n      vasoocclusion and hemolysis. Vasoocclusion is very likely to account for the tissue\n      infarction and pain associated with the disease, while hemolysis liberates hemoglobin into\n      the plasma where it scavenges nitric oxide (NO), producing vascular complications such as\n      pulmonary hypertension and skin ulcers. The plasma and vessel wall adhesive protein von\n      Willebrand factor (VWF) is thought to be involved in both of these processes, so strategies\n      aimed at reducing its secretion or reactivity, which could decrease complications in\n      patients with SCD, are being tested.\n\n      Based on prior studies, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment may decrease VWF activity in\n      patients with SCD and may be a useful adjunctive treatment in this disorder.\n\n      This is a pilot study in patients with hemoglobin homozygous S (HbSS) or hemoglobin S with\n      beta zero thalassemia(HbS-\u03b2o thalassemia), with the aim of examining the effect of NAC\n      treatment on VWF parameters. As a first step, the investigators will examine whether\n      intravenous or oral administration of NAC, in doses used to treat other conditions, changes\n      VWF content, activity, multimer size, or extent of oxidation. In prior studies,\n      investigators have shown that a number of patients followed in the sickle cell clinic at the\n      University of Washington have ultralarge VWF multimers and high VWF:total activity (TA).\n      Only patients with elevated VWF are eligible for this pilot study."
