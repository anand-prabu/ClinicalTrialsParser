    <textblock>
      Voclosporin is a next generation CNI intended for use in the prevention of organ graft
      rejection and for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.  The aim of the current study is to
      investigate whether voclosporin added to the standard of care treatment in active LN is able
      to reduce disease activity, as measured by a reduction in proteinuria.  Two doses of
      voclosporin will be studied and compared in a placebo controlled trial on a background of
      MMF and corticosteroids.  Patients with active, flaring LN will be eligible to enter the
      study. They are required to have a diagnosis of LN according to established diagnostic
      criteria (American College of Rheumatology) and clinical and biopsy features suggestive of
      active nephritis. Efficacy will be assessed by the ability of the drug combination to reduce
      the level of proteinuria while demonstrating an acceptable safety profile.

             greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal) at screening and confirmed before
             randomization.

          -  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma requiring oral steroids.

          -  Bone marrow insufficiency unrelated to active SLE (according to Investigator
             judgment) with white blood cell count &lt;2,500/mm3; absolute neutrophil count &lt;1.3 x
             103/μL; thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;50,000/mm3).

          -  Active bleeding disorders.

          -  Current infection requiring IV antibiotics.

        Any overlapping autoimmune condition for which the condition or the treatment of the
        condition may affect the study assessments or outcomes. Overlapping conditions for which
        the condition or treatment is not expected to affect assessments or outcomes are not
        excluded.

        Subjects who are pregnant, breast feeding or, if of childbearing potential, not using
        adequate contraceptive precautions.
