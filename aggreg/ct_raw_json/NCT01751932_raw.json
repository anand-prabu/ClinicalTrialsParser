            "textblock": "The study will use two CE marked Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) systems; Dexcom G4\n      Platinum CGM CE-marked 2012 (Dexcom, USA) and the Medtronic Paradigm Veo system with Enlite\n      Sensor CE-marked 2011 (Medtronic, USA). Both the Dexcom G4 Platinum and the Medtronic Enlite\n      sensors will be obtained through normal commercial channels rather than directly from the\n      manufacturer. The two CGM sensors will be worn concomitantly by the participant during the\n      visit to the Clinical Research Center (CRC). This visit will have a duration of 6 hours.\n      Blood will be drawn for the determination of glucose levels. The patient will receive his\n      usual breakfast and an increased insulin bolus (180% of the patient's calculated mealtime\n      dose) will be administered to correct the breakfast glucose excursion with the aim of\n      inducing a period of minor hypoglycaemia. Blood sampling will continue until the end of the\n      admission. At the end of this CRC part, the patient will continue to wear the two sensors at\n      home. In the case of sensor failure before the CRC session on the third day into the study,\n      patients will be instructed to insert a new sensor per the manufacturer's instruction for\n      use and to notify study coordinators of the event. Sensors will be worn until the end of the\n      six day study duration. Patients will be asked to perform at least 6 fingersticks per day\n      for blood glucose measurements with the study glucometer. The study will end on the 6th day\n      after initial sensor insertion.  Patients will return to the CRC to have the sensor removed\n      and their CGM sensor and blood glucometer data downloaded from the devices. In case of\n      failure of both sensors after the CRC session but before the scheduled six day study\n      duration, patients will return to the CRC for sensor removal and for data download."
