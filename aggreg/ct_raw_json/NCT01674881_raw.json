            "textblock": "A recent epidemiologic survey has indicated that approx. 42% of Danish women treated for\n      breast cancer experience negative sequelae in the form of pain following treatment. Chronic\n      pain is known to be associated with impaired social and emotional functioning, and thus\n      presents a particular concern.\n\n      Mindfulness-based intervention is among the complementary, psychological treatments, which\n      cancer patients commonly seek out in relation to the course of their illness. Despite the\n      popularity of mindfulness-based intervention among cancer patients, no studies have so far\n      investigated the effect of mindfulness-based intervention on chronic pain in breast cancer\n      patients. While no studies so far have focused on pain, there is evidence to suggest that\n      mindfulness-based intervention is associated with improved psychosocial adaption to cancer.\n      Furthermore, non-cancer research suggests that mindfulness-based intervention is associated\n      with reduced pain experiences.\n\n      The aim of this project is to investigate the effect of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy\n      (MBCT) on chronic pain in breast cancer patients. Women who have completed their treatment\n      for breast cancer and who experience chronic pain, will be randomized to an intervention\n      group (MBCT) or a treatment-as-usual control group. All participants will be assessed at the\n      same time points, i.e. before the intervention (baseline), and three times after the\n      intervention/control condition, with the last follow-up 6 months after the intervention. In\n      addition, a number of potential moderators and mediators of the outcome will be explored.\n      For example, recent studies indicate that adult attachment style may constitute an important\n      moderator and/or mediator in the development of pain, and preliminary research has suggested\n      that attachment style may moderate the effect of mindfulness-based intervention.\n\n      The results will provide valuable new knowledge about the potential of MBCT as a treatment\n      strategy for chronic pain in breast cancer patients, will contribute to the clarification of\n      underlying mechanisms in the experience of and coping with pain, which could help the\n      development of more effective, individualized interventions."
