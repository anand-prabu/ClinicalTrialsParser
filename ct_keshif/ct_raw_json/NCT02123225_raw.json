            "textblock": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality after\n      total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Up to 30% of surgical patients have undiagnosed OSA; however,\n      many patients are unable to obtain a sleep study prior to surgery. In recent years the\n      STOP-BANG questionnaire (8 yes-no questions; \u22653 high-risk OSA) has become one of the most\n      common tools used in the preoperative period to identify patients at high-risk for OSA.\n      However, further research is needed to determine if the STOP-BANG is predictive of worsening\n      of sleep apnea parameters in patients undergoing TKA.\n\n      The purpose of this prospective observational cohort study is to determine in TKA patients\n      if the score on the STOP-BANG (<3, \u22653 to <5, or \u22655) is predictive of worsening sleep apnea\n      parameters (AHI, time with SPO2 <90% & 85% [T90 & T85], lowest oxygen saturation [LSAT], &\n      number of central apneas) during the first three days after surgery. The investigators\n      propose to enroll N = 168 patients undergoing TKA at NMCSD who are receiving multimodal\n      anesthesia/analgesia for surgery. Patients will complete a baseline unattended sleep study\n      prior to surgery then again for the first three days after surgery. Patients will be\n      categorized into three groups based on their STOP-BANG score (<3, \u22653 to <5, or \u22655) and the\n      investigators will first compare the groups to identify if there are differences between\n      baseline and postoperative sleep apnea parameters based on the STOP-BANG groups (<3, \u22653 to\n      <5, or \u22655). If differences are found the investigators will use multiple regression analysis\n      to determine if the STOP-BANG scores or categories and/or other covariates (i.e.,\n      comorbidity index, total morphine equivalents) are predictive of worsening sleep apnea\n      during the first three days after surgery.\n\n      Results of this study may help improve patient safety by allowing us to identify which group\n      of TKA patients with undiagnosed OSA may require more intensive postoperative monitoring and\n      therapy (i.e, ICU admission, need for continuous end-tidal CO2 monitoring, postoperative\n      positive airway pressure therapy) or change in the analgesic plan."
