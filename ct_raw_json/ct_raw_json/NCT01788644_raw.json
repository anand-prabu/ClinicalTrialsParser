The investigators plan to establish a\n      racially and ethnically diverse southern cohort of 800 mother/infant dyads, followed\n      regularly from birth to 12 months of age. The cohort will be residents of Durham, NC and the\n      immediate surrounding area. The proposed longitudinal study will examine factors\n      contributing to the development of obesity, including dietary behaviors, physical activity\n      and inactivity, stress, and sleep duration and quality. Frequent in-home assessments\n      throughout infancy and contact with other care providers will help pinpoint exactly when\n      children begin to gain weight excessively and will identify risk factors related to energy\n      intake, energy expenditure, stress, and sleep associated with obesity."
