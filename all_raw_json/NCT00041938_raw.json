All randomized patients\n      have completed their follow up. All study related procedure as per the protocol has been\n      completed. We are now in the extension phase of the study to obtain more patient data to\n      address further aims of the study.  No new procedures are performed and data already in\n      place at the sites will be collected (EKG and echocardiograms).\n\n      The aims for this study extension are:\n\n        -  To assess progression of cardiac dysfunction over time among heart failure patients\n\n        -  To correlate prognosis with cardiac dysfunction"

Warfarin is the most promising unstudied\n      intervention in patients with cardiac failure.  This randomized, double-blind, multi-center\n      study will define optimal antithrombotic therapy for patients with cardiac (heart) failure\n      and patients with low ejection fraction (EF).  EF is the proportion of left ventricular\n      volume emptied during systole.  It reliably measures left ventricular systolic function.\n\n      With the rapidly increasing numbers of elderly patients with heart failure, this study has\n      important public health implications.  The study will determine which of two commonly used\n      treatments Warfarin, an anticoagulant, or aspirin, a drug which affects platelet function is\n      better for preventing death and stroke in patients with low ejection fraction."
