Treatment continues in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1-3 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 56-120 patients (14-30 per stratum) will be accrued for this\n      study within 15 months."
