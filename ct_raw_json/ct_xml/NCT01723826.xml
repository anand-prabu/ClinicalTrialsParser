    <textblock>
      This Phase II, open-label extension (OLE), multicenter study will evaluate the l ong-term
      safety and tolerability of crenezumab in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease
      who have participated in and completed the treatment period of the Phase II Study ABE4869g
      or ABE4955g. Patients will receive crenezumab at the same dosing frequency, dose level and
      route of administration they were ass igned to after the Week 73 visit of Study ABE4869g or
      ABE4955g. Patients who rec eived placebo in Study ABE4869g or ABE4955g will receive active
      drug. Anticipate d time on study treatment is 94 weeks.

             daily living and behavior in order to complete the study-specific assessments

          -  Diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease according to the National Institute on
             Neurological and Communication Disease and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related
             Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria (McKhann et al. 1984)

          -  MMSE score of 12 or more at screening (Folstein et al. 1975)
