The project will simultaneously\n      conduct a cross-sectional and a case-control study.  The primary aim will investigate\n      cross-sectional association between older age and the energy expenditure of daily activities\n      by recruiting approximately 25 adults in each of 7 age groups\n      (20-30,30-40,40-50,50-60,60-70,70-80,80+) for a total of 180 individuals.  A secondary aim\n      will investigate the effect of functional impairments on the energy expenditure of daily\n      activities by conducting a case-control study.  An additional 25 older adults with\n      functional impairment will be recruited in each age decade (60-70, 70-80, and 80+ years old)\n      to accomplish this aim.  Additional outcomes will evaluate rating of perceived exertion\n      differences in daily activities.  A tertiary aim will investigate using accelerometers to\n      predict the metabolic costs of daily activities."
