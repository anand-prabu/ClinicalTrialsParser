Prostate volumes 30 - 80 gm based on transrectal ultrasound\n\n          3. Men \u2265 50 years of age\n\n          4. IPSS symptom score > 15 and IPSS bother score > 2\n\n          5. Baseline peak flow rate Qmax < 12 cc/s on two separate occasions with voided volume\n             at least 150 cc\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. History of prostate or bladder cancer, pelvic radiation, untreated bladder stones,\n             urethral strictures/bladder neck contracture (BNC), renal insufficiency (i.e.\n             creatinine > 1.4)\n\n          2. Neurogenic bladder, Parkinson's disease\n\n          3. Prior treatment for urinary incontinence\n\n          4. Micturition frequency AND urgency.  Micturition frequency defined as > 8 micturitions\n             per 24 hours as assessed by a thorough subject history including the question: \"On\n             average, how many times do you void during a 24 hour period? // < 4, 5-7, 8 or more.\"\n               Urgency defined as an uncontrollable urge to void that occurs > 3 per 24 hours as\n             assessed through the subject history/question:  \"On average, how many times a day do\n             you have an uncontrollable urgency to void? // 0, 1-2, 3 or more?\"\n\n          5. Intravesical prostate lobe protrusion > 1 cm on TRUS.

Not able to temporarily discontinue aspirin, Coumadin, Plavix and any other\n             anticoagulant at least seven days prior to the time of treatment\n\n         10. History of known bleeding disorders (e.g. von Willebrand disease)\n\n         11. Prior BPH prostate procedures (e.g. Transurethral Microwave Therapy [TUMT], TUNA,\n             water induced thermotherapy, TURP, PVP)\n\n         12. Men with confirmed or suspected malignancy of the prostate based on a digital rectal\n             exam (DRE), prostate biopsy or PSA > 10 ng/mL.  Men with free PSA < 25% and with PSA\n             within an age and race-specific range may only be enrolled after a negative biopsy.\n             If a biopsy is required, the subject shall have a six-week waiting period between the\n             biopsy and histotripsy treatment, if he is deemed eligible to participate in the\n             study.\n\n         13. Men interested in future fertility\n\n         14. Declines or unable to provide informed consent\n\n         15. Non-English-speaker\n\n         16. Life expectancy estimated to be less than one year\n\n         17. Unable or unwilling to complete all required questionnaires and follow-up assessments\n\n         18. In the opinion of the investigator, it is not in the subject's best interest to\n             participate in the study."
