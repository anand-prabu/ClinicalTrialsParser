            "textblock": "Colon capsule endoscopy is a new technology that is a noninvasive method of examining the\n      large bowel. The bowel preparation required for this test differs from colonoscopy in that\n      it needs to clean the colon but also needs to provide propulsion. Most published studies\n      have used medications as part of their regime that are not available in parts of North\n      America (ex. sodium phosphate) and have shown poor test completion, bowel preparation and\n      polyp detection rates.\n\n      Objective: In this study a bowel preparation for the colon capsule is proposed that uses\n      medications approved for use in Canada that may provide a better preparation quality and\n      better completion rates.\n\n      Methods: Patients who are being referred for a colonoscopy will be recruited to participate\n      in the study. They will all receive split-dose polyethylene glycol (PEG) for bowel\n      preparation. They will be randomized to receive either 1) Prucalopride 2mg daily for four\n      days, 2) Prucalopride 2mg daily for four days plus a Prucalopride booster, or 3)\n      Prucalopride 2mg for four days plus 1 and 1/2 sachets of Picosalax boosters for the colon\n      capsule study.  The day after the colon capsule they will drink PEG 2L at 5am ( or approx\n      4hrs prior to procedure time and return for a colonoscopy.  The colon capsule results will\n      be reviewed by two endoscopists experienced in video capsule endoscopy who will assess the\n      bowel preparation using a previously defined scale and examine for polyps. We propose that\n      administering Prucalopride daily for 4 days will increase intestinal motility and improve\n      colon capsule completion rates and a booster dose of Picosalax will improve colon capsule\n      completion rates compared to prucalopride by itself."
