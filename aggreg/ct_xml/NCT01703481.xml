      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (study of what the
      body does to a drug), and pharmacodynamics (study of what a drug does to the body) of
      JNJ-42756493, a pan-fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in
      adult participants with advanced or refractory solid tumors or lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 first-in-human, non-randomized (individuals will not be assigned by chance
      to study treatments), open-label (individuals will know the identity of study treatments),
      multicenter, 3-part, dose-escalation study. Each cycle will consist of 21 days of daily
      continuous dosing or 28 days of intermittent dosing schedule. Part 1 is the dose-escalation
      phase, which will be guided by pharmacokinetics and safety. Three to 6 new participants will
      be enrolled in sequential cohorts (first cohort will receive the starting dose and
      subsequent cohorts will receive increased doses of JNJ-42756493). Enrollment in each cohort
      will be staggered; the second and third participant in every cohort will not be dosed until
      the first participant in that cohort is beyond Day 7 of Cycle 1. If no dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLTs) have been observed during the first week of Cycle 1 in the first
      participant, the second and third participant in the cohort will initiate treatment. After
      the last participants in each cohort completes Cycle 1 (DLT observation period of 21 days of
      treatment), the Safety Evaluation Team (SET) will evaluate the safety for DLT determination
      and the pharmacokinetic data and make the decision whether to escalate the dose in a new
      cohort of 3 to 6 new participants. Dose escalation will halt when the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) or when the plasma concentrations exceed the predefined cardiovascular threshold. The
      total number of participants to be enrolled in Part 1 will depend on the dose level at which
      the DLT will be achieved. Part 2 is the Dose Confirmation Phase, which consists of 1 biopsy
      cohort. The study drug will be administered once daily on a continuous 21 day cycle at the
      RP2D. Approximately 10 to 20 participants will be enrolled for treatment at the RP2D. In the
      Part 2 biopsy cohort, tumor biopsies will be mandatory at pretreatment and during treatment
      (Day 1 of Cycle 2) until pretreatment/post-treatment biopsy pairs are collected for at least
      10 participants. Part 3 is the Dose Expansion Phase, which consists of 4 expansion cohorts
      (Cohorts A, B, C, and D). In this cohort, study drug will be administered once daily on a
      continuous 21-day cycle. Up to 15 subjects for each cohort will be enrolled before the
      interim analysis and up to 30 additional subjects may be enrolled for treatment at the RP2D
      to evaluate clinical responses. The study will take approximately 36 months to complete.
