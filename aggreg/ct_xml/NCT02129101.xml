    <textblock>
      This phase I/IB trial studies the side effects, best dose, and efficacy of azacitidine and
      erismodegib in treating patients with myeloid malignancies. The hedgehog (Hh) signaling
      pathway plays an important role in cellular growth, differentiation and repair.
      Inappropriate activation of Hh pathway signaling and uncontrolled cellular proliferation may
      be associated with mutations in the Hh-ligand cell surface receptor Smo. Erismodegib binds
      to the Hh cell surface receptor Smo, which may result in the suppression of the Hh signaling
      pathway and the inhibition of cancer cells. Azacitidine may stop the growth of cancer cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving azacitidine together with
      erismodegib may be a safe and successful treatment for patients with myeloid malignancies.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of LDE225 (Sonidegib)
      in combination with azacitidine (overall). (Phase I) II. To estimate the efficacy of LDE225
      in combination with azacitidine in the following subgroups: untreated acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML)/chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)/myelodysplastic syndrome
      (MDS)/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) Overlap; relapsed/refractory AML/CMML/MDS/MPN
      Overlap; and myelofibrosis (MF) only. (Phase IB)  SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the
      duration of response, time to progression, overall survival, and time to AML or death (for
      MDS subjects) of LDE225 in combination with azacitidine (overall and by cohort). (Phase
      I/1B)  TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To conduct correlative studies to measure hedgehog (HH)
      pathway activation and inhibition and explore biomarkers of response. II. To evaluate
      quality of life (QOL) and patient-reported symptoms using the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm
      Symptom Assessment Form (MPNSAF) and European Organization for Research and Treatment of
      Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-Core (C)30 in subjects treated with
      LDE225 in combination with azacitidine.  OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of
      erismodegib.  Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) on days
      1-7 and Sonidegib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  After completion of study
      treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months until progressive disease and then every
      6 months.

             contraception is defined as either:   ** Total abstinence: When this is in line with
             the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient; periodic abstinence (e.g.,
             calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not
             acceptable methods of contraception   ** Sterilization: Patient has had surgical
             bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six
             weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the
             reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level
             assessment   ** Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy
             documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate); (for female study patients,

             (IUD) or nonhormonal intrauterine system (IUS)   *** Barrier method of contraception:
             condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical vault caps) with spermicidal
             foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository   **** Note: Hormonal contraception methods
             (e.g. oral, injected, implanted) are not allowed as it cannot be ruled out that the
             study drug decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraception    **** Note: Women
             are considered post-menopausal and not child bearing potential if they have had 12
             months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g.
             age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea with serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL and
             estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
             hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago; in the case of oophorectomy alone, only when
             the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level
             assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential   **** Note: Male patient
             must use highly effective (double barrier) methods of contraception (e.g.,
             spermicidal gel plus condom) for the entire duration of the study, and continuing
             using contraception and refrain from fathering a child for 6 months following the
             study drug; a condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men as well as
             during intercourse with a male partner in order to prevent delivery of the study
