Biological therapies such as gefitinib may interfere with the\n      growth of the tumor cells and slow the growth of colorectal cancer. Combining chemotherapy\n      with gefitinib may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to compare the effectiveness of chemotherapy with or without\n      gefitinib in treating patients who have metastatic or locally recurrent colorectal cancer."

Patients are stratified according to ECOG performance status\n      (0 vs 1-2).\n\n        -  Phase I: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and oral gefitinib once\n           daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease\n           progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gefitinib until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n        -  Phase II: Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n             -  Arm I: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1.\n\n             -  Arm II: Patients receive oxaliplatin as in arm I and oral gefitinib once daily at\n                the MTD on days 1-21.\n\n      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in arm II with stable or responding disease\n      after 6 courses may continue to receive gefitinib alone until disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 77 patients (9 for phase I and 68 for phase II) will be\n      accrued for this study within 12-14 months."
