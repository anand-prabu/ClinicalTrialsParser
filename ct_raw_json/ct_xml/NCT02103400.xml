  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) have reduced functional
      capacity, peripheral muscle strength and quality of life. Despite the high incidence and
      severity has not yet been demonstrated whether a physical training program can change these
      outcomes. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of an exercise training program in patients
      hospitalized for CAP, to compare this effects with traditional physical therapy and assess
      whether the inflammatory markers correlate with the functional status of the patient and
      type of treatment. Methods: A controlled, prospective, randomized clinical trial. Patients
      hospitalized for CAP, adults, conscious, hemodynamically stable and independent to walk will
      be studied. In the first day, a medical history, measured dyspnea, incremental shuttle walk
      test, Glittre test, measurement of peripheral muscle strength, spirometry, and the
      application of quality of life questionnaire Shor Form 36 will be held. The measurement of
      inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor) will also be held.
      Patients will be randomized into two groups: one will perform a program of physical training
      (stretching, active resistance exercises and aerobic exercises) and the other group held the
      traditional physical therapy (bronchial hygiene, breathing exercises and walking) for eight
      days. On the tenth day the same assessment will be carried out initially described.
