      The purpose of this research study is to determine if auto-adjustable positive airway
      pressure (APAP) is an effective way to treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children.
      APAP is a device similar to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) that delivers
      pressure to the upper airway (nose and throat) to keep the airway from collapsing while
      during sleep.  The difference is that APAP adjusts the pressure throughout the night with
      changes in resistance during breathing, and CPAP gives the same amount of pressure the whole
      time it is worn.  APAP is currently widely used to treat adults with OSA, however, this
      device has not yet been extensively studied in children.

      There are two parts to this research study.  Subjects will begin using APAP at the time of
      enrollment for 4 to 8 weeks. The investigators will compare the pressure measured by the
      APAP device over the 4-8 weeks with the pressure determined by a CPAP titration study. The
      titration study is a second overnight sleep study that is routinely ordered when a child
      with sleep apnea starts treatment with CPAP.  It tells the doctor what CPAP setting should
      be used.

      In the second part of this study The investigators will compare the effects of APAP with
      CPAP to see what is reported as more comfortable and is used during more hours of sleep.
      This part of the study will last about 8 weeks and each subject will use both CPAP and APAP
      for 4 weeks each.

      Currently when someone is diagnosed with OSA there is a delay in starting treatment with
      CPAP until the results of the titration study are available.  In this research, patients
      could be allowed to immediately start treatment with APAP. If APAP is found to be as safe
      and effective as regular CPAP, treatment with APAP could be used as an alternative to CPAP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a small clinical trial to test the feasibility of using APAP in children with sleep
      apnea.

      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is commonly used to treat OSA by delivering a
      predetermined amount of positive pressure to the patient's upper airway in order to reduce
      the collapsibility of airway structures during sleep.  The commonly accepted method for
      determining the appropriate pressure setting for children with OSA is through an in-hospital
      overnight CPAP titration study.  Another commonly used treatment modality in adults with OSA
      is auto-adjustable positive airway pressure (APAP), in which airway patency is maintained by
      adjusting pressure delivery through the night depending on the needs of the patient as
      determined by the device.  Benefits of APAP compared with CPAP include the ability to
      initiate therapy without an inpatient CPAP titration study, resulting in more prompt
      establishment of treatment and cost-savings.  Patient adherence may also be significantly
      improved as the pressure delivered is appropriate for sleep stage and patient position,
      resulting in greater patient comfort.  Utility and efficacy of APAP compared to CPAP have
      never been evaluated in the pediatric population.

      The aim of this study is to establish APAP as an effective means of assessing CPAP pressure
      for OSA in children, and to determine if APAP therapy confers better treatment adherence and
      quality of life compared to traditional CPAP.  The investigators hypothesize that APAP can
      effectively approximate the pressure determined by CPAP titration study, that APAP is
      superior to fixed CPAP in terms of treatment success, and that adherence to therapy will be
      improved with APAP compared to CPAP.

      Forty patients aged 5-20 years will be enrolled in the study. These subjects will be
      recruited from the pediatric pulmonary or pediatric sleep clinic at Cincinnati Children's
      Hospital.  Patients who are suspected of having OSA will be referred in the usual manner to
      the sleep center for diagnostic sleep study (PSG).  Following the establishment of OSA
      diagnosis and subsequent enrollment in the study, the subject will begin therapy with APAP
      which will continue for 4 to 8 weeks.  In that period of time the clinically ordered
      in-hospital CPAP titration study will be completed.  The subject will then be randomized to
      either traditional fixed pressure CPAP at the pressure determined by in-hospital titration
      or APAP.  The subject will receive 4 weeks of treatment in the randomized group (CPAP or
      APAP) then crossover to 4 weeks in the alternate group (CPAP or APAP).  Both patient and
      researcher will be blinded to the randomization of pressure modality.  The total study
      period will range from 12-16 weeks.
