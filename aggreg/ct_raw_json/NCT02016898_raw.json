Suitable candidate for trabeculectomy with Ex-PRESS glaucoma filtration device with\n             MMC in the superonasal quadrant in the study eye which the physician deems as\n             medically necessary.\n\n          4. Capable and willing to provide consent\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Unable or unwilling to provide consent\n\n          2. Any previous ocular surgeries in the study eye preventing placement of the\n             trabeculectomy with Ex-PRESS glaucoma filtration device with MMC in the superonasal\n             quadrant\n\n          3. Any previous glaucoma drainage devices in the study eye\n\n          4. Any abnormality other than glaucoma in the study eye that could affect applanation\n             tonometry.\n\n          5. Presence or history of any abnormality or disorder that could interfere with the\n             study procedure or prevent the successful completion of the study.\n\n          6. Presence or history of uveitis within 10 years or any other ocular infection or\n             inflammation within 14 days before day 1.\n\n          7. Any significant unstable cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory,\n             gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, hematologic, neurologic, or\n             psychiatric disease.\n\n          8.
