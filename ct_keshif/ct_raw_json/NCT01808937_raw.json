Patient must have a clinical diagnosis of morphea confirmed by the primary\n             investigator and by histopathological examination.\n\n          2. Ages 0-90 years old\n\n          3. Children must weigh more than 20 lbs. in order to satisfy Children's Medical Center\n             policy for the maximum amount of blood drawn in a 24 hour period.\n\n          4.

All races and ethnic backgrounds will be included\n\n          7. Relationships to proband: All patients with morphea will be included. A patient's\n             family history will be reviewed and if there is a family history of morphea or\n             systemic sclerosis then we will give the study patient the investigator's contact\n             information and ask the family member to call the study team to answer any questions\n             and enroll them in the study if they choose to do so.\n\n          8. Ability to give informed consent: Patients must be able to give informed consent or\n             they will give assent with parent or guardian consent as a minor to be a part of the\n             morphea registry.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        - Patients who have been coded as morphea (701.0), but do not have morphea/localized\n        scleroderma (examples: steroid atrophy, acquired keratoderma, keloids, nephrogenic\n        fibrosing dermopathy, systemic sclerosis, lichen sclerosis)"
