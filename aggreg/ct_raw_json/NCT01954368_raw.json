            "textblock": "Time to pain-relief can vary widely in the Emergency Department (ED), depending on various\n      factors such as ED overcrowding or inadequate training in pain management.\n\n      As intravenous (IV) opioid administration is world-wide recommended for severe pain\n      treatment, delays from triage to room admission and to first IV injection directly influence\n      this time to pain-relief. Moreover, it is proven that an incorrect adherence to morphine\n      titration protocol can participate in ED oligoanalgesia.\n\n      Although ED experience in intranasal (IN) opioid administration is still lacking, this\n      simple and non-invasive way of treating pain seems safe and promising. Opioid\n      pharmacokinetic by IN route indeed is interesting for ED practitioners : while assuring a\n      timely analgesia, the lower Cmax and delayed Tmax by IN route can theoretically limit the\n      risk of respiratory depression, in comparison with IV route.\n\n      We propose a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study on a convenience sample of\n      adult patients admitted in our ED (annual census of 80000 attendances) for an isolated limb\n      injury, and experiencing a severe pain (score > 5/10 on numerical pain scale).\n\n      For primary outcome, we will compare the proportion of patients relieved (score < 4/10) 30\n      minutes after admission, depending on the administration (or not) of a single intranasal\n      dose of sufentanil (0,4 mcg/kg) given by the triage nurse.\n\n      Other secondary outcomes will include : evolution of pain scores in the first hour of\n      admission and during entire ED stay, proportions of opioid-induced side-effects, proportions\n      of patients receiving morphine and doses of morphine administrated, times for discharge,\n      patient and staff satisfaction scores."
