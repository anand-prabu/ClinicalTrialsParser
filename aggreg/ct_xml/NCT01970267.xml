  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitreous floaters are tiny, cloudy, clumps of cells that appear in the otherwise clear fluid
      (vitreous) that fills the back 3/4 of the eye. Floaters are commonly caused by eye
      conditions such as posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), vitreous syneresis and asteroid
      hyalosis. While these symptoms are considered physiological in nature, they can be of
      considerable inconvenience to many patients which affect essential activities. The
      investigators wish to assess the safety and efficacy of floater treatment in patients with
      highly symptomatic floaters using an FDA approved nanosecond infrared yttrium aluminum
      garnet (YAG) lasers.

    <description>Laser will direct the laser at vitreous opacities. The power of the laser will be adjusted from 0.3-12 millijoules (mJ) with the end point being laser induced optical breakdown and the production of a small gas bubble 50% of the time. The treatment will attempt to reduced or eliminate symptomatic floaters in the visual axis. Each treatment session will be limited to 300 laser applications. Participants will be retreated based on continued symptoms for up to 5 sessions</description>

    <description>Laser will be set at 0.3 millijoules (mJ). There will be a 100% absorptive filter (black spot) of about 1cm placed centrally on the lens. All laser aiming beams will be placed within the 1cm filter. Laser will be applied at 0.3 mJ at the absorptive black spot (100% density filter) in order to create a realistic treatment therapy procedure.</description>

          -  Be able to provide informed consent

          -  Diagnosed with Posterior Vitreous Detachment

          -  Accept a 1% risk of complications

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Less than 19 years of age

          -  Is a high myope (greater than -6 diopters)

          -  Has monocular vision

          -  Diagnosed with asteroid hyalosis

          -  Diagnosed with acute on-set of floaters (less than two months and may clear
             spontaneously)
