  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frozen shoulder or adhesive capsulitis is a common cause of shoulder pain, estimated to
      affect 25% of the general population.  Many forms of treatment have been advocated for
      frozen shoulder including physiotherapy, injection with steroid, distension arthrogram with
      steroid, manipulation under anesthetic and arthroscopic releases. There is no general
      agreement in favour of one form of treatment, and the response to a particular treatment
      varies in different series. A few randomized controlled trials appear in the literature.
      Most of these showed improvements with steroid use, but the results were not always
      statistically significant.  One randomized control trial reported superior results in favor
      of arthrographic joint distension with steroid compared to a saline placebo.   To our
      knowledge there have been no other similar randomized trials to support these results.  The
      objective of this study is to determine if arthrographic distension of the shoulder joint
      with steriods is an effective treatment modality for adhesive capsulitis as compared to
      injection with local anesthetic and contrast alone.  The study design is a
      placebo-controlled, double blind clinical trial where participants will undergo distension
      arthrogram of the shoulder and be randomized to receive either Triamcinalone (steroid),
      lidocaine and contrast or injection with lidocaine and contrast alone.
