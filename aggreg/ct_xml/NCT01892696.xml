  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical usefulness of inspiratory flow pattern manipulation during mechanical
      ventilation remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of
      different inspiratory flow waveforms, i.e. constant and decelerating, on cardiac preload in
      mechanically ventilated patients assessed by arterial pulse pressure variation (PPV) and
      inferior vena cava distensibility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During mechanical ventilation the lungs can be inflated with different pressure and flow
      waveforms. Originally the piston-driven mechanical ventilators generated a quasi-sinusoidal
      flow waveform, whereas the newer electronically controlled ventilators can also produce
      constant and decelerating waveforms. According to several theoretical,animal and clinical
      studies,the inspiratory flow waveform affects the distribution of the inspired gas as well
      as respiratory mechanics and gas exchange. However, other studies failed to show any
      significant effect.But there is no study interested to the effects of inspiratory flow
      waveforms on cardiac preload. Thus, the clinical usefulness of inspiratory flow pattern
      manipulation remains unclear, though the capacity for selection of different inspiratory
      flow waveforms is provided by most modern, microprocessor-equipped ventilators. Therefore,
      the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of flow patterns (sinusoidal, constant
      and decelerating) on dynamic measurements of cardiac preload dependence such as arterial
      pulse pressure variation (ΔPP) and distensibility index of the inferior vena cava (dIVC).

    <description>inspiratory flow waveform was changed, in a randomized sequence using a computer ,to one of the following modalities: 1) constant inspiratory flow; 2) decelerating inspiratory flow Each inspiratory flow waveform was maintained for 30 min. During the last 5 min of this period the physiological signals were collected and measures were performed.</description>
