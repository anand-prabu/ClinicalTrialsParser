  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of an
      extended half-life anti-respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) monoclonal antibody compared to
      placebo when administered to healthy adult subjects.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of MEDI8897 compared to placebo when
      administered to healthy adult subjects. Approximately 72 subjects will be entered to receive
      treatment across 5 fixed dose cohorts at 1 site.  Investigational product will be delivered
      intravenously (IV) to 3 cohorts and intramuscularly (IM) to 2 cohorts. A total of 4
      different dose levels of investigational product will be evaluated across the 5 cohorts.
      Subjects will be followed for approximately 1 year.
