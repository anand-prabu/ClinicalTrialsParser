  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies antiemetic (prevents or reduces nausea and vomiting)
      therapy with olanzapine to see how well they work compared to antiemetic therapy alone in
      preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer receiving highly
      emetogenic (causes vomiting) chemotherapy. Antiemetic drugs, such as palonosetron
      hydrochloride, ondansetron, and granisetron hydrochloride, may help lessen or prevent nausea
      and vomiting in patients treated with chemotherapy. Olanzapine may help prevent
      chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting by blocking brain receptors that appear to be
      involved in nausea and vomiting. Giving antiemetic therapy with olanzapine may help to
      reduce or prevent nausea and vomiting in patients treated with highly emetogenic
      chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cancer may receive chemotherapy that may cause nausea and vomiting. The
      purpose of this study is to determine if the use of olanzapine can significantly reduce
      nausea and vomiting in a large number of patients receiving chemotherapy. Patients are
      randomized to one of two treatment arms. Please see the &quot;Arms and Intervention&quot; sections for
      more detailed information. The primary objective is to compare the number of patients with
      no nausea for the acute (0-24 hours post-chemotherapy), delayed (24-120 hours
      post-chemotherapy) and overall periods (0-120 hours post-chemotherapy) for patients
      receiving HEC. The secondary objectives are:

        1. To compare the complete response (CR) (no emetic episodes and no use of rescue
           medication in the acute, delayed and overall periods

        2. To compare the incidences of potential toxicities ascribed to olanzapine

      Protocol treatment is to begin ≤ 14 days of registration. Patients will receive treatment on
      Days 1-4. Patients will be permitted to take rescue therapy of the treating investigator's
      choice based on the clinical circumstances. After completing treatment, patients will be
      monitored for side effects.
