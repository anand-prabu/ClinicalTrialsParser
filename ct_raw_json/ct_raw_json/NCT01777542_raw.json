While IGF-1 is approved by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA)\n      for certain use in children, it is considered an investigational drug in this trial because\n      it has not previously been used to treat RTT. Information from this study will help\n      determine if IGF-1 effectively treats RTT but will not necessarily lead to FDA approval of\n      IGF-1 as a treatment for RTT."

            "textblock": "Enrolled subjects will complete five study periods: screening, two 20-week long treatment\n      periods, a 10-week break between treatment periods (\"washout\"), and a follow-up phone call 4\n      weeks after all treatment ends. Subjects will be chosen at random to receive either IGF-1 or\n      placebo during the first treatment period and then switch to the alternate medication for\n      the second treatment period. Therefore, by completion of the trial, all subjects will have\n      received treatment with IGF-1 for 20 weeks. The study will be double-blinded; meaning,\n      neither subjects' families nor study investigators will know who is receiving IGF-1 or\n      placebo at any time. Treatment must be administered by the caregiver twice daily through\n      subcutaneous (just underneath the skin) injections. Caregivers will be trained by research\n      nurses in how to administer the medication. Participation in this study will last\n      approximately one year.\n\n      Throughout the course of the trial, investigators will collect information to assess the\n      effects of IGF-1 and monitor for safety.  Families must attend study visits at Boston\n      Children's Hospital every 10 weeks; requiring families to travel to and stay in Boston for\n      about a week each time. These visits cannot be completed at any other hospital. Parents will\n      fill out questionnaires and undergo a structured interview reporting on their child's\n      health, behavior, and mood. Subjects will undergo clinical and physical examinations by a\n      study doctor. Non-invasive devices and cameras will also be used to monitor things like\n      breathing, hand movements, heart rate, and body temperature. Blood and urine will be\n      collected for routine laboratory tests to monitor for safety. Investigators will also\n      monitor safety by asking parents to complete a medication diary and side effect reporting\n      form on a regular basis. Between trips to Boston Children's Hospital, parents will complete\n      a set of online questionnaires and undergo a structured interview over the phone.\n\n      The cost of travel and lodging during research-related visits to and from the hospital will\n      not be covered by the study. If a condition or illness is identified during the trial (and\n      is determined to be unrelated to study treatments), referrals to outside medical care will\n      be made. Study medications and all research-related materials and services will be provided\n      at no cost to participants. Parking vouchers will be provided for all study-related hospital\n      visits.\n\n      The study is investigating 5 potential effects:\n\n        1. IGF-1 may improve subjects' behavior, communication and/or mood. In order to measure\n           this, investigators will evaluate subjects every 5 weeks throughout each treatment\n           period with behavioral and psychological assessments. All of the tests used during\n           these evaluations are non-invasive. Investigators will ask parents what their\n           impressions are about their child's behavior and day-to-day activities through a\n           structured parental interview and various questionnaires.\n\n        2. Investigators will examine subjects' brain function through use of a brain- monitoring\n           device known as electroencephalography (EEG). The EEG measurements will be taken while\n           investigators present subjects with exercises to stimulate their vision and hearing.\n           EEG is a non-invasive way of recording the electrical activity of a subject's brain by\n           applying a net of monitors (electrodes) to their scalp. Through this method\n           investigators gain insight into how brain function links to behaviors in individuals\n           with RTT. By understanding this relationship, investigators will be better able to\n           identify whether or not treatment with IGF-1 affects the way the brain communicates\n           with the body.\n\n        3. As one of the features of RTT is unstable vital signs, investigators are trying to\n           determine if IGF-1 has any effect on normalizing subjects' heart rate and breathing\n           patterns. To measure this, investigators will ask subjects to wear a BioCapture\u00ae during\n           hospital study visits every 10 weeks throughout each treatment period. The BioCapture\u00ae\n           is a device that includes three electrocardiogram connectors and two stretchy bands\n           that measure heart rate and respiratory patterns in a non-invasive way. This\n           information will be recorded and stored on an accompanying laptop.\n\n        4. The safety of IGF-1 in children with RTT is very important. Investigators will ask\n           parents to complete a medication diary and side effect reporting form on a regular\n           basis. In addition, laboratory tests will be performed every 10 weeks throughout each\n           treatment period to evaluate the safety of IGF-1. These will be blood tests similar to\n           those provided in typical clinical care. Subjects will undergo regular non-invasive\n           comprehensive physical and neurological examinations, tonsil evaluation,\n           electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, scoliosis x-ray, bone age x-ray, and\n           measurement of height, weight and head circumference.\n\n        5. Children with RTT often experience unintended, stereotyped hand movements. The Qsensor\u00ae\n           is a non-invasive device worn on a fabric bracelet that continually measures subjects'\n           movement. Investigators will use the Qsensor\u00ae to determine whether or not IGF-1 affects\n           the presentation of stereotyped hand movements. As such, investigators will ask\n           subjects to wear the Qsensor\u00ae during study visits every 10 weeks throughout each\n           treatment period and occasionally at home."
