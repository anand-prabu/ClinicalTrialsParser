Diagnosis of subfoveal CNV secondary to wet AMD without restriction of lesion size,\n             with visual impairment being exclusively due to an active wet AMD lesion. Active\n             lesions will be characterised by any of the following: abnormal retinal thickness,\n             with evidence of intraretinal, subretinal or sub-pigment epithelial fluid\n             accumulation, confirmed by OCT; presence of intraretinal or subretinal haemorrhage;\n             new leakage shown on a FA; CNV enlargement on FA unless solely due to dry, fibrotic\n             staining; visual acuity deterioration considered likely to represent CNV.\n\n          2. BCVA score at both Screening and Baseline must be 23 letters or more  as measured by\n             the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like chart at 4 metres,\n             inclusively (or approximate Snellen equivalent to 20/320).\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Any active periocular or ocular infection or inflammation (e.g., blepharitis,\n             conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, uveitis, endophthalmitis) at the time of\n             Screening or Baseline.\n\n          2.

Neovascularisation of the iris or neovascular glaucoma at the time of Screening or\n             Baseline.\n\n          4. Visually significant cataract, aphakia, pseudoexfoliation, severe vitreous\n             haemorrhage, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, proliferative diabetic retinopathy or\n             CNV of any cause other than wet AMD at the time of screening and baseline.\n\n          5. Structural damage within 0.5 disc diameter of the centre of the macula (e.g.,\n             vitreomacular traction, epiretinal membrane, scar, laser burn, foveal atrophy) at the\n             time of screening that in the investigator's opinion could preclude visual function\n             improvement with treatment.\n\n          6. Treatment with any anti-angiogenic drugs (including any anti-VEGF agents) prior to\n             Baseline in study eye (allowed in fellow eye).\n\n          7. Any intraocular procedure (including Ytrium-Aluminium- Garnet capsulotomy) within 2\n             months prior to Baseline or anticipated within the next 6 months following Baseline\n             in th study eye (allowed in fellow eye).\n\n        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply."
