  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Very few studies have examined different models of care involving initial ambulatory
      home-based diagnosis in diagnosing OSA, identifying patients who benefit from CPAP, and
      reducing the need for PSG. This study aims to assess the role of an ambulatory approach with
      home diagnostic sleep study. We hypothesize that the ambulatory approach is as good as the
      conventional approach in managing OSA in terms of improvement of clinical outcome but the
      former approach will lead to substantial cost savings.

    <description>Embletta is a pocket-sized digital recording device. It is a multi-channel screening tool that measures airflow through a nasal cannula connected to a pressure transducer, providing an anpea-hyponea index (AHI) based on recording time. It also detects both respiratory and abdominal efforts through the effort sensor and can differentiate between obstructive and central events.</description>
