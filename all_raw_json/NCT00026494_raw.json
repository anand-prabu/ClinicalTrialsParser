Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 1 year in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of vinorelbine until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional 20-35\n      patients will be treated at that dose level.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3-4 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 3 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of this\n      study and 20-35 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of this study within 2\n      years."
