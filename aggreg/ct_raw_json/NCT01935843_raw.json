RT-PCR(reverse transcription\n      polymerase chain reaction)analysis of whole blood will be used to detect and quantify\n      survival of CART-HER-2 TCR zeta:CD137 and TCR(T-cell receptor) zeta cells over time.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I.For patients with detectable diseases, measure anti-tumor response due to CART-HER-2 cell\n      infusions.\n\n      II.Estimate relative trafficking of CART-HER-2 cells in tumor bed.\n\n      III.Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-HER-2,\n      and assess correlation with loss of detectable CART-HER-2(loss of engraftment).\n\n      IV.Determine the relative subsets of CART-HER-2 T cells (Tcm,Tem,and Treg).\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 group according to order of enrollment. Patients receive\n      anti-HER-2-CAR (coupled with CD137 and CD3 zeta signalling domains)vector-transduced\n      autologous T cells on days 0,1, and 2 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed intensively for 6 months, every 3\n      months for 2 years, and annually thereafter for 13 years.\n\n      Estimate relative trafficking of CART-HER-2 cells in peripheral blood."
