  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to demonstrate that pasireotide-induced hyperglycemia can be effectively and
      safely managed in majority of patients, including those with diabetes at start of
      pasireotide treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV, multi-center, randomized, open-label study. Eligible patients will start
      pasireotide subcutaneously (s.c.) for Cushing's disease and pasireotide LAR (long-acting
      release) for acromegaly. Patients currently treated at screening visit with pasireotide s.c.
      or LAR are eligible as long as they meet protocol criteria during the screening period. If
      previously normo-glycemic patients experience increases in their fasting blood glucose and
      meeting the criteria for diabetes while on pasireotide, they will start anti-diabetic
      treatment using metformin. If they continue to have elevated blood sugars above target on
      metformin within the first 16 weeks, they will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      treatment with incretin based therapy or insulin for approximately 16 weeks.
