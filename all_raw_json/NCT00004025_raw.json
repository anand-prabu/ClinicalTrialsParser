Interleukin-2 may stimulate a\n      person's white blood cells to kill melanoma cells. Combining vaccine therapy with\n      interleukin-2 may be an effective treatment for stage III or stage IV melanoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy with or without\n      interleukin-2 in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV melanoma that cannot be\n      surgically removed."

Evaluate the safety, dose-limiting toxicity, and maximum tolerated dose of\n      autologous dendritic cells transduced with adenoviruses encoding the MART-1 and gp100\n      melanoma antigens with or without interleukin-2 in patients with stage III or IV melanoma.\n      II. Evaluate the cellular response and efficacy of these regimens in this patient\n      population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are sequentially assigned to one of three\n      dose levels. Patients receive modified autologous dendritic cells subcutaneously on day 1\n      with or without interleukin-2 IV on days 4-19. Treatment continues every 21 days for a total\n      of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6\n      patients receive escalating doses of modified dendritic cells with or without interleukin-2\n      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for each regimen is reached. The MTD is defined as\n      the dose below that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 1\n      year."
