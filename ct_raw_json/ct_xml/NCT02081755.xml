  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective Phase IV study to determine if the use of Everolimus results in
      lower liver tumor recurrence and improved patient and graft survival after liver transplant
      for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The immunosuppressive comparators will be Everolimus and
      Tacrolimus therapy compared to Tacrolimus and Mycophenolic acid/Mycophenolate Mofetil.
      Primary outcomes data is disease free survival (the time from randomization to HCC
      recurrence or death). Secondary outcomes are rate of recurrence of Hepatitis C, problems
      related to wound healing, hernia repair within the first 12 months, hepatic arterial
      thrombosis, renal function, acute cellular rejection, post-transplant diabetes,
      hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.

      The study population will consist of approximately 336 patients (225 Everolimus and
      Tacrolimus and 111 Tacrolimus and Mycophenolic acid/Mycophenolate Mofetil). Initial
      screening criteria will include patients 18 years or older who are candidates to receive a
      primary orthotopic liver transplant (from deceased or living donor). Within 7 - 10 days
      post-transplant, patients will be re-evaluated for eligibility for randomization. The
      criteria include the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma in the explant as determined by
      pathology evaluation, pathology review for tumor burden, presence of microvascular invasion,
      no evidence of hepatic vessel complications, functioning liver allograft, able to take oral
      medications and no systemic infection or delayed wound healing.

      Subjects will remain in study treatment until Month 24 at which time the subject and
      investigator will determine the preferred immunosuppressive regimen. Subjects will be
      followed for an additional 12 months for outcome data as described above.
