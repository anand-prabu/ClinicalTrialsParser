It is\n      expected a decrease by 20 and 40% of total cholesterol blood and LDL-cholesterol levels,\n      respectively (total cholesterol <1.5 g / l and LDL-cholesterol <1g / l).\n\n      Considering this protocol as a pilot study to evaluate safety and efficacy, sample size\n      estimation was fixed considering a Fleming design at one stage. These designs with one group\n      and multi-stages (between 1 and 5) can be seen as filtering steps leading to the decision\n      type go/no go. With a type I error a and statistical power (1-\u03b2) equals respectively 5% and\n      90%, n=17 subjects were necessary to reject the hypotheses of minimal (p=0.85) and maximal\n      (p=0.95) acceptable non-toxicity. If 1 subject or more presented a toxicity, the treatment\n      was considered no safe. To measure the evolution of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol\n      levels concerning the efficacy, n=17 subjects were necessary to show a minimal paired\n      difference (to be detected) of 0.5 with expected standard-deviation of difference = 0.5,\n      correlation coefficient of 0.5, a= 5% (two-sided) for a power greater than 90% (1-\u03b2=97%).\n\n      Subjects are included after a screening visit (visit 0), during which routine laboratory\n      biochemical tests are performed, an electrocardiogram is taken, blood pressure, weight and\n      height are measured; physical examination including testis evaluation and semen parameters\n      are analyzed according to WHO standards 1999 .\n\n      The subjects take atorvastatin orally (10mg/day (d), Tahor\u00a9, Pfizer Laboratory) during 5\n      months allowing to study atorvastatin effects on human spermatogenesis and epididymal\n      maturation (one cycle requiring approximately 3 months).\n\n      Blood and semen parameters were measured :\n\n        -  before to take atorvastatin treatment (visit 1)\n\n        -  at the end of the therapy  (visit 3)\n\n        -  and 3 months after the end of treatment, (visit 4) to perform measurements during\n           different cycles of spermatogenesis on a same subject. After two months of treatment, a\n           consultation (visit 2) is realized to ensure good tolerance to treatment and to control\n           treatment efficiency.\n\n      Biochemical clinical and semen measurements take before treatment were considered as\n      \"control baseline measures\"."
