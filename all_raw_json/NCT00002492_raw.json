            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response in patients with resectable soft tissue sarcoma of the\n      extremity treated with neoadjuvant intra-arterial cisplatin and IV doxorubicin followed by\n      limb-sparing procedure or amputation, adjuvant IV cisplatin and IV doxorubicin, and\n      radiotherapy. II. Determine the chemotherapeutic response in tumor specimens of patients\n      treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Patients undergo arterial cannulation followed by\n      cisplatin intra-arterially over 4 hours on day 1 and doxorubicin IV (beginning 15 minutes\n      after completion of cisplatin infusion) on days 1-3. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for 2\n      courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo amputation or limb-sparing\n      wide excision, as feasible, approximately 4 weeks after the second course. If surgery cannot\n      be scheduled at this time for logistical reasons, a third course may be administered.\n      Patients with an estimated tumor kill of at least 50% receive adjuvant chemotherapy as\n      outlined below. Patients undergoing limb-sparing wide excision receive post-operative\n      radiotherapy as outlined below. Adjuvant chemotherapy: Beginning 3-4 weeks after surgery,\n      patients receive cisplatin IV over 4 hours on day 1 and doxorubicin as above on days 1-3.\n      Treatment continues every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression,\n      stable disease, or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergoing radiotherapy receive the final\n      3 courses of chemotherapy after completion of radiotherapy. Post-operative radiotherapy:\n      Beginning after the first postoperative chemotherapy course and within 8 weeks after\n      surgery, patients receive radiotherapy 5 days a week for 7-8 weeks. An interstitial implant\n      using iridium Ir 192 may be used to administer the final doses of radiotherapy.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years."
