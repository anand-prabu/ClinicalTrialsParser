In severe COPD subjects, sputum eosinophils levels are elevated\n      to similar levels as those seen in severe asthmatics. It is hypothesized that the reduction\n      of eosinophils with mepolizumab in COPD subjects would translate into a reduction of COPD\n      exacerbations. The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab, in subjects\n      who are at or above the baseline blood eosinophil count of at least 150 cells/microliters\n      who exacerbate despite regular use of maximal tolerated therapy, appropriate for severe COPD\n      subjects, in the 12 months prior to study start. In total, 660 subjects will be randomized\n      in 1:1:1 ratio to receive mepolizumab 300 mg, mepolizumab 100mg, or placebo administered SC.\n      The total duration of subject participation will be approximately 62 weeks, consisting of a\n      1 to 2 week screening period, 52-week treatment period and 8-week follow-up period."
