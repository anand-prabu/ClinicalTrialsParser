Pharmacists would provide one packet of progestogen-only pills, giving women one month\n           to arrange an appointment with contraceptive services.\n\n        2. Rapid access to a family planning clinic upon presentation of the empty  EC packet.\n           Women would be seen as a 'walk-in' and contraception provided.\n\n      If feasible, these interventions could reduce unintended pregnancies.\n\n      Participating pharmacies will be randomised to provide one of the interventions, or standard\n      care (verbal/written advice on local contraceptive services).\n\n      Women requesting EC from study pharmacies will be recruited by the research nurse/doctor to\n      participate in the study that will involve them consenting to  contact by telephone 6-8\n      weeks after EC by the researcher, to evaluate the interventions in terms of :\n\n      (i) determine women's experiences/ views of the interventions and control. (ii) determine if\n      women have commenced effective contraception and if not , reasons why.\n\n      A subset of 12 women will also be invited for in-depth interview to collect more detailed\n      qualitative data on their EC experience.\n\n      We also wish  to (iii) explore pharmacists views on the interventions\n\n      Data from this pilot will enable us to determine whether a larger multisite study is\n      feasible. The aims of a larger study being to   determine if either of the two interventions\n      being tested result in an increased proportion of women using effective ongoing\n      contraception compared to the control."

Rapid access to a family planning clinic upon presentation of their empty(used) packet\n           of EC. Women would be seen as a 'walk-in' (without appointment) and ongoing\n           contraception discussed and provided.\n\n      These interventions would be compared with the status quo, i.e. pharmacists give verbal\n      advice and written information on local contraceptive services where ongoing contraception\n      can be accessed.\n\n      The interventions that we are testing are low cost i.e one packet of progestogen-only pills\n      (\u00a33 for most costly brand) plus additional consultation time with the pharmacist (estimated\n      20 mins@ \u00a31 per minute), versus the staff consultation time in a family planning clinic. In\n      the family planning clinic, women would be seen as a 'walk-in' and so this may not add\n      costs, since staff are already present.These interventions could, if shown to be effective,\n      offer huge costs savings to the NHS, by reducing the costs of unintended pregnancies\n      (abortion, miscarriage, birth)."
