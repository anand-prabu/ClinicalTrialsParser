            "textblock": "Glucagon, the treatment of choice for severe hypoglycemia outside of the hospital setting,\n      is currently available only as a powder that must be mixed with a diluent immediately prior\n      to administration by injection.  Although this is a very simple procedure for insulin-using\n      individuals, subjects experiencing severe hypoglycemia cannot inject themselves with\n      glucagon because of the disabling effects of severe neuroglycopenia.  For any non-medical\n      person who is confronted with an emergency situation in which a patient with diabetes is in\n      a hypoglycemic coma or suffering hypoglycemia-related convulsions, reconstitution and\n      injection of the current injectable glucagon is a complex and daunting procedure.\n\n      When used at the recommended dose of 1 mg by injection, glucagon often causes a substantial,\n      although transient, hyperglycemia that is often accompanied by nausea and vomiting.  The\n      data generated to date with AMG504-1 suggest the resulting glucagon pharmacokinetics (PK),\n      although less than that observed with injected glucagon, results in a therapeutic blood\n      glucose increment with a very low incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects.\n\n      Caregivers of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes are called upon to treat\n      episodes of severe hypoglycemia and may want to use AMG504-1.  This study is being conducted\n      to permit determination of appropriate dose level(s) for pediatric use based on the safety\n      observations and results of glucagon and glucose assays.\n\n      Each participant 12.0 to less than 17.0 years of age will undergo two visits in random order\n      and receive AMG504-1 during one visit and commercially available glucagon (GlucaGen, Novo\n      Nordisk) by IM injection during the other visit. Participants 4.0 to less than 12.0 years\n      are randomly assigned to have either 1 visit with commercially available glucagon (GlucaGen,\n      Novo Nordisk) by IM injection OR to have 2 visits with a 2.0 mg dose of AMG504-1\n      administered during one visit and a 3.0 mg dose of AMG504-1 administered during the other\n      visit. For those randomized to complete two research dosing visits, the dose of intranasal\n      glucagon given during each visit will be masked to the participant and study personnel.\n\n      Each dosing visit consists of reducing the plasma glucose level to about 80 mg/dL by\n      increasing the basal insulin infusion rate on the insulin pump or by an intravenous (IV)\n      infusion of regular insulin diluted in normal saline.  The insulin infusion will be stopped\n      once the plasma glucose is <80 mg/dL.  Five minutes after stopping the insulin infusion,\n      participants will be treated with either glucagon given intranasally (either 2.0 mg or 3.0\n      mg for participants 4.0 to less than 12.0 years of age or 3.0 mg for those 12.0 to less than\n      17.0 years of age) or by intramuscular (IM) injection (1 mg constituted in 1 mL of diluting\n      solution for those 55 lbs or more and 0.5 mg constituted in 1 mL of diluting solution for\n      those who weigh less than 55 lbs) in the quadriceps muscle of the leg.\n\n      Blood glucose levels and adverse events will be carefully monitored for 90 minutes\n      post-dosing. After a wash-out period of 7 days or more, participants 12.0 to less than 17.0\n      years of age will return to the clinic and the procedure repeated with each participant\n      crossed over to the other treatment. Participants 4.0 to less than 12.0 years assigned to\n      have 2 dosing visits will also return to clinic and repeat the procedure with a different\n      dose of intranasal glucagon given. Participants 4.0 to less than 12.0 years assigned to a\n      single dosing visit do not return for a second dosing visit."
