  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Analyze the effect of meal pattern (meal number, frequency, and form) on satiety, gut
      peptides, insulin, and glucose levels in individuals before and 12-15 months after gastric
      bypass surgery (GBP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main goal is to study the effect of meal number, size and texture on metabolism and
      incretin levels after GBP. Patients will be studied before GBP (T0) and 12-15 months after
      GBP (T1). At T0 and T1, patients will come for 2 study days for 8 hours: On one study day, a
      single meal will be served, on the second study day, three small isocaloric meals, with the
      order of the conditions randomly assigned.  The total amount of calories and the overall
      nutrient composition will be equivalent between conditions. The meals will be either all
      solid or all liquid. Patients enrolled in the study will be randomly assigned to solid or
      liquid test meals.

      Gastric emptying will be measured by the acetaminophen test.
