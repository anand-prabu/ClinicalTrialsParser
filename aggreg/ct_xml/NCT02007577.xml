  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The possibility that obesity-associated inflammatory changes may play a role in the
      pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (2DM) has led to increased interest in the possibility that
      salicylates might represent a useful treatment to improve glucose tolerance.  Several
      studies, performed in patients with 2DM, as well as in nondiabetic, obese individuals, have
      demonstrated that salicylates have beneficial effects on glucose and insulin metabolism, but
      have not led to a coherent view as to the mechanism(s) involved.

      In this research proposal we will use specific methods to quantify insulin mediated glucose
      uptake (IMGU), glucose-stimulated insulin secretion rate (GS-ISR), and insulin clearance
      (I-Cl) in overweight/obese, nondiabetic, insulin resistant individuals. We will use the
      insulin suppression test (IST) to quantify IMGU in nondiabetic, overweight/obese volunteers
      to identify those individuals who are sufficiently insulin resistant to be enrolled in this
      study. We will then use the graded glucose infusion technique in these insulin resistant
      subjects to generate specific measures of both GS-IS and I-Cl. Following these baseline
      measurements, salsalate or placebo will be administered for one month to the participants,
      after which time the IST and the graded glucose infusion will be repeated to quantify and
      compare the changes in IMGU, GS-ISR, and I-Cl that have resulted from salsalate versus
      placebo. These results will provide for the first time quantitative data of the effect of
      salicylates on IMGU, GS-ISR, and I-Cl in overweight/obese, insulin resistant, nondiabetic
      individuals.
