The microbiological sampling of body\n      sites is already performed in many units of the hospital as standard of care. Infection and\n      readmission related data from enrolled patients will be collected for upto 1 year after\n      enrollment.\n\n      Data analysis: Standard surveillance for hospital-acquired infections will be performed by\n      the infection control group of the hospital. The identity and the nature of micro-organisms\n      colonizing the high touch surfaces of rooms and of patient's body sites will be determined\n      and compared. Risks involved is no more than minimal risk."
