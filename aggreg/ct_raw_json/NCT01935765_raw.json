It might be\n      therefore important for type 1 diabetic patients who have already an increased\n      cardiovascular risk to be properly diagnosed for sleep apnea. A systematic screening for\n      sleep apnea is already recommended for patients with type 2 diabetes by experts.\n\n      A secondary objective is to determine if the presence of a sleep apnea syndrome in type 1\n      diabetic patients is associated to an autonomic neuropathy, a poor glycemic control , a\n      poorer quality of life , a poorer quality of sleep, more severe cardiovascular consequences\n      and biological impairment."
