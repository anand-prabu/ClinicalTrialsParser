      Background:

      - Changes in how a person   s body burns energy or calories can affect their weight over
      time. The lowest level of energy the body needs to function is called    basal metabolic
      rate.    In the cold, we burn extra energy, even before we start to shiver. This is called
       non-shivering thermogenesis    and it occurs in different types of tissue such as muscle
      and fat. Researchers want to learn more about this type of energy burning and how it is
      regulated. They hope this will help treat obesity in the future.

      Objectives:

        -  Sub-study 1: to better understand how non-shivering thermogenesis works.

        -  Sub-study 2: to measure the effects of anti-obesity drugs on basal metabolic rate.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy, lean adult males ages 18 to 35.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, blood test, and EKG.

        -  Participants will receive one X-ray scan.

        -  Each day, all participants will:

      &lt; TAB&gt; - Have height and weight measured, and have urine collected.

      - Spend 4 hours in a temperature-controlled room with furniture, toilet area, phone, and
      computer. They will wear small non-invasive devices to monitor activity, heart rate,
      temperature, and shivering.

      &lt; TAB&gt; - Walk for 30 minutes.

        -  Participants will stay in the Metabolic Clinical Research Unit at the National
           Institutes of Health Clinical Center and receive a daily study medication
           (FDA-approved).

        -  Sub-study 1 participants will stay as inpatients for up to 17 days. They will be able
           to leave on some weekends.

      &lt; TAB&gt; - Sub-study 2 participants will stay as inpatients for 6 separate overnight stays,
      not in a row, but to be completed within a 12-week time window.

      - Participants will be compensated for their time and participation at the end of the study

    <textblock>
      The balance between energy expenditure (EE) and energy intake ultimately determines body
      weight. Resting EE is the major component (60-75%) of total EE in an adult human being.
      Resting EE dynamically adapts to environmental changes such as ambient temperature. In our
      on-going study of environmental temperature changes within and around the thermoneutral
      zone, we observed that healthy young men can increase EE by 17 % of the basal metabolic rate
      through the process of non-shivering thermogenesis (NST).  This capacity for NST is
      unexpectedly large as compared to prior reports of mild cold-induced thermogenesis (3 to
      11%) and suggests that increasing NST could be explored as an intervention to combat
      obesity.

      The aim of this study is to better understand the physiology of NST and to develop improved
      assays for evaluating the effect of drugs that alter EE. For example, only recently has it
      been realized that brown adipose tissue is functional in adult humans and that white adipose
      tissue can be converted to brown-adipose-like tissue to increase heat production during cold
      exposures. Moreover, skeletal muscle likely also plays a role in cold-induced thermogenesis
      even before shivering occurs. It is plausible that the mechanisms governing heat production
      for NST contribute to regulation of body weight and thus may be contributing to the current
      obesity epidemic:  even small changes in EE, if not compensated by changes in food intake,
      can have long-term effects on body weight.

      This protocol has two phases.  The first uses a pharmacologic approach to investigate the
      mechanism of NST in young healthy lean males. Since the principal physiologic stimulus to
      BAT (and possibly muscle for NST) is via the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), b-adrenergic
      receptors may hold key roles in regulating human EE. We hypothesize that, by careful
      measurements of NST (at an individually-titrated cool environmental temperature, between
      18-21  C vs. at thermoneutrality of 27  C) and using b-adrenergic drugs that differ in
      receptor specificity and agonist/antagonist properties, we will gain better understanding of
      the regulation of human NST.

      The second phase of the study focuses on measuring of anti-obesity drugs    potential effect
      on basal metabolic rate (BMR) under thermoneutral conditions. The rationale is that previous
      studies of drug effect on EE in humans have not always rigorously enforced the use of
      thermoneutral conditions, thus may have increased variability and underestimated the effect,
      contributing to inconclusive findings.

      It is envisioned that this study will further our knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate
      the acute adaptive changes in resting energy expenditure and the effects of drug therapy
      targeting obesity in humans.
