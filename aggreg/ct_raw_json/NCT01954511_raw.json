Among the main symptoms are\n      pre-auricular pain (in the region of the TMJ) and/or pain in the masticatory muscles.\n\n      It's usual to observe that subjects with TMD also present cervical alteration. Beside this,\n      cervical postural alterations produced by muscle tension can influence mandibular position.\n\n      The intervention protocol was based on manual therapy, stabilization exercises and\n      stretching.\n\n      The technique are:.\n\n        1. Upper cervical flexion mobilization;\n\n        2. C5 central posterior-anterior mobilization;\n\n        3. Stabilization exercise: Cranio-cervical flexor stabilization exercise\n\n        4. Stretching of muscles: upper trapezius, scalenes, semispinalis capitis; splenius\n           capitis, sternocleidomastoid"
