      To characterize pharmacokinetic profile of Imatinib Mesylate tablets EQ 400 mg base of
      Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC, compared to that of the reference product - GLEEVEC® (imatinib
      mesylate) tablets 400 mg in adult patients, who are diagnosed to have CML or GIST and are
      presently receiving stable dose of imatinib mesylate tablets 400 mg, and assess their
