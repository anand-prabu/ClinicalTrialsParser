In recent years we have used the bipolar energy for resection of polyps\n      by hysteroscopy, becoming a routine clinical practice and universally accepted.\n\n      Resection of endometrial polyps laser energy has recently begun to be used with satisfactory\n      results, so studies are needed to analyze these results and compare it with the usual\n      techniques .\n\n      This time in advance of medicine, it is appropriate to introduce minimally invasive\n      procedures , allowing resection of endometrial polyps on an outpatient basis without\n      anesthesia and acceptable to most patients.\n\n      These procedures assume a lower cost and are associated with a lower surgical risk due to\n      their realization without anesthesia .\n\n      Hypothesis: Resection of polyps outpatient laser diode has a similar or superior to that of\n      the bipolar electrode tolerability. The diode laser is a viable , quick , simple technique\n      with a high percentage of resection and high degree of satisfaction of patients"

The patients randomly into 2 groups will include: Group A bipolar electrode treatment\n      Versapoint and Group B diode laser treatment.
