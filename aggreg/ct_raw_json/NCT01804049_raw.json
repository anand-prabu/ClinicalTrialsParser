Sarcopenia is common in older adults and is associated with decreased strength,\n      increased disability, falls and fractures. There are currently few interventions to prevent\n      or treat sarcopenia and a poor understanding of the mechanisms for sarcopenia. Given the\n      growing number of veterans over the age of 65, studies to prevent sarcopenia and resulting\n      disability are important for the health, independence and well-being of this population. Our\n      preliminary studies have shown that older adults with diabetes have an accelerated loss in\n      muscle mass and gait speed, except when treated with metformin. Older adults with\n      prediabetes also have a greater decline in muscle mass and higher incidence of disability.\n      Therefore, this study further investigates these findings by addressing the following aims:\n      (1) to determine whether metformin can prevent the loss in muscle mass and physical\n      performance and (2) to examine changes in muscle histologic characteristics associated with\n      metformin treatment in older adults with prediabetes."
