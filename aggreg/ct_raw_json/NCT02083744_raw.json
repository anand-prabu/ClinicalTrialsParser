A sample of 60 adult Hispanic\n      heart failure patients will be recruited. Each patient will either participate in the\n      psychoeducational intervention or usual care. A repeated measures (longitudinal) analysis\n      will be used to examine these aims by employing a linear mixed models approach. The basic\n      analysis has one between subjects (fixed) factor, group, with 2 levels (education and\n      control) and one repeated factor, time, with 2 levels (baseline and 12 months). This\n      analysis allows for testing the main effect of group, main effect of time, and the group by\n      time interaction.  The potential benefit of improving heart failure knowledge and self-care\n      in Hispanic heart failure patients is that these patients may better understand how to care\n      for themselves. This study will provide data to examine the longer-term outcomes of\n      emergency department visits and hospitalization events in Hispanic patients."
