The goal is to randomize and complete 200 subjects\n      from the 240 enrolled. A Sequential Parallel Design for Double-Blind Phase will be utilized.\n       During the first phase of double-blind adjunctive treatment, eligible patients (n=200) are\n      randomized to adjunctive treatment with either folate and vitamin B12  (n=60) or placebo\n      (n=150), with a 2:3:3 ratio for random assignment to the treatment sequences drug/drug (DD;\n      n=70), placebo/placebo (PP; n=70), and placebo/drug (PD; n=75), while all continue to\n      receive their antipsychotic agent for the entire duration of the study.  Assuming a 10%\n      drop-out rate during the first phase, 126 patients on placebo will complete the first 56-day\n      phase, and 54 patients on folate and vitamin B12 will complete the first 56-day phase."

Treated with an antipsychotic for at least 6 months at a stable dose for at least 6\n             weeks\n\n          5. PANSS total score of at least 60, with at least a 3 (moderate) on one negative\n             symptom item or on one positive symptom item.\n\n          6. No acute medical problems; any chronic medical condition (e.g. hypertension)\n             consistently treated and stable during the 1 month prior to participation\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Unable to provide informed consent\n\n          2. Serum B12 concentration less than 300mcg/L; Complete Blood Count (CBC) results\n             consistent with megaloblastic anemia\n\n          3. Serum creatinine concentration greater than 1.4\n\n          4. Current use of folate or B12 supplementation\n\n          5.

Alcohol or other substance abuse within 3 months (nicotine allowed)\n\n          7.
