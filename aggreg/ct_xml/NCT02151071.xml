  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the feasibility of using intra-operative Cerenkov Luminescence
      Imaging (CLI) to assess tumour margin status and lymph node metastatic status in patients
      having Breast Conserving Surgery (BCS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational single-centre pilot study to assess the feasibility of
      intra-operative Cerenkov Luminescence Imaging (CLI) of breast cancer wide local excision
      (WLE) specimens, the post-resection surgical cavity, and lymph nodes in situ and ex vivo.
      The CLI imaging will be performed using a specimen analyser and a hand-held fibrescope. This
      study will measure the agreement between margin status of the WLE specimen and the
      metastatic status of dissected lymph nodes as determined by CLI and by histopathology. This
      is a pilot study to assess feasibility before proceeding to pivotal studies to determine
      diagnostic performance.
