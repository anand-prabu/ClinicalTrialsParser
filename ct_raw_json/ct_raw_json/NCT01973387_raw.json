Approximately 150 patients\n      will be randomly assigned in a 1:2 ratio into 2 treatment arms to receive either intravenous\n      rituximab (Treatment Arm A) for 6 cycles or oral ibrutinib (Treatment Arm B) until disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first. The study will include\n      screening, treatment, and follow-up phases. Treatment will extend from randomization until\n      study drug discontinuation. Follow-up will consist of 2 phases: post-treatment (from the\n      discontinuation of treatment for reasons other than disease progression until the patient\n      has progressive disease) and post-disease progression (subsequent anticancer therapy and\n      survival status will be recorded until death, lost to follow-up, consent withdrawal, or\n      study closure). Study end is defined by when 90 progression-free survival (PFS) events\n      (progressive disease or deaths) have been observed, or earlier at the interim analysis\n      (approximately 45 PFS events) if PFS analysis is statistically significant in favor of\n      ibrutinib, whichever happens first. Efficacy evaluations will assess for disease response\n      and progression in accordance with International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia\n      2008 criteria for patients with CLL or SLL. Serial pharmacokinetic (study of what a drug\n      does to the body) blood samples will be collected in the ibrutinib treatment group. Safety\n      will be assessed throughout the study."
