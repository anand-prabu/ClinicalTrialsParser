The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients\n      are treated at the MTD.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months and then every 6 months for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
