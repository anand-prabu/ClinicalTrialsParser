      Optimization of Pazopanib Exposition in Patients with Renal Cell Carcinoma by Therapeutic
      Drug Monitoring followed by Individual Dose Escalation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open, multi-center, intraindividual dose-optimization study. Patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma receive 800 mg Pazopanib daily. After 14
      days the Pazopanib plasma concentration is determined. In patients who show good
      tolerability and plasma trough levels of  ≤ 20 µg/mLthe daily dose is increased in 200 mg
      steps until plasma trough levels of &gt; 20 µg/mL are achieved or dose-limiting toxicities
      occur, a daily dose of 1600 mg is reached, or there is disease progression.

      After each dose optimization the plasma concentration is determined after 14 days (day
      11-15). If indicated, dose optimization is performed 21 days after the previous dose
      optimization (on day 18-24).
