            "textblock": "Despite multidisciplinary care and advancements in therapeutics and technology, health\n      outcomes remain suboptimal in pediatric diabetes centers world-wide. A major contributor to\n      poor outcomes is suboptimal diabetes management in pediatric patients and their families.\n      The premise of this research project is that patients and families do not have adequate\n      resources to meet the level of diabetes management that translates to better outcomes.\n      Therefore, we will give them a valuable tool to improve their overall management. The tool\n      is CareCoach.\n\n      Research shows that enhancing communication and partnership among patients, parents, and\n      providers is especially critical for optimal outcomes in pediatric diabetes. Communication\n      gaps and conflict can complicate the already complex provider-patient interactions and daily\n      management. We have therefore designed, refined, and made available to consumers a new\n      mobile-based intervention, CareCoach, to improve communication; build trust among providers,\n      patients and parents; and increase overall satisfaction with the quality of diabetes care.\n      This web/mobile application is designed to help patients unobtrusively audiorecord their\n      clinical encounters, track their medical consults and treatment plans, review information\n      from past visits, create visit discussion guides, and track adherence to medication and\n      dosing schedules. In addition, because mobile-based applications are inexpensive to\n      administer, portable, and available at all times of day, CareCoach holds great promise for\n      communication coaching and contributing to improved diabetes management.\n\n      We hypothesize that CareCoach will improve patient-parent-provider communications, build\n      patient-parent-provider trust, and increase overall satisfaction with clinical interactions\n      in a sample of children with type 1 diabetes and their parents. These improvements will lead\n      to significant gains in diabetes management, setting the stage for optimal health outcomes.\n      To test the effectiveness of CareCoach, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial\n      comparing the CareCoach intervention to standard care in a sample of 60 children with type 1\n      diabetes and their parents."
