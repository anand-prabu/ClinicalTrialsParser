Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so\n      they stop growing or die. Combining SU5416 with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining SU5416 and paclitaxel in\n      treating patients who have advanced cancer."

During subsequent\n      courses, SU5416 is administered on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 25. Paclitaxel begins\n      on the second week of therapy and is administered IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.\n      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SU5416 until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients\n      experience dose limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
