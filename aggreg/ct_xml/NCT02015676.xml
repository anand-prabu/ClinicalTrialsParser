  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will define an optimal chemotherapy dose regimen of Myocet in combination with
      paclitaxel and intravenous Herceptin and will evaluate the efficacy and safety of this dose
      regimen in patients with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer and HER2
      overexpression. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months.
