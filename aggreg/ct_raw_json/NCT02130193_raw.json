Approximately 10 subjects will be\n      enrolled in Part A of the study.  Progression to and dose selection for Part B will occur\n      following review of the data collected in Part A. Part B will be a 52-week, randomized,\n      double-blind (sponsor unblind), placebo-controlled on top of standard of care, parallel\n      group study. Part B will evaluate several clinical efficacy assessments related to\n      exacerbations and respiratory symptoms.
