Drugs used in chemotherapy use\n      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining\n      chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher\n      doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of cyclophosphamide\n      when given together with combination chemotherapy and a peripheral stem cell transplant in\n      treating patients with malignant solid tumors."

Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested and selected for CD34+ cells on\n      day 15. Bone marrow is also harvested in case insufficient PBSC are harvested.\n\n      Preparative regimen/transplantation: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour and\n      etoposide IV continuously on days -6 to -4. Cyclophosphamide is administered IV over 1 hour\n      on days -3 and -2 or IV continuously on days -3 and -2, -4 to -2, -5 to -2, or -6 to -2.\n      PBSC or bone marrow is reinfused on day 0.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-10 patients receive escalating doses of cyclophosphamide until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which 20% of\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      At least 6 additional patients receive cyclophosphamide at the MTD.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 36 patients will be accrued for this study."
