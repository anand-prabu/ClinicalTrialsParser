Typically used are\n      three chest tubes - two in the mediastinum and one in the pleural space, if opened. The\n      investigators propose that removal of the pleural tube will not impact the rates of\n      clinically significant pleural effusions post cardiac surgery. Patients will be randomized\n      into two groups - one receiving the standard three chest tubes (standard), and the other\n      receiving only mediastinal drains (experimental). The primary outcome will be rates of\n      post-operative pleural effusions as determined by defined interventions, including insertion\n      of a chest tube, thoracentesis, or return to the operating room for primary evacuation of\n      pleural effusion or hemothorax. Secondary outcomes include length of hospital stay, length\n      of mechanical ventilation, postoperative respiratory status, and presence/size of pleural\n      effusions, as well as readmission for pleural effusion."
