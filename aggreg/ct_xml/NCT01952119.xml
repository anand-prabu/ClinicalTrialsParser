  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess whether adding a secure message reminder to routine care improves the
      percentage of patients who complete a follow-up appointment with a new, documented blood
      pressure reading.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is one of the leading risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Optimizing blood
      pressure management can help prevent adverse cardiovascular outcomes. The National Committee
      for Quality Assurance (NCQA) defines blood pressure control as less than 140/90 mmHg. Per
      this definition, less than half of Americans with hypertension are considered controlled.
      Literature has been published describing several ways of improving blood pressure
      management, but results have been variable.
