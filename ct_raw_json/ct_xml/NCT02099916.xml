  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor responders to ovarian stimulation represents one of the most frustrating problems in
      reproductive medicine. The investigators hypothesize that ovarian response of those patients
      could improve by  treating these patients with 25 mg DHEA tid for 12 weeks prior to
      stimulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with poor ovarian response will be  included in the study.   The
      definition of poor response was based on the presence of at least one of the following
      criteria: Age &gt; 40 years old, day 2 FSH &gt;9.5 mIU/ml, AMH &lt; 2ng/ml ,at least one previous COH
      with less than 3 oocytes retrieved, at least one cancelled attempt due to poor response,
      estradiol less than 500 pg/ml on the day of HCG. All patients will be  counseled regarding
      their prognosis and other  treatment options including oocyte donation as well as adoption
      were also presented and discussed in detail. All patients will be  aware that the use of
      DHEA is experimental   and informed consent was obtained for those agreeing to use the
      medication. Women in the DHEA group will receive 25 mg of DHEA three times a day for at
      least 12 weeks. During this period, women will be  subjected to monthly measurements of
      early follicular phase FSH and estradiol. Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) will be  measured
      prior to the initiation of treatment and at the end of the observation period. Patients will
      be  stimulated with a short GnRH-antagonist protocol. Briefly, all women will have
      measurements of serum FSH and estradiol and a pelvic sonogram on the second day of their
      cycle.  Providing that serum FSH is &lt; 17 mIU/ml and estradiol is &lt; 70 pg/ml on day 2 ,
      ovarian stimulation will be  initiated with 450 IU of gonadotropins either in the form of a
      combination of highly purified  urinary FSH and LH or with a combination of Rec FSH and Rec
      LH. All patients will be  re-evaluated on day 5 of the stimulation, and  dosage adjustments
      will be made and the antagonists (Cetrorelix or ganirelix  0.25 mg/day) will be  initiated.
      When at least 2 follicles reach an average diameter of 17 mm, final oocyte maturation will
      be  triggered with 10,000IU of  hCG ( Pregnyl, Organon, Greece Inc.). Oocyte retrieval will
      be  performed 34 to 36 hours later. All patients will undergo ICSI. Patients with successful
      fertilization will have  embryo transfer under sonographic guidance on day 3 after
      retrieval.
