Each ending day when carry SenseCam\u00ae, they will be asked to go to the\n      laboratory where 4 types of interventions will be successively done according to the\n      randomization: 1) a simple visual retrospective procedure (SVR), 2) a visual retrospective\n      procedure coupled with a specific cueing intervention (VR-SC), 3) a verbal retrospective\n      (VbR) and 4) no intervention (control condition).The testing phase will take place 14 days\n      after the last day of data collection and will consist in a cued recall task and a\n      recognition task using the pictures obtained by the SenseCam\u00ae of the participants.According\n      to our hypotheses, the vividness of memories will be higher in events subjected to the VR-SC\n      procedure than in events subjected to the SVR and VbR procedures. This effect is expected\n      for both patients with schizophrenia and controls participants. Since strategies to enrich\n      memory details will be explicitly given to the patients when using the VR-SC procedure, we\n      assume that patients will be able to normalize their scores."
