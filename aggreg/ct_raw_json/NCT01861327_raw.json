Of these procedures, half chosen randomly by computerized simple random, will be\n      submitted to the endovascular procedure in question using only iodinated contrast and the\n      other half will be submitted to the endovascular procedure using carbon dioxide (CO2). There\n      will be no CO2 injection in the aortic arch or cerebral territory. The patient previously\n      evaluated at the Hospital Municipal Dr. Moses Deutsch will be referred to the operating room\n      of the Albert Einstein Hospital where it will be performed under general anesthesia with\n      intubation or blockage associated with sedation, and the same in the supine position\n      (DDH).The femoral artery will be punctured with Seldinger technique unilaterally or\n      bilaterally, according to the indication for the procedure. By using the guide wire will be\n      one or two sheaths inserted in a retrograde manner. Through the introducer, is manually\n      injected retrogradely 50 ml of CO 2, in obtaining images of the apparatus module CO2 Philips\n      mode subtraction angiography. In angioplasty for obstructive disease, with the module\n      roadmap will be held the passage of the guidewire through the stenotic region or occlusion,\n      and dilatation balloon angioplasty specific. After angioplasty, there will be a new\n      injection of contrast for the evaluation of partial results. As appropriate, will be held\n      stent placement, in which case there will be a last angiography with 50 ml of CO2. In\n      endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms, there will be a first injection of CO2\n      for the study of the neck of the aneurysm and stent implantation. After the release of the\n      entire stent, a new angiography is performed by injection of CO2 for the control of surgical\n      outcome. In all procedures will be performed to measure pressure through the femoral sheath\n      prior to angioplasty, after angioplasty and stent after the placement. During the use of CO2\n      as contrast medium, with questions at the trial of such factors as the extent of injury,\n      indication of repair, endoleak, leak, rupture or thrombosis by arteriography will be\n      performed by manual injection of iodinated contrast.Of course this amount of contrast is\n      measured."
