    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a serious and eventually fatal disease damaging the
      lungs and the heart. It results from narrowing and eventual blockage of small blood vessels
      in the lung, due to abnormal proliferation of cells in the blood vessel (arterial). Patients
      with PAH suffer from fatigue, shortness of breath, low oxygen levels, blood clots and heart
      failure. No therapies reverse the disease process in the lung arteries, however there are
      three approved drugs that can temporarily dilate the vessels and improve symptoms. However,
      all three drugs have significant side effects and toxicities, they do not work effectively
      in many patients, survival remains on average only 2 to 3 years once symptoms begin, and
      none of these drugs prevent the underlying disease process in the small arteries of the
      lung.

      PAH is known to develop in patients with a pre-existing class of bone marrow diseases called
         myeloproliferative disorders    (MPDs).  We and others have recently shown that patients
      with PAH have bone marrow changes similar to those seen in patients with MPDs, even without
      other signs and symptoms of those bone marrow diseases such as anemia or high platelet and
      white blood cell counts. Compared to healthy volunteers, patients with PAH have a higher
      frequency of immature stem and progenitor cells able to produce blood cells and vascular
      wall cells in their bone marrow.  They also have higher circulating numbers of these cells
      in the blood, and increased localization of these cells in the lung blood vessels. When
      immature bone marrow cells from PAH patients and normal volunteers were infused into mice,
      the mice receiving PAH marrow cells developed similar lung and heart problems to PAH
      patients, suggesting that the bone marrow problem is a primary cause of the lung problems,
      and that the increased numbers of immature bone marrow cells in the bone marrow and blood of
      PAH patients causes the lung blood vessel disease.

      The drug hydroxyurea is used to inhibit the abnormally high level of bone marrow cell
      proliferation in patients with MPDs. It has been shown to reduce the numbers of circulating
      immature bone marrow cells in patients with MPDs. Hydroxyurea has been available for almost
      fifty years, and has been used to treat patients with MPDs, sickle cell anemia, and
      congenital heart disease for very prolonged periods of time, up to twenty or more years in
      individual patients. It has an excellent long-term safety profile and few side effects and
      is generally well tolerated. It does not appear to result in an increased rate of leukemia
      even with many years of treatment.

      In the current protocol, we hypothesize that treating patients with PAH with hydroxyurea
      will decrease the level of circulating immature bone marrow cells and interrupt the abnormal
      narrowing and occlusion of lung arteries. We will treat patients with moderately severe
      primary    (no known underlying cause) PAH with 6 months of hydroxyurea, carefully
      monitoring side effects and adjusting dosage as necessary, and measure the effect on
      circulating immature cells, lung blood vessel pressures, other blood markers of active PAH,
      and exercise tolerance.
