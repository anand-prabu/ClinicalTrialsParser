Pharmacological and\n      rehabilitation therapies to SCI have got limited effect. There is definitely an urgent need\n      for finding different methods of treatment for these patients who cannot undergo established\n      modalities of treatment or these have been tried unsuccessfully. Another promising\n      therapeutic approach for SCI is \"Stem cell transplantation\". Bone marrow derived stem cells\n      have been shown to promote anatomical and functional recovery in animal models of SCI by\n      promoting tissue sparing, axonal regeneration, and remyelination. In our present study, we\n      want to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous bone marrow derived stem cells\n      surgically transplanted intrathecally into patients with spinal cord injury."
