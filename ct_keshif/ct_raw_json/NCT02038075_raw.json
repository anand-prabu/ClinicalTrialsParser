BCBT was is delivered in three sequential phases. In phase I (5 sessions), the therapist identifies patient-specific factors that contribute to and maintain suicidal behaviors, provides a cognitive-behavioral conceptualization, collaboratively develops a crisis response plan, and teaches basic emotion regulation skills. In phase II (5 sessions), the therapist applies cognitive strategies to reduce beliefs and assumptions that serve as vulnerabilities to suicidal behavior. In phase III (2 sessions), a relapse prevention task is conducted."

The standard null hypothesis will involve tests conducted comparing improvement\n      following B-CBT (treatment duration of 12 weeks) to treatment as usual (TAU).  The primary\n      outcome comparisons will include both direct markers of suicidality (i.e. suicide, suicide\n      attempts) and indirect markers including associated symptomatology (i.e. suicidal ideation,\n      intent, anxiety, depression, hopelessness, substance abuse, and sleep disturbance), along\n      with remission of psychiatric diagnoses. Secondary purposes include the prospective\n      investigation of suicide risk factors and warning signs to explore these variables' ability\n      to predict subsequent suicidal behavior following an index attempt."

            "textblock": "The research gap in the treatment of suicidality is considerable, particularly with military\n      populations, including those returning from deployment in support of OIF/OEF. Only one\n      randomized clinical trial targeting suicidality has been conducted with a military sample\n      (Rudd et al., 1996).  Although time-limited treatment of suicidality is the primary target\n      of the project, additional elements will be explored including prospective investigation of\n      suicide risk factors and warning signs, as well as development of a centralized software\n      assessment/management tracking system for high-risk suicidal individuals.  Reference to\n      \"active duty\" refers to U.S. military service members that have been activated and deployed\n      as a part of OIF/OEF in accordance with federal orders under Title 10 or 32, Unites States\n      Code.  This includes individuals on active duty from the National Guard and Reserve forces.\n\n      Specific Aim 1:  To evaluate the effectiveness of brief cognitive-behavioral therapy (B-CBT)\n      for the treatment of suicidality, including suicidal ideation and attempts (regardless of\n      Axis I or II diagnosis) among active duty military personnel. It is anticipated that a large\n      percentage of those identified for treatment will include military personnel recently\n      returned from OIF/OEF.  The standard null hypothesis will involve tests conducted comparing\n      improvement following B-CBT (treatment duration of 12 weeks) to treatment as usual (TAU).\n      The primary outcome comparisons will include both direct markers of suicidality (i.e.\n      suicide, suicide attempts) and indirect markers including associated symptomatology (i.e.\n      suicidal ideation, intent, anxiety, depression, hopelessness, substance abuse, agitation,\n      and sleep disturbance), along with remission of psychiatric diagnoses.\n\n      Specific Aim 2:  To engage in prospective investigation of suicide risk factors (i.e.\n      psychiatric diagnosis and history, suicidal ideation, intent, anxiety, depression,\n      hopelessness) and warning signs (i.e. agitation, sleep disturbance), exploring their ability\n      to predict subsequent suicidal behavior following onset of suicidality.\n\n      Specific Aim 3: To explore the effectiveness of B-CBT (versus TAU) for increasing\n      appropriate utilization of and compliance with medical, mental health, and substance abuse\n      treatment, as well as improving psychological and social functioning.\n\n      Specific Aim 4: To develop a risk management software program for the initial risk\n      assessment, ongoing monitoring and clinical management of high-risk suicidal patients.  The\n      software program would provide a mechanism for organizing and tracking clinical risk factors\n      and warning signs for suicide, along with appropriate management and clinical intervention\n      strategies during the treatment process."
