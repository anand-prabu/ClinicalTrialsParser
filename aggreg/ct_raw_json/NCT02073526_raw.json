Anti-TNF agents are used in the\n      treatment. However, some patients do not respond and response rates declines over time. The\n      cause may be immunogenicity against the agent itself, the agent\u00b4s failure to neutralize TNF\n      or another biological pathway leading to inflammation. Anti-TNF agents have been\n      administrated as fixed doses at certain frequencies and this may not be optimal for all\n      patients, but recent studies have indicated a correlation between efficacy and serum drug\n      concentration levels (trough levels). Our preliminary data suggest that trough levels early\n      in the treatment course may be predictive of later trough levels. By multiple measurements,\n      this will be assessed. The study will also investigate biological markers in serum and blood\n      cells which may be predictable for trough levels. Finally, we will compare different methods\n      to measure serum drug concentrations."
