The study was\n      planned according to the Good Clinical Quality standards and the analysis was performed\n      using an intention-to-treat method. The protocol was approved from an Ethics Committee.\n      Selected patients gave their written informed consent. The family practitioners agreed and\n      obtained the data and analysis. Collected data were analyzed from single-blinded\n      investigators (without knowledge of the used test drug and time of collection).\n\n      Patients Study design: same patients were assigned to DIG or IVA for 3 months, according to\n      a randomization cross-over design.\n\n      Tested drugs Commercial brands of digoxin and ivabradine were used. Digoxin was given by\n      mouth at a dose of 0.125 mg/day, 5 times per week, for 3 months.\n\n      Ivabradine was given by mouth at a dose of 7.5 mg bid for 3 months.\n\n      Inclusion criteria Chronic and stable coronary artery disease Permanent atrial fibrillation.\n      Diastolic dysfunction with maintained systolic function.\n\n      Exclusion criteria Unstable angina pectoris. Reduced systolic cardiac function (LVEF<52%).\n      Normal diastolic function. Diabetes requiring insulin. Moderate or severe renal or hepatic\n      dysfunction. Technically insufficient echocardiographic quality.\n\n      Collected data Medical history and concomitant medications. Physical examination was\n      performed. Laboratory values (including proBNP and serum digoxin concentration). ECG.\n      Echocardiography. 6-minute walk test.\n\n      Statistical Analyses Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 1 SD. Absolute values and percent changes\n      in relation to baseline measurements were analyzed. The 2 hypotheses tested were: null\n      hypothesis: mu1-mu2=0.0, and alternative hypothesis: mu1-mu2>>0.0. Comparisons within groups\n      were made using paired t tests or the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test, where\n      appropriate. Between-group comparisons were performed by unpaired t tests or the\n      non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test, respectively. Chi-square test or Kruskal-Wallis test\n      were used to compare continuous normally or not normally distributed and qualitative\n      variables, where appropriate. Multivariate analysis of variance was performed. A p value of\n      < 0.05 was considered statistically significant."
