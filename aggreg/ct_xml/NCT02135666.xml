             requirements of the protocol.

          -  A male or female who received two/three doses of Twinrix according to his/her group
             allocation in study HAB-084 (208127/084), and received no further dose of any
             hepatitis A and/or B vaccine since then.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants
             or other immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to study entry. Inhaled and
             topical steroids are allowed.

          -  Administration of long-acting immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the
             study entry.

          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study
             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a
             non-investigational vaccine/product (pharmaceutical product or device).

          -  Administration of any hepatitis A and/or B vaccine at any time since completion of
             the primary vaccination series in HAB-084 (208127/084) study, including a challenge
             dose of the study vaccine, as a part of the study procedures, during the long-term
             persistence phase.

          -  Documented history of hepatitis A or B disease since completion of the primary
             vaccination series in HAB-084 (208127/084) study.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required).

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins within six months prior to study entry.
