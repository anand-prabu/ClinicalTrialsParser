      This pilot clinical trial studies fludeoxyglucose F18 (FDG)-positron emission tomography
      (PET) in imaging patients with prostate cancer treated with ranolazine. Diagnostic
      procedures, such as FDG-PET, may help find prostate cancer and find out how far the disease
      has spread. Giving ranolazine may enhance FDG-PET imaging by increasing the amount of
      glucose available for uptake by the scan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PET scans have traditionally not been very good at detecting prostate cancers.  This is
      because prostate cancer cells do not take up glucose well so the signals are very weak.
      The ability of PET imaging to detect cancers requires that the cancer cells take up glucose
      into the cells.   Different methods are being tested to see if we can improve the detection
      of prostate cancers using PET scans.

      Ranolazine is a drug that is already approved by the FDA for treatment of chronic chest pain
      in people with heart disease.  Ranolazine has been studied in the laboratories at the
      University of Colorado Denver, Anschutz Medical Campus.   Ranolazine has been added to
      prostate cancer cells and grown in petri dishes and in animals in the laboratory. It has
      been shown to increase the glucose uptake of prostate cancer cells.  The goal of this study
      is to see if patients taking ranolazine will have better PET imaging of their prostate
      cancers.
