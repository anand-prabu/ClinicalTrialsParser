Rather than isolating specific variables for\n      hypothesis formulation, this study will be attempting to collect an array of data that is a)\n      both qualitative and quantitative, and b) observational and test subject-reported. The final\n      results will consist of a list of possible trigger factors to avoid for individual subjects,\n      and metrics showing the directional tendencies of players depending on the severity of their\n      symptoms at the time.\n\n      The overall goal of this research is to better understand factors that contribute to\n      simulator sickness, both in who it affects and why some gameplay experiences may cause it\n      more than others. Operating from the basic assumption that the way a player moves through an\n      environment affects how quickly that player gets sick, we will primarily be gathering data\n      on how the player moves through the digital space and whether that behavior changes once\n      they begin to feel sick."
