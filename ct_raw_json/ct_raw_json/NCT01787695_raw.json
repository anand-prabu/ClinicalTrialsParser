            "textblock": "Vitiligo is a chronic acquired disease characterized by well defined white macules and\n      patches affecting the skin and mucous membranes. Mucocutaneous lesions develop secondary to\n      selective destruction of melanocytes. The etiology of vitiligo is largely unknown but more\n      likely to be multifactorial. There are several theories on the pathogenesis of vitiligo\n      including mainly the autoimmune, neurohormonal, and autocytotoxic theories. The autoimmune\n      hypothesis has the strongest evidence with alteration mainly in the cellular immune\n      response.\n\n      There are many treatment modalities available for vitiligo, however, none of them cure the\n      disease. These include different topical treatments, phototherapy, surgical therapy, and\n      depigmentation therapy. Narrow-band UVB (NB-UVB) is currently the preferred treatment over\n      topical psoralen and ultraviolet A radiation (PUVA), for patients with vitiligo. However,\n      overall response of vitiligo to NB-UVB has been variable. Ultraviolet A1(UVA1) phototherapy\n      is now useful for a variety of skin diseases, specifically scleroderma. There are only a few\n      studies published on the efficacy of UVA1 in vitiligo.\n\n      One of the main side effects of UVA1 is prominent tanning which might be due to melanocyte\n      stimulation. Therefore, the investigators hypothesis is that UVA1 will induce significant\n      skin pigmentation to improve vitiligo. The investigators plan on conducting a prospective\n      single-blind randomized clinical trial to assess efficacy and safety of UVA1 in the\n      treatment of vitiligo.\n\n      Study Objectives\n\n        1. To evaluate the potential for UVA1 to induce repigmentation within vitiligo patches.\n\n        2. To assess the side effect profile of UVA1 when used in the treatment of vitiligo."
