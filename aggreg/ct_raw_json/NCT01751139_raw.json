All individuals in the household will be eligible for participating in the\n      study.  This study will be sponsored by GSK and co-funded by GSK and Fiocruz. As study\n      sponsor, GSK will delegate some activities to Fiocruz, according to the provisions in their\n      Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA)."
