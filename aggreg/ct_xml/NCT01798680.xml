      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of vitamin D3
      (cholecalciferol) supplementation on HIV progression and incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis
      among HIV-positive Tanzanian adult men and women initiating highly active antiretroviral
      therapy (HAART).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV-infected adults initiating antiretroviral therapy in resource-limited settings
      experience high mortality, pulmonary tuberculosis, and other comorbidity rates during the
      first year of HIV treatment. Observational studies have shown low vitamin D is a risk factor
      for HIV progression and incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis among adults initiating HAART;
      however, whether this relationship is causal and if vitamin D supplementation starting at
      HAART initiation can improve health outcomes has not been determined. This study is a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted to examine the effect of
      vitamin D3 supplementation on morality and pulmonary tuberculosis for adults initiating
      HAART. Participants are HIV-positive Tanzanian men and women aged 18 years and older, who
      are initiating HAART at the time of randomization whose baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D
      (25(OH)D) concentration is &lt;30ng/mL. Eligible individuals are randomized to receive a) a
      vitamin D3 regimen consisting 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 taken orally once per week for 4 weeks
      (weeks 0, 1, 2, 3) followed by 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 supplements taken orally once per day
      starting at 4 weeks until study discharge at 12 months or b) placebo pills taken once weekly
      for 4 weeks (weeks 0, 1, 2, 3) followed by placebo pills taken daily starting at 4 weeks
      until study discharge.  Participants will be followed for 12 months after ART initiation.
