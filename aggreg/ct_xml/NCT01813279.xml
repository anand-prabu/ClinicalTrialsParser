  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis is an autoimmune disease characterized by skin lesions and visceral
      responsible for significant morbidity. Microcirculatory disorders and tissue fibrosis are
      excessive severity of the disease. This condition can affect the hands with a major
      functional consequence severely impairing the quality of life of patients.

      Adipose tissue is used in plastic surgery for over a century for the filling of depressions
      in the skin. In addition to the volume effect, a trophic effect on the surrounding tissue
      was noted. It is shown that the stromal vascular fraction is responsible for this
      regenerative effect.

      In a previous study the investigators have demonstrated in a mouse model that the
      subcutaneous adipose tissue provides a trophic effect on SSc skin lesions by reducing the
      fibrosis of the dermis and providing a pro angiogenic.

      Objectives and means:

      This is a clinical study evaluating an innovative cell therapy procedure. The objective of
      this study was to evaluate the effects of injection of autologous stromal vascular fraction
      of adipose origin according to the system Celution ® (Cytori Therapeutics, Inc.., United
      Kingdom) in digital in patients with scleroderma cutaneous hands.

      Eleven patients with scleroderma with the hands will be included in the study. Due to the
      nature of the orphan disease, a longitudinal study be conducted, where each patient will
      have own control.

      The evaluation will be pre and post operative for a period of six months. This evaluation
      will be based on clinical criteria (trophic balance, functional) and laboratory
      (capillaroscopy, Doppler ultrasound of the arteries of the forearm, laser-Doppler tissue).

      Project schedule and implementation phases:

      The project will run over a period of twelve months. Patients will be followed for a period
      of six months. Analyzes clinical, paraclinical, and exploitation of results will be achieved
      over a period of six months.

      Expected Results: This study will validate the functional and trophic effects of reinjection
      of autologous stromal vascular fraction of adipose tissue issue on the fingers of patients
      with scleroderma.

      Conclusion: This innovative cell therapy could represent an alternative treatment for
      patients with scleroderma in check, intolerant or insufficiently relieved by medical
      treatment currently available in the scleroderma hand
