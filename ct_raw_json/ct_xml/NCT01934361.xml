  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, phase Ib/ II study (two parts) with patients that have recurrent
      glioblastoma multiforme. The first part (phase Ib) will investigate the maximum tolerated
      dose/Recommended phase ll dose (MTD/RP2D) of once daily buparlisib in combination with
      every-three-week carboplatin or buparlisib once daily in combination with every-six-week
      lomustine (CCNU) using a Bayesian model. Once MTD/ RP2D is established in either of the 2
      arms, the corresponding phase II portion of the study will start. Phase II will assess the
      treatment effect of buparlisib in combination with carboplatin in terms of Progression Free
      Survival (PFS) and will compare the treatment effect of buparlisib with lomustine versus
      lomustine plus placebo in terms of PFS.

    <description>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is defined as the highest BKM120 dosage that does not cause medically unacceptable Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) in more than 35% of the treated patients during the first cycle of treatment. DLT is defined as treatment-related toxicity occurring during the phase Ib cycle 1 and meeting specific protocol-predefined criteria. The information will be integrated in a Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control to estimate the MTD.</description>

             treatment, prophylaxis or otherwise. Therapy with heparin, low molecular weight
             heparin (LMWH), or fondaparinux is allowed.

          -  Patient is currently receiving treatment with drugs known to be moderate or strong
             inhibitors or inducers of isoenzyme CYP3A. The patient must have discontinued strong
             inducers for at least one week and must have discontinued strong inhibitors before
             the treatment is initiated. Switching to a different medication prior to
             randomization is allowed.

          -  Patient is currently receiving an enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drug (EIAED). The
             patient must have discontinued EIAED therapy for at least two weeks prior to starting
