  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to establish whether defects in immune cell function are shared across
      multiple autoimmune diseases and whether those problems match to similar genes in the cells.
      We will look at immune cells from each subject and match the differences to types of immune
      cells known to cause autoimmune diseases. We will also investigate a particular disease
      pathway - the IL23R signaling cascade.  We want to establish whether alterations to this
      function are present in multiple diseases.
