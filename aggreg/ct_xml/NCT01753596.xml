  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye syndrome (DES) is a highly prevalent ocular condition with severe consequences for
      the patients reaching from ocular discomfort in its simplest form up to visual impairment
      and corneal ulceration in severe cases. Data from epidemiological studies indicate that DES
      is a common disease, especially in the elderly population, affecting up to 20% of adults
      aged 45 years or older. Topical lubricants are a mainstay of therapy, but data on its effect
      on tear film thickness and the corneal residence time are lacking.

      Recently, a new objective method for assessment of tear film thickness by optical coherence
      tomography has been developed. The present study aims to investigate the corneal residence
      time of an established topical lubricant compared to placebo in patients with DES and
      healthy controls.
