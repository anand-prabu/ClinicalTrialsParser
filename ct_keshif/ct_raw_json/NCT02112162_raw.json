Studying samples of tissue in\n      the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in deoxyribonucleic acid\n      (DNA) and may also help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment before surgery.\n      PET-MRI is a procedure that combines the pictures from a PET scan and an MRI scan. The\n      combined scans give more detailed pictures of areas inside the body than either scan gives\n      by itself. PET-MRI may help determine how well people respond to pre-surgery chemotherapy\n      and radiation therapy and help the surgeon make the best plan for removal of the tumor."
