  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluate efficacy and safety of 16 weeks of titrated dose treatment with BAY85-3934 versus
      epoetin alfa/beta as measured by hemoglobin (Hb) levels. Fixed starting doses of 25, 50, and
      75 mg of BAY85-3934 titrated at the scheduled dose control visits. Titration will be based
      on the subject's Hb response and tolerability of the prior dose. Planned doses include 15,
      25, 50, 75, 100, and 150 mg/day.

             [AV]block);

          -  New York Heart Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure

          -  Severe hepatic insufficiency (defined as alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate
             aminotransferase [AST], or gamma-glutamyl transferase &gt; 3 times the upper limit of
             normal [ULN], total bilirubin &gt; 2 mg/dL, or Child-Pugh B or C) or active hepatitis in
             the investigator's opinion
