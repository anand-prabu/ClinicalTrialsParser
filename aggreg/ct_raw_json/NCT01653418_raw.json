Since these components are all effective in myeloma and bortezomib has\n      shown promising results in the transplant setting, here the investigators propose a phase II\n      study to investigate the combination of bortezomib and BEAM as a new conditioning regimen\n      for patients who relapse or progress after the first autologous transplantation and for whom\n      a second autologous transplant is considered."
