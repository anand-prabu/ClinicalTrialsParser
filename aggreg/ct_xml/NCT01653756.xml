          -  Use of any medication for the treatment of asthma other than a short-acting β2
             agonist (as needed) within the 4 weeks prior to Screening

          -  Participation in another clinical study within minimum of 30 days prior to study
             Screening

          -  A positive screen result for active or latent tuberculosis

          -  A history of cardiovascular disease
