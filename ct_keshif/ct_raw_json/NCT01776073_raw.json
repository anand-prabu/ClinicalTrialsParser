Patients identified as being at high and moderate risk of delay to\n      waitlisting will be linked with a patient navigator, who will facilitate their completion of\n      pre-waitlisting requirements. We believe that patients who are randomized to a patient\n      navigator will be more likely to complete the pre-waitlisting process and will complete the\n      process more quickly than high and moderate risk patients who do not receive additional\n      assistance from a patient navigator."

Medical secretaries will\n      collect information about patients' medical and demographic characteristics during the\n      appointment scheduling phone call. This information will be entered into the REDCap risk\n      assessment tool, which will be used to calculate the probability of waitlisting. A\n      previously defined cut-off will be used to categorize the risk of delay to waitlisting.\n\n      A random subset of patients identified as being at high and moderate risk of delay to\n      waitlisting will be connected with a patient navigator, who will be available not only to\n      answer questions, but also to manage clinical information prior to, during, and following\n      transplantation. The navigator will work to identify potential barriers and to ensure that\n      the most up-to-date clinical information has garnered responses at the nurse and physician\n      levels.\n\n      The effect of connecting high and moderate risk patients with a patient navigator on time to\n      waitlisting and rate of waitlisting will be analyzed to determine whether such a program is\n      an effective means of increasing access to transplant for patients who are likely to face\n      financial, racial, and demographic barriers."
