The study will enroll a total of 10 patients.  5 will randomly\n      be assigned to receive the cromolyn sodium solution, and the other 5 will be randomly\n      assigned to receive the placebo solution.  All participants will be instructed to apply\n      their assigned solution twice daily to their face.  Patients will return to the clinic 3, 6,\n      and 8 weeks after the distribution of the solutions to measure the efficacy of their\n      assigned solution."
