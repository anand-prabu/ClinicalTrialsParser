Several mechanisms of action have been proposed to explain why written disclosure\n      produces positive benefits, but all have focused on processes occurring during the writing\n      session.  It has been suggested, however, that additional processing may occur after the\n      writing exercises are over, yet no research has studied the influence of this processing on\n      outcomes.  The current study proposes to directly measure how processing after participating\n      in written disclosure affects physical and psychological outcomes."
