Patients were\n      distributed into two groups: Group Without Retention (GSC) n = 15; and Group With Retention\n      (GCC) n = 15. In the GCC group, a Transpalatal Arch (TPA) was installed for retention soon\n      after removal of the expander. The dental casts were scanned using a Vivid 9i 3D laser\n      scanner (Konica Minolta, Wayne, NJ). The plaster models were performed preoperatively (T1),\n      4 months after the expander was removed (T2), and 10 months after the end of the expansion\n      (T3). The distances measured were Inter-Cusps of Premolars and Molars (Inter-Cusp PM)\n      (Inter-Cusp M), Inter-Cervicals of Premolars and Molars (Inter-Cervical PM) (Inter-Cervical\n      M), Inter-WALA edges of Premolars and Molars (PM Inter-BW) (BW Inter-M), palatal height at\n      the molar, and palatal area and volume at T1, T2, and T3."
