  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale behind this post-market clinical follow-up investigation is to collect data
      regarding the usability and clinical performance of the Baha Attract System in subjects with
      hearing impairment that are candidates for Baha surgery:

        -  to evaluate the efficacy of the Baha Attract System in terms of hearing performance
           compared to the unaided situation and compared to a pre-operative test situation using
           the sound processor on a Baha Softband;

        -  to evaluate the mid- and long-term safety of the Baha Attract System.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Adult subject, i.e. ≥ 18 years of age

        Conductive or mixed hearing loss in the ear to be implanted:

        Bone conduction thresholds with a pure tone average PTA4 of &lt; 30 dB hearing level (mean of
        500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz).

        OR

        Single-sided sensorineural deafness (SSD):

        European sites: Bone conduction thresholds with a pure tone average PTA4 of &lt; 30dB hearing
        level (mean of 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz) in the good ear.

        US sites: Air conduction thresholds with a pure tone average PTA4 of  20 dB hearing level
        (mean of 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 Hz) in the good ear OR Subject is indicated for an AC
        CROS but—for some reason—cannot or will not use an AC CROS.

        No previous bone conduction implant on the side of the skull to be implanted. Signed
        informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects that are scheduled for simultaneous bilateral implant surgery. The investigation
        is limited to subjects with unilateral use of the Baha Attract System (however, bilateral
        hearing loss is not an exclusion criterion).

        Suitable implant position for the BI300 Implant (4 mm or 3 mm) not found during surgery
        due to insufficient bone quality and/or bone thickness.

        Less than 3 mm soft tissue thickness at the planned implant site. Subjects that have
        received radiation therapy at the same side of the skull where the Baha Attract System
        will be positioned.

        Condition that could jeopardise osseointegration and/or wound healing as judged by the
        investigator (e.g. osteoporosis, psoriasis, use of corticosteroids).

        Uncontrolled diabetes as judged by the investigator. Condition that may have an impact on
        the outcome of the investigation as judged by the investigator.

        Unable to follow investigational procedures (e.g. to complete quality of life scales).

        Participation in another investigation with pharmaceuticals and/or  medical device.
