Epidemiological studies\n      reveal that about 10% of the adult population suffer from severe periodontitis.It comprises\n      of two distinct but interconnected etiologic components: the periodontopathic bacteria\n      adjacent to the periodontal tissues, and the host-mediated connective tissue-destructive\n      responses to the causative bacteria and their metabolic products. In the arena of\n      periodontics, the probiotics pose a great potential of plaque modification, halitosis\n      management, altering anaerobic bacteria colonization, improvement of pocket depth, and\n      clinical attachment gain.\n\n      Aim of the study is to analyze the beneficial effect of probiotic lozenges as an adjunct to\n      Scaling and Root Planing, on clinical and biochemical parameters."
