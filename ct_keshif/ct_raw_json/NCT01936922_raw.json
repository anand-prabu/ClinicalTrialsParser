This study will evaluate whether older adults who have had\n      unintentional falls are willing to enroll in this kind of study, use the device briefly, and\n      undergo research assessments. The study will also test whether using the virtual reality\n      device leads to detectable changes in gait, balance, and mobility confidence. This study\n      will lay the groundwork for more comprehensive studies in the future that will assess the\n      clinical impact of using the device.\n\n      Twenty-four subjects will be recruited.  They will include equal numbers of older adults\n      who: (1) have fallen without a significant injury (e.g. only minor contusion, lacerations)\n      or (2) have fallen with a significant injury (e.g. dislocation, strain/sprain, or fracture)\n      which has healed prior to enrollment.\n\n      Each subject will complete baseline measures of gait, balance, and confidence.  Then she or\n      he will be introduced to the virtual reality device  and will use it for a brief period.\n      Gait and balance will be tested again, first with the virtual reality device and then,\n      finally, without the virtual reality device.\n\n      The device (GaitAid\u00ae), developed by co-investigator Yoram Baram, Ph.D., has already been\n      used for the rehabilitation of neurological patients (e.g. Parkinson's Disease).  The device\n      is a training tool and NOT a continuous walking aid."
