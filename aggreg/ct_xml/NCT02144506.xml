    <textblock>
      The aim of the pilot-study is to evaluate the feasability of a future RCT, regarding
      recruitement of eligible participants, adhesion rate, datarecording and cost.  In this
      feasibility pilot study, 18 patients with at least 65 years will be allocated randomly to
      one of two interventions. The control group gets a well-known home-based exercise program
      (OTAGO) aiming to prevent falls where the exercises are prescribed by a physical therapists.
      The exercises will be presented on a booklet and on printed cards. The Intervention group
      consists of an exercise program, the &quot;T&amp;E&quot; program, where the elderly persons can choose the
      exercises depending on their abilities. The exercises in the &quot;T&amp;E&quot; program will be presented
      in a printed manual and shown on videos on an electronic tablet. Both intervention groups
      receive 6 hours of instruction and control/supervision sessions by physical therapists. In
      addition,  the participants will exercise alone.

      The interventions will be performed over 24 weeks.

      In this pilot study, the hypothesis is that the adhesion rate is at least 65%. Other
      feasibility criteria will be costs, data recording issues and the qualitative evaluation of
      the booklet and the tablet.

      Falls will be assessed with a falls calendar. The amount of physical activity of the
      participants is assessed with an accelerometers (actigraph) and quality of life will be
      assessed with OPQOL-35 at baseline, week 16 and week 24.
