  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous return is driven by the pressure gradient between mean systemic pressure and right
      atrial pressure. However, mean systemic pressure is more a physiological concept than an
      available clinical measurement. Indeed, the mean systemic pressure is the one that would be
      measured anywhere within the vascular system after cardiac arrest. Recent advances in
      hemodynamic monitoring have made MSP available to the clinician through beat-by-beat cardiac
      output measurements during respiratory pauses under mechanical ventilation. In this way, it
      is possible to calculate MSP, the pressure gradient and the venous return resistances. The
      investigators aim is to explain the hemodynamic variations and the decrease in cardiac
      output observed during prone position. The investigators hypothesis is that venous return
      resistances are increased during prone position probably following an increased
      intra-abdominal pressure.
