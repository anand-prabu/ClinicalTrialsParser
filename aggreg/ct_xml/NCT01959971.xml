      Primary Objective:

      To assess the effects of subcutaneous (SC) doses of alirocumab on the elimination (measured
      by Fractional Clearance Rate (FCR)) of apolipoprotein B (apoB) in low density lipoprotein
      (LDL) in adults with mildly elevated LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C).

      Secondary Objectives:

      To assess the effects of SC doses of alirocumab on:

        -  Various parameters of  the metabolism and turnover in plasma of different lipoproteins

        -  Plasma lipids concentration: total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol
           (HDL-C), triglycerides, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apoB,
           lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a))

        -  Lipoprotein particle size profile

        -  PCSK9 (free and total) concentrations in serum To assess safety and tolerability of
           alirocumab. To assess emergence of anti-alirocumab antibodies. To document serum
           alirocumab concentrations.

      Total duration of the study per subject is 26 weeks, including a screening period of ≤ 4
      weeks, placebo treatment period of 4 weeks, alirocumab treatment period of 10 weeks, and a
      follow up period of 8 weeks.
