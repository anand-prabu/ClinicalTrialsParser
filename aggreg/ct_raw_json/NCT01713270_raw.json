            "textblock": "Atrial fibrillation(AF) is the most common arrhythmia, and its frequency increases with age.\n      Hemodynamic impairment and thromboembolic events related to AF result in significant\n      morbidity, mortality, and cost. Management of patients with AF involves 3\n      objectives\u2014correction of the rhythm disturbance, rate control, and prevention of\n      thromboembolism. Regardless of whether the rate-control or rhythm-control strategy is\n      pursued, attention must also be directed to antithrombotic therapy for prevention of\n      thromboembolism.  Pharmacological cardioversion approaches appear simple but are less\n      efficacious. The major risk is related to poor tolerance of side effects\uff0cdrug\u2014associated\n      toxicity\uff0cand proarrhythmic potentia1 of antiarrhythmic drugs. Radiofrequency catheter\n      ablation of AF has developed rapidly in recent years, but the number of AF recurrences\n      during the long-term follow-up was significant. In addition, the complications associated\n      with AF ablation procedures likely to result in prolonged hospitalization, long-term\n      disability or death. Hypertension is the most important risk factor for AF , Hypertension is\n      associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, impaired ventricular filling, left atrial\n      enlargement, and slowing of atrial conduction velocity. These changes in cardiac structure\n      and physiology favor the development and maintenance of AF, and they increase the risk of\n      thromboembolic complications. In patients with AF, aggressive treatment of hypertension may\n      reverse the structural changes in the heart, reduce thromboembolic complications, and retard\n      or prevent the occurrence of AF. Recently, many clinical researches have verified that\n      Catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation can safely be used to substantially reduce\n      blood pressure, reduce left ventricular hypertrophy, improve glucose tolerance and sleep\n      apnea severity. Simultaneously, a marked reduction in muscle and whole-body\n      sympathetic-nerve activity(MSNA) is apparent, with a decrease in renal and whole-body\n      norepinephrine spillover. Left ventricle hypertrophy, left atrial enlargement, high\n      norepinephrine level\uff0cglucose tolerance abnormity and obstructive sleep apnea are all\n      recognized as independent risk factors for the development and recurrence of AF. So, we\n      design this randomized parallel control multi center clinical study to demonstrate whether\n      renal sympathetic denervation is safe and effective in patients with hypertension and\n      symptomatic atrial fibrillation."
