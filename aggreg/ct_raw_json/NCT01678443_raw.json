Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, such as yttrium-90 anti-CD45 monoclonal\n      antibody BC8, can find cancer cells and carry cancer-killing substances to them without\n      harming normal cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient\n      they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells,\n      and platelets. Giving radiolabeled monoclonal antibody before a stem cell transplant may be\n      an effective treatment for relapsed or refractory lymphoid malignancies."

To optimize the protein dose (antibody [Ab]) to deliver a favorable biodistribution in\n      the majority of patients.\n\n      II. To describe the impact of rituximab concentrations, B-cell depletion, and disease burden\n      on CD20 and CD45 targeting.\n\n      III. To describe response rates and remission durations in relapsed B-NHL, T-NHL, and HL\n      following administration of myeloablative doses of 90Y-BC8-DOTA prior to autologous stem\n      cell transplant (ASCT).\n\n      IV. To assess the correlation of lymphoma biomarkers with outcomes.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of yttrium-90 anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody BC8.\n\n      Patients receive indium-111 anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody BC8 intravenously (IV) on day -28\n      and (if necessary) day -21 to evaluate the antibody's biodistribution. Patients then receive\n      yttrium-90 anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody BC8 IV on day -14. Patients then undergo autologous\n      peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 0.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months and\n      then annually thereafter."
