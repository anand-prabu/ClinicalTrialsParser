Signed informed consent by the patient and/or parents/legal\n      guardian was obtained as soon as it is confirmed that the patient met inclusion/exclusion\n      criteria and the parents/guardian would agree for the child to participate in the study.\n\n      The primary interventions for the study were:\n\n        1. Administration of study drug.\n\n        2. Collection of baseline physical exam, vital signs, blood and urine samples for\n           laboratory tests.\n\n        3. Collection of periodic physical exam, vital signs, blood and urine samples for\n           laboratory tests during the period of administration of the study drug.\n\n        4. Collection of any adverse event information.\n\n      Time and Events Schedule:\n\n      Baseline:\n\n        1. Confirm eligibility\n\n        2. Obtain written informed consent from patient and/or parents/legal guardian\n\n        3. Collect demographic data and disease and medication history, including family history\n\n           Baseline and Ongoing:\n\n        4. Obtain  body weight\n\n        5. Record adverse events\n\n        6. Obtain blood and urine samples for laboratory tests\n\n        7. Initiate study drug therapy & monitor study drug therapy and adjust dose as needed"
