  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to collect feasibility and acceptability of an internet
      mindfulness meditation intervention for older adults and to collect preliminary data on mood
      and cognition changes from before to after the intervention. Up to 32 older adults will be
      randomized to receive a mindfulness meditation intervention or a time and attention control,
      both delivered over the internet (16 completers). Participants will have a one-hour session
      weekly for six weeks with daily home practice between sessions. Participants will complete
      the sessions online with a study iPad. Their home practice will also be installed on the
      study iPad as well as an objective adherence monitoring program that the investigators
      developed to track actual home practice between sessions. The feasibility and acceptability
      measures are enrollment rate, completion rate, and participant satisfaction. Self-report
      mood questionnaires and cognitive tasks will be measured before and after the intervention
      period and data used to conduct power analyses and sample size estimation for a larger
      clinical trial.

    <description>One session per week for 6 weeks online through study iPAD. The intervention is a standardized and structured program.  The objectives are to: 1) help participants understand their personal reactions to stress, 2) teach them skills to modify their stress reactions, and 3) promote their desire for self-care and feelings of competence and mastery.</description>
