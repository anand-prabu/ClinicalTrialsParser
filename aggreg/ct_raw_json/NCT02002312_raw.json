Whole body and blood measurements of\n      radioactivity will be obtained on at least three occasions for one week to determine\n      targeting and dosimetry. Only if at least one known and evaluable metastatic lesion is\n      visualized with In-111-DOTA-girentuximab, therapeutic Lu-177-DOTA- girentuximab will be\n      administered the following week. In the absence of disease progression and after recovery\n      from toxicity, patients may be retreated no sooner than 12 weeks after the prior treatment\n      with a dose of no more than 75% of the previous dose, for a total of not more than three\n      treatments.
