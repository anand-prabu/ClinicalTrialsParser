    <description>For the purpose of facilitating future genetic laboratory investigations of late effects among of survivors of cancer, tumors, or a related illness. Patients in the ALTFU Program are followed for secondary malignant neoplasms and other adverse outcomes (so-called &quot;late effects&quot;) including cardiomyopathy, pulmonary fibrosis, cardiac valvular pathology, osteoporosis, and others. The following data will be ascertained from each study participant: (1) family history information will be ascertained using the Family History Questionnaire (Appendix A); and (2) saliva or blood samples for genetic analysis.</description>

    <description>The purpose of this study is to establish a registry of survivors of cancer, tumors,or a related illness. The registry will include detailed family history and germline DNA. Ultimately, we hope to improve our understanding of genetic susceptibility to secondary malignant neoplasms and other late effects among survivors of cancer, tumors, or a related illness.</description>

    <description>Consented subjects will be given the Family History Questionnaire (FHQ) (Appendix A), to complete either in clinic or at home. For participants who are children and can not fill out the questionnaire on their own, the clinic RSA will instruct the parent or guardian present to fill out the questionnaire, reminding them that the &quot;You&quot; in the questionnaire refers to their child. Saliva or blood samples will be collected in the clinic at the time of a routine visit. The patient will decide which type of sample they would like to donate. For children who are ten years of age or younger, who cannot be expected to produce a saliva sample, approximately 3-5cc of blood will be collected.</description>
