    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, observational study of changing from any IOP-lowering treatment
      to a prostaglandin analogue-containing IOP-lowering medication for patients with Primary
      Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) or Ocular Hypertension (OHT).  The decision to change medications
      lies with the physician according to their standard practice.
