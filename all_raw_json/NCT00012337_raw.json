Drugs such as ZD 1839 may interfere with the growth factors and cause tumor cells\n      to die.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ZD 1839 in treating patients who have\n      metastatic kidney cancer."

Determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this drug.\n      III. Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral ZD 1839 once daily. Courses repeat every 28 days in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for at least\n      1 month.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-46 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
