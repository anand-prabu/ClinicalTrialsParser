We will measure the brachial index tow times once before giving L-Citrulline\n      malate and the other time after 2 weeks giving it.Patients receiving L-Citrulline malate as\n      a 1 gram dry  powder agent twice a day, that should in use with 250 mg dilute water .The\n      patients will followed after 2 weeks by measuring brachial index which is our primary\n      outcome measurement in this trial.We assumed that the brachial index in both smoker and\n      non-smoker group of patients with coronary heart disease would change to normal or close to\n      normal after giving 1 gram L-citrulline malate twice a day for 2 weeks."
