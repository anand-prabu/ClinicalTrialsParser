A correlation between the use of potato\n      resistant starch and specific clinical and quality of life endpoints between elderly\n      residents of a long term care facility and in pre-elderly, adults from the general public\n      will be studied.\n\n      Hypothesis 1: The investigator hypothesizes that the microbiome in LTC residents (\u226570 years)\n      is less diverse and more prone to imbalance compared to adults (30-50 years) from the\n      general population and that this imbalance of the gut microflora in the LTC residents is\n      partially related to inadequate RS in their diet.\n\n      Hypothesis 2: The investigator hypothesizes that ingestion of potato resistant starch of\n      food grade quality (MSPrebiotic) will stabilize the gut microbiome (i.e. high\n      Firmicutes/Bacteroides ratio)in LTC residents (i.e. similar to that of adults from the\n      general population), thereby improving gut health and reducing the risk of diarrhea and/or\n      gut infection."
