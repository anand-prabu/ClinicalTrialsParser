            "textblock": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a condition characterized by an increased pulmonary\n      vascular resistance that can lead to right heart failure and death. Several diseases are\n      known etiologies of PAH including scleroderma and cirrhosis. The presence of PAH in the\n      context of systemic sclerosis or cirrhosis has a dramatic impact on prognosis and survival\n      of the connective tissue or liver disease.\n\n      Despite advances in the diagnosis of PAH, echocardiography remains a necessary test for\n      screening PAH in patients with scleroderma or cirrhosis.  However, echocardiography is less\n      than ideal for diagnosing PAH and predicting treatment response. Thus, there is a pressing\n      need to identify methodologies that can accurately and non-invasively recognize the presence\n      of PAH in patients with scleroderma and cirrhosis.\n\n      Hypothesis:\n\n        1. To measure endothelial function and exhaled gases in patients with scleroderma and\n           cirrhosis. To assess whether they correlate with the presence or the development of\n           PAH.\n\n        2. The degree of local (forearm) capillary vasodilation during treprostinil iontophoresis\n           identifies patients who will develop PAH and in those already diagnosed PAH predicts\n           response to PAH-specific therapies."

We will test patients with\n      cirrhosis because they tend to have PAH in the context of a hyperdynamic instead of a\n      hypodynamic state as observed in scleroderma and PAH.\n\n      Aims:\n\n        1. To measure endothelial function and exhaled gases in patients with scleroderma or\n           cirrhosis to assess whether they correlate with the presence or the development of PAH.\n\n        2.
