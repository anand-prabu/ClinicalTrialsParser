It is known that in critically ill\n      patients, alterations in function of various organs and body systems can influence the\n      pharmacokinetics and hence the plasma concentration of a drug. The pharmacokinetic\n      parameters of micafungin in critically ill patients are most likely different, but this has\n      not been specifically studied.\n\n      The pharmacokinetic parameters of micafungin in critically ill patients will be established\n      and plasma concentrations of micafungin will be correlated with disease severity."
