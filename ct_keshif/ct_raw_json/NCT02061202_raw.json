The specific\n      aims of this proposal are 1) Conduct a feasibility study - a randomized controlled trial of\n      ICS for adults with SCD who do not meet criteria for a diagnosis of asthma but report\n      recurrent cough or wheezing, 2) Measure the effects of ICS on biological correlates of\n      pulmonary inflammation (as determined by exhaled nitric oxide) and vascular injury (as\n      determined by sVCAM) in SCD, and 3) Compare properties of traditional and Bayesian adaptive\n      clinical trial design for therapeutic trials in SCD in preparation for designing a\n      definitive trial of ICS. These aims have the potential to 1) change the standard of care for\n      individuals with SCD and recurrent cough or wheeze, 2) provide insight into the pathogenesis\n      of non-asthmatic wheezing in SCD and its response to treatment, 3) explore the suitability\n      of innovative clinical trial designs to overcome the challenges that have hindered\n      therapeutic innovation for SCD."
