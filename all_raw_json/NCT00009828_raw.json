            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of weekly paclitaxel when combined with\n      fluorouracil-uracil and leucovorin calcium in patients with solid tumors. II. Determine the\n      side effects and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of paclitaxel. Patients receive paclitaxel IV on\n      days 1, 8, and 15. Patients also receive oral fluorouracil-uracil and leucovorin calcium\n      twice daily on days 2-6, 9-13, and 16-20. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6\n      courses in the absence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6\n      patients receive escalating doses of paclitaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is\n      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience\n      dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 2 months and then for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
