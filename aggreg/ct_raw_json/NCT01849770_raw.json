            "textblock": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting primarily\n      motor neurons, for which treatment designed to slow or arrest progression remains lacking.\n      Mexiletine is a use-dependent sodium channel blocker that has been FDA-approved for decades\n      for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias and more recently to treat neuropathic pain in\n      diabetic polyneuropathy. Mexiletine has been shown also to be protective of neurons\n      following spinal cord, head injury, and cerebral ischemia, largely by blocking\n      excitotoxicity. Based on previous studies, mexiletine appears to penetrate into the central\n      nervous system at concentrations sufficient to confer significant protection. Recent\n      unpublished studies in the laboratory of Dr. Robert Brown at the University of Massachusetts\n      have also demonstrated that mexiletine ingestion in mice genetically engineered to express\n      high levels of mutant cytosolic copper-zinc superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) transgene prolongs\n      survival in these animals. As mexiletine already has FDA-approval as an anti-arrhythmic\n      agent, much is known about the pharmacology and safety of this drug in non-ALS patients. We\n      anticipate that by excluding subjects with a known history of cardiac disease and with the\n      known neuroprotectant properties of this medication, mexiletine is a good choice for further\n      study in an ALS clinical trial."
