  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety of giving CD8+T cells
      with ipilimumab, cyclophosphamide, and IL-2 (aldesleukin).  Researchers also want to learn
      if this combination can help to control metastatic melanoma.

      CD8+T cells are a type of white blood cell.  Researchers grow the T cells in the laboratory,
      and they are designed to find melanoma cancer cells and may kill them.

      Ipilimumab and aldesleukin are designed to increase the immune system's ability to fight
      cancer.

      Cyclophosphamide will be used at a very low dose to weaken the body's natural defense
      against the T-cell transplant, so that the transplanted T-cells have a chance to grow and
      multiply.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive
      cyclophosphamide by vein over about 30-60 minutes on Day -2 (2 days before you receive the
      CD8+ T cells).  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will be given standard drugs to help
      decrease the risk of side effects.  You may ask the study staff for information about how
      the drug is given and its risks.

      On Day 0, you will receive the CD8+ T cells by vein over about 30-60 minutes.  You will stay
      in the hospital overnight after the dose.

      Starting within 6 hours after the CD8+T cell infusion and then 2 times a day after that for
      14 days, you will give aldesleukin as an injection into your skin around your abdomen.  You
      will be taught how to give yourself these injections.

      On Days 1, 22, 43, and 64, you will receive ipilimumab by vein over about 90 minutes.

      Study Visits:

      Within 2-4 weeks before you receive the CD8+ T cells:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 5½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and
           tests on how long the T-cells survive in your body.

        -  You will have a computed tomography (CT) scan or x-rays to check the status of the
           disease.

      On Day -2:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.  This routine blood draw
           will include a pregnancy test if you can become pregnant.  To continue your
           participation in this study, you cannot be pregnant.

      On Days 0, 7, 14, 22, 28, 35, 43, 49, 56, 64, 70, 77, 84, 112, and 140:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 5½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and
           tests on how long the T-cells survive in your body.

        -  Between Day 35 and 42 and again between Day 77 and 84, you will have a CT scan or
           x-rays to check the status of the disease.

      On Day 3, blood (about 5½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests,
      and tests on how long the T-cells survive in your body.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed to confirm the status of the disease, blood (about 1½
      tablespoons) will be drawn every 3-6 months for up to 3 years.

      The study tests may be repeated or you may have additional tests performed anytime the
      doctor thinks it is needed.

      Some of the study tests may be done at your local clinic if you cannot return to MD
      Anderson.  The study staff will discuss this with you.

      Length of Treatment:

      The treatment portion of the study will last until Day 64.  You will no longer be able to
      take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you
      are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      At Day 168:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 5½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and
           tests on how long the T-cells survive in your body.

      Follow-Up:

      Every 3 months after Day 84, unless the disease gets worse or you start another cancer
      therapy, you will have a CT scan or x-rays to check the status of the disease.  Every 3
      months for up to 5 years, the study staff will call you or ask your doctor how you are
      doing.  If you are called, the calls should last about 10-15 minutes.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will return to the clinic every 4-6 weeks or as often
      as the doctor thinks is needed.  Blood (about 5½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine
      tests, immune system tests, and tests on how long the T-cells survive in your body.

      This is an investigational study.  CD8+T cells are not FDA approved or commercially
      available.  They are currently being used for research purposes only. Cyclophosphamide,
      ipilimumab, and aldesleukin are FDA approved and commercially available for the way they are
      being used in this study.

      Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this multicenter study.  Up to 20 will take part
      at MD Anderson.
