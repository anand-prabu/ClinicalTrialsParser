Be a postmenopausal woman with an intact uterus and a Screening serum estradiol level\n             of \u226450 pg/mL. Postmenopausal is defined herein as:\n\n               1. \u2265 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea, or\n\n               2. at least 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with a Screening serum FSH level of\n                  >40 mIU/ml, or\n\n               3. \u2265 6 weeks postsurgical bilateral oophorectomy.\n\n          3. Be seeking treatment or relief for vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause.\n\n          4. To participate in the VMS Substudy, a subject must also report \u22657 moderate to severe\n             hot flushes per day, or \u226550 per week, at the baseline assessment during Screening\n             (subjects whose hot flushes are less frequent may still participate as non-Substudy\n             subjects.\n\n             Note: A minimum of 14 consecutive days of complete hot flush diary data are required\n             during the baseline assessment at Screening, and these consecutive days must occur\n             within the last 14 days prior to the Randomization visit (not counting the\n             Randomization visit day itself).

Have a Body Mass Index (BMI) less than or equal to 34 kg/mP2P. (BMI values should be\n             rounded to the nearest integer [e.g., 34.4 rounds down to 34, while 26.5 rounds up to\n             27]).\n\n          6.

The medical evaluation findings\n             must include:\n\n               1. a normal or non-clinically significant physical examination, including vital\n                  signs (sitting blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature).\n                  Acceptable sitting systolic blood pressure is \u2264140 mmHg and diastolic blood\n                  pressure \u226490 mmHg at Screening.

The site must obtain a copy of the official report\n                  for the subject's study file, and it must be verified that the mammogram itself\n                  is available if needed for additional assessment.\n\n               4. a normal or non-clinically significant clinical breast examination.

Additionally, the endometrial biopsy reports by the two central\n                  pathologists of Other Findings at Screening must each specify one of the\n                  following: endometrial polyp not present; benign endometrial polyp; or polyp\n                  other.
