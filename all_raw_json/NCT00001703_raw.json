            "textblock": "About 27,000 new cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are diagnosed every year in the United\n      States.  11,000 of these cases will die from the disease.  More than half of patients\n      present with advanced or metastatic disease for which chemotherapy plays a very limited\n      role.  Therefore, development of another therapeutic approach is needed.  Cancers in humans\n      are commonly associated with mutations in dominant and recessive oncogenes.  These genes\n      produce mutated proteins that are unique to cancer cells.  Von Hipple-Lindau (VHL) gene\n      which is associated with the development of the VHL disease, has been recently mapped and\n      cloned, and it is found to be mutated in 57% of sporadic renal cell carcinomas.\n\n      Data in mice have shown the generation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restricted\n      cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) that are capable of detecting endogenous cytoplasmic peptide\n      derived from mutated oncogenes.  In addition, we have recently demonstrated, by conducting\n      different phase I clinical trials in which we vaccinate cancer patients with mutated Ras or\n      p53 peptides corresponding to the abnormality patients harbor in their tumors, that in some\n      patients we can generate immunological responses represented by the generation of\n      lymphocytes (CD4+ and/or CD8+).  In the current study, we would like to extend our\n      observations to test whether VHL tumor suppressor protein can be immunologically targeted by\n      vaccination.  We have identified specific epitopes along the amino acid sequence of the VHL\n      protein, which represent known specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class-I binding\n      motifs.  These amino acids stretches in the VHL protein correspond to the area of the point\n      mutation hot spots.  Therefore, we propose to treat patients with sporadic RCC who carry VHL\n      mutations in their tumors with corresponding mutant VHL peptide vaccination.  This\n      vaccination will be done either by using pulsed-autologous peripheral mononuclear cells with\n      the peptides, or peptides administered subcutaneously alone or in combination with\n      cytokines."

            "textblock": "About 27,000 new cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are diagnosed every year in the United\n      States.  11,000 of these cases will die from the disease.  More than half of patients\n      present with advanced or metastatic disease for which chemotherapy plays a very limited\n      role.  Therefore, development of another therapeutic approach is needed.  Cancers in humans\n      are commonly associated with mutations in dominant and recessive oncogenes.  These genes\n      produce mutated proteins that are unique to cancer cells.  Von Hipple-Lindau gene, which is\n      associated with the development of the VHL disease, has been recently mapped and cloned; it\n      is found to be mutated in 57% of sporadic renal cell carcinomas.\n\n      Data in mice have shown the generation of MHC restricted CTL that are capable of detecting\n      endogenous cytoplasmic peptide derived from mutated oncogenes.  In addition, we have\n      recently demonstrated, by conducting different phase I clinical trials in which we vaccinate\n      cancer patients with mutated Ras or p53 peptides corresponding to the abnormality patients\n      harbor in their tumors, that in some patients we can generate immunological responses\n      represented by the generation of lymphocytes (CD4+ and/or CD8+).  In the current study, we\n      would like to extend our observations to test whether VHL tumor suppressor protein can be\n      immunologically targeted by vaccination.  We have identified specific epitopes along the\n      amino acid sequence of the VHL protein which represent known specific HLA class-I binding\n      motifs.  These amino acids stretches in the VHL protein correspond to the area of the point\n      mutation hot spots.  Therefore, this protocol treats patients with sporadic RCC who carry\n      VHL mutations in their tumors with corresponding mutant VHL peptide vaccination."
