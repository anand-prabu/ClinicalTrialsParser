Intravenous amphotericin B is effective for acute disease but relapse occurs in\n      the majority of patients. Maintenance therapy is recommended but must be balanced against\n      the multiple toxicities of the drugs used and the problems associated with the weekly\n      administration of intravenous therapy. Treatments that are equally or more effective and\n      less toxic than traditional methods are needed, especially oral therapy. SCH 39304 is an\n      orally active antifungal drug that in animal studies is active against a wide range of\n      systemic fungal infections including infections due to Cryptococcus. Features of SCH 39304\n      suggest that it might be of value in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis."
