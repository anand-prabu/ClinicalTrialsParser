  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if daily consumption of barley beta-glucans
      impact on lipid and glucose metabolism and on intestinal microbiota in a population with
      metabolic syndrome. It is assumed that two month intervention with beta-glucans will improve
      some clinical signs of metabolic syndrome and alter composition of intestinal microbiota.
      Variation in microbiota composition will be investigated with emphasis on Bacteroidetes and
      Firmicutes ratio. Furthermore it is presupposed that consumption of beta-glucans will
      stimulate growth of beneficial intestinal bacteria from genus Lactobacillus and
      Bifidobacteria and consequently effect production of short chain fatty acids in population
      with metabolic syndrome. Moreover it is presupposed that two-month consumption of
      beta-glucans will have influence on glucose metabolism and will consequently improve insulin
      resistance within people with metabolic syndrome. It is assumed that two-month consumption
      of beta-glucans will improve specific plasma lipid content in population with metabolic
      syndrome.

    <textblock>
      In study it will be investigated whether daily consumption of barley beta-glucans integrated
      in bread product effects lipid and glucose metabolism and alter the composition of
      intestinal microbiota in a population with metabolic syndrome. 70 participants with
      metabolic syndrome will be enrolled in study. Participants will daily consume 200 g of bread
      with high amount of beta-glucans.

      Hypothesis:

        1. Two-month consumption of beta-glucans alters composition of intestinal microbiota and
           changes ratio of bacteria from phylum Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Furthermore
           consumption of beta-glucans stimulates growth of beneficial intestinal bacteria from
           genus Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria and consequently effects production of short
           chain fatty acids in population with metabolic syndrome.

        2. Two-month consumption of beta-glucans has influence on glucose metabolism and
           consequently improves insulin resistance within people with metabolic syndrome.

        3. Two-month consumption of beta-glucans improves specific plasma lipid content in
           population with metabolic syndrome.

      Study will be designed as double blind, randomised, placebo controlled clinical trial and
      performed regarding to CONSORT 2010 recommendations for randomised clinical trials. Patient
      enrollment will be performed in several community health centres in Slovenia in association
      with family medicine doctors. Appropriate patients with metabolic syndrome will be suggested
      to participate in clinical trial. Candidates will be suggested to participate in a two month
      study. If there will not be recruited enough participants for two month study they will be
      suggested for participation in one month study. Candidates interested in participating in
      study will be informed about study design and terms and conditions of study by main
      investigator.

      Study will be performed after successful recruitment of first 20 or more participants. Study
      will be performed three times, so that 70 participants will be recruited in complete study.
      Participants will consume bread with high beta-glucans content (around 3, 4 g beta-glucans
      per 100 g of bread) during 8 week period. Before beginning of study participants will have
      two week washout period without consuming any pre- and pro-biotics. They will remain their
      usual eating habits during study period except taking any antibiotics or pre- and
      pro-biotic. Participants will give blood and stool samples a day before intervention with
      barley beta-glucans. Blood sampling will involve oral glucose test for insulin resistance
      determination and sampling for specific lipid content determination. They will also have
      option to give a blood sample for genetic investigation of genes associated with lipid
      metabolism (apoE). Blood and stool sampling will be repeated day after intervention period.
      The same parameters as before intervention period except genetic analysis will be
      investigated. 72-hour dietary recall will be performed during intervention period
      individually to evaluate daily nutrient and energetic input of each participant.

    <description>Experimental food is bread with high amount of barley beta-glucans. Experimental bread contains approximately 3,4 % (w/w) beta-glucans. Participants will consume 6 g of beta-glucans daily (approximately 200 g of bread per day). Beta-glucans are natural polysaccharides found in grain endosperm and are mostly represented in oat and barley. Beta-glucans are linear homopolymers of D- glycopyranosyl residues with mixed linkage (1-4, 1-3)-β-D-glucans. Their molecular structure enable beta-glucans their functional action that mostly depends of their viscosity and solubility (1). Testing bread has integrated flour with high amount of barley beta-glucans (ReducholTM). Beta-glucans are concentrated in flour up to 15 % with dry milling, sieving and air classification of barley flour.</description>
