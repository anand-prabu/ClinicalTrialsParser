Positive and negative symptom scale\n      (PANSS) is applied before the first stimulation, at the end of every stimulation day and two\n      weeks after the last stimulation (a total 6). Other psychiatric evaluations used are\n      Clinical global impression (CGI), Sheehan disability scale (SDS), Personal and social\n      performance scale (PSP) and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS), Calgary depression\n      scale for schizophrenia (CDSS); (MADRS and CDSS are for the exclusion of depression).
