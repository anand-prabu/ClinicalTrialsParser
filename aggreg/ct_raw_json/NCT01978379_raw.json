In\n      this study, we will also use two devices called the Medasense PMD-100 and PhysioDoloris\n      monitors to look at measurements of pain. We will compare the measurements from the study\n      devices to the measurements of heart rate and blood pressure.  We hope to enroll about 40\n      subjects in this study at the University of Washington Medical Center."

            "textblock": "The following measurements will be collected during surgery for this research study.\n\n        1. Nociception Level (NoL) index The PMD-100 monitor includes a small probe similar to the\n           pulse oximeter that will be placed on the subjects finger, which will be connected to\n           the laptop placed next to the anesthesia machine.  We will measure and record NoL index\n           values at the following painful events: placement of breathing tube, skin incision,\n           initial surgical instruments insertion and muscle relaxation assessment with a twitch\n           monitor (60mA, 100Hz, 30sec). The anesthesiologist will be blinded to NoL index values\n           that will only be collected for research purposes. We will compare the NoL index to ANI\n           index, BP and HR. The measurements will start 5 minutes prior to the administration of\n           general anesthesia and will continue until 5 min. after initial surgical instruments\n           insertion.\n\n        2. Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) index The PhysioDoloris monitor attached to the IV\n           pole will be connected with a cable to the anesthesia monitor. We will measure and\n           record ANI index values at the following painful events: placement of breathing tube,\n           skin incision, initial surgical instruments insertion and muscle relaxation assessment\n           with a twitch monitor (60mA, 100Hz, 30sec). The anesthesiologist will be blinded to ANI\n           index values that will only be collected for research purposes. The measurements will\n           start 5 minutes prior to the administration of general anesthesia and will continue\n           until 5 min. after initial surgical instruments insertion.\n\n        3. Blood Pressure and Heart Rate We will also collect blood pressure and heart rate\n           measurements that are generated as part of the standard anesthesia monitoring from\n           electronic anesthesia record at 30 second intervals.\n\n        4. Bispectral Index We will also collect Bispectral Index (BIS) measurements that are\n           generated as part of the anesthesia monitoring from electronic anesthesia record at 30\n           second intervals. BIS is a monitor of the depth of anesthesia that uses a sensor placed\n           on patient's forehead.  BIS monitor calculates a dimensionless number estimating the\n           patient's level of consciousness. The BIS values range from 0 (no brain activity) to\n           100 (fully awake) with the target range between 40 and 60 for general anesthesia.\n\n        5. Pain Medication Data: We will collect the amount of pain medications used during the\n           surgery from electronic anesthesia record."
