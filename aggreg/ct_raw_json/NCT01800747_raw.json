The study currently  underway is the DAP-Adults study (a randomised controlled trial\n      that evaluates several antibiotic prescribing strategies, including de delayed prescription\n      in uncomplicated acute respiratory infections in adults in primary care).\n\n      The aim of this study DAP-Pediatrics (randomized, multicenter parallel) to determine the\n      efficacy and safety of delayed prescription of antibiotics compared to direct prescription\n      and non-prescription of antibiotic in  uncomplicated acute respiratory infections in\n      pediatric patients. This 3 arms clinical trial will include 450 children and will evaluate\n      the duration and severity of symptoms, antibiotic consumption, parents' satisfaction, the\n      perceived efficacy of antibiotics and the number of visits  generated. The project also\n      includes a qualitative study, by means of structured interviews, to assess the perception\n      and attitudes of parents towards the different treatment strategies and carry out a full\n      analysis of economic evaluation."
