  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, rater-blinded, 5-arm, parallel-group trial that will test 4
      doses of plovamer acetate against the active comparator Copaxone in subjects with Relapsing
      Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS). The trial will be conducted on an outpatient basis for
      minimum treatment duration of 40 weeks.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, between the ages of 18 and 60 years

          -  Subject is able to learn and self-administer subcutaneous injections (a care-giver
             may be trained to inject the subject)

          -  Subjects must have a current diagnosis of Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis
             (RRMS) (according to the 2010 McDonald MS diagnostic criteria)

          -  Other protocol defined inclusion criteria could apply

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any multiple sclerosis categorized as primary progressive, secondary progressive or
             progressive relapsing

          -  Allergy  to  mannitol,  plovamer acetate,  Copaxone (glatiramer  acetate),  Gd
             contrast  for MRI

          -  Any requirement for continuous  systemic  glucocorticoid  administration  during  the
              trial  period. (Note:  Treatment with interferons such as Avonex®, Rebif®, or
             Betaseron® will be allowed until the baseline visit, as no wash-out period is needed)

          -  Contraindication to Copaxone use

          -  Other protocol defined exclusion criteria could apply
