            "textblock": "Exposure to particulate air pollution is associated with increases in cardiovascular\n      mortality and morbidity. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this observation are\n      emerging, and exposure to particulate air pollution has been shown to result in increases in\n      blood pressure and arterial tone, impaired vascular function and an increased tendency for\n      blood to clot as well as an increase in atherosclerotic plaque burden. Recent evidence from\n      panel studies and controlled exposure studies have suggested an increase in myocardial\n      ischaemia (a reduction in blood flow to the heart) following exposure. In this study we aim\n      to investigate directly myocardial (heart) blood flow following exposure to diesel exhaust\n      (as a model of urban air pollution) using CT/PET myocardial perfusion imaging in male\n      patients with stable coronary disease and healthy male controls. We hypothesize that\n      following exposure to dilute diesel exhaust:\n\n        1. Myocardial blood flow will be reduced\n\n        2. Coronary flow reserve will be impaired\n\n        3. The magnitude of impairment will be higher in patients with coronary disease as\n           compared to healthy controls"
