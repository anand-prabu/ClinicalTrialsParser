Participants are\n      randomized to either a combined therapist guided Internet-CBT for insomnia and depression,\n      or to Internet-CBT for depression with an addition of a placebo intervention for insomnia.\n      The primary purpose is to evaluate changes in insomnia and depression severity for the\n      combination treatment compared to the depression treatment, after treatment and at 6 and 36\n      months follow up. A secondary purpose is to evaluate cognitive functioning before and after\n      treatment, as well as cost effectiveness. Recruitment is done in the Stockholm County\n      through mass media and the Internet psychiatry clinic's regular patient recruitment.\n\n      Trial 2 includes patients with insomnia who do not meet criteria for major or minor\n      depression. All participants start therapist guided Internet-CBT for insomnia. After 4 weeks\n      patients that are judged to be at risk of treatment failure are randomized to either\n      continued treatment or treatment with added support intended to enhance outcome. The primary\n      purpose is to evaluate change in insomnia severity for participants who get added support,\n      compared to continued treatment with regular support level. A secondary purpose is to\n      evaluate cognitive functioning before and after treatment, as well as cost effectiveness.\n      Recruitment is done in the Stockholm County through mass media and the Internet psychiatry\n      clinic's regular patient recruitment."
