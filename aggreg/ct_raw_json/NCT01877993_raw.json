The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of CAS and\n      atrioventricular (AV) block in association with BP level. The investigators will register\n      consecutive patients who underwent coronary angiography with an acetylcholine (Ach)-induced\n      provocation test from November 2004 to May 2012. The investigators exclude from the patients\n      who were taking antihypertensive drugs or who had a documented history of cardiovascular\n      disease in order to avoid the confounding effects of cardiovascular medications on coronary\n      vasomotion. CAS is defined as >70% luminal narrowing on Ach provocation and /or concurrent\n      chest pain. The study population will be divided into quartiles of rising systolic BP and\n      diastolic BP. The incidence of Ach-induced CAS according to each systolic BP/diastolic BP\n      quartile will be evaluated."

Among them, patients with\n      documented cardiovascular disease and/or any other serious medical condition, such as an\n      increased serum creatinine level (>2mg/dl), will be excluded. Patients will be excluded due\n      to incomplete data. The study population will be divided into quartiles based on rising\n      systolic BP, diastolic BP, and pulse pressure. Each group will be defined as following\n      criteria: 1) group 1: systolic BP <117mmHg, diastolic BP <69mmHg, and pulse pressure\n      <42mmHg; 2) group 2: systolic BP 117-130 mmHg, diastolic BP 69-77 mmHg, and pulse pressure\n      42-51mmHg; 3) group 3: systolic BP 131-141 mmHg, diastolic BP 78-86 mmHg, and pulse pressure\n      52-61mmHg; and 4) group 4: systolic BP  >141 mmHg, diastolic BP  >86 mmHg, and pulse\n      pressure >61mmHg. CAS+Chest Pain  means>70% luminal narrowing on Ach provocation test.\n      and/or concurrent typical chest pain. BP was measured with a noninvasive BP monitoring\n      device with the patient lying on the angiographic table after a five-minute rest (Patient\n      monitoring system, NP 30:Philips, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The first reading was\n      discarded, and the mean of the next two consecutive readings was used. Next, coronary\n      angiography was performed. Hypertension is defined as systolic BP \u2265140mmHg and/or diastolic\n      BP \u226590mmHg on at least two consecutive readings in the outpatient clinic. Patients taking\n      antihypertensive medications are also categorized as hypertensives. Other Risk factors for\n      CAS examined in this study include hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level \u2265200mg /dl or\n      current medication with lipid-lowering drugs), diabetes (fasting blood glucose\u2265126mg /dl,\n      and/or glycated Hemoglobin A1c level more than 6.5% or current use of medications), current\n      smoker (active smoking within the past 12 months), and current alcohol user (at least 1\n      alcohol drinking a week)."
