  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During episodes of depression patients with MDD may make sub-optimal decisions based on
      exaggerated negative beliefs about themselves, the future, or the world around them. These
      disruptions in decision-making contribute adversely to quality of life, in both work and
      personal realms. Although effective treatments for depression are available, very little
      work has explored the effects of treatment on how people make decisions.  The specific
      aspects of decision-making that differ between depressed and health control individuals are
      unknown, and whether any changes in these decision-making features occur as a result of
      improvement from depression, or whether medication treatment itself can lead to changes in
      decision-making, even in the absence of clinical improvement.

      In this trial, fifty participants with current major depressive disorder who are not
      receiving an antidepressant medication and fifty healthy controls will complete
      questionnaires and computerized tasks to assess their decision-making styles. There will be
      three visits for depressed patients and two for healthy controls (the first and third
      visits). The first visit will involve interviews and questionnaires to assess the
      participant's level of depression, medical history and quality of life. Participants will
      then complete the decision-making tasks, and will earn between $5-40 based on their choices,
      in order to make the decisions on the computer tasks financially meaningful. At the
      completion of this visit, depressed patients will be prescribed an FDA-approved
      antidepressant, chosen in consultation with the treating psychiatrist. Patients will be
      responsible for paying for the prescription themselves. After two weeks on the medication,
      the patient will be seen for a follow-up visit to ensure tolerability of the medicine. After
      six weeks on the medicine, patients and healthy controls will return to repeat the
      questionnaires and the computer based decision-making tasks, and will again earn between
      $5-40 based on their performance.

      The overall goal of this study will be to identify whether decision-making characteristics
      in people with major depression is affected by treatment, and whether depressed patients
      make decisions differently from healthy controls. A total of 4 decision-making tasks and one
      control task will be administered via computer to eligible subjects.
