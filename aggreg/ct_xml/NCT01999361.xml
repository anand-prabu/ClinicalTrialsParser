      This is a single-center, prospective, open label study in islet transplant recipients after
      complete islet graft rejection/loss, defined as stimulated c-peptide ≤0.3 ng/mL. After
      complete islet graft loss is determined, patient's maintenance immunosuppression (i.e.
      sirolimus and tacrolimus) will be discontinued and they will be placed on Myfortic®
      monotherapy for 2 years thereafter. After completion of two years of Myfortic® maintenance
      monotherapy, it will be weaned and subjects will be monitored over the subsequent twelve
      months, for the appearance of sensitization using panel reactive antibody (PRA) levels.

          2. Ability to provide written informed consent.

          3. Mentally stable and able to comply with the procedures of the study protocol.

          4. Any subject currently prescribed immunosuppressive medications or discontinuation of
             immunosuppressive medications indicated as per current protocol of islet
             transplantation.

          5. History of at least one islet transplant.

          6. Stimulated C-peptide &lt;0.3 ng/ml.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known history of untreated severe hyperlipidemia, obesity, or refractory hypertension

          2. For female participants: Positive pregnancy test or presently breast-feeding.

          3. History of active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, or TB.

          4. Any history of malignancy except for completely resected squamous or basal skin cell
             carcinoma.

          5. Known active alcohol or substance abuse.

          6. Severe co-existing history of cardiac disease, characterized by a history of any one
             of these conditions: recent myocardial infarction (within past 6 months), evidence of
             ischemia on functional cardiac exam within the last year, or left ventricular
             ejection fraction &lt;30%.

          7. History of persistent elevation of liver function tests. SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT),
             alkaline phosphatase or total bilirubin, with values &gt;1.5 times normal upper limits
             will exclude a patient.

          9. Active peptic ulcer disease

         10. History on non-adherence to prescribed regimens including immunosuppression.

         11. PRA ≥ 50% or evidence of significant sensitization to be determined at discretion of
