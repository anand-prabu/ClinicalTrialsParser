            "textblock": "Rationale: Early postsurgical pain is a consequence of tissue trauma during surgery, which\n      can lead to hyperalgesia or allodynia. Adequate management of postsurgical pain leads to\n      earlier mobilization, shortened hospital stay, reduced costs, and increased patient\n      satisfaction. Treatment usually involves the use of opioids, which have many side effects.\n      Besides the problem of acute surgical pain, surgery may lead to the development of\n      persistent postsurgical pain.\n\n      Based on preclinical research, it is hypothesized that \u03949-THC may improve outcomes of early\n      postsurgical pain due to pain modulatory effects and may lower the incidence of persistent\n      postsurgical pain through modulation of central pain processing, e.g. reduction of central\n      sensitization. From clinical studies, evidence for the value of \u03949-THC in this context is,\n      to date, scarce. Indeed, research in a patient group with a major nociceptive load - i.e.\n      major abdominal surgery - and an extended perioperative treatment schedule has not been\n      performed so far. Both a major nociceptive load and an extended perioperative treatment\n      schedule are necessary for adequate assessment of the analgesic efficacy of \u03949-THC in this\n      context. Thus, the question regarding the perioperative analgesic efficacy of \u03949-THC in\n      major abdominal surgery remains unresolved.\n\n      Objectives: The primary aim of this study is to investigate the analgesic effect of\n      perioperatively administered Namisol\u00ae to reduce postsurgical pain on the day of major\n      abdominal surgery and in the first five days after major abdominal surgery. A secondary aim\n      is to investigate the effect of perioperatively administered Namisol\u00ae on the incidence of\n      persistent postsurgical pain in the first 12 postoperative weeks.\n\n      Study design: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study design\n      with an perioperative add-on treatment of Namisol or placebo and a follow-up period of 24\n      weeks.\n\n      Study population: Forty patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinic of the\n      department of surgery of the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center. Patients will have\n      persistent or intermittent abdominal pain, due to underlying intra-abdominal pathology\n      including diverticulitis, Crohn's disease, chronic pancreatitis, ulcerative colitis,\n      endometriosis, or abdominal adhesions. Other intra-abdominal pathology may be included if\n      causing pain and if judged appropriate by the investigator. Patients will be planned to\n      undergo elective, open abdominal surgery with planned use of an epidural catheter for\n      perioperative analgesia. The surgical procedure will have an estimated duration of at least\n      two hours, excluding the time to induce anesthesia.\n\n      Intervention: Namisol\u00ae, a tablet with standardized \u03949-THC content, or identical matching\n      placebos will be administered orally to evaluate the analgesic properties of Namisol\u00ae\n      administered as add-on perioperative treatment. The study medication is given from the day\n      before surgery (day -1: 5 mg in the afternoon and in the evening) up to the fifth day after\n      surgery (day 0 to +5: 5 mg four times daily).\n\n      Primary and secondary study parameters: The primary study outcome is postsurgical pain\n      intensity during the first five postoperative days, reflected by the primary endpoint: the\n      area under the curve of the VAS scores in the first five days (AUC5days) after surgery. The\n      secondary outcome is the incidence of persistent postsurgical pain 12 weeks after surgery.\n\n      Other study parameters: In addition to the primary and secondary outcomes, several other\n      outcome parameters will be collected. These include measures of postsurgical pain intensity\n      at 24 weeks after surgery, measures of analgesic efficacy (postoperative consumption of\n      other analgesics), central nervous system processing and sensitization in the first 5 days\n      and after 6 and 12 weeks after surgery (QST, Von Frey testing, and brush stroke testing),\n      postoperative sedation level (Ramsay Scale), and immune system response during 72 hours\n      after surgery and after 6 weeks (ILs, MMPs) are investigated. In addition, questionnaires\n      are filled out to examine parameters related to side effects and postoperative recovery (VAS\n      Bond&Lader, VAS Bowdle, HADS, SF-36, PCS, PASS, QoR-40, AppLe, and TSQM). Two variants in\n      genetic CYP2C9 polymorphisms will be genotyped and three variants in genetic CYP2C19\n      polymorphisms will be genotyped.\n\n      Nature and extent of the burdens, risks, and benefits: Participation means three or four\n      visits to the outpatient clinic in addition to usual care, including the screening visit.\n      Various measurements, including blood samples (seven additional samples over the entire\n      study period), will be conducted during each visit. The participating patients may\n      experience better pain relief in the postoperative period and may benefit from a reduced\n      incidence of persistent postsurgical pain, but are subject to more intense diagnostics and\n      observation."
