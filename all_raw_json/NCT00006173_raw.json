The current diagnostic work-up of RVH involves a complex\n      algorithm which includes doppler ultrasound, captopril renography and conventional\n      angiography.  Because of the expense, risk and inconvenience of this workup, patients may\n      not be correctly diagnosed.\n\n      Advances in MR technology present the opportunity to develop a single comprehensive test.\n      This would combine an MR angiogram that provides anatomic information about the renal\n      arteries, and an MR renogram that provides information about the functional impact of a\n      stenosis as a cause of hypertension.  Our main purpose is to test MR renography with and\n      without an oral angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) combined with MR angiography\n      against the reference standard of captopril radionuclide renography.  Secondary goals of\n      this study are to test whether hypoxia within ischemic kidneys affected by RVH is detectable\n      by T2 weighted (Blood oxygen level dependent or BOLD) MRI.  This is considered of value\n      since such a test of oxygenation would further shorten and simplify the diagnostic MR test.\n      Information gained from this study could lead to important changes in the diagnostic and\n      pathophysiologic understanding of RVH."

Severe anemia may predispose to hypotension\n        after captopril.\n\n        Patients with hyperkalemia (plasma potassium:  above 5.0 mmol/L), because of the risk of\n        arrhythmia.\n\n        Clinically unstable patients and those unable to tolerate a 1-2 hour MR study.  Examples\n        of medical conditions that would lead to exclusion include unstable angina, dyspnea at\n        rest, severe pain at rest, or severe back pain.\n\n        Pregnancy.\n\n        Nursing mothers.\n\n        Subjects who are claustrophobic and are unable to tolerate MR imaging.\n\n        Patients with a serum creatinine concentration above 4mg/dl.\n\n        Bilateral renal stents.\n\n        Healthy subjects must not have an abnormality detected on dipstick urinalysis, or a\n        systolic BP above 140 mmHg or a diastolic BP above 90 mmHg on screening examination or an\n        abnormal BUN or creatinine level in the blood."
