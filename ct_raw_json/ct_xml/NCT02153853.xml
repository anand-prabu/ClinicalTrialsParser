  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is on the rise in the Western population and BMI has been shown to be associated
      with an increased risk of per- and postoperative complications.

      The investigators intend to study a population of more than 300 patients undergoing
      laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer.

      The investigators main outcome measure will be the conversion rate, and the investigators
      also intend to study other indications of short term complications, such as peroperative
      bleeding, infection, re-operation and mortality.

      The investigators hypothesise that increased BMI does not increase the risk of conversion.
