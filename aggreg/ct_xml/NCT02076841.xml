      The primary objective of this study is to  assess the overall change in injection site
      tolerability from treatment switch to intramuscular interferon beta 1a Autoinjector (Avonex
      Pen) at baseline to Month 4 measured on a composite visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from
      0-100.  The secondary objectives of this study are to assess the following:  Overall change
      in injection site tolerability from treatment switch (baseline) to Month 12 measured on a
      composite VAS ranging from 0-100; Change in systemic tolerability (systemic adverse events)
      assessed on VAS (0-100) from treatment switch to Month 4 and 12; Percentage of patients on
      Avonex treatment after 4 and 12 months; Treatment satisfaction on VAS (0-100) at Month 12;
      Changes in Quality of Live (QoL) (SF-36) and Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive functions
      (FSMC) from treatment switch to Month 12, adherence (drug accountability).
