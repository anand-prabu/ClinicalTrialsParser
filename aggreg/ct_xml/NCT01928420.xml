  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent epidemiologic evidence, has suggested that diabetes mellitus significantly increases
      risk for the development of Alzheimer's disease, independent of vascular risk factors.
      Moreover, even patients who are simply insulin resistant, without frank diabetes, have been
      shown to share this elevated risk for the development of AD. As insulin's role as a
      neuromodulator in the brain has been revealed, several potential mechanisms for the
      interaction of diabetes or insulin resistance with AD have been suggested such as decreased
      cortical glucose utilization particularly in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex;
      increased oxidative stress through the formation of advanced glycation end products;
      increased Tau phosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangle formation; and increased
      beta-amyloid aggregation through inhibition of insulin-degrading enzyme. The future
      treatment of AD might involve pharmacologic and dietary manipulations of insulin and glucose
      regulation

      NIC5-15 is a single, small, naturally occurring molecule. Animal studies and some human
      trials have shown NIC5-15 to be safe and a potent insulin sensitizer at doses equivalent to
      800-2000mg per day. In preclinical studies at doses higher than those previously studied in
      clinical trials, we found that NIC5-15 interferes with the accumulation of beta amyloid, an
      important step in the development of Alzheimer's pathology. These data suggest that NIC5-15
      may be a reasonable therapeutic agent for the treatment of Alzheimer Disease for two
      reasons:

      It is a -secretase inhibitor that is Notch-sparing. It is potentially an insulin-sensitizer.

      However critical safety and human efficacy studies must be conducted. This application
      proposes to conduct these early critical human studies. The goal of the studies contained in
      this proposal is to establish safety and efficacy of NIC5-15 for the treatment of AD. The
      specific objectives of this study are to:

      Specific Objective #1) Conduct a multiple dose safety study of NIC5-15 to establish safety
      in the doses that appear to block amyloid accumulation. These studies will characterize the
      safety profile, pharmacokinetics, and tolerability

      This objective was met with completion of the initial study ID#NCT00470418.

      The current study continues investigations of  NIC5-15 in Alzheimer's disease with the
      following objective:

      Specific Objective #2) Conduct a double blind placebo controlled pilot efficacy study of
      NIC5-15 in patients with AD. The goals of this study are to:

      A) Demonstrate feasibility for a multi-site trial that will be used to guide the design of a
      future larger effort. Demonstration of feasibility will include examination of accrual rate,
      overall recruitment, adherence to protocol, compliance with medication and willingness to
      complete a randomized trial, and lack of short term toxicity.

      B) Collect preliminary evidence of efficacy in terms of cognitive and global measures as
      well as secondary efficacy outcomes of activities of daily living, behavioral disturbances
      and AD biomarkers.

    <description>A systematic method for assessing clinically significant change in a clinical trial as viewed by an independent skilled and experienced clinician .  The ADCS-CGIC focuses on clinician's observations of change in the subject's cognitive, functional, and behavioral performance since the beginning of a trial.  It relies on both direct examination of the subject and an interview of an informant.  Unlike a targeted symptom scale, it takes into account a subject's overall function in the cognitive, behavioral, and functional activity domains.</description>

    <description>ADCS-ADL assesses functional performance in subjects with Alzheimer's disease.  In a structured interview format, informants are queried as to whether subjects attempted each item in the inventory during the prior 4 weeks and their level of performance.  The ADCS-ADL scale discriminates well between normal controls and mild AD patients.  It has good test-retest reliability.  The ADCS-ADL includes some items from traditional basic ADL scales (e.g., grooming, dressing, walking, bathing, feeding, toileting) as well as items from instrumental activities of daily living scales (e.g., shopping, preparing meals, using household appliances, keeping appointments, reading).</description>
