Continuous femoral nerve block has been used to enhance post op pain relief\n      (POPR) for TKR but at the expense of motor blockade  . A Sub sartorial approach to saphenous\n      nerve block (SNB) spares the motor block . To date the role of saphenous nerve block for\n      POPR in TKR has not been evaluated.\n\n      Methodology:\n\n      In order to test this hypothesis, we proposed to carry out a prospective randomized\n      controlled double blinded (surgeon and assessor) trial study. With institutional ethics\n      approval and having obtained written informed consent from each patient, 20 ASA 1 - 3\n      patients scheduled to undergo TKR under spinal anesthesia +/- sedation were allocated to one\n      of two groups i.e. Group (SNB): patients receiving SNB sub sartorial approach and Group\n      (NSNB): patients not receiving SNB.\n\n      Group allocation was determined using computer generated random number tables. Sealed\n      envelopes were opened on the day of the surgery by the attending anesthetist responsible for\n      the care of the recruited patient.\n\n      Postoperative period:\n\n      Patients were then assessed for pain at rest and on movement on arrival in recovery and then\n      at 6 , 12 and 24 hrs. Visual analogue scale on a 10 cm straight line was used to assess\n      postoperative pain scores as predictive value of post operative analgesia on rest and\n      movement i.e passive flexion of knee to 30 degree . Patients were assessed for any motor\n      block by using maximum tolerable range of active knee flexion (MKF) and maximum range of\n      straight leg raise(MSLR) on arrival in recovery and at 6, 12 and 24 hrs. All patients\n      received regular paracetamol 1g 6 hourly, diclofenac 75 mg 12 hourly, oxycontin 10-20 mg (\n      depending on age) 12 hourly and oxynorm 10 mg as rescue analgesia."
