      The study objectives are to assess the safety and clinical performance of the CoreValve™
      Evolut R™ System in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who are considered at
      high through extreme risk for surgical aortic valve replacement.   These objectives will be
      accomplished by a prospective clinical study involving up to 60 implanted subjects among up
      to six study centers.

             or maximal aortic valve velocity &gt; 4.0 m/sec by resting echocardiogram.

          2. Estimated 30 day mortality risk of &gt; 15% by study center Heart Team assessment,33 OR
             at least two cardiovascular surgeons from the study center deny surgery because of
             prohibitive operative risk, estimated to be a combined &gt;50% risk of irreversible
             mortality or morbidity.

          3. Symptoms of aortic stenosis, and NYHA Functional Class II or greater.

          4. The subject meets the legal minimum age to provide informed consent based on local
