  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is a chronic acquired disease characterized by well defined white macules and
      patches affecting the skin. There are many treatment modalities available for vitiligo,
      however, none of them cure the disease. Visible red light has been shown to stimulates
      melanocyte migration and proliferation resulting in repigmentation of vitiligo patches.
      However, there are only a few studies published on the efficacy of red light in vitiligo.
      This is a prospective single-blind randomized clinical trial to assess efficacy of red light
      in the treatment of vitiligo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is a chronic acquired disease characterized by well defined white macules and
      patches affecting the skin and mucous membranes. Mucocutaneous lesions develop secondary to
      selective destruction of melanocytes. The etiology of vitiligo is largely unknown but more
      likely to be multifactorial. There are several theories on the pathogenesis of vitiligo
      including mainly the autoimmune, neurohormonal, and autocytotoxic theories. The autoimmune
      hypothesis has the strongest evidence with alteration mainly in the cellular immune
      response.

      There are many treatment modalities available for vitiligo, however, none of them cure the
      disease. These include different topical treatments, phototherapy, surgical therapy, and
      depigmentation therapy. Visible red light has been shown to stimulates melanocyte migration
      and proliferation resulting in repigmentation of vitiligo patches. However, there are only a
      few studies published on the efficacy of red light in vitiligo. The investigators plan on
      conducting a prospective single-blind randomized clinical trial to assess efficacy of red
      light in the treatment of vitiligo.

      Study Objective To evaluate the potential for red light to induce repigmentation within
      vitiligo patches.

    <description>Patients with a vitiligo patch larger than 25cm2 will be recruited. The target patch will be divided into four quadrants. Two opposite quadrants will be shielded by foil and served as control, the third quadrant will be exposed to low intensity red laser (at 3 J/cm¬2), and the fourth quadrant will be exposed to high intensity red light (at 37 J/cm¬2).
Treatments will be given twice weekly for 10 weeks. This will be followed by assessments at 4, 8, and 12 weeks post treatment.</description>
