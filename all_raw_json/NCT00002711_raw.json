Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy and radiation\n      therapy in treating patients with cancer of the esophagus."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the maximum tolerated dose and recommend a phase II dose for\n      paclitaxel (TAX) when administered as a 96-hour intravenous infusion with a weekly fixed\n      dose of intravenous cisplatin (CDDP) during concurrent radiotherapy for patients with\n      localized esophageal cancer. II. Estimate the response rate of patients treated with 2\n      courses of TAX/CDDP induction chemotherapy and the complete response rate of patients\n      treated with TAX/CDDP and concurrent radiotherapy. III. Describe the toxic effects of\n      TAX/CDDP prior to and during radiotherapy. IV. Describe the pharmacokinetics of TAX as a\n      continuous infusion (CI) over 96 hours. V. Evaluate, by flow cytometry, the ability of CI\n      TAX to block esophageal cancer cells in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle.\n\n      OUTLINE: After the MTD of TAX is reached on Part A, new patients are entered on Part B. The\n      following acronyms are used: CDDP Cisplatin, NSC-119875 EBRT External-beam radiotherapy TAX\n      Paclitaxel (Bristol-Myers), NSC-125973 PART A: Radiotherapy plus 2-Drug Combination\n      Chemotherapy. EBRT using megavoltage equipment (>/= 10 MV recommended; electron boost\n      allowed for subclavicular fossae); plus TAX/CDDP. PART B: 2-Drug Combination Induction\n      Chemotherapy followed by Radiotherapy plus 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. TAX/CDDP;\n      followed by EBRT as in Part A; plus TAX/CDDP.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 3 patients/dose will be entered on Part A (up to 24 patients)\n      and 3-6 patients on Part B."
