  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to assess the effects of lisdexamfetamine (trademark name: Vyvanse; LDX) on
      executive function and prefrontal cortex activation in menopausal women ages 45-57, who
      report subjective cognitive difficulties. This protocol will recruit women from Dr.
      Epperson's ongoing study, Protocol #812470, to examine the impact of LDX on brain activation
      during performance of cognitive tasks specifically probing prefrontal cortex function.

    <description>To assess the effects of LDX on gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate levels as well as brain activation patterns in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of menopausal aged women during tasks that utilize working memory and sustained attention. Cognitive domains such as attention, concentration, organization, planning, working memory, initiation of appropriate actions and inhibition of inappropriate actions are considered executive functions. This study will assess the extent to which GABA levels and brain activation patterns in menopausal women differ when treated with LDX versus placebo. We will consider these findings in light of the literature regarding stimulant treatment effects on brain activation in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</description>
