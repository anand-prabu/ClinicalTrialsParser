Only 50% of\n      patients are discharged from the hospital within the first month after GCSE. Recent\n      Guidelines from Experts highlight the necessity to improve the efficiency of the first line\n      anti-epileptic (AE) therapy.\n\n      Intravenous Sodium Valproate (SV) might be an adjuvant AE drug to the recommended first line\n      AEs. Intravenous SV is available, well tolerated and easily injectible but also has\n      pharmacologic properties for reducing the risk of seizures relapses and for being\n      neuroprotective. However, efficacy of intravenous as an adjuvant therapy in GCSE has never\n      been properly assessed.\n\n      Primary Purpose The primary purpose is to assess if the association of intravenous Sodium\n      Valproate with the recommended treatment for Generalized Convulsive Status Epilepticus\n      increases to 20 % the number of living patients, discharged from the hospital at day 15."
