  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine how different meal patterns influence the
      absorption of beneficial plant pigments (carotenoids) from vegetables.  The hypothesis is
      that carotenoid absorption will be lower when daily vegetables are consumed in one meal
      compared two smaller meals throughout the day.
