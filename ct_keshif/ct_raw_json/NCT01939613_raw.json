The main controversy between the two formulae also\n      focuses on whether to infuse the colloid in the first 24 h.Controversy continues and the\n      conflicting results left many clinicians unsure about the effect of colloids on fluid\n      resuscitation in extensive burn patients who suffer higher risk of hypovolaemia, abdominal\n      compartment syndrome (ACS), multiple organs dysfunction and mortality. To address this\n      uncertainty, we conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial to compare\n      fluid resuscitation in extensive burns guided by Parkland formulae with TMMU formulae as a\n      modified Evans formula routinely used in China."
