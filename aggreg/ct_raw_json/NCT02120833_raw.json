All participants' skin will be examined by a\n      dermatologist to determine if they have atopic dermatitis and have an active mild to\n      moderate eczema wound.  Participant's parents/guardians will be asked a few questions to\n      determine if their child qualifies for the study.\n\n      Then all participants' caregivers will complete a questionnaire at the beginning of the\n      study.  The child's skin will be examined to rate the level of their eczema and a trained\n      examiner will grade the looks and symptoms of their eczema. All parents or guardians will be\n      instructed how to apply the test product and how to record usage on a diary card and then\n      apply the test product.  The test product will be applied at least 2 times per day or more\n      as needed on all body areas, including the face affected throughout the study.\n\n      One digital picture will be taken of one eczema wound.  Another digital picture will be\n      taken of the area around this wound. These pictures will be taken on Day 0 (Baseline), Day\n      3, and Day 14.\n\n      Once product is applied the skin will be examined for any adverse events and all\n      participants' caregivers will complete a questionnaire on study day 1, 3, 7 and 14."

No product should be applied within 4 hours of a\n      site visit.  These treatments will be used in place of the participant's current\n      moisturizers and/or emollients.\n\n      Diaries will be completed by the participants' caregivers each day, beginning upon\n      initiation of therapy and continuing until trial completion/discontinuation, and will\n      include information on product application and use of rescue medication.\n\n      All participants will visit the clinical site for assessments at baseline (Day 0) and on\n      Days 1, 2, 3, 7 and 14.  Clinical assessments include the Eczema Area and Severity index\n      (EASI) and Investigator's Global Atopic Dermatitis Assessment (IGADA).  Instrumental\n      assessment of hydration will be done using a Corneometer (Courage & Khazaka, Germany).\n      Caregivers will also complete a questionnaire to assess product experience.  The final visit\n      will occur on Day 14 or on the day of participant withdrawal from the trial."
