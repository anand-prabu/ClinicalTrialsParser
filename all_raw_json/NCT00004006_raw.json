Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Bone marrow transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy\n      drugs and kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus\n      radiation therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation in treating patients who have\n      retinoblastoma."

Beginning on\n      week 6, patients receive concurrent radiotherapy 5 days a week over 4-6 weeks. Patients with\n      meningeal involvement receive topotecan intrathecally twice weekly for 3 weeks and then\n      weekly for 3 weeks before starting radiotherapy. Beginning one day after each treatment\n      course, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily for 10 days.\n\n      Patients undergo bone marrow collection before or after week 6. Following hematologic\n      recovery, patients receive several days of high dose chemotherapy consisting of\n      cyclophosphamide and topotecan followed by bone marrow reinfusion.\n\n      Patients are followed at 6, 9, and 12 months, and then every 6 months for 4 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study."
