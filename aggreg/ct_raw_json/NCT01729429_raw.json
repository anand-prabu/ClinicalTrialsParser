            "textblock": "The primary research goal is to implement and evaluate evidence-based intervention\n      strategies targeted to adolescent girls and their parents that stimulate patient demand for\n      the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and compliment provider-directed strategies already\n      employed by Parkland clinics.\n\n      The project has three specific aims:\n\n        -  Aim 1. Determine if a mailed packet with a reminder and educational material delivered\n           prior to clinic visit, increases 1 dose coverage of the HPV vaccine series.\n\n        -  Aim 2. Determine if a telephone recall delivered 2 weeks after the clinic visit,\n           increases 1 dose coverage among patients who decline the vaccine during the clinic\n           visit.\n\n        -  Aim 3. Determine if telephone recalls to those who miss appointments for 2nd or 3rd\n           doses of the HPV vaccine series, increase 3 dose coverage of the series.\n\n      Phase 1 - Cognitive interviews: To ensure the usability and cultural appropriateness of all\n      project materials, investigators will conduct 40 in-person, cognitive interviews with\n      parents of female patients ages 11-18 attending Parkland clinics.\n\n      Phase 2 - Randomized controlled trial. Investigators will select and invite 1200 families\n      whose daughter has an upcoming appointment at one of four Parkland clinic sites. Eligible\n      patients will be randomized to either the Intervention group or the General Adolescent\n      Vaccine Brochure group.  The Intervention group participants will be mailed a packet\n      containing an invitation letter to join the study and HPV vaccine-specific educational\n      materials; General Adolescent Vaccine Brochure group participants will be mailed a packet\n      with educational materials on all four of the recommended adolescent vaccines (HPV,\n      meningococcal, TDAP, and influenza). A few days after the packet has been sent, a research\n      assistant will call participants to verify that the letter was received and assess interest\n      in completing a pre-clinic visit survey.\n\n      Participants who agree to fill out the in-clinic survey will be asked to come to their\n      clinic appointment 40 minutes early to obtain verbal informed consent from the parent and\n      verbal assent from the adolescent female patient. Then, the parent will complete a 20-30\n      minute survey about the HPV vaccine and interactions with their daughter's provider. The\n      daughter will complete a short survey that asks about use of social media and health\n      concerns.\n\n      Intervention group participants who complete the in-clinic survey are also eligible to\n      receive telephone recalls and reminders.  If the Intervention group parent refused the\n      vaccine during the initial clinic visit, a telephone recall will be delivered after 2 weeks\n      offering to schedule an immunization-only appointment. If the Intervention group participant\n      misses the 2nd and/or 3rd doses, telephone reminders will be delivered. For participants who\n      complete the in-clinic survey and are randomized to the General Adolescent Vaccine Brochure\n      group, parents who refused will be contacted after 2 weeks to assess attitudes and\n      intentions toward the HPV vaccine.\n\n      Participants in both the Intervention and General Adolescent Vaccine Brochure group will\n      have their medical record reviewed to assess HPV vaccine outcomes, receipt of the other\n      three recommended adolescent vaccines, and contact with the clinic during the 12 months\n      following randomization."
