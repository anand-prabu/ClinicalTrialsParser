This study involves patients who have received at least 60 weeks of anti-HIV\n      therapy, either alone or in combination with IL-2, while enrolled in ACTG 328.\n\n      Remune is an experimental HIV vaccine. To see how the body's immune system reacts, this\n      vaccine will be given with 1 to 3 other vaccines, and skin tests will monitor the body's\n      reaction."

            "textblock": "Proliferative responses to HIV antigens are either absent or of small magnitude in\n      HIV-infected patients, even in the early stages of infection when vigorous proliferative\n      responses to recall antigens are still seen.  Remune consists of an inactivated,\n      gp120-depleted virus intended to stimulate HIV-specific immune responses.  Remune has been\n      reported to increase lymphocyte proliferative responses to HIV antigens in patients with\n      high CD4 cell counts.  Many other T-cell-dependent responses are also impaired in\n      HIV-infected patients, such as after vaccination with hepatitis A or B vaccine. In this\n      study, patients with moderately advanced HIV disease who have already received 52 weeks of\n      either HAART or HAART plus IL-2 are vaccinated with Remune and a control recall immunogen,\n      tetanus toxoid (TT), to evaluate whether these patients can develop new CD4 T-cell and CD8\n      T-cell responses to HIV-related antigens.  The antibody response to hepatitis A and\n      hepatitis B vaccinations also will be explored.\n\n      Fifty patients are enrolled in this substudy; 17 from the HAART only arm (Arm I of ACTG 328)\n      and 33 from the HAART plus either CIV or subcutaneous IL-2 arms (Arms II and III of ACTG\n      328).  All patients are vaccinated 3 times with Remune and twice with TT.  If patients are\n      hepatitis A total antibody negative, they receive hepatitis A vaccine twice.  Additionally,\n      if patients are hepatitis B surface antigen negative, hepatitis B core antibody and surface\n      antibody negative, they receive hepatitis B vaccine 3 times.  Patients who are negative for\n      all hepatitis markers receive hepatitis A and B vaccines.\n\n      Week 0 of A5046s begins at or after Week 64 of ACTG 328 (for patients in the HAART-only arm)\n      or 4 weeks after the initiation of the seventh or any subsequent IL-2 cycle of ACTG 328 (for\n      patients in any of the IL-2-containing arms).  [AS PER AMENDMENT 9/16/99: Patients can be\n      screened through Week 124 of ACTG 328.] Patients receive Remune at Weeks 0, 8, and 16 and TT\n      at Weeks 0 and 8.  Hepatitis A and/or B vaccines are also given at these times, if\n      indicated.  Blood and skin tests are performed at Weeks 0, 8, 16, and 24 to measure immune\n      response and lymphocyte proliferative responses."
