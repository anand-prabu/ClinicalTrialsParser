            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to advance knowledge of neurocognitive outcomes in pediatric\n      traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients by exploring the relationships between physiologic\n      factors of cerebral vasospasm, apolipoprotein E (apo-E) allele, biomarkers, and\n      neurocognitive outcomes. This study is a funded project within Duke University School of\n      Nursing National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Nursing Research (NIH/NINR) P30\n      Center of Excellence Grant. This study will continue on with some of the work of a small\n      intramural grant study determining the feasibility of conducting pediatric TBI research at\n      DUHS. It will advance the measurement of vasospasm by translating the use of the\n      Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound to neuromonitoring in children. To date, this will be\n      the first pediatric study examining the relationship of cerebral vasospasm, apo-E, and\n      biomarkers with neurocognitive outcomes. Unlike adult TBI patients, cerebral vasospasm,\n      apo-E, and biomarker collections have yet to be examined in pediatric neurotrauma patients\n      in the Duke University Health System. Although neurocognitive outcomes are a standard of\n      care for TBI patients at Duke University Health System (DUHS), the data has yet to be\n      examined within the realm of pediatric neurodiagnostic physiologic measures. By obtaining\n      preliminary data in 35 patients, it will allow for the evaluation of multi-diagnostic\n      measures in pediatric TBI patients, as well as provide data for future funding for a larger\n      regionally-scale study."
