            "textblock": "Thoracoscopic bullectomy for primary spontaneous pneumothorax is relatively simple and short\n      procedure compared to other thoracic surgery. However, in the anesthetic preparation,\n      complicated technique and procedures are needed including a double lumen endotracheal\n      intubation, auscultation, and flexible bronchoscopic confirmation of the tube location, even\n      during lateral decubitus position. The double lumen endotracheal tube has a bigger outer\n      diameter. And postoperative sore throat and voice change can develop after the intubation\n      procedure.\n\n      Recently, single lumen intubation using carbon dioxide gas instillation under general\n      anesthesia during thoracoscopic surgery is reported. However, if safety and efficacy are\n      warranted, thoracoscopic surgery using nonintubated and self-ventilated anesthesia will be a\n      best solution for above mentioned postoperative discomforts.\n\n      Investigators designed the comparative study of nonintubated local anesthesia under sedation\n      and intubated general anesthesia in thoracoscopic bullectomy through the single port.\n      Investigators will investigate postoperative pain, sore throat, voice change, nausea,\n      vomiting, and intraoperative arterial blood gas analysis.\n\n      This study will be performed at Korea University Ansan Hospital. A total of 40 patients will\n      be enrolled (20 patients in each arm)."
