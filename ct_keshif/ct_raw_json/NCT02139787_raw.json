Participants in the\n      Intervention condition listened to the \"radio stories\" and the participants in the control\n      condition listened to an audio brochure with relevant health information. We hypothesized\n      that the intervention participants would report higher intentions to engage in various\n      healthful lifestyle behaviors than the control participants after both participants listened\n      to their respective health information."

To test the stories, we are conducting a two-arm trial that includes\n      146 participants (obesity: 68, hypertension: 78; 44 Hmong, 49 Latino, and 53 Somali\n      participants).  Effectiveness and acceptability of the program will be tested with pre-and\n      post questionnaires.\n\n      Anticipated Results: Higher rates of satisfaction, increased knowledge, and increased\n      intention to change healthful lifestyle behaviors in participants receiving the radio\n      stories, as compared to control group participants, will indicate radio story program\n      effectiveness and acceptability."
