Lifestyle modification therapy alone is ineffective for\n      most adolescents with severe obesity and few patients qualify for bariatric surgery.  Many\n      patients would likely benefit from pharmacotherapy but only one medication (orlistat) is\n      approved for use in adolescents but notable side effects and limited efficacy impede its\n      clinical use.  Topiramate, a medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\n      for the treatment of seizures in adults and children, is associated with weight loss.\n      Although not FDA approved for the treatment of obesity, studies in obese adults have\n      demonstrated weight reduction of approximately 5% with 6-12 months of therapy.  However, the\n      weight loss effect of topiramate has never been evaluated among children and adolescents.\n      Therefore, the goal of this pilot study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 24 weeks\n      of topiramate therapy with a 4-week run-in of meal replacement therapy in adolescents with\n      severe obesity.\n\n      This will be a 28-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot clinical trial\n      of meal replacement therapy (4 weeks) followed by topiramate (24 weeks) vs. meal replacement\n      therapy (4 weeks) followed by placebo (24 weeks) for BMI reduction and cardiometabolic risk\n      factor improvement in 36 adolescents (ages 12-17 years old) with severe obesity.  Monthly\n      lifestyle modification/behavioral counseling will be delivered by trained study coordinators\n      to patients in both groups.  The lifestyle modification education materials will be given to\n      patients and selected sections will be discussed at each monthly contact (five face-to-face\n      sessions and three phone sessions).\n\n      The primary object is to evaluate the effect of meal replacement therapy followed by\n      topiramate vs. meal replacement therapy followed by placebo on percent change in BMI among\n      adolescents with severe obesity.  The primary hypothesis is that 4 weeks of meal replacement\n      therapy followed by 24 weeks of topiramate will have a larger average percent decline in BMI\n      between baseline and 28 weeks compared to meal replacement therapy followed by placebo.\n\n      The secondary objective is to characterize the safety profile of topiramate for the\n      treatment of adolescent obesity, evaluate the effects of meal replacement therapy followed\n      by topiramate vs. meal replacement therapy followed by placebo on risk factors for CVD and\n      T2DM, and evaluate response to topiramate treatment based on baseline eating behavior\n      phenotype in adolescents with severe obesity.  The secondary hypothesis is that 4 weeks of\n      meal replacement therapy followed by 24 weeks of topiramate will significantly reduce\n      average absolute BMI, absolute and percent body weight, percent total body and visceral fat,\n      systolic blood pressure, fasting triglycerides and insulin, compared to meal replacement\n      therapy followed by placebo, and that the presence of binge eating disorder characteristics\n      at baseline will be associated with greater reduction in BMI with topiramate treatment."
