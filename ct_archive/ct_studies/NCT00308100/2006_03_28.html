<td colspan="2" class="bigdent">
<p>End-stage liver disease is one of major causes leading to death. With advancement of transplantation surgery and perioperative anesthesia management, liver transplantation has become an effective method to recover patients&rsquo; liver function, thus save their lives and improve their quality of life. Serious disorders of fluid balance, such as blood coagulation dysfunction, electrolyte disequilibrium, hypoalbuminaemia, hypohematocrit, hypohemoglobin and acid-base imbalance etc exist in end stage cirrhosis patients with liver transplantation. Such abnormalities in internal milieu could cause or worsen cardiovascular and pulmonary dysfunction, thus makes the perioperative management more difficult.<br>
<br>Albumin and blood plasma are conventionally used as plasma volume expanders in clinical practice. At the same time, the level of albumin concentration is also used as an important criterion of prognosis. When the level of albumin concentration in serum is below 35g/L, postoperative mortality rates and complications will be increasing significantly. In fact, it has been the focus of debate for many years whether albumin should be used for volume replacement in critically ill patients. Boldt and his colleagues demonstrated that albumin has little positive influence on the prognosis of critically ill patients. However, Shwe deemed albumin beneficial to critically ill patients. Simon suggested that albumin is given mainly for treating hypovolemia instead of increasing the level of albumin concentration in serum. However, at the same time, he admitted there is no advantages of albumin in comparison to other colloid solutions and, furthermore, it is more expensive.<br>
<br>Voluven (130/0.4) is a medium molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch (HES) produced by Beijing Fresenius Kabi Pharmaceutical Co.,Ltd, a novel HES preparation with optimized molecular weight and molecule distribution, a lower degree of substitution (DS) (0.4), and a narrower molecular distribution profile (C2/C6) than other available HES specifications make it more suitable for volume replacement therapy.
