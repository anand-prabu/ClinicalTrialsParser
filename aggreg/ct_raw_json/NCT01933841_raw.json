Physiological data suggest that PORC impairs\n      normal respiratory function, and compelling evidence suggests PORC impairs clinical recovery\n      in the immediate postoperative period and prolongs PACU length of stay. However, despite the\n      widespread use of NMBDs and the frequent occurrence of PORC, limitations in the literature\n      prevent an understanding of their full impact on clinical outcomes. This study will collect\n      data about patients who receive NMBDs and examine the impact of monitoring on incidences of\n      PORC.\n\n      The incidence of PORC and postoperative complications after the introduction of monitoring\n      in the PACU will be determined by measuring TOF ratios and tracking the postoperative\n      outcomes in the surgical patients over time."
