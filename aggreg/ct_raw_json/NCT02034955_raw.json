These\n      patients will be asked to complete toxicity scores and a quality of life questionnaire at\n      the start and completion of treatment, and at 3 months 1, 2 and 5 years from the start of\n      radiotherapy. These results will be used to determine the feasibility of the proposed\n      approach, and obtain early estimates of improvements in uncertainty margin requirements for\n      this population of patients."
