Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y\n      90 anti-CEA monoclonal antibody MN-14 in patients with relapsed or refractory non-small cell\n      lung cancer. II. Determine the dosimetric and pharmacokinetic properties of this treatment\n      regimen in the blood, normal organs, and tumors of these patients. III. Determine the\n      stability and complexation with circulating carcinoembryonic antigen of this radioantibody\n      in the plasma of these patients. IV. Determine the antibody response of these patients with\n      this treatment regimen. V. Determine the antitumor effects of this treatment regimen in\n      these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of yttrium Y 90 anti-CEA monoclonal antibody MN-14\n      (90Y-hMN-14). Patients undergo pretherapy imaging with indium In 111 anti-CEA monoclonal\n      antibody MN-14 IV over 30-40 minutes on day -7 or -6, followed by external scintigraphy on\n      days -7 or -6 to 0. Patients who show positive localization of at least one documented tumor\n      site receive 90Y-hMN-14 IV over 30-40 minutes on day 0. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive\n      escalating doses of 90Y-hMN-14 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD\n      is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting\n      toxicity. Patients are followed at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks; every 3 months for 2 years; and\n      then every 6 months for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
