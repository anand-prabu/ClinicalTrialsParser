The major symptom\n      is snoring or noisy breathing. Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) is a wide spectrum of\n      disorders that includes primary snoring, UARS and OSA. The main etiology for SDB in children\n      is enlarged tonsils and adenoids and therefore the first line of treatment in pediatric SDB\n      is adenotonsillectomy.\n\n      The objectives of this study are:\n\n        1. To investigate the natural history of primary snoring\n\n        2. To investigate the effect of seasonality on SDB severity\n\n        3. To compare the effect of adenoidectomy to adenotonsillectomy in the treatment of SDB in\n           children\n\n        4. To characterize the children referred for repeated PSG following adenoidectomy or\n           adenotonsillectomy and the indications for second PSG evaluation."
