      The research is aimed at developing and testing a new method of visual-motor rehabilitation
      of veterans with macular degeneration by using inexpensive &quot;tablet&quot; computers at home.

    <textblock>
      The research objective is to test the hypothesis that practicing eye-hand coordination using
      tablet-computers can improve manual skills of those with Age-related Macular Degeneration
      (AMD).  AMD causes the loss of sharp central vision used for reading and many other everyday
      activities.  Those with AMD experience a &quot;macular scotoma&quot;, a blanked-out area of whatever
      they're attempting to look at, and they must use an area of peripheral vision, the
      &quot;Preferred Retinal Locus (PRL)&quot; to look at objects of interest.  The PRL does not provide
      sharp vision, causing deficits in eye-hand coordination needed for manual tasks.  There have
      been few studies of visuo-motor rehabilitation training for deficits caused by macular
      scotomas.  However, a recent study demonstrated that visuo-motor eye movement training
      dramatically improved reading ability of subjects with AMD.  In addition, it has been shown
      that playing action video games can improve certain visual skills.  Thus, a small but
      growing body of research suggests that it may be possible to ameliorate manual task deficits
      caused by AMD through computer-based visuo-motor rehabilitation training.

      To test this idea, three visuo-motor training modules will be developed for low-cost tablet
      computers that subjects will use at home.  Modules will be for scotoma awareness training,
      line and circle tracing, and video games.  All three modules will involve PRL-hand
      coordination by moving a stylus on the tablet screen in response to stimuli.  Scotoma
      awareness training is necessary because the majority of those with macular scotomas do not
      realize they have them.  Line and circle tracing will develop eye-hand coordination skills
      needed for printing.  The video game module will provide practice in PRL-hand coordination.
      Progress in PRL-hand coordination will be automatically recorded on the tablet-computer.

      Changes in manual task performance from the training modules will be assessed after each
      training module using previously developed Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (SLO) tests of
      maze-tracing, and printing.  The SLO will also be used to determine the position and
      fixation stability of the subject's PRL and the retinal position of the scotoma.  SLO
      testing will be repeated three months after all training.  Digitized SLO video images
      showing the hand, stylus, and object on the retina will be measured and analyzed.  Several
      performance measures will be derived from the SLO image analysis including maze-tracing
      accuracy, printing legibility, retinal area of the stylus, percentage of time the stylus is
      in the scotoma, and PRL retinal area.  This data will be statistically analyzed to determine
      whether visuo-motor training with the computer tablets improves manual task performance and
      whether one module is more effective than others.

      There will be six groups of five subjects.  Subjects will be assigned as they are recruited
      to a group until the group is full.  Two groups will have training delayed by 6 months and
      will be tested on the SLO 4 times to assess changes in the dependent measure without
      training.  Following training on each module, subject will be tested on maze tracing and
      printing in the SLO.  Two groups undergo four SLO tests without training and begin training
      six months later.
