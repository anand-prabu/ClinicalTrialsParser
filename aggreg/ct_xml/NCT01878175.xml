  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a common surgical procedure among veterans.  It is most
      often used to treat hip osteoarthritis, which is more common among veterans than the general
      population.  Some patients continue to experience functional limitations after THA, and
      studies have shown that these patients still tend to put greater loads on the opposite leg,
      which can  increase the risk of developing osteoarthritis in that leg.  One likely reason
      for these post-surgical limitations is that rehabilitation is very minimal following this
      procedure.  This project will involve development and preliminary testing of a functional
      movement retraining program, designed to help veterans improve their function and
      biomechanics after THA.  The project will also develop processes for delivering this program
      in veterans' homes, to increase accessibility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rehabilitation following total hip arthroplasty (THA) is limited in scope, and some patients
      continue to exhibit functional limitations, as well as loading asymmetries that place them
      at risk for developing osteoarthritis in contralateral joints. The purpose of this study is
      to collect preliminary data to support a larger project that will examine the effectiveness
      of a 12-session functional movement retraining (FMR) program for veterans following THA.  A
      novel aspect of the FMR program is that it focuses not only on improving overall function
      but also normalizing side-to-side asymmetries in balance and strength via patient-specific
      tailoring of exercises.  The program also involves telerehabilitation processes to improve
      access.

      Participants will be n=15 patients scheduled for THA at the Durham VAMC, identified from
      electronic medical records.  Participants will complete assessments pre-operatively, then
      approximately 6-weeks post-THA, at which time FMR program will begin.  The 12 FMR sessions
      will optimally be delivered twice weekly for 6 weeks.  However, to account for missed
      visits, we will allow for 9 total weeks to complete the 12 sessions.  Therefore follow-up
      assessments will be scheduled at 15-weeks post-THA for all participants. FMR sessions will
      be a combination of: 1.) in-person, on-site visits and telephone contacts with a licensed
      physical therapist and 2.) in-home telehealth visits by a telehealth technologist or
      physical therapy assistant.  The FMR program will focus on improving lower extremity
      mobility, muscle stability and functional movement patterns.  Participants will be
      instructed to perform a series of stretching exercises daily and strengthening exercises
      three times weekly.  Exercises for each patient will be tailored according to results of the
      Lower Quarter Y-Balance Test (conducted at baseline and mid-way through the program), which
      assesses asymmetries between limbs and between anterior vs. posterior reach.  Outcomes will
      include objective functional measures (timed up-and-go, sit-to-stand, walking speed, stair
      climb, Lower Quarter Y-Balance Test), self-reported pain and activity limitations (Hip
      disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score), and therapist-assessed function (Harris Hip
      Score).  Basic descriptive statistics will be used to compare changes in each outcome
      (pre-operative to 15-week post-THA and 6-week post THA to 15-week post-THA) and inform
      sample size estimates for a larger trial. We will also assess various aspects of program
      feasibility (recruitment success, adherence, telerehabilitation processes) and collect
      in-depth qualitative information from both patients and therapists to assess aspects of the
      intervention that may need to be modified prior to a larger study.

    <description>The HOOS is a validated outcome measure in patients with painful hip conditions.   It contains 5 subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) and hip related Quality of life (QOL). The last week is taken into consideration when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question gets a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale.</description>

    <description>We will use the Patient Global Impression of Change scale to evaluate participants' perspectives on overall changes in their joint pain during the study period.  This single-item measure asks participants to describe their change in pain on a 7-point rating scale with the following options: &quot;very much improved,&quot; &quot;much improved,&quot; &quot;minimally improved,&quot; &quot;no change,&quot; &quot;minimally worse,&quot; &quot;much worse,&quot; and &quot;very much worse.&quot;</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The timed get up-and-go test has demonstrated excellent reliability and correlates well with other standard measures such as gait speed, self-report and clinical report indices of function, and is predictive of who can safely ambulate.  This test requires the participants to stand from a standard arm chair, walk 3 meters and then return to sitting in the same chair.  Participants are asked to complete this as quickly and safely as possible, without the use of an assistive device.</description>

    <description>The Sit-to-Stand Test has been reported to be a good indicator of postural control, fall risk, lower-extremity strength, and disability.  During the sit-to-stand test participants will be asked to place their arms across their chest and keep their feet flat on the floor.  They will then be asked to stand up and sit down 5 times as fast as they can.  This will be repeated twice and the scores will be averaged for analysis.</description>

    <time_frame>Change between Pre-intervention (6 weeks post-surgery) to post-intervention (15 weeks post-surgery)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Gait speed is a global measure of disability and function and has been correlated with disease processes, fitness level, activities of daily living, and emotional states (48). Gait velocity changes are sensitive to improvements in mobility in adults and correspond directly with self-report of improvement in global assessment by subjects. In addition, gait speed is an imperative measure for integration to safe and effective community ambulatory status, and has been defined as a reflective measure of function.  Walking speed will be determined as the average walking speed over a 3 meter walk. Participants will be asked to walk down a 10 meter walkway 7 times (while wearing standard footwear) to have their walking speed monitored using infrared photocells, while speed is monitored over the middle 3 meters.  These seven trials will be averaged in order to determine walking speed at each of the three visits.</description>

    <measure>Change in Objective functional test:  Stair climbing</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between Pre-intervention (6 weeks post-surgery) to post-intervention (15 weeks post-surgery)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The task of stair climbing has been found to be sensitive to change with interventions in individuals with knee OA.  We have chosen to use 12 steps, which is a standard practice in our laboratory, because this mirrors and average flight of stairs and therefore provides an evaluation of participants' ability to accomplish a basic life skill of walking one set of stairs.  This measures the time it takes a participant to ascend and descend a flight of 12 steps (each step 18 cm high and 28 cm deep). Participants will be asked to complete the test as quickly as they felt safe and comfortable. The use of one handrail will be allowed if necessary, but patients will be encouraged to minimize their use of the handrail. One practice trial will be performed and the average of two additional tests will be used for analysis. The use of an assistive device will be allowed only if the subject will be unsafe or cannot complete the test without the use of the device.</description>

    <time_frame>Change between Pre-intervention (6 weeks post-surgery) to post-intervention (15 weeks post-surgery)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The UCLA scale shows a strong correlation with the other measures (r = -0.35 to 0.56 for THA; r = -0.55 to 0.23 for TKA) and discriminates between insufficiently and sufficiently active patients undergoing THA and TKA. The UCLA scale has good reliability, provides high completion rate, and shows no floor effects. It seems to be the most appropriate scale for assessment of physical activity levels in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty.  The UCLA scale is a simple scale ranging from 1 to 10. The patient indicates her or his most appropriate  activity level, with 1 defined as 'no physical activity, dependent on others' and 10 defined as 'regular participation in impact sports.'</description>

    <description>The HHS is the most widely used physician- or therapist-assessed measure of hip function following THA and associated rehabilitation.  Although the HHS has also been used in a patient-report format, in this study we will obtain this measure via therapist report, to complement the patient-reported outcomes described above.  This measure covers the domains of pain (severity and effects on activities and need for pain medication, function (daily activities and gait), deformity (hip flexion, adduction, internal rotation, and extremity length discrepancy) and range of motion (hip flexion, abduction, internal and external rotation, and adduction). The HHS includes 10 items, with a total score range of 0-100.  The HHS has been shown to be a reliable and valid measure of hip function.</description>

    <description>The YBT-LQ is a test of dynamic balance in unilateral stance that has been deemed to be reliable and valid. It will be administered to all patients who pass a clearance test, which consists of being able to sand on one leg for 10 seconds without loss of balance. Each participant will receive 3 attempts to complete this task. If they are able to complete the test on each leg they will complete the full YBT-LQ.   The YBT-LQ is a derivative of the Star Excursion Balance test. This is performed for both left and right limbs. Any trial that is failed will be repeated with a maximum of 4 additional trials to be performed in each reach direction, anterior, posterior, and lateral.</description>

    <description>15-week rehabilitation / exercise intervention, including visits at the Durham VA medical center, in-home with clinical personnel, and via telephone. The intervention is tailored to participants' post-operative functional status, particularly unilateral balance asymmetries.  The exercise program will focus on three areas: lower extremity mobility (ankle, knee and hip), muscle stability (quadriceps and gluteal muscle strength) and functional movement patterns (lower extremity focus).   Participants will be instructed to perform their prescribed stretching exercises daily and strengthening exercises three times per week (on non-consecutive days).</description>
