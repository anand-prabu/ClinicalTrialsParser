Type 1 or 2 diabetic patients for cataract surgery with > grade 3 cataract type using\n             the Lens Opacities Classification System III. Patients with onset of diabetes before\n             the age of 30 years and minimal or absent endogenous insulin production were\n             classified as having type 1 diabetes. The remaining patients were classified as\n             having type 2 diabetes.\n\n          2. Diabetics included must have at least level 20 (microaneurysms only) of diabetic\n             retinopathy, defined by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS).\n\n          3. Patients must be healthy enough to undergo cataract surgery as decided by their\n             physicians.\n\n          4. Patients must be 18 years older and must be able to provide informed consent.\n\n        Exclusion criteria\n\n          1. Patients with active or suspected ocular or periocular infections including most\n             viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva, including active epithelial herpes\n             simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, varicella, mycobacterial\n             infections, and fungal diseases.\n\n          2. Patients with advanced glaucoma.\n\n          3. Patients with known hypersensitivity to any components of this product or to other\n             corticosteroids.\n\n          4. Patients with ACIOL (Anterior Chamber Intraocular Lens) and rupture of the posterior\n             lens capsule\n\n          5. Patients who have aphakic eyes with rupture of the posterior lens capsule.\n\n          6. Diabetic patients without any retinopathy and those with active uncontrolled\n             proliferative disease will be excluded. We are excluding normal retinas of diabetics\n             since we do not feel they are at particular risk for ME when compared to those who\n             have some form of the disease. A grading of proliferative diabetic retinopathy is\n             based on the criteria made by the ETDRS study, which includes presence of either 1/3\n             optic disc neovascularization or \u00c3\u2260\u00e2\u221a\u2202 optic disc area of neovascularization anywhere\n             elsewhere in the retina.\n\n          7. Patients with clinical significant macular edema (CSME) measured with OCT prior to\n             surgery will be excluded.\n\n          8. Panretinal photocoagulation within the prior 3 months or anticipated need for\n             panretinal photocoagulation within the next 6 months.\n\n          9. Patients with retinal diseases, other than diabetes, that can affect ME will be\n             excluded from the study.\n\n         10. Eyes with uveitis, a history of any other intraocular surgery or a history of\n             uncontrolled glaucoma (baseline IOP higher than 21 mmHg or those using more than one\n             type of glaucoma medication) or steroid responders will not be enrolled in the study.\n\n         11. Eyes with cataract precluding proper optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurement\n             pre-operatively will also be excluded.\n\n         12. Patients who will experience longer than usual operating time, complicated surgery,\n             rupture of the posterior capsule, and iris or corneal burns will be managed\n             accordingly but will be excluded from the study.\n\n         13. Patients who are pregnant, breast feeding, or are unable to attend the schedules\n             follow-up appointments will also be excluded"
