  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed study is to evaluate the clinical utility of muscle
      ultrasonography for improving the diagnostic yield and safety of core muscle biopsy. Our
      facility currently uses core (needle) biopsy to obtain muscle samples in patients 18 years
      old or older. Currently, there is no imaging tool used to guide the actual biopsy. As muscle
      biopsy is an invasive and potentially painful procedure, improving the diagnostic yield of
      this test is important.
