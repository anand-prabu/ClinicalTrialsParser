  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with DiaPep277® is expected to be long-term; stopping treatment may result in the
      eventual loss of the preserved beta-cell function. Indeed, extension of phase 2 studies has
      shown that patients who were initially treated with DiaPep277® and maintained their initial
      beta-cell function, required continuation of treatment, losing beta-cell function if
      switched to Placebo. These extension studies were too small for the outcome to be
      statistically significant, but they suggested that continuation of treatment is needed for
      long-term maintenance of efficacy.

      Therefore, in this extension study, patients who complete the 1001 phase 3 study and
      maintain clinically significant beta-cell function are offered a 2-year continuation of
      active treatment, since they are likely to benefit from use of the medication. The
      participation in the extension study will be offered to all eligible subjects who complete
      the 1001 study, regardless of the treatment arm allocation in the initial study.

      By achieving long-term preservation of beta-cell function, patients are expected to maintain
      good management of the disease, manifesting as better glycemic control and fewer
      hypoglycemic events.
