Furthermore, several\n           large sample size retrospective studies from China, showed that there were no advantage\n           of CCRT over RT alone when treated by SIB-IMRT.\n\n        -  In an analysis of who will benefit from CCRT,( Lin, et.al, IJROBP,2004; 60:156-164),\n           the author divided the locally advanced NPC patients into two groups, with the\n           high-risk group defined as patients met at least one of following criteria: nodal size\n           >6 cm, (2) supraclavicular node metastasesN3, T4N2 and multiple neck node metastases\n           with 1 node >4cm.\n\n        -  Based on these information, we hypothesize that, for low-risk locally advanced NPC\n           patients, there may no need CCRT under SIB-IMRT treatment."
