Evaluate the efficacy of acupressure and acustimulation as adjuncts to\n      standard serotonin antiemetics in reducing acute nausea (day of treatment) and delayed\n      nausea (1-4 days following treatment) associated with cisplatin or doxorubicin based\n      chemotherapy in cancer patients. II. Evaluate the efficacy of acupressure and acustimulation\n      in reducing acute and delayed vomiting and in improving quality of life in cancer patients.\n      III. Investigate the relationship between expectations for the development of\n      chemotherapy-related nausea/vomiting and its actual occurrence in cancer patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to chemotherapy agent\n      and research site. Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms. Arm I: Patients\n      receive standard antiemetic therapy with serotonin receptor antagonists. Arm II: Patients\n      receive standard antiemetic therapy with serotonin receptor antagonists and wear an\n      acupressure wrist band (an elastic band equipped with a small plastic button used to apply\n      pressure to a specific point on the wrist) continuously for 5 consecutive days except when\n      necessary to avoid immersion in water. Patients may wear the band on either wrist, including\n      alternating between wrists if desired. Arm III: Patients receive standard antiemetic therapy\n      with serotonin receptor antagonists and wear an acustimulation wrist band (a portable\n      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator (TENS) device) continuously for 5 consecutive\n      days except when necessary to avoid immersion in water. Patients may wear the band on either\n      wrist, including alternating between wrists if desired, and may adjust the intensity of\n      stimulation for optimum effectiveness. All patients complete a questionnaire concerning\n      expectations of nausea and other side effects prior to receiving chemotherapy with cisplatin\n      and doxorubicin. Patients in arms II and III complete this measure after the wrist band is\n      in position. All patients complete a questionnaire and a 5 day diary at home concerning\n      nausea and emesis following the first chemotherapy treatment, and then complete a quality of\n      life questionnaire on the fourth day following treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 700 patients will be accrued for this study over 3 years."
