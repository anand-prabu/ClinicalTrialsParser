      The purpose of this study is to clarify efficacy and safety of MRI-based intravenous
      thrombolysis with alteplase for patients with acute wake-up ischemic stroke and those having
      acute ischemic stroke with unknown time of symptom onset.

      THAWS is an investigator initiated Japanese multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial
      of MRI based thrombolysis in patients with acute wake-up ischemic stroke and those having
      acute ischemic stroke with unknown time of symptom onset. Intravenous thrombolysis with
      alteplase of 0.6mg/kg, different from 0.9mg/kg used in other countries, is available as
      effective and safe treatment of acute stroke within 4.5 hours of symptom onset in Japan.
      However, time of symptom onset is unknown in about 25% of acute stroke patients. These
      patients are currently excluded from intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase. The objective
      of the THAWS project is to provide effective treatment options for acute stroke patients
      with unknown time of symptom onset. The purpose of this study is to clarify efficacy and
      safety of MRI-based intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase of 0.6mg/kg for patients with
      acute wake-up ischemic stroke and those having acute ischemic stroke with unknown time of
      symptom onset. Eligible patients will be selected based on MRI findings indicative of acute
      ischemic stroke less than 4.5 hours of age.
