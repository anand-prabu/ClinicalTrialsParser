  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rate of serious complications are relatively low in bariatric surgery today, but still
      3-4 % will suffer from a serious complication. There are factors known before the surgery or
      during the operation that are likely to increase the risk for a serious complication. If the
      investigators are aware of these we can optimize the patients risk factors prior to the
      operation or at least increase the awareness of the increased risk in some patients given
      the presence of risk factors.

      Data is collected prospectively to the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry. Today all 44
      clinics performing bariatric surgery in Sweden submits data on baseline characteristics,
      operational data and data from a 30 days, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years follow up for all
      patients. The database is compared annually to the Swedish civil registry to cover all
      mortality.

      From the database we will identify patients who underwent a bariatric procedure between May
      1st 2007 and September 30th 2012. Patients undergoing other bariatric procedures than
      laparoscopic gastric bypass or revisional surgery will be excluded.

      The data will be analyzed with &quot;Chi-2&quot; test, logarithmic regression, linear regression or
      t-test when appropriate. Odds ratio will be calculated.
