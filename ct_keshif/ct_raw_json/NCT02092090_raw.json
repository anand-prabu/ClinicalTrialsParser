The secondary\n      objectives are to determine effects of sodium reduction on major vascular events and total\n      mortality."

Effects on the risks of vascular outcomes have not been defined in an\n      adequately powered randomised trial. Rural Chinese are known to consume very large\n      quantities of sodium and to suffer from very high rates of hypertension and stroke. This\n      study is a large scale cluster randomised trial done in rural areas of China.  The study\n      will define the effects of a salt substitute-based sodium reduction strategy on the primary\n      outcome of stroke.  Secondary endpoints will include major cardiovascular events and total\n      mortality. The study will be conducted in 600 rural villages across five Northern Chinese\n      provinces and Tibet. The study will recruit 35 individuals at elevated risk of stroke from\n      each village for a total of 21,000 participants. The participating villages will be\n      randomised into intervention and control group with 1:1 allocation. Recruitment will\n      prioritise individuals with a history of stroke but also include older individuals with high\n      blood pressure. Follow up is scheduled for 5 years. Individuals in intervention villages\n      will receive repeated dietary advice and a supply of low sodium salt substitute while\n      individuals in control villages will receive dietary advice at baseline only. Every 6 months\n      throughout follow-up each individual will be contacted by phone call to inquire about the\n      occurrence of stroke, hospitalisation for any cause and diagnoses of any other serious\n      illnesses. The interview will be structured and done by individuals masked to the randomised\n      assignment of each individual.  For all deaths identified and all events that might possibly\n      be non-fatal strokes a home visit will be made. A series of process indicators including\n      urinary sodium, urinary potassium, blood pressure, knowledge about sodium and use of salt\n      substitute will also be measured on a random sample of at least 20 individuals drawn from a\n      random selection of 60 villages at baseline and every year thereafter."
