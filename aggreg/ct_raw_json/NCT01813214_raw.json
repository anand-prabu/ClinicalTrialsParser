This research study is a way of gaining new knowledge about treatment\n      options for metastatic melanoma. This research study is evaluating the effects of a drug\n      called vemurafenib on the immune system.\n\n      Vemurafenib has been approved by the FDA for treatment of patients with advanced melanoma\n      that harbors a B-RAF mutation. Vemurafenib works by blocking a protein called B-RAF.\n      Researchers have found that a large number of melanomas have mutations (changes) in the BRAF\n      gene. Genes are specific parts of your DNA that contain information on hereditary\n      characteristics such as hair color and eye color. The BRAF gene codes for a protein called\n      B-RAF, which is involved in sending signals in cells that can lead to cell growth. Research\n      has determined that mutations in the BRAF gene at the V600 position cause a change in the\n      B-RAF protein that can drive the growth and spread of melanoma cells.\n\n      The purpose of this research study is to determine how vemurafenib may alter the immune\n      system's reaction to melanoma, in order to learn how best to combine immune therapies with\n      vemurafenib in the future."

Day 1 of the\n      study will be defined as the first day a subject receives vemurafenib. During the treatment\n      phase, all study assessments will be conducted on Day 1 (\u00b1 3 days) of each cycle, with the\n      exception of computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which should\n      occur every 6 weeks (+/- 7 days).\n\n      All subjects will have biopsies performed of safely accessible tumors before starting\n      treatment and at 1, 2, and 4 weeks later (days 8, 15, 29). In addition, any patient with\n      accessible tumor at the time of progression will have a tumor biopsy performed at that time.\n\n      Mixed-effects models will be used to study the change in CD8 T cell counts per mm2 of\n      tissue, changes in expression of immunoinhibitory proteins (B7-H1/PD-L1, IDO, arginase), and\n      changes in endothelial homing receptor ligands and tumor associated chemokines at\n      pre-treatment at pre-treatment and at weeks 1, 2, and 4 after vemurafenib therapy. Subjects\n      will be treated as random effects to account for individual variability. Potential\n      covariates are age, gender, and ECOG performance status.\n\n      60 ml of blood for lymphocytes will be drawn on days 1, 8, 15, and 29."
