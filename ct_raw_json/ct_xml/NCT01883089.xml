  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study combines both clinical trial and daily process methodology to examine the
      dynamic longitudinal relationships between daily approach and avoidance inclinations (i.e.,
      craving) and drinking behaviors in those diagnosed with an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) prior
      to, during, and after receiving a brief alcohol intervention. It is hypothesized that daily
      avoidance inclinations will significantly moderate the effect of daily approach inclinations
      on drinking behaviors, and that significant increases in avoidance inclinations will be
      observed prior to treatment entry, followed by significant decreases in approach
      inclinations during treatment.
