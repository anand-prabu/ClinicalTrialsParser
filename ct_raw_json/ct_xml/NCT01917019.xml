  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study conducted in 2 parts. Part A is a double-blind
      placebo-controlled parallel-group period, and Part B is an open-label extension period. The
      primary objective of the double-blind study (Part A) is to assess the effect of
      Prolonged-Release Fampridine, treatment on walking speed, in Japanese patients with Multiple
      Sclerosis. The secondary objectives of the double-blind portion of the study are to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of prolonged-release Fampridine in this study population. The
      primary endpoint of the open-label extension study (Part B) is to evaluate the long-term
      safety profile of prolonged-release Fampridine.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Part A

        To be eligible to participate in Part A, candidates must meet the following eligibility
        criteria at screening or at the timepoint specified in the individual eligibility
        criterion listed (potential subjects who fail screening may be rescreened 1 time):

          1. Must have a diagnosis of primary-progressive, secondary progressive, progressive
             relapsing, or relapsing-remitting MS as defined by the revised McDonald Committee
             criteria ([Lublin and Reingold 1996; McDonald 2001; Polman 2005]) of at least 2
             months duration.

          2. Must be able to complete the T25FW with or without a walking aid in an average of 8
             to 45 seconds at the screening visit.

        Part B

        To be eligible to participate in Part B, candidates must meet the following criteria at
        the Week 21 visit in Part A, which is the first visit for Part B:

        1. Completed all visits in Part A of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known allergy to pyridine-containing substances, or any of the inactive ingredients
             of the prolonged-release fampridine tablet

          2. Any prior history of seizures, epilepsy, or other convulsive disorder, with the
             exception of febrile seizures in childhood, or prior history of epileptiform activity
             on electroencephalogram.

          3. Any form of renal impairment as defined by a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of &lt;80
             mL/min (estimated by the central laboratory).

          4. Known history of cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac conduction disorders requiring medical
             or surgical intervention, or any clinically significant ECG abnormality (as
             determined by the Investigator) at the screening visit or Day 1.

          5. Any prior treatment with fampridine (4 AP) or 3,4 diaminopyridine in any formulation.

          6. Treatment with an investigational drug or approved therapy for investigational use
             within 30 days (or 5 half lives, whichever is longer) prior to the screening visit.

          7. Participation in an investigational study (with the exception of observational
             studies) within 30 days prior to the screening visit or plans to enroll in another
             interventional investigational study at any time during this study.
