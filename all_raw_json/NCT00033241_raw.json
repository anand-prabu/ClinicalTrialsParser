Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so\n      they stop growing or die. Combining erlotinib with gemcitabine may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining erlotinib with gemcitabine in\n      treating patients who have newly diagnosed locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer\n      or other solid tumors."

Patients\n      receive subsequent courses of therapy comprising gemcitabine once weekly for 3 weeks and\n      erlotinib once daily. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 12 additional\n      patients are accrued and treated at the MTD as above.\n\n      Patients are followed at 30 days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 months."
