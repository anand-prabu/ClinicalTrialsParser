            "textblock": "Radiation and androgen deprivation is a common modality for patients with localized prostate\n      cancer. Unfortunately for patients with intermediate to high risk prostate cancer incomplete\n      tumor eradication and subsequent relapse occurs in 50-75% of patients. The Src pathway\n      appears to be integral to the pathobiology of prostate cancer and may be fundamental to\n      radioresistance.\n\n      The primary objective of this trial will be to establish the safety of dasatinib with\n      androgen deprivation and radiation for prostate cancer. Three dasatinib dose levels will be\n      evaluated, 50 mg/day, 70 mg/day and 100 mg/day.  Dasatinib will begin with day #1 of\n      radiation and will be discontinued once radiation is completed. The study treatment period,\n      therefore, will be when patients receive concurrent dasatinib, hormone therapy and radiation\n      to 30 days after the last radiation/dasatinib treatment. However, it will be highly\n      recommended that, prior to entering the study, patients receive 2 months of androgen\n      deprivation with a LHRH agonist. Furthermore, it will be highly recommended that, after\n      completion of dasatinib /hormone therapy/radiation, patients with intermediate risk disease\n      receive approximately 2 additional months of hormone therapy (to complete 6 months of\n      hormone therapy) and patients with high risk disease receive 20 additional months of ADT to\n      complete 2 years of hormone therapy. If casodex was given at onset of diagnosis, patient\n      must be off drug for 6 weeks prior to beginning radiation therapy"
