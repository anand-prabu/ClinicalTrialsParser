Patients are stratified\n      according to participating center and cheek being treated (right vs left). Patients are\n      randomized to 1 of 2 schedules of light-emitting diode (LED) therapy.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo LED therapy for 71 seconds once daily beginning on day 1 of the\n           myeloablative conditioning regimen comprising chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy\n           and continuing for 14 days after bone marrow transplantation (BMT).\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo LED therapy as in arm I beginning on the day of BMT (day 0)\n           and continuing for 14 days after BMT.\n\n      Photographs are taken of the right and left buccal mucosa at baseline and then every 3 days\n      beginning on day 1 of LED therapy.\n\n      Pain and xerostomia are assessed using the Wong-Baker \"smiley-face\" pain scale at baseline\n      and then periodically for 14 days after BMT.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (40 per arm) will be accrued for this study within\n      2 years."
