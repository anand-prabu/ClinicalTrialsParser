Although direct decompressive surgery is the most effective\n      treatment, surgery is only used in selected patients because most patients have a poor\n      overall condition and short life expectancy. Radiation therapy (RT), therefore, is the most\n      commonly used for patients with MESCC, but conventional RT alone can achieve modest\n      neurologic outcomes.\n\n      The hypothesis to use stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for MESCC is that the rapid\n      decompression of epidural mass, durable local control and subsequently improved neurologic\n      outcomes compared to conventional RT are expected when MESCC is treated with SBRT."
