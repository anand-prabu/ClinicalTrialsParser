  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this study is to more precisely define the role of mass azithromycin
      treatments as an intervention for reducing childhood morbidity and increasing growth, and
      for the potential selection of antibiotic resistance. The investigators propose a set of 3
      cluster-randomized trials comparing communities randomized to oral azithromycin with those
      randomized to placebo. To assess the generalizability of the intervention, investigators
      will monitor for antibiotic resistance, which could potentially limit adoption of mass
      antibiotic treatments. The investigators will also assess several measures of infectious
      diseases. The investigators hypothesize that mass azithromycin treatments will reduce
      childhood morbidity and will be accompanied by an acceptable level of antibiotic resistance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will assess childhood infectious disease morbidity and macrolide
      resistance over two years, comparing communities where children aged 1-60 months receive
      biannual oral azithromycin to communities where the children receive biannual oral placebo.
      In Niger, a third arm - annual treatment of all persons 1 month and older - will also be
      included.

      Randomization of Treatment Allocation. In each site, 30 communities within a contiguous area
      of 300,000 to 600,000 individuals will be randomized into the azithromycin or placebo arm.
      At the Niger site, an additional 15 communities will be randomized to the third arm
      (azithromycin for everyone). The investigators will use a simple random sample separately
      for each study site, but without stratification or block randomization within the site.
      These communities are being randomized from the same pool of communities eligible for a
      sister trial (Mortality Reduction After Oral Azithromycin (MORDOR) - Morbidity Study;
      clinicaltrials.gov OPP1032340-A).

      Specific Aims

      Specific Aim 1: To assess whether macrolide resistance is greater in a population-based
      community sample of pre-school children, or in a clinic-based sample of ill pre-school
      children

      Specific Aim 2: To assess whether biannual mass azithromycin treatments of pre-school
      children can eliminate ocular chlamydia in a hypoendemic area

      Specific Aim 3: To assess the diversity of the microbiome of the nasopharynx, oropharynx,
      nares, conjunctiva, and gastrointestinal tract
