  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>

      In this pilot study with a randsomized controlled trial design, we examine the effect of an
      intervention optimizing and integrating rehabilitation for breast cancer on psychological
      and physical symptoms as well as health behavior after breast cancer. In the intervention
      group, we systematically screen for psychological and physical symptoms as well as health
      behavior (smoking alcohol and physical activity) not in line with the recommendations.
      Patients who screen positive are offered a sequence of sessions with a navigator nurse who
      monitor rehabilitation needs, supports the patient, educate in self-management of symptoms
      and refer to existing rehabilitation services as well as to up to 6 free sessions with a
      psychologist specialized in cancer patients. The rehabilitation services that the nurse
      refers to include several hospital departments and municipality services as well as general
      practice and by thorough follow-up on the patients use of these, the intervention aims at
      developing an integrated treatment and rehabilitation trajectory. The control group receives
      standard care.
