At the same time, the AMES device provides sensory stimulation by vibrating the tendons of muscles stretched by the movement.  The vibratory stimulus switches from one side of the limb to the other when the rotation reverses direction so that the sensory stimulation remains functionally related to the movement. This study provides for 25 AMES treatments over 8-13 weeks, at a rate of 2-3 sessions per week."

Our hypotheses are: (1) both sensation and movement recover with\n      AMES treatment, (2) sensory recovery precedes that of movement, (3) robotic delivery of the\n      Joint Position Test produces more reliable test results than does manual delivery of this\n      test, and (4) the Frisbee Test results will parallel those of the Joint Position Test."
