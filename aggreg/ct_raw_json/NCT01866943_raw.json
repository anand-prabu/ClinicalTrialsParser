            "textblock": "Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a procedure associated with perioperative blood loss,\n      requiring blood transfusions in some patients. The major cause of this blood loss is due to\n      surgical trauma that induces the clotting cascade and fibrinolysis. Several previous studies\n      and meta-analyses have shown that tranexamic acid is an effective antifibrinolytic agent\n      that reduces blood loss in a variety of situations. Tranexamic acid given in an intravenous\n      form has been extensively studied and shown to be efficacious in cardiothoracic, spine\n      surgical procedures as well as total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and THA. Similarly, topical\n      tranexamic acid has been associated with decreased blood loss in cardiac surgeries as well.\n      Recently, results from a prospective randomized study on the topical use of tranexamic acid\n      in total knee arthroplasty found it to be effective for reducing postoperative blood loss.\n      Taking all of the above into consideration we have proposed a study to evaluate effects of\n      topical application of tranexamic acid on postoperative blood loss and blood transfusion on\n      patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. The aim of this study is to evaluate the\n      efficacy of the topical application of tranexamic acid on blood loss in patients undergoing\n      a primary unilateral total hip arthroplasty."
