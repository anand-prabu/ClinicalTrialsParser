Giving a chemotherapy drug before surgery may shrink the tumor\n      so that it can be removed during surgery.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by\n      surgery in treating infants who have newly diagnosed neuroblastoma."

Patients are stratified according to symptomatic\n      spinal cord involvement (yes vs no).\n\n      Patients without evidence of symptomatic spinal cord compression receive vincristine IV on\n      day 1 and cyclophosphamide IV on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 2 courses.\n      Patients eligible for surgery undergo surgical resection and then are removed from the\n      study.\n\n      Patients ineligible for surgery after 2 courses of initial chemotherapy, but with at least\n      25% response to initial chemotherapy, receive 2 additional courses of vincristine and\n      cyclophosphamide. Patients eligible for surgery undergo surgical resection and then are\n      removed from the study.\n\n      Patients ineligible for surgery after 2 additional courses of initial chemotherapy or with\n      disease progression receive etoposide IV over 2 hours and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days\n      1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses. Patients eligible for surgery undergo\n      surgical resection and then are removed from the study.\n\n      Patients who remain ineligible for surgery or with disease progression after etoposide and\n      carboplatin receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5, doxorubicin IV over 6 hours\n      on days 4 and 5, and vincristine IV on days 1 and 5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2\n      courses. Patients then undergo surgical resection or biopsy.\n\n      Patients with symptomatic spinal cord compression receive initial treatment with etoposide\n      and carboplatin as above. Patients with improved symptoms and resectable disease after\n      initial chemotherapy undergo surgical resection or biopsy. Patients who remain ineligible\n      for surgery or with no improvement in symptoms after initial chemotherapy receive\n      cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine as above. Patients then undergo surgical\n      resection or biopsy.\n\n      Patients are followed within 6 months and then annually for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years."
