  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if BL-8040 in combination with
      cytarabine (Ara-C) can help to control the disease in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia
      (AML) that has relapsed or did not respond adequately to previous treatment.  The safety of
      the study drug combination will also be studied.

      Open-label, multicenter, phase IIa, dose escalating study in subjects with
      relapsed/refractory AML, defined according to WHO criteria (1), including subjects who
      failed chemotherapy only and those who failed previous Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation
      (ASCT) / Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation (AlloSCT), provided at least 6 months have
      passed from transplant.

      Eligible subjects will receive subcutaneous (SC) injections of BL-8040 (&quot;monotherapy
      period&quot;) over two days (one injection per day) followed by concurrent administration of
      BL-8040 with standard salvage chemotherapy (&quot;combined period&quot;) over 5 days. During the
      &quot;combined period,&quot; BL-8040 will be administered 4 hours prior to chemotherapy. The
      chemotherapy will consist of cytarabine (Ara-C) 1.5 or 3 g/m2/d per dose (based on age),
      administered intravenously (IV) over 3 hours, for 5 days  and will not be escalated.

      The first part of the study (Part 1) will include escalating dose groups and be considered
      the 'escalation phase'. Five potential dose levels (see Table 1) will be investigated
      starting at dose level 1. Patients will be accrued in a conventional 3+3 design. Applying
      this study design, the first cohort of 3 patients will be treated at dose level 1 and
      evaluated for dose escalation.
