            "textblock": "Mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) or \"concussions\" are an increasingly prevalent injury\n      in our society. Patients with post-concussion syndrome have been shown to have deficits on\n      tests of short term memory, divided attention, multi-tasking, information processing speed,\n      and reaction time, as well as alteration in mood and emotional functioning.  Many patients\n      have other vague complaints including fatigue, dizziness, irritability, sleep disturbances,\n      and chronic headaches. Furthermore, sleep disruption of one of the most common complaints in\n      patients suffering from traumatic brain injuries, with as many as 40 to 65% of patients with\n      mTBI complaining of insomnia.  Sleep problems in these patients are associated with poorer\n      outcome, while resolution of the sleep disturbance is associated with improvement in\n      cognitive functioning.\n\n      Despite recent evidence of the correlation between sleep quality and recovery from traumatic\n      brain injury, and the well-established role of sleep in neural plasticity and neurogenesis,\n      there have been virtually no direct studies of the causal effects of sleep on recovery\n      following mTBI.  However, it is quite likely that sleep plays a critical role in recovery\n      following brain injury.\n\n      A particularly promising non-pharmacologic approach that shows potential in\n      improving/modifying abnormalities of the circadian rhythm and sleep-wake schedule is bright\n      light therapy. For the proposed investigation, we hypothesize that bright light therapy may\n      be helpful in improving the sleep of patients with a recent history of mTBI and may also\n      have other mood elevating effects, both of which should promote positive treatment outcome\n      in these individuals. Bright light therapy may increase the likelihood that they will\n      recover more quickly, benefit more extensively from other forms of therapy, and build\n      emotional and cognitive resilience."
