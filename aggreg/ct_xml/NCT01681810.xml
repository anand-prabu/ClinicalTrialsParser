  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being conducted to examine the effects of daily inorganic nitrate and
      nitrite treatment on the cardiometabolic and hormonal disturbances observed in
      overweight/obese adults with the metabolic syndrome and high blood pressure. Ultimately,
      oral nitrate and nitrite therapy may have a major impact on the prevention and treatment of
      both diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States and
      worldwide. Several studies have demonstrated that fruit and vegetable rich diets
      significantly reduced blood pressure and reduced the risk of ischemic stroke and
      cardiovascular disease in general, the exact mechanisms remain poorly understood.
      Preclinical and clinical research over the last decade has revealed the important
      vasoprotective effects of nitrates and nitrites with regards to reduction in blood pressure,
      vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. More recent findings suggest that
      inorganic nitrate and nitrite therapy may be involved in the regulation of glucose-insulin
      homeostasis.

      For this reason, development of an oral formulation of nitrate and nitrite salts represents
      a rational avenue of exploration for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, whereby
      nitrite would ensure rapid acting effects upon absorption, while the nitrate would
      continuously provide a slow formation of nitrite over a prolonged period of time via the
      enterosalivary circulation pathway. In this pathway, about 25% of circulating nitrate is
      concentrated in the saliva and reduced to nitrite by commensal mouth bacteria with nitrate
      reductase enzymes. The proposal is the first human study to investigate the inorganic
      nitrate or nitrite effects (in any form) on insulin sensitivity in a patient population.
      This will be the third human trial using orally delivered inorganic nitrate capsules in
      normal volunteers or subjects with hypertension and the second human trial using orally
      delivered nitrite (previously as aqueous solution).
