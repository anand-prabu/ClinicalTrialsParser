Our project, Volunteers Adding Life in\n      Dementia (VALID), will design and implement a volunteer-led program to reduce behavioral\n      symptoms and improve the quality of life of older adults with dementia who are residing in\n      long-term care facilities."

NPS are particularly problematic in long-term care (LTC) where approximately\n      60% of individuals have dementia, and 80% of individuals with dementia have NPS at any time.\n      Adverse outcomes associated with NPS include increased use of psychotropic medications,\n      stress for families and nursing staff, increased costs of care, and decreased quality of\n      life. A novel approach to implementing non-pharmacological interventions for LTC residents\n      with NPS is the use of volunteers. Volunteer-led programs have been demonstrated to be an\n      effective, inexpensive, and sustainable method of implementing psychosocial interventions\n      for older adults in acute care. The objectives of our project are to: 1.) Recruit and train\n      approximately 40 volunteers in the VALID program; 2.) Conduct a cluster-randomized\n      controlled trial of the VALID program in 6 LTC facilities (3 intervention and 3 control LTC\n      sites; 60 individuals with dementia in each of the experimental and control arms) to\n      determine the effect of the VALID program on symptoms of NPS, patient quality of life,\n      volunteer's experience, and LTC staff stress, 3.) Determine key components of the VALID\n      program that served as facilitators and barriers to implementation."
