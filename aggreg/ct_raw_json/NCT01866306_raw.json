The study is divided into 2 parts. Part\n      1 is a dose-finding study where healthy participants, and asthmatic participants, either\n      concomitantly treated or not treated with a class of long-acting beta antagonists (LABA),\n      undergo nasal challenge with increasing doses of RV16UB. Part 2 is a biomarker study where\n      mild to moderate asthmatics undergo challenge with the most appropriate dose of RV16UB\n      identified in Part 1, based on tolerability and viral effects."
