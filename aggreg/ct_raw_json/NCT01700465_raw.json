Newly developed algorithms can, in real-time:  1)\n      estimate acute blood loss volume, 2) monitor and estimate fluid resuscitation needs, 3)\n      predict cardiovascular collapse well ahead of any clinically significant changes in standard\n      vital signs, and 4) estimate intracranial pressure.  We hypothesize that these same methods\n      can be used to monitor volume loss during hemodialysis, as well as predict intradialytic\n      hypotension, well before it occurs."

Combine the physiological data from patient monitors with clinical and demographic\n           data, including age, gender, race, problem list, reason for dialysis, estimated dry\n           weight, volume removed, arterial and venous pressures, etc. for use in developing\n           mathematical models of hemodialysis.\n\n        3. Develop robust, real-time, computational models for:\n\n             -  estimating acute intravascular volume loss during hemodialysis\n\n             -  predicting an optimal, individual specific, intravascular volume to be removed\n                during a hemodialysis session\n\n             -  predicting intradialytic hypotension\n\n        4.
