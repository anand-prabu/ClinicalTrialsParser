            "textblock": "The investigators propose to administer the Asthma Control Test (ACT), a clinically\n      validated and reliable measure of asthma control, to a pediatric pulmonary patient\n      population, using novel channels to improve usage of the tool and health outcomes. The\n      investigators will administer ACT to patients using Facebook to monitor asthma control and\n      notify clinicians when there is deterioration of control.\n\n      The goal is to improve health outcomes in patients with asthma by measuring adherence to the\n      use of monitoring tool, follow-up visits to their specialist, and hospitalization/Emergency\n      Department (ED) visits. To achieve this, the investigators will use a novel technology\n      platform that is simple, secure, private and easily scalable to other relevant sites and\n      groups, without the need for additional investment.  Currently, patients take the ACT survey\n      only during their scheduled office appointments. The aim of the study is to increase the use\n      of ACT to monitor patients who see a pediatric pulmonologist to promote regular\n      self-monitoring.\n\n      ACT is a short symptom-based survey consisting of 5 questions, validated in English and\n      Spanish. Participants will receive reminders on Facebook every month to login to the study\n      website to complete the ACT survey therefore allowing patients to easily take the survey on\n      a regular basis, and receive reminders and educational content in the media spaces they\n      already inhabit. Participants would receive reminders and links in the same way they would\n      receive other reminders or notifications from Facebook.  The system will rate asthma control\n      and send patients and their specialist notification of status if it reaches critical levels,\n      defined as a score of 14 or lower on the ACT survey. This will be a system generated\n      notification, based on a protocol developed in conjunction with the physicians at the\n      Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) pediatric pulmonary department.\n\n      The intervention will study the efficacy of electronic social networks in engaging teenagers\n      in their asthma control over time, using a simple but effective symptom-based survey tool.\n      Both patients and providers would receive notifications in case of deteriorating control,\n      which could result in early intervention and lead to better clinical outcomes by prompting\n      timely intervention by the clinician. The Center for Connected Health (CCH) will work with\n      the MGH Department of Pulmonology, as well as the Pediatric Asthma group at Partners\n      Community HealthCare Inc. (PCHI) to enroll ambulatory teenagers with asthma in the research\n      study for one year.\n\n      120 participants will be enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two groups."
