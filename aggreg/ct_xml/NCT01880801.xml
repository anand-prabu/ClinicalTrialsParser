      The purpose of this study is to determine whether mothers with Idiopathic thrombocytopenic
      purpura (ITP) has antibodies against platelets in breastfeeding milk aside control group of
      healthy mothers.

      In order to prevent severe thrombocytopenia in infants born to mothers with ITP.

      Samples of breastfeeding milk and sera will be collected from 10 lactating women diagnosed
      with ITP and from 10 healthy women in the same stage after giving birth. Antibodies against
      platelets in the samples will be examined by using anti human IgM/G/A antibody following
      incubation of the serum/milk samples with platelets. The platelets will be from leftovers of
      samples send to platelets functionality test and found to be normal (the platelets samples
      will be taken without any identification and be marked only with lab number). The
      measurement will be done by flow cytometer. Sample will be consider as positive when the
      signal will be greater than 2 fold of control samples standard deviation. In addition, the
      presence of antibodies in different times from the birth will be checked in breastfeeding
      milk and sera of ITP patients. If the milk proteins and lipids will disturb the exam, the
      immunoglobulins from the milk will be isolated using Ig isolation kit from plasma.
