The\n      overall benefit of intravenous thrombolysis is substantial, but up to 2/3 of patients with\n      large clots may not achieve re-opening of the vessel and up to 40% of the patients may\n      remain severely disabled or die. Ultrasound accelerates clot break-up (lysis) when combined\n      with thrombolysis (sonothrombolysis) and increases the likelihood of functional independence\n      at 3 months. Adding intravenous ultrasound contrast (gaseous microspheres) further enhances\n      the thrombolytic effect (contrast enhanced sonothrombolysis = CEST). Contrast enhanced\n      ultrasound may also accelerate clot break-up in the absence of thrombolytic drugs (contrast\n      enhanced sonolysis = CES).\n\n      HYPOTHESIS: Contrast enhanced ultrasound treatment administered within 4 1/2 hours after\n      symptom onset may be given safely to patients with acute ischemic stroke, both to those\n      receiving intravenous thrombolysis and those not receiving intravenous thrombolysis, and\n      will improve clinical outcome.\n\n      AIMS: To compare efficacy and safety of contrast enhanced ultrasound treatment vs. no\n      ultrasound treatment in patients with acute ischemic stroke receiving or not receiving\n      intravenous thrombolysis.\n\n      STUDY ENDPOINTS: The primary endpoint is excellent clinical outcome at 3 months (effect).\n      Secondary endpoints are early clinical improvement (effect) and bleeding complications\n      (safety)."

In patients eligible for intravenous thrombolysis contrast enhanced\n      sonothrombolysis (CEST) has superior effect as compared with standard intravenous\n      thrombolysis and may be given safely. 2.) In patients not eligible for thrombolysis,\n      contrast enhanced sonolysis (CES) has superior effect as compared with no specific treatment\n      and may be given safely.\n\n      RANDOMISATION: In NOR-SASS-I (two step randomisation), 1st randomisation is 1:1 to either\n      tenecteplase (TNK) or alteplase (tPA); 2nd randomisation is 1:1 to either CEST or no CEST.\n      In NOR-SASS-II, randomisation is 1:1 to either CES or no CES."
