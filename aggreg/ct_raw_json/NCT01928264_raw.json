The\n      control group is designed very similar and implies predominantly sedentary leisure time\n      group activities (e.g. playing board games, doing handicrafts). Measures will be performed\n      at baseline, post-test, and at follow ups three and twelve months after post-test, some\n      variables will additionally be assessed 4-weekly during the intervention. We expect that\n      intervention group participants will report and show, respectively, more improved physical\n      fitness, (physio-)psychological functioning and participations skills, as well as increased\n      ability to work, compared to the control group."
