Individuals\n      with a clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or a HOMA-IR value above 16 were excluded.\n      Standard statistical analyses carried out.  An association between 25(OH)D and the endpoints\n      of interest was first  established. The residual values after adjusting HOMA-IR, serum\n      insulin, QUICKI, and blood pressure for BMI, age, sex, and waist circumference were then\n      regressed against serum 25(OH)D using 40-percentile data blocks, stepping upward from the\n      lowest 25(OH)D values by 5 percentile increments through the 7th decile.  Regression\n      coefficients are then computed for each data block and each outcome variable.  The location\n      (along the 25(OF)D continuum) of the largest and most statistically significant coefficients\n      is noted, and regions of null response noted as well."
