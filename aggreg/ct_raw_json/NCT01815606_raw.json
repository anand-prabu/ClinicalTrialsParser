The biopsy can be performed using either a 19 or 25-Gauge needle.\n      The purpose of this study is to compare which of the two needles is better for performing\n      biopsies of the pancreas on masses that are greater than 35mm."

Randomized trials have shown that all three needles are safe and\n      perform equally well. However, in a retrospective study, the diagnostic sensitivity of\n      EUS-FNA for pancreatic masses that measured more than 35mm was less compared to smaller size\n      masses. This is because larger size tumors have more necrosis and it is difficult to\n      identify cancer cells in them to make a diagnosis. Therefore, more biopsies must be\n      performed in larger size tumors to establish a diagnosis. In previous studies it has been\n      shown that the larger 19G needles procure larger and better quality tissue. Therefore, our\n      hypothesis is that, when a larger 19G needle is used to FNA tumors more than 35mm, a\n      diagnosis can be achieved with fewer passes."
