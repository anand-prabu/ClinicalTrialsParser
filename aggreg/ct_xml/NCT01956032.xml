    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of resources, measured as number of
      contacts and time spent by the Duodopa Nurse Specialist, the Investigator, and the
      telemedicine Technician, during titration of Levodopa Carbodopa Intestinal Gel at home using
      Telemedicine.

    <description>Resource use is composed of the health care professional and technician time in hours used during the study period. Health care professional-time is defined as Duodopa Nurse Specialist- and Investigator time, in contact with patient by visiting the patient's home, by telemedicine equipment or by telephone. Telemedicine technician time will include time for telemedicine equipment setup, demounting and adjustments if needed.</description>
