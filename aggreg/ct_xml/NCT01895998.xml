  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research study is a cross-sectional study enrolling young children with sickle
      cell disease between 5 and 12 years of age.  They will be screened as outpatients for
      consent to perform pulmonary function testing (PFT) and echocardiography.  In addition, the
      degree of bronchodilator response will be assessed at each session.  To estimate presence of
      pulmonary hypertension,  echocardiography will be performed at the time of PFT measures.

      Study Design:

        1. Enroll children aged 5 to 12 years of age with sickle cell disease (HbSS, HbSC, HbS
           beta plus thalassemia, HbS beta zero thalassemia, and HbS OArab) who are established
           patients within the Duke Pediatric Sickle Cell Clinic.

        2. Perform a chart review of all enrolled subjects to obtain specific details regarding
           birth history, nutritional status (weight, height), family history, sickle cell
           genotype, parental smoking history, recent laboratory parameters, parental smoking
           history, any concurrent conditions (atopy, asthma, airway anomaly), history of sickle
           cell complications and prescribed medications.

        3. Perform spirometry and plethysmography with the administration of albuterol.

        4. Before or after completion the PFT session, the patient will have echocardiography in
           the PFT lab area

        5. Using medical record information, determine number of hospitalizations for any
           pulmonary symptoms indicative of acute chest syndrome (ACS) (dyspnea, fever, wheezing,
           hypoxia, cough, chest pain).  In addition, we will track any respiratory or cardiac
           symptoms or therapies for each subject 6 years after enrollment up to age 18 years
           using the registry.

        6. As standard of care, refer any child identified as having lung disease or pulmonary
           hypertension to a pediatric pulmonologist and/or cardiologist for monitoring, treatment
           and ongoing care.
