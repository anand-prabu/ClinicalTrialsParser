      The purpose of this research study is to compare the medication TP05 to the medication
      Asacol™ for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) and to assess the safety and
      tolerability of TP05. This study will investigate whether TP05 is as good as (non-inferior
      to) Asacol™.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, multi-centre,
      non-inferiority trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 3.2 g of TP05/day compared to
      3.2 g/day of Asacol™ with an open label extension to assess the long-term safety and
      tolerability of TP05 administered over a 26 week period. A total of 800 subjects with mildly
      to moderately active UC will be evaluated. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a
      1:1 ratio to receive 3.2 g/day of TP05 (administered once daily) or 3.2 g/day of Asacol™.
      The primary efficacy outcome will be assessed at Week 8.  All subjects who respond to
      TP05/Asacol™ (response or remission) will continue receiving blinded study treatment for up
      to 12 weeks. After that, subjects can enroll in an Open Label Extension (OLE) for 26 weeks
      duration to receive TP05. Subjects failing to respond to study drug at the Week 8 visit can
      enroll in the OLE at week 8 and receive 4.8 g/day of TP05.
