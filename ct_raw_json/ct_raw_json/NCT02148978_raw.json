The vast majority of patients with CF will develop\n      pancreatic endocrine insufficiency over time manifested as altered glucose metabolism. The\n      presence of overt diabetes in patients with CF is associated with adverse clinical outcomes.\n\n      The underlying pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is still a matter\n      of investigation. In addition to localized tissue damage developing similar to that of the\n      exocrine pancreas, additional mechanisms may be involved. The investigators have recently\n      shown that insulin secretion in patients with CF is significantly altered prior to the\n      development of diabetes. This phenomenon is associated with reduced secretion of gut derived\n      incretins (specifically GIP). The blunting of incretin induced insulin secretion (whether\n      due to a deranged interaction of gastrointestinal contents with enterocytes resulting in\n      reduced secretion or due to rapid clearance of such peptides) may be a major underlying\n      driver of altered glucose metabolism in such patients."
