Spirometry is a\n      standardized test used in medical practice that measures how much air your lungs can hold\n      and how forcefully you can breathe out.\n\n      For this study, the investigators will compare two groups: 1) intervention (treatment) group\n      and 2) usual care group (control). The intervention group will have a spirometry test and\n      the results will be provided to the primary care physician. The usual care group will not\n      initially have a spirometry test. Both groups will be followed for outcomes."
