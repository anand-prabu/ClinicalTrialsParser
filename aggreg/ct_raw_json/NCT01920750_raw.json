The volunteers will be recruited by direct contact after\n      placing notices in the Department of Microbiology at Colorado State University. There are\n      approximately 40 faculty/staff/students in this population and all are routinely tested (PPD\n      skin-testing or chest X-ray) by the staff at the Hartshorn Health Service Center in the\n      context of the Department's tuberculosis research. Five individuals will be selected for\n      testing MLSA-LAM and five will receive MLCwA. Each will receive single 0.1 ml intracutaneous\n      injections of three titrated doses (1, 10 and 25 )lg/ml) of the skin-test antigen, one of\n      mock antigen (i.e., physiological saline), and one of control antigen (the product now in\n      use; Rees MLSA, 10 )lg), divided equally between the subject's two arms. Results will be\n      recorded at 15 min, 48 h, 72 h, and 28 days post-injection. The test dose will be\n      administered with a sterile1 ml syringe calibrated in tenths and fitted with a sterile,\n      one-half inch, 26 or 27 gauge needle. The rubber stopper of the vial will be wiped with a\n      sterile piece of cotton moistened with alcohol and allowed to dry.It is expected that all\n      concentrations of the two leprosy skin test antigens will evoke similar negative responses.\n      If so, all three concentrations will be used for subsequent studies. This protocol is linked\n      to study 98-202."
