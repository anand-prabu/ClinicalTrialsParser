Assess the safety and tolerability of\n      this treatment regimen in this patient population. III. Evaluate the efficacy of oral\n      bexarotene in terms of induction of differentiation and decreased aberrant cell\n      proliferation in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified\n      according to prior therapy for metastatic disease. Patients are randomized to one of two\n      dose levels. All patients receive oral bexarotene once daily. Treatment continues in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every week\n      for the first month, at weeks 6 and 8, then monthly thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 84-180 patients will be accrued for this study."
