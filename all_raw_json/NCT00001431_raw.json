Patients will be treated with external beam radiation therapy in a\n      standard manner.  Gemcitabine will be administered as a 30 minute infusion beginning on the\n      first day of irradiation and weekly afterwards for a total of 5 doses.  Patients will be\n      assessed clinically for acute toxicity which will be graded per RTOG and DCT toxicity\n      grading system."
