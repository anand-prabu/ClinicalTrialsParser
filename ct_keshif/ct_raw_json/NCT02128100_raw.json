FOLFIRINOX with be delivered prior to SBRT for 4 cycles. Restaging imaging\n      will occur prior to SBRT delivery. SBRT will be delivered using standard stereotactic\n      techniques to a dose of 3200cGy at 650cGy per fraction delivered over 2 weeks. Additional\n      adjuvant chemotherapy with be delivered at the physician's discretion. Patients will be\n      reassessed both clinically and radiographically at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12\n      months post-treatment. Quality of life analysis will occur at 3 month intervals after\n      treatment. Blood will be drawn for exploratory biomarker analysis at strategic timepoints\n      during treatment and followup. Following the initial imaging time points, standard\n      surveillance will be employed with clinical assessment and imaging at 3 month intervals for\n      the first 2 years post-treatment."
