            "textblock": "Anaemia is a condition in which blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. It\n      can also occur if red blood cells do not contain enough haemoglobin, an oxygen carrying part\n      of blood. Anaemia is common in patients with chronic kidney disease. Healthy kidneys produce\n      a hormone called erythropoietin, which stimulates the bone marrow to produce the proper\n      number of red blood cells needed to carry oxygen to vital organs. Chronic kidney disease is\n      a general term that means that the kidneys are not functioning to their full potential. The\n      study drug, BAY85-3934, is being evaluated as a drug to increase the body's ability to\n      produce erythropoietin.\n\n      The purpose of this extension study is to find out if the study drug, a tablet taken orally,\n      is safe and effective for the treatment of anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease.\n\n      The extension study will enroll up to 240 patients at multiple locations in Europe, Asia and\n      Australia.  Patients who participated in Studies 15141 or 15261 may be eligible to take part\n      in the extension study. The study consists of the Haemoglobin (Hb) Stabilisation Phase and\n      the Main Phase. The Hb Stabilisation Phase involves up to 10 study visits scheduled over 16\n      weeks.  The Main Phase will last for at least 6 months and up to a maximum of 36 months,\n      with visits every 4 weeks.  During these scheduled visits patients will undergo a number of\n      procedures to confirm efficacy and safety of the study drug, including measurement of heart\n      rate and blood pressure, physical examination, Electrocardiogram and blood/urine sample\n      collection for laboratory tests.\n\n      The study will be conducted at 5 hospitals in the UK. Bayer HealthCare AG is funding this\n      research. This study will include subjects who either completed the treatment period in\n      their respective Phase 2 parent study (i.e., Study 15141 or Study 15261) or experienced a\n      stopping event in the fixed dose parent study (Study 15141). As Study 15141 is a\n      double-blind study, subjects will be unblinded as per the Study 15141 protocol prior to\n      entry into the extension study."
