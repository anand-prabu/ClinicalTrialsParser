      This study's goal is to determine the frequency and severity of acute graft versus host
      disease, to evaluate incidence of primary and secondary graft rejection, to assess event
      free survival and overall survival, to determine the time to neutrophil and platelet
      engraftment, to determine the time to immune reconstitution (including normalization of T, B
      and natural killer (NK) cell repertoire and Immunoglobulin G production), and to establish
      the incidence of infectious complications including bacterial, viral, fungal and atypical
      mycobacterial and other infections following CD34+ selection in children, adolescents and
      young adults receiving an allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant from a family
      member or unrelated adult donor for a non-malignant disease.

      Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a condition that results from a reaction of transplanted
      donor T-lymphocytes against the body and organs of the patient receiving the transplanted
      cells. There are two forms: acute (early) and chronic (late). Acute GVHD may produce skin
      rashes, liver disease,diarrhea, and an increased risk of infection. Chronic GVHD can appear
      in patients without prior acute GVHD. Chronic GVHD may also produce skin rashes, liver
      disease, diarrhea and an increased risk of infection. GVHD can make patients very sick, and
      having GVHD can make it more likely that patients will not survive their transplant. In this
      study the investigators are offering to treat the donor peripheral blood stem cells in the
      hope that it will make it less likely for the patient who receives them to have GVHD.

      Patients on this study are being offered an experimental treatment involving the use of a
      Miltenyi CliniMacs CD34+ selection device to remove T-cells from the peripheral blood stem
      cell transplant in order to decrease the risk of acute and chronic GVHD. CD34+ stem cells
      are selected from the donor's peripheral blood stem cells. In doing this, T-cells are also
      removed. T-cells are the cells which are responsible for graft versus host disease (GVHD).
      This study is a clinical trial for patients diagnosed with a non-malignant disease who will
      receive a peripheral blood stem cell transplant. Patients with the following types of
      non-malignant diseases can participate in this study: Bone marrow failure syndromes
      (including Severe Aplastic Anemia, Severe Congenital Neutropenia, Amegakaryocytic
      Thrombocytopenia (Kostman's Syndrome), Diamond-Blackfan Anemia, Schwachman Diamond Syndrome,
      Primary Immunodeficiency Syndromes, Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndromes, and Histiocytic
      Disorders) and Hemoglobinopathies (including Sickle Cell Anemia and Sickle/Beta
      Thalassemia). Patients on this study will be given standard transplant therapy with either
      high doses of chemotherapy drugs or lower doses of chemotherapy drugs, depending on their
      disease. Diseases within each disease group will receive chemotherapy that is standard for
      that condition.

      Some patients on this study will receive an allogeneic stem cell transplant (AlloSCT) from a
      matched related donor. If a patient does not have a matched related donor, a bone marrow
      search will be done at all of the bone marrow banks in the world. The patient will then go
      on to receive an AlloSCT from either a partially matched family member or an unrelated adult
      stem cell transplant donor. The transplanted cells will allow all the normal parts of the
      patient's blood system to recover. The experimental portion of this treatment involves the
      use of a Miltenyi CliniMacs CD34+ selection device to remove T-cells from the peripheral
      blood stem cell transplant in order to decrease the risk of acute and chronic GVHD. CD34+
      stem cell selection AlloSCT has been studied in adults with malignant and non-malignant
      disease with successful engraftment and has shown some improvement in GVHD. It is unknown if
      CD34+ stem cell selection will work to prevent severe GVHD in children and adolescents.
