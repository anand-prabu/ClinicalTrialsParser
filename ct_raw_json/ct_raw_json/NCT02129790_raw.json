Mentalization-based therapy for adolescents (MBT-A) has been shown to be\n      more effective than 'usual care' in reducing self-harm for adolescents and adults with\n      borderline personality disorder. MBT-A includes psychoeducational and coping strategies that\n      may prove quite effective for bipolar adolescents who are at elevated risk for self-harm.\n\n      Participation in this study will last 9 months. All participants will receive a thorough\n      medical-psychiatric evaluation. All youth will be able to receive pharmacotherapy with a\n      study psychiatrist in the CHAMP clinic. The MBT-A will consist of up to 21 weekly, biweekly\n      and monthly individual sessions interspersed with 9 monthly family sessions (30 therapy\n      hours total). Participants will also complete follow-up assessments every 3 months for 9\n      months. These assessments will include research interviews and questionnaires."
