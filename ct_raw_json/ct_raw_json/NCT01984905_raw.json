            "textblock": "Clinical outcomes of chronic type B aortic dissections are unknown, especially in case of\n      false lumen expansion and risk of rupture. Data of literature give us some indications about\n      prognosis. The 1-year survival rate is about 80%, but we deplore the 25% rate of mortality\n      at 3 years despite follow-up.The only known predictive factors are the initial diameter of\n      more than 4 cm and the persistence of a false lumen patent.However, actual means of\n      follow-up do not allow to predict severe complications. The aim of the sudy is to propose a\n      diagnostic and preventive strategy for the follow-up of chronic type B aortic dissections\n      treated medically.\n\n      The primary objective is then to evaluate the prognostic role of 18-FDG-PET Scan in such\n      patients in order to predict the risk of aortic diameter growth of more than 5 mm in 1 year\n      and/or of an aortic dissections extension at 1 year. The secondary objectives are to\n      evaluate the link between fibrosis biomarkers MMP et TIMP) and the results of imaging\n      results (evolution of diameter and extension and results of PET-Scan imaging) Methods: 100\n      patients to be included in 3 years History of chronic type B aortic dissection, treated\n      medically, evolving since more than 1 month and less than 5 years.\n\n      Expected results: Prognostic contribution of 18FDG-PET-Scan and biomarkers for the\n      identification of patients at high risk of evolution. Elaboration of a decisional algorithm\n      about follow-up modalities of chronic aortic dissections. Demonstration of a correlation\n      between aortic diameter growth or aortic dissection extension and intensity of marker\n      fixation with 18-FDG-PET-Scan."
