Treatment repeats\n      every 4 weeks for a total of 6 courses unless disease progression or unacceptable toxicity\n      intervenes. The etoposide dose may be increased by 10% on subsequent courses if the white\n      blood cell and platelet nadirs on the previous course are at least 3,000 and 100,000,\n      respectively. Patients are followed every 2 months for 6 months, then every 3 months for 4.5\n      years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be entered over approximately 7 years if\n      there are 3-8 responses in the first 13 patients and 7-9 responses in the first 25 patients."
