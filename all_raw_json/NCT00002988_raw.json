Determine the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan administered in\n      combination with a fixed dose of carmustine in patients with recurrent primary malignant\n      glioma. II. Determine the toxic effects of irinotecan and carmustine in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of irinotecan. Patients receive irinotecan IV over\n      90 minutes weekly on weeks 1-4 and carmustine IV over 1 hour on weeks 1-6. Treatment\n      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6\n      patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is\n      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences\n      dose limiting toxicities.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-36 patients will be accrued for this study."
