this definition excludes ampullary cancers and all tumors of\n             mixed histology); cytological confirmation is not allowed on this study, as tissue is\n             needed for correlative science; fresh tissue (mandatory) AND paraffin embedded tissue\n             (positron emission tomography [PET]) from tumor blocks (if available) will be\n             required from patients before enrolling on this study\n\n          -  Patients will be required to undergo a biopsy prior to enrolling on the study and\n             will be given the option to have another biopsy around 4 weeks from initiation of\n             treatment\n\n          -  Patients must have measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria, defined as at least one\n             lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to\n             be recorded) as >= 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan (CT scan slice\n             thickness no greater than 5 mm);

for this reason and because AZD6244\n             hydrogen sulfate and MK-2206 is known to be teratogenic, women of childbearing\n             potential and men must use two forms of contraception (hormonal or barrier method of\n             birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study\n             participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or\n             her partner is participating in this study, the patient should inform the treating\n             physician immediately\n\n          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\n          -  Ability to swallow oral tablets and capsules\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy, biologic therapy, or immunotherapy, within 4\n             weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those\n             who have not recovered from adverse events to a grade 1 or less due to agents\n             administered more than 4 weeks earlier\n\n          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents\n\n          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial\n             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic\n             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events\n\n          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic\n             composition to MK-2206 or AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate or other agents used in the study\n\n          -  Preclinical studies demonstrated the potential of MK-2206 for induction of\n             hyperglycemia in all preclinical species tested; patients with diabetes or in risk\n             for hyperglycemia should not be excluded from trials with MK-2206, but the\n             hyperglycemia should be well controlled on oral agents before the patient enters the\n             trial\n\n          -  Preclinical studies indicated transient changes in corrected QT (QTc) interval during\n             MK-2206 treatment; prolongation of QTc interval is potentially a safety concern while\n             on MK-2206 therapy; cardiovascular: baseline corrected QT by Fridericia's formula\n             (QTcF) > 450 msec (male) or QTcF > 470 msec (female) will exclude patients from entry\n             on study;

developmental and reproductive toxicity\n             studies of MK-2206 and AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate have not been performed thus far;\n             women of child-bearing potential and men participating in clinical studies of AZD6244\n             hydrogen sulfate and MK-2206 must use appropriate contraception, including abstinence\n             and double-barrier methods, throughout AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate and MK-2206 therapy;\n             in preclinical mutagenicity studies, ADZ6244 hydrogen sulfate and MK-2206 were\n             neither genotoxic or mutagenic; because there is an unknown but potential risk for\n             adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with AZD6244\n             hydrogen sulfate and MK-2206, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is\n             treated with AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate and MK 2206\n\n          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral\n             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with\n             AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate and MK-2206; in addition, these patients are at increased\n             risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate\n             studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy\n             when indicated\n\n          -  Patients requiring strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) or\n             those receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP\n             450 3A4 are ineligible"
