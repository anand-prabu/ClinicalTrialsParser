Conventional hormone therapy by oral route\n      has been used for relieving menopausal symptoms. Transdermal estrogens have not been used\n      extensively in Brazilian women with menopausal symptomatology, however; recently a previous\n      long term study has indicated no increased risk breast cancer or vasomotor disorders in\n      menopausal women, using transdermal HRT."
