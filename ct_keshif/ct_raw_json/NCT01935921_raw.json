Monoclonal antibodies, such as\n      ipilimumab and cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability\n      of tumors to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry\n      tumor-killing substances to them. Specialized radiation therapy, such as IMRT, that delivers\n      a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less\n      damage to normal tissue. Giving ipilimumab together with cetuximab and IMRT may kill more\n      tumor cells."

To estimate the clinical response of patients with high- or intermediate-risk, locally\n      advanced HNSCC treated with above regimen using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors\n      (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.\n\n      II. To estimate the 2-year progression-free survival of patients with high- or\n      intermediate-risk, locally advanced HNSCC treated with the above regimen.\n\n      III.

To estimate the association by dose-response modeling between dose of Ipilimumab,\n      clinical response and biomarkers.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ipilimumab.\n\n      Patients receive cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 60-120 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.\n      Treatment with cetuximab repeats every 4 weeks for 2 courses.
