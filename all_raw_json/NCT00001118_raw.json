Doctors hope to better treat HIV by adding T-20 to anti-HIV drug\n      combinations that include 1 or 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus a\n      nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and/or a protease inhibitor (PI)."

            "textblock": "T-20 is the first drug to be developed which specifically inhibits the function of the gp41\n      transmembrane glycoprotein. By inhibiting the essential protein-protein surface interaction,\n      T-20 is able to block the process of virus-to-host cell membrane fusion. Combination\n      antiretroviral regimens (reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus PIs) have benefited many HIV\n      patients, but heavily pretreated patients often develop multi-drug resistance via multiple\n      gene mutations. A pharmacologic agent, such as T-20, that is effective at an alternative\n      point in the virus replication cycle will make a valuable addition to the treatment of HIV\n      infection.\n\n      This Phase I/II open-label, dose-escalating, randomized study is divided into 2 parts.\n      Patients may participate in Part A and/or Part B. Part A (single dosing): 12 patients are\n      sequentially assigned to receive 1 of 3 doses of T-20 given once on Day 0 by SC injection\n      into the abdomen, deltoid area, or anterior aspect of the thigh and once on Day 1 by IV\n      infusion. Provided safety criteria are met, patients who complete Part A, or new enrollees\n      who did not participate in Part A, enroll in Part B. Doses for Part B are determined by\n      pharmacokinetic data obtained in Part A. [AS PER AMENDMENT 4/20/00: Current data has now\n      projected a pediatric dose. Each child will move to chronic dosing in Part B provided the\n      child has no Grade 3 or higher toxicity to study drug through Day 7 in Part A.] Part B\n      (multiple dosing): Patients are randomly assigned to 1 of 3 dose cohorts to receive 24 weeks\n      [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/7/00: 48 weeks] of treatment (optional extension to 48 weeks [AS PER\n      AMENDMENT 12/7/00: 96 weeks]) with bid SC injections of T-20. Cohort 1 receives the dose\n      identified in Part A (Dose 1) as the lowest dose that is well tolerated and that achieves\n      the target trough plasma concentration. Cohort 2 receives the next higher dose from Dose 1\n      (Dose 2). Cohort 3 receives either Dose 1 or Dose 2, depending on the tolerability and\n      antiviral activity of each dose. [AS PER AMENDMENT 4/20/00: Cohort 1 receives 30 mg/m2 SC\n      bid (Dose 1); Cohort 2 receives 60 mg/m2 SC bid (Dose 2); and Cohort 3 receives Dose 1 or 2\n      SC bid.] On Day 7 of T-20 dosing, children begin a new antiretroviral therapy regimen chosen\n      by the site investigator based on study parameters. (Abacavir and amprenavir are not allowed\n      for this regimen.) [AS PER AMENDMENT 1/6/00: Abacavir and amprenavir are now allowed.] The\n      first injection will be given in the clinic and a parent/guardian will be trained to give\n      successive injections. [AS PER AMENDMENT 4/20/00: The 2 doses given prior to obtaining\n      trough levels on Days 1 and 7 must be directly observed by medical personnel.] Patients\n      undergo clinical and laboratory evaluations to monitor viral load, HIV-related symptoms, and\n      pharmacokinetics at time points throughout the study. Patients participating in Part A are\n      evaluated at the clinic on Days 0, 1, and 7. Patients participating in Part B are evaluated\n      at the clinic 6 times during the first 3 weeks and then every 4 weeks through Week 24. [AS\n      PER AMENDMENT 12/7/00: Patients participating in Part B are evaluated at the clinic 6 times\n      during the first 3 weeks, every 4 weeks through Week 24, and then every 8 weeks through Week\n      48.]"
