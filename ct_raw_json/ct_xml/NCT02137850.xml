          -  Male, age below 6 years of age at the time of signing informed consent

          -  Diagnosis of severe haemophilia A (FVIII activity level  1%) based on medical records
             or central laboratory results

          -  No prior use of purified clotting factor products (5 previous exposures to blood
             components is acceptable)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any history of FVIII inhibitor (defined by medical records)

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to trial product or related products
