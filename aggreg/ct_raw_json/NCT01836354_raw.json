            "textblock": "Stroke and its risk factors disproportionately affect minority populations, and secondary\n      stroke prevention programs have had relatively little success. TIA and mild stroke patients\n      with few after-affects also stay in the hospital for a shorter period of time, and leave\n      without enough information about their risk for another stroke. Additionally, mild stroke\n      and TIA patients often do not follow-up with neurologists after they leave the hospital.\n      DESERVE is a discharge education study using  health workers to enroll and randomly assign\n      800 subjects from MSSM, MSSM Queens and CUMC diagnosed with Transient Ischemic attack (TIA\n      ), mild Ischemic stroke (IS) or mild Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH) to either risk factor\n      education or usual care. Those patients assigned to education will receive education on\n      stroke preparedness education plus risk factor reduction education, and help accessing\n      follow up care with health workers.  This education includes a power point presentation and\n      a patient-paced workbook and video on Risk perception, Medication Adherence, and\n      Patient-Physician Communication. To target the most appropriate mild IS/ICH  and TIA\n      survivors for participation in this proposal, we will focus on survivors with mild stroke\n      and TIA, excluding those whose stroke deficits are severe enough to warrant discharge to a\n      nursing home or to require 24-hour care.\n\n      Those patients assigned to usual care will receive written stroke preparedness education.\n      This protocol will evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention to reduce blood pressure,\n      and individual stroke risk factors and future stroke risk.  Additionally, we will evaluate\n      the ability of the these strategies to conduct education to affect positive change in taking\n      medications as directed, stroke knowledge 6 months and 12 months after hospital admission,\n      attendance at follow-up health care appointments, and cost-effectiveness.  After 1 year\n      participants will be followed quarterly for up to 3 years to track events."
