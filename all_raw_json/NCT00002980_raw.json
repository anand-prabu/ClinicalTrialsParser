Describe the side effects and toxicity of DAC at the doses\n      studied. III. Determine the steady state DAC serum levels at the doses studied. IV. Document\n      any clinical responses to DAC.\n\n      OUTLINE: A dose escalation schedule for the administration of decitabine (DAC) is being used\n      to determine the MTD and biologically active dose. Patients are given two 12 hour continuous\n      infusions per day, for 3 days at each dose level. A minimum of 3 patients are enrolled at\n      each dose level until dose limiting toxicity (DLT) or biologic activity is observed. If DLT\n      or biologic activity is observed at a particular dose level, an additional 3 patients are\n      enrolled, for a total of 6. If 2 or more patients experience DLT, dose escalation is ceased.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24 patients will be accrued for this study."
