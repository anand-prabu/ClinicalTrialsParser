This dose aims at increasing\n      the deficient AAT serum levels just above a predetermined \"safety threshold\" of 11 uM.\n      However, normal levels of AAT are between 25-50 uM.\n\n      AAT has shown not only to inhibit lung proteases such as neutrophil elastase, but also to\n      modulate inflammation. Given that many subjects with AATD who receive augmentation therapy\n      still have significant lung disease and inflammation, this study will evaluate whether\n      doubling the dose to 120 mg/kg/week has an effect in decreasing lung inflammation.\n\n      Only the dosing of 60 mg/kg /week has received FDA approval. FDA has granted an IND number\n      to this study to test the higher dose of 120 mg/kg/week.\n\n      The study will evaluate systemic (serum) and pulmonary (bronchoscopy samples)markers of\n      inflammation in 3 phases: standard dose (4 weeks), double dose (4 weeks) and standard dose\n      (4 weeks)."

This inflammation can be further reduced with\n      higher AAT dosing.\n\n      The study will enroll 20 subjects with AATD and COPD already receiving augmentation therapy\n      with any brand at standard doses for at least a month. For inclusion and exclusion criteria\n      see below.\n\n      Protocol:\n\n      The study will take place over approximately 12 weeks: a month receiving Zemaira at standard\n      dose (60 mg/kg/week), a month at double dose (120 mg/kg/week) and a month at standard dose\n      (60 mg/kg/week). The infusions at standard doses will be done at home and infusions with\n      higher doses will be provided at the study site.\n\n      the study involves scheduled blood draws for clinical labs and serum for research samples.\n      At the end of each phase a bronchoscopy will be performed (3 in total) to obtain research\n      samples (lung lavage, brushings and endobronchial biopsies).\n\n      The first bronchoscopy after receiving 4 weeks of standard augmentation therapy will assess\n      the \"residual\" inflammation that may be present despite augmentation therapy. The second\n      bronchoscopy after double dose augmentation therapy phase will be to assess changes\n      (decreases) in inflammatory markers. The third bronchoscopy after resuming standard dosing\n      is to assess if inflammation returned to baseline levels (required for proof of concept).\n\n      There will be approximately 9 visits to the study clinic. This study does not include\n      placebo (no active drug) treatment. Besides blood draws and bronchoscopy, the study will\n      include questionnaires, lung function testing and urine sample testings."
