            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to use both, liver pump treatment and systemic chemotherapy, to\n      assess the effects this type of treatment has on the patient and the tumor. Liver pump\n      treatment uses a metal pump that is surgically placed in the abdomen and gives chemotherapy\n      directly to the liver. Systemic chemotherapy gives chemotherapy through a vein\n      [intravenously (IV)] and treats the whole body. This type of treatment has been done before\n      and had shown that people with both pump and systemic chemotherapy had improved results. The\n      investigators hope that this combination of treatments improves the response to chemotherapy\n      and reduces the spread of the disease.\n\n      Another purpose of this study is to learn the clinical importance of a specific type of MRI\n      scan. The investigators would like to see if this type of MRI will help predict the response\n      to the treatment and see if they could help the physician with their treatment plan. These\n      scans will be done at specific time points.\n\n      The last purpose of this study is to learn more about how the tumor interacts with the\n      chemotherapy. This will be done through a biopsy taken during surgery and blood draws at\n      specific time points."
