Patients with partial response or stable disease may continue treatment.\n      Patients achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for an additional 8 months\n      after reaching CR.\n\n      Tumors are measured every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
