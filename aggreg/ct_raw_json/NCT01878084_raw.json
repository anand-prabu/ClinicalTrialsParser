            "textblock": "Bioactive glass has long been known as a bone graft substitute capable of bone augmentation.\n      The current proposal introduces a newly tailored bioactive glass scaffold with multi-scale\n      porosity prepared using the sol-gel technique to regenerate bone in extraction sockets with\n      the aim of preserving the alveolar ridge.  This novel material has the potential to enhance\n      angiogenesis and osteogenesis thereby preserving the overall height and width of the\n      alveolar bone by regenerating new bone that closely mimics the adjacent healthy one. Thirty\n      patients requiring myofunctional therapy including premolar extraction as part of a two\n      stage orthodontic treatment (class II division I) will be enrolled in this phase I/II\n      clinical study. Patients will undergo extraction of their maxillary and mandibular premolar\n      teeth. This will serve as a split-mouth study where on one side the extraction sockets will\n      be left empty while on the other side they will receive the bioactive glass as a bone graft\n      substitute.  Clinical and radiographic assessment of healing will be performed at the\n      following time intervals; 1,2,4,12,24 weeks. Clinical criteria will include scoring for\n      pain, inflammation, and occurrence of any post-operative complications using a well-defined\n      scoring system. Radiographic assessment will monitor the changes in crestal bone height and\n      bone mineral density. Computed tomographic scans will also be taken preoperatively and at 6\n      months for each patient for 3D assessment of bone changes. A core biopsy will also be taken\n      after informed consent at the 6 months time-point to evaluate the quality and quantity of\n      new bone formed."
