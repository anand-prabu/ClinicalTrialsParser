Assess the risks and benefits of\n      this intervention.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Participants are\n      stratified by participating institution. Participants are randomly assigned to receive\n      either oral tamoxifen or oral placebo every day for 5 years in the absence of breast cancer\n      development or pregnancy. Participants are followed every 6 months for 5 years; then\n      annually for 5 years. Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 7,000 women will be entered at a rate of 200-500 women/institution/5\n      years."
