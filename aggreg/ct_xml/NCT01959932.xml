  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the study is to evaluate if the ad libitum use of the THS 2.2 for 5 days
      by adult healthy smokers results in a reduction in the levels of biomarkers of exposure for
      selected harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) compared to smoking
      conventional cigarettes and smoking abstinence.
