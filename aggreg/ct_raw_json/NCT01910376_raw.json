            "textblock": "Cancer is a disease of the elderly. Cancer incidence is 11-fold higher in persons over the\n      age of 65, than in younger ones. Approximately 60% of all cancers and 70% of cancer\n      mortality occurs in people older than 65 years. Moreover, due to the aging of the population\n      in the Western world the number of elderly people is expected to increase and therefore the\n      number of older cancer patients is expected to rise. Despite this rapid increase in cancer\n      incidence and cancer-related mortality with age, our knowledge about ageing and cancer and\n      about optimal treatment for older cancer patients is still far from adequate. Therefore, it\n      is clear that cancer in the elderly is a major and increasing health problem. A key problem\n      in geriatric oncology research is the important selection bias because very old/frail\n      patients, are very rarely included in clinical trials.\n\n      Changes in the patterns of health care delivery have shifted the care of the elderly from\n      acute care settings to the community and long-term care facilities. As the European\n      population ages, more and more people will become nursing home residents, many of whom will\n      have a suspicion of, or be diagnosed with, and eventually die from, cancer. Although cancer\n      is very common in elderly nursing home residents, it is poorly studied. This lack of\n      information may impact on clinical decision making and the appropriateness of treatments\n      offered and therefore collection of this information is needed.\n\n      This project has two main objectives. The first objective is to report on demographics,\n      referral patterns and motives for non-referral, anti-cancer treatments and outcome of\n      patients in nursing homes with suspected or diagnosed active invasive cancer where a\n      diagnostic or treatment decision has to be taken. The second objective is to develop better\n      prognostic tools (for survival) including biological markers of ageing to help treatment\n      decisions in the elderly."
