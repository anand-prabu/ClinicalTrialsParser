  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In pre-clinical study we found that the thioredoxin reductase activity of serum harbours
      huge difference between cancer patients and non-cancer patients, the enzyme activity
      elevated remarkably among cancer patients, and after any kind of treatment serum thioredoxin
      reductase activity declined remarkably, so we hypothesis that serum thioredoxin reductase
      activity could be a warning marker for early progression of first-line treatment for
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer

      This is a cooperative research project involving patients in Medical Oncology Department of
      Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Xiangya School of Medicine Central South University, and the
      State Key Laboratory for Natural Medicine and Biomimetic Drugs Perking University. The
      primary objective is to measure the thioredoxin reductase activity using blood in subjects
      received platinum based chemotherapy, to study the warning progression ability of
      thioredoxin reductase in blood. The secondary objective is to compare the warning
      progression activity of blood thioredoxin reductase reductase activity with carcinoembryonic
      antigen in subjects received platinum based first-line chemotherapy. Blood will be collected
      before chemotherapy, after every 2 cycles of chemotherapy, every 3 months after all
      first-line chemotherapy till 2 years, then every 6 months till 3 years, or collect blood
      till tumor progression, evaluation CT results every time collecting blood samples.
