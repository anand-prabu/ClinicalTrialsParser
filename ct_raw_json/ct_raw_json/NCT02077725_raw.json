Team visits, including complete medication reviews, by\n      pharmacists and physicians within a National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) tier 3\n      patient-centered medical home (PCMH) at an academic medical center, can improve medication\n      regimens. Secondary objectives include (1) measuring each patient's quality of life at\n      baseline and one month post-intervention and (2) tracking the cost of medication additions\n      and discontinuations.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      Patients taking ten or more chronic medications will be identified for referral to the\n      polypharmacy clinic from a report generated from the electronic medical record.  The\n      polypharmacy clinic will be staffed by a pharmacist and medical resident with oversight from\n      an attending physician who specializes in geriatrics. Drug-related problems identified\n      during the visit will be resolved and categorized based upon indication, efficacy, cost,\n      safety, and compliance.  The numbers and types of interventions made, both during the\n      primary visit and anticipated in the future, will be tracked. The 12-item short form (SF-12)\n      survey will also be administered at baseline and one month post intervention. The increase\n      or decrease in cost for medications added and removed during these visits will be captured\n      using the average wholesale prices.\n\n      Preliminary Results Using descriptive statistics, the types of drug-related problems\n      identified and interventions made will be reported. Changes in quality of life and monthly\n      medication costs will also be described."
