In addition, PPI\n      produces bone fracture, community pneumonia and diarrhea in patient with long-term use.\n\n      Wu-Chu-Yu tang consists of Evodia fargesii Dode (Evodia Fruit), Panax ginseng C. (Ginseng),\n      Ziziphus jujube Mill (Chinses Date), Zingiber officinale Rosee (Fresh Ginger). According to\n      \"I-Fang-Chi-Chieh\" and \"Shanghonzobinglun\" recordings that Wu-Chu-Yu tang can treat\n      vomiting, and also can relax gastric tonicity and can enhance peristalsis of stomach.\n\n      Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of Wu-Chu-Yu\n      tang on GRED, and this effect of Wu-Chu-Yu tang compared to PPI Omeprazole."
