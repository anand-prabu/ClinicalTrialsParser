After first-line treatment, temozolomide will be given alone as maintenance therapy in all patients who have achieved study entry hematologic criteria and who do not have progressive disease or severe toxicity. During temozolomide maintenance therapy, patients will receive temozolomide at  150mg/m2/d for 5 days of a 28-day cycle orally daily. Temozolomide maintenance therapy will continue until progressive disease or irreversible toxicity occurs.\nRe-staging will be performed every 2 cycles (every 8 weeks) during the study"
