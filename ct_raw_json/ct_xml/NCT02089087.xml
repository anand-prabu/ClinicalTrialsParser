  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human study to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,
      and pharmacodynamics of single intravenous and subcutaneous doses of CFZ533 in healthy
      subjects and intravenous doses in rheumatoid arthritis patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Healthy Volunteer only study originally, but after an amendment to protocol,
      rheumatoid arthritis patients will be starting 7-Mar-2014 and thus, the protocol is now
      registered.
