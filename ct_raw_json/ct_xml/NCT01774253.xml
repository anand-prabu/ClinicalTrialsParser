  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate an investigational drug (Vismodegib) for
      Pontine Glioma that is growing or has come back (reoccurred). This study will look at the
      tumors response to the study drug, Vismodegib, and will also look at the safety and
      tolerability of Vismodegib.

      Vismodegib has been tested in multiple adult clinical trials and one pediatric trial.
      Laboratory testing in pontine gliomas suggests that this drug may be effective in treating
      this disease.
