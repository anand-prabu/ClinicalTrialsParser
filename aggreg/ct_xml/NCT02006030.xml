  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Certain cancers require the amino acid arginine. Arginine deiminase (ADI) is an enzyme from
      microbes that degrade arginine. ADI has been formulated with polyethylene glycol and has
      been used to treat patients that have cancers that require arginine. In this study, the
      investigators will evaluate the response rate, as determined by the revised International
      Working Group recommendations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior diagnosis of HCC confirmed clinically or histologically or cytologically. A
             clinical diagnosis of HCC requires the following: (i) positive for hepatitis B or C
             and/or evidence of liver cirrhosis, (ii) presence of hepatic tumor(s) with image
             findings (sonography, CT or MRI) compatible with HCC, (iii) no evidence of other
             gastrointestinal tumors, and (iv) persistent elevation of serum alpha-fetoprotein
             (AFP) level ≥ 400 ng/ml without any evidence of an existing AFP-secreting germ cell
             tumor.

          2. Solitary hepatic tumor &lt;8 cm in diameter or multifocal disease as evidenced by CT or
             MRI scan. Tumor volume ≥50% of liver organ or infiltrating HCC should be excluded.

          3. Not a candidate for surgical resection or ablation of the tumor.

          4. The target lesion must not have been treated previously with local therapy, including
             TACE. Prior local therapy (radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol injection,
             cryoablation, or surgery) to nontarget lesions is acceptable.

          5. The subject must have received no more than 2 TACE (n≤ 2) or the previous TACE was
             performed longer than 6 months before enrollment.

          6. Local therapy must have been completed at least 4 weeks before baseline scan.

          7. Measurable disease using mRECIST criteria (Appendix A) and RECIST (Appendix B)
             criteria. At least 1 measurable lesion must be present.

          8. Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging classification B (intermediate stage)
             (Appendix C). That is, multinodular asymptomatic tumors, without extra-hepatic spread
             (second branch invasion of the unilateral lobe is not allowed).

          9. ECOG performance status of 0 - 1 (Appendix E).

         10. Cirrhotic status of Child-Pugh grade A and B7. Child-Pugh status should be determined
             based on clinical findings and laboratory data during the screening period (Appendix
             D). Subjects on anti-coagulants are to receive only 1 point for their INR status.

         11. Expected survival of at least 3 months.

         12. Age ≥ 18 years.

         13. Fully recovered from prior major surgery and none within 2 weeks prior to week 1
             visit. Liver biopsy for HCC confirmation is allowed.

         14. Female subjects of childbearing age and male subjects must be asked to use
             appropriate contraception for both the male and female for the duration of the study.
             Subjects must agree to use two forms of contraception or agree to refrain from
             intercourse for the duration of the study. Females must not be pregnant at the start
             of the study, and a serum human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) pregnancy test must be
             negative before entry into the study.

         15. Informed consent must be obtained prior to study initiation.

         16. No concurrent investigational studies are allowed.

         17. Total bilirubin &lt; 2.5 mg/dL and no evidence of bile obstruction.

         18. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤5 x upper
             limit of normal range.

         19. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1,500/µL.

         20. Platelets &gt;50,000/µL.

         21. Serum uric acid ≤ 8 mg/dL (with or without medication control).

         22. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of normal range, or, if serum creatinine
             &gt;1.5 x the upper limit of normal range, then the creatinine clearance must be ≥ 60
             mL/min.

         23. Serum albumin level ≥ 3.0 g/dl.

         24. Prothrombin time (PT)-international normalized ratio (INR): PT &lt;3 seconds above
             control or INR &lt;1.7.

         25. Subjects with active hepatitis B or C on anti-viremic compounds may remain on such
             treatment, except for interferon.

         26. Encephalopathy - none or mild (grade 1 or 2, by Child-Pugh classification); lactulose
             of other supportive care allowed.

         27. Ascites - absent or slight (by Child-Pugh classification); diuretic therapy allowed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Candidate for potential curative therapies (i.e., resection or transplantation).

          2. Prior allograft transplantation including liver transplantation.

          3. Significant cardiac disease (New York Heart Association Class III or IV; Appendix F).

          4. Serious infection requiring treatment with systemically administered antibiotics.

          5. Pregnancy or lactation.

          6. Expected non-compliance.

          7. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active

             or IV), unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness or
             social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          8. Subjects who have had any anticancer treatment within 2 weeks prior to week 1 visit.

          9. Subjects who have not fully recovered from toxicities associated with previous HCC

             resected non-melanoma skin cancer; b) curatively treated cervical carcinoma in situ;
             or c) other primary solid tumor with no known active disease present in the opinion
             of the investigator will not affect patient outcome in the setting of current HCC
             diagnosis.

         11. Subjects who had been treated with ADI-PEG 20 previously.

         12. Allergy to pegylated products.

             albumin preparation, or granulocyte colony stimulating factors (G-CSF) within 7 days
             prior to screening laboratories or after screening laboratories have been obtained
             until week 1 visit.

         18. Use of traditional medicines approved by local authorities, including but not limited
             to Chinese herbs within 2 weeks prior to week 1 visit.
