Specialized\n      radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more\n      tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as\n      cisplatin and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by\n      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as\n      cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells\n      to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or transmit tumor killing\n      molecules to them. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy is more effective when\n      given with cisplatin, docetaxel, or cetuximab and docetaxel."
