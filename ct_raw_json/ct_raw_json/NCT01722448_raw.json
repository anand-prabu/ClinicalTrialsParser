Before the begin of the\n      supplementation study and after 3 and 6 weeks the investigators will test response to the\n      exercise challenge and ask that all consumed foods are recorded."

Participants of the\n      intervention study will also have to be complete interviews on the final three days of the\n      two intervention periods The recruited candidates will do an initial exercise challenge with\n      no intervention, then a second challenge after three weeks with the first supplement\n      (randomized choline or placebo), then a third challenge after another three weeks with the\n      complementary second supplement (choline if they had placebo first, placebo if they had\n      choline first).\n\n      Samples identified only by code will be stored indefinitely at the UNC Nutrition Research\n      Institute to permit the analysis of additional genetic markers related to muscle health and\n      choline metabolism when the capacity for the analysis of such markers becomes available.\n      Such analyses may be carried out at the University of North Carolina Nutrition Research\n      Institute (UNC NRI) or at external laboratories providing the service for the PI. Samples\n      will be destroyed once no such additional analyses are intended or feasible anymore or if\n      the investigators do not continue this research. Storage of the samples is not optional."
