    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate how treatment with Kinetic Oscillation Stimulation
      (KOS) in the nasal cavity in patients with non-allergic rhinitis can be optimized to
      minimize any patient reported discomfort during treatment procedure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with persistent (&gt;12w) symptoms of idiopathic rhinitis dominated by nasal
             congestion (± secretion) for an average of at least 1 h per day for at least 5 days
             during a period of 14 days

          -  Having nasal congestion as major symptom, and a nasal congestion score of at least 2
             (scale 0-3)

          -  Male or female 18 - 65 years

          -  Judged by the Investigator as suitable for participation in the study without safety
             concerns based on medical history and physical examination

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent prior to participation in the
             clinical investigation

          -  Willing and able to comply with all study related procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with Allergic rhinitis, demonstrated by either positive skin prick test,

          -  Ongoing respiratory tract infection including nasal cavity at inclusion (treatment
             visit 1)

          -  Systemic steroid treatment less than 4 weeks before the inclusion in the study

          -  Patients with a history of nasal surgery like: septoplasty, cosmetic surgery, conchal

          -  Any disease, condition (medical or surgical) which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, might compromise the study results, or would place the subject at
             increased risk

          -  Any implant with an electrical and/or neurostimulator device, including but not
             limited to cardiac pacemaker, defibrillator, vagal neurostimulator, deep brain
             stimulation, spinal stimulator, bone growth stimulator, or cochlear implant or any
             other implant in the head-, and neck region
