  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The need for low vision services (LVS) will increase exponentially over the coming years due
      to the anticipated and exponential growth in the ageing population in Singapore and a rise
      in chronic non-communicable eye diseases. Finding the best evidenced-based management for
      chronic eye diseases contributing to low vision (LV) is therefore crucial. Improving patient
      responsibility is the key to managing LV effectively.1 This means achieving optimum self
      management (SM).2 However, there are currently no LV SM programs in Singapore and none has
      been evaluated using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design,  the gold standard methods
      to evaluate health interventions.

      The aims of this study are to assess the effectiveness of the 'Living Successfully with Low
      Vision (LSLV)' program in improving quality of life (QoL) in 160 elderly people with LV
      attending the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC) LV clinic. Of these, 80 will be randomly
      allocated to receive the LSLV 4-week SM program while the remaining 80 will receive the
      usual care. Comparisons will be made to determine the efficacy of the LSLV program. QoL,
      self-efficacy, emotional well being, and vision-specific distress will be assessed 2 weeks
      after training, and at six months and 12 months post intervention.

      This study will be the first evidenced-based RCT investigating the effectiveness of a novel
      vision-specific self-management strategy to improve QoL. It will also adopt a longitudinal
      design where the effectiveness of these interventions will be evaluated at 12 months-the
      first follow-up assessment of that duration at both national and international levels.
      Furthermore this will be the first study to characterize and profile the patients where the
      effect of the program did not demonstrate an improvement in both primary and secondary
      outcomes six months after its completion. The future clinical implications of this study
      include the potential to implement a successful model of LV rehabilitation in other tertiary
      centres around the country.

    <description>Intervention: The program will work with participants to choose a specific and achievable goal they wish to achieve, involve participants in the learning process, provide information, explore experiences with low vision, and solutions to develop problem solving skills to enhance self efficacy. Participants will learn new techniques to cope with their activities of daily living. In addition to this, local guest experts in the field will be sourced and invited to provide training in aspects of low vision care.</description>
