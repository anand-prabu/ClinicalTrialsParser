      The proposed study seeks to test the efficacy of an intervention to reduce suicide behaviors
      in veterans. The Veterans Coping Long Term with Active Suicide Program (CLASP-VA) is an
      innovative, telephone-based intervention that combines elements of individual therapy, case
      management, and significant other/family therapy and is designed to be integrated into a VA
      system.

    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed study is to test an adjunctive intervention to reduce suicide
      behaviors and re-hospitalization in military veterans at risk for suicidal behavior. Suicide
      is one of the leading causes of death for military personnel and for the first time in
      recorded history the rates of military suicides are exceeding civilian rates. Despite the
      public and patient health costs associated with suicidal ideation and behavior, existing
      efforts have not appreciably reduced the rates of suicidal behavior in the military.
      Consequently, finding novel efficacious and acceptable methods to reduce suicide behaviors
      is of great military health relevance and should be a fundamental goal of clinical research
      with military veterans. The Veterans Coping Long Term with Active Suicide Program (CLASP-VA)
      is an adjunctive intervention, modified specifically for VA patients and health care system
      that combines aspects of problem-solving therapy, case management, family support, and
      assessment. The program is a 6-month, telephone-based program designed for patients at risk
      for suicidal behavior. The program is designed to be easily integrated into the VA's current
      system and will integrate with, and compliment the role of the National Suicide Coordinator.

      The primary objective of this study is to test the efficacy of CLASP-VA in a sample of
      veterans at risk for suicide behavior. A sample of at-risk veterans will be randomly
      assigned to either the CLASP-VA intervention or to a Enhanced Treatment as Usual control
      condition, composed of usual VA care, including safety planning and brief telephone
      follow-up by the Suicide Coordinator, plus regular assessments and feedback to treating
      clinicians. Participants will be assessed at the end of the active intervention phase (3 and
      6 months post-discharge from the hospital) and again at 9 and 12 months post discharge.
      Efficacy of the program will be determined by several primary outcomes including number of
      attempts, number of re-hospitalizations, severity and chronicity of suicidal ideation.
      Secondary analyses will be conducted to help identify the types of patients who will receive
      the most benefit from the CLASP-VA intervention.
