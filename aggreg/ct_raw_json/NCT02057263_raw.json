Adjuvants boost immune responses and are commonly\n      included in vaccine preparations. Bisphosphonates are the most commonly prescribed treatment\n      for osteoporosis and may represent a new class of adjuvant. Bisphosphonates are well\n      tolerated with chronic administration and have very few adverse effects. Research suggests\n      that these medications can stimulate the immune system.\n\n      Bisphosphonates are of special interest in populations with impaired immunity and an\n      inability to amount protective antibody responses following immunizations. We propose a\n      pilot study to evaluate the clinical relevance of this finding in humans.  We will study the\n      effect of bisphosphonates on quantitative humoral immune response to hepatitis B vaccine in\n      healthy older volunteers who have not previously received this vaccine."
