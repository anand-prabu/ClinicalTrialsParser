  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The spontaneous breathing test (SBT) is routinely performed on all intubated patients in the
      NICU who are potential candidates for extubation from mechanical ventilatory support.  For
      all parents who consent, the routine SBT will be performed on all infants.  In addition to
      the routine SBT the following will occur:

        1. work of breathing indices: obtained non-invasively through respiratory inductive
           plethysmography (RIP).

        2. Performing the SBT in the prone position, in addition to the routine position (supine).
