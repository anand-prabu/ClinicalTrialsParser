However, these cardiovascular rehabilitation\n      programs are scarce and only a small fraction of the population who needs has access. So, it\n      is pertinent to the displacement of these programs to the community context.\n\n      Obesity has become a truly global epidemic among children and adults, as well as changing\n      the metabolic profile: when occurs an excessive accumulation of adipose tissue (mainly\n      central distribution) there are a set of changes / adjustments to the cardiac structure and\n      function. The electrical stimulation of abdominal subcutaneous (electrolipolysis) is a\n      procedure often used in physical therapy clinics to reduce waist circumference. However, the\n      effectiveness of this intervention, the selection of parameters, and the duration of its\n      effects in cardiac patients are not yet clarified in the literature."
