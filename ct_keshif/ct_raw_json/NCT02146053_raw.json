Subjects were randomized into two treatment groups\n      (n=10/group) to receive either ferrous sulphate (200 mg capsules containing 65 mg of iron)\n      or placebo, both to be taken at mealtimes twice daily during the treatment period. Subjects\n      completed the questionnaires daily for 14 days. The questionnaire included gastrointestinal\n      symptoms commonly reported to be associated with the oral intake of ferrous iron salts (i.e.\n      nausea, vomiting, heartburn, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and constipation)."
