The Investigators hypothesize that individuals who lose a significant amount of\n      weight in response to the intervention will show a reduction in the brain response to food\n      cues as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as compared to those who do\n      not lose food. These changes in neuronal activity will be associated to physiologic and\n      behavioral measures."
