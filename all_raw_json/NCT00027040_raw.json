This will be examined\n      using noninvasive proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). The effect of the drug\n      selegiline on memory problems also will be examined."

This study proposes to non-invasively examine the pattern and extent of cerebral\n      injury associated with HIV infection and its response to selegiline by using 1H-MRS. The\n      following hypotheses will be tested: selegiline, a compound with antioxidant and\n      anti-apoptotic properties, will reverse the metabolic abnormalities measured by 1H-MRS, and\n      these changes will parallel the degree of improvement in cognitive and functional\n      performance.\n\n      This is a substudy of ACTG A5090. The pattern and extent of cerebral injury associated with\n      HIV infection and its response to selegiline are examined using a 1H-MRS. 1H-MRS evaluations\n      are performed at screening and Week 24 (or at the time of premature discontinuation) of Step\n      1 of A5090. The screening MRS exams may only be performed once all A5090 screening\n      evaluations (including the lumbar puncture) have been completed and it has been determined\n      that the patient is eligible for A5090 study entry.\n\n      The screening MRS must be performed prior to A5090 study drug administration. The Week-24\n      MRS must be performed while the patient is still on blinded study drug."
