    <textblock>
      Many patients suffer from devastating injuries to vascularized composite tissues.
      Vascularized composite tissues are blocs of functional tissue that can contain multiple
      tissue types such as bone, muscle, nerves, blood vessels, tendons, ligaments, and others.
      Examples of patients with severe vascularized composite tissue defects include limb
      amputees, patients with third-degree burns to the face or extremities, soldiers with
      improvised-explosive-device blast injuries to the face, and others. These patients cannot be
      helped satisfactorily with conventional reconstructive surgery; however, recently
      vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) such as transplantation of faces and limbs
      became available to this patients. Unfortunately, at this juncture, patients who receive VCA
      must submit to life-long regime of immunosuppressant drugs with serious side effects such as
      infection, renal toxicity and cancer. Immune tolerance is the absence of a destructive
      immune response from the recipient's body to the transplant, while otherwise maintaining
      sufficient immune function to fight infections and other threats. Transplant recipients with
      immune tolerance do not need to take immunosuppression drugs. The investigators believe that
      they can achieve immune tolerance in recipients of face and limb transplants.
