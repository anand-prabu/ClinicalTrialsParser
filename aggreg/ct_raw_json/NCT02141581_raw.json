This work may help in the improved design of new vaccines, both\n      for influenza and for other respiratory pathogens as well. Young adults, 18-30 years of age\n      who did not receive 2010-2011 seasonal influenza vaccine will be enrolled. They will be\n      randomly assigned to one of the three 2011-2012 licensed influenza vaccine [Fluzone\u00ae\n      2011-2012 Formula (IM), Fluzone\u00ae 2011-2012 Formula (ID) or Flumist\u00ae 2011-2012 Formula given\n      intranasally].  Blood samples to conduct the assays will be taken at pre-immunization, Day\n      7-8 and Day 28 post immunization. A small sub-set of 7 young adults, 18-49 years of age who\n      were not previously immunized with 2010-2011 seasonal influenza vaccine will be assigned to\n      receive Flumist\u00ae 2011-2012 Formula vaccine.
