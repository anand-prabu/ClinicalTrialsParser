Second year will invite diabetes and hypertension patients from\n      different phase of illness with different levels of health anxiety trait, meta-cognitive and\n      control strategies if derived different coping and emotions outcome. The third year will\n      design motivational psycho-education program for patients to alleviate the emotions and use\n      cold meta-cognition to due good health behavior and self care with their illness.
