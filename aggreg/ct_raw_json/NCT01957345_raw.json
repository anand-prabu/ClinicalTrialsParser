We hypothesize that such defects are under-diagnosed in patients, due to\n      heavy workup and requirement of relatively large blood sample by conventional biochemical\n      methods. We propose to analyse kinase signalling downstream platelet membrane receptors\n      using multiplex flow cytometry quantification and fluorescent platelet barcoding."

            "textblock": "Little is known of the molecular basis of disorders of signalling pathways potentially\n      responsible of constitutional defects of platelet functions (adhesion, aggregation or\n      secretion) (1-5). Indeed, in routine practice, this investigation is limited by the\n      complexity of the analyse using biochemical methods (western blotting), and the requirement\n      of large amount of platelets.\n\n      We have designed a new approach for the quantification of platelet cytoplasmic\n      phosphoproteins by flow cytometry. Fresh platelets in platelet rich plasma are analysed at\n      baseline or after stimulation by major agonists (ADP, TRAP, thromboxane analogue, or\n      collagen-related peptide), with and without relevant inhibitors of each pathway. Multiplex\n      barcoding is used to identify each condition, allowing a high throughput analysis (6, 7).\n      Platelet signalling profiling of Akt, Slp76, P38 MAPK and LIMK can be obtained from a blood\n      sample of less than 10 ml, and within 6h The main objective of the study is to standardize\n      the method between clinical laboratories with a standard expertise in flow cytometry. The\n      study will be performed in 4 academic hospitals members of the French reference network of\n      rare platelet diseases. Three groups of patients referred for mild or severe bleeding\n      disorders will be included: 1) a control group of patients (30 per centre) with a bleeding\n      disorder definitely other than of platelet origin (e.g. \"low\" von Willebrand); 2) a group of\n      10 patients per centre with definite constitutional platelet disorder (e.g. Glanzmann\n      thrombasthenia) and 3) a group of 10 patients per centre with a defect of platelet function\n      of unknown origin, potentially defective in signalling pathway.\n\n      The control group will serve to standardize the method between centres and to establish the\n      reference values. A quality control will be set up by using frozen platelet preparations.\n      The patients with definite platelet disorder will be useful for detecting potential\n      signalling defects still not described in these pathologies. Platelet signalling defects\n      which could be evidenced in these groups will be further identified by conventional\n      biochemical and molecular methods after confirmation on a new sample.\n\n      If this new approach can be proposed to clinical laboratories working on rare platelet\n      diseases, we expect an advance in our knowledge in the field. In addition the method has a\n      potential in pharmaceutical innovation, for identifying (8) or monitoring new antiplatelet\n      agents (9, 10), or identifying platelet defects induced by new \"target therapies\" designed\n      for other diseases such as cancer or immune pathologies (10)."
