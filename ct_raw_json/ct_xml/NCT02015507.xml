          -  Healthy subjects, as defined by no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a
             detailed medical history and full physical examination, including blood pressure and
             heart  rate measurement, standard 12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory tests.

             at screening and at the Day -1 Visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any illness, clinical condition, or other factor that, in the opinion of
             the investigator or the subject's general practitioner, might confound the results of
             the study or pose an additional risk in administering study drug(s) to the subject

          -  For female subjects: Pregnant or nursing subjects and female subjects of childbearing
             potential who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of contraception as
             outlined in this protocol. For male subjects: Subject has a female partner who is
             pregnant, nursing, or planning to become pregnant during the study or within 120 days
             after the last study drug dose.
