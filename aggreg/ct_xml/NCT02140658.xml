    <description>Statins Medication adherence at 3 months. Adherence is defined as continuation of prescribed statins medications except those stopped according to health care provider instructions. Subjects were contacted by research personnel at the coordinating center 3 months after stroke onset. Subjects who reported discontinuing statins medication were asked whether they chose to stop statins medication or were instructed to do so by a physician.</description>

    <description>Statins Medication persistence at 3 months. Persistence is defined as continuing statins medication therapy from discharge to the 3 months follow-up. Subjects prescribed statins medication at discharge but who were not taking statins medication at follow up were defined as &quot;nonpersistent&quot;. however, subjects were considered persistent if there was a switch to another type of statins medication.Subjects were contacted by research personnel at the coordinating center 3  months after stroke onset. Interviewers used standardized scripts to ascertain stroke prevention medication persistence.</description>
