This problem has been previously identified\n      with the use of the prior ARDS definitions, particularly in patients with milder severity of\n      illness.  Importantly, the chest x-ray criteria in the ARDS definition has demonstrated only\n      moderate reliability when applied by experts, although this can be improved through the use\n      of training radiographs (as will be used in this educational module).  The investigators\n      hypothesize that the training from the educational module will allow more accurate diagnosis\n      of ARDS by data collectors/study coordinators participating in the LUNG-SAFE study."
