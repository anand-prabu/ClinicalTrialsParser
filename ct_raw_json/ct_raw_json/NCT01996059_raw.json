How to improve the nutritional status of the patients\n      following total gastrectomy with gastrointestinal reconstruction arouses people's attention.\n      The purpose of this study was to evaluate differences of the nutritional status in patients\n      undergoing functional jejunal interposition and Roux-en-Y after total gastrectomy."
