    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes of using Er: YAG
      laser along with bone graft and barrier membrane  to conventional mechanical debridement
      also with bone graft and barrier membrane in the treatment of peri-implantitis infections.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients, aged 18 - 85 years

          -  Physical status according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I or II,
             which includes patients who are systemically healthy or suffer under mild to
             moderate, but well controlled systemic diseases.

          -  Patients having a minimum of 1 dental implant with peri-implantitis.

          -  The dental implant with peri-implantitis has ≥ 3 threads exposed or pocket probing
             depth (PPD) ≥ 5mm, with bleeding on probing (BOP) and/or suppuration (pus).

          -  The implants are in function for at least 6 months

          -  No uncontrolled systemic disease or condition known to alter bone metabolism, like
             Osteoporosis, Osteopenia, Hyperparathyroidism, Paget's disease.

          -  Only rough surface implant will be included in this study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Long-term use of antibiotics &gt; 2 weeks in the past two months

          -  No peri-implantitis treatment in the last 2 months

          -  Patients taking medications known to modify bone metabolism (such as bisphosphonates,
             corticosteroids, Hormone replacement therapy for menopausal women, Parathyroid
             hormone, Denosumab, strontium ranelate).

          -  Pregnant females or those planning to become pregnant.

          -  Patients with a history of medically diagnosed oral cancer, bisphosphonate usage,
             Sepsis or those having adverse outcomes to oral procedures in the past, will be
             excluded

          -  Mobility of dental implants

          -  History of alcoholism or drug abuse

          -  Current smokers or quit smoking less than 6 months

          -  Diseases of the immune system or any medical condition that may influence the outcome
             (uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c &gt;7)

          -  Patients with allergies known to affect one or more of the treatment provided in this
             study

          -  Polish surface implants

          -  Implants with trabecular surface
