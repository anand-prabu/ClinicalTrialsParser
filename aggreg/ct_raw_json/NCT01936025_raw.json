A lower dose (30 mg) will be given to see whether effects on insulin\n      secretion are present also at lower doses and then translate into a BG lowering action. A\n      higher dose (90 mg) will be added to see whether this way an effect on glucose excursion\n      reduction occurs following an OGTT, (like previously demonstrated with 270 mg DXM) that can\n      be related to an increase of insulin secretion."
