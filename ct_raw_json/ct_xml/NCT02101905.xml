    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies lapatinib tosylate before surgery in treating patients
      with recurrent high-grade glioma. Lapatinib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To achieve an intratumoral lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate) concentration of at least 1.5
      ÂµM in at least 70% of patients 3 hours after the last dose of pulsatile lapatinib. (Group A)
      II. To determine the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of pulsatile lapatinib (at pulsatile
      maximum tolerated dose [MTD]) on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation
      (using Mesoscale Discovery enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] assay for total and
      phospho-EGFR). (Group A and Reference Group)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety profile of pulsatile lapatinib in pre-operative patients with EGFR
      amplified recurrent high-grade glioma. (Group A and Reference Group) II. To determine the
      effect of lapatinib on tumor cell proliferation (marker of proliferation Ki-67 [KI-67]
      staining) (Group A compared to Reference Group).

      III. To determine the ex-vivo sensitivity of tumor sphere cultures to lapatinib. (Group A
      and Reference Group)

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

      GROUP A: Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -2 to
      0. Within 3-5 hours after last dose of lapatinib ditosylate, patients undergo surgery on day
      0.

      REFERENCE GROUP: Patients undergo surgery on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 30 days.
