    <description>This is a qualitative study and the outcome will be assessed by coding the transcripts of the goals of care discussions. We will use the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS) in which coders assign 1 of 37 mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories to each complete thought expressed (referred to as an utterance). Utterances are combined to reflect &quot;instrumental&quot; (e.g., biomedical exchange, psychosocial exchange, and partnership building) and &quot;affective&quot; behaviors (e.g., social conversation, positive and negative statements, and emotional statements). Additional global measures include patient-centeredness, verbal dominance, and tone.</description>
