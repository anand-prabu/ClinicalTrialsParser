The knowledge gained from this study may lead to a\n      better understanding of the biological mechanisms that contribute to persistent low back\n      pain and will inform future work to develop predictive measures of persistent low back pain\n      risk, evaluative measures to examine treatment efficacy, and possibly biomarker assay(s) to\n      identify patients who are at increased risk of persistent low back pain."

Compare (A) genetic polymorphisms at low back pain onset between incident\n      cases and controls and mRNA expression of candidate genes at LBP onset and at 6 weeks\n      between incident cases and controls; and (B) differential expression levels of candidate\n      genes over time in incident cases.\n\n      H2.A Incident cases will have a higher frequency of polymorphisms and differential\n      expression levels of candidate genes at low back pain onset compared with controls.\n\n      H2.B Examine expression levels of candidate genes over time in incident cases.\n\n      Specific Aim 3. Determine the contribution of enhanced pain sensitivity, cofactors\n      (clinical/psychosocial/environmental), genetic polymorphisms, and mRNA expression of\n      candidate genes on the risk of persistent low back pain."
