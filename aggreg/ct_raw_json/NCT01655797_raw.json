The study design was a randomised controlled\n      parallel group design, with allocation to CBT and waiting list control group (WL). Following\n      an active treatment-control period, the control group were re-assigned to CBT. The study\n      hypothesis was that the CBT group would experience less symptoms of insomnia after treatment\n      compared with the WL group. Primary outcome measure was a brief self-report screening form,\n      Insomnia severity index."
