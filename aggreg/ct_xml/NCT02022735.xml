    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of  Deep Brain stimulation (DBS) on
      walking in patients with Parkinson's disease that have had  DBS. While DBS improves
      Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms and walking in many patients in some of the patients
      walking problems persist.  This study aims to find out what are the best stimulation
      parameters of the DBS in order to improve  walking.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson disease (PD) is defined by the presence of a resting tremor, slowness, stiffness
      and problems with balance and walking.  Gait disorder in Parkinson's disease is common and
      has a greater impact on quality of life.  Currently, carbidopa-levodopa and Deep Brain
      Stimulation are the only treatments available for gait impairment.

      This study is meant to see if there is improvement in gait or freezing of gait are seen
      after changes in the stimulation parameters.   Subjects  will be randomly assigned to four
      different stimulation parameters: both stimulators on (BL ON), both stimulators off (BL
      OFF), right stimulator on (R ON), left stimulator on (L ON). The investigators will assess
      your gait using a clinical scales as well as wearable sensors attached to your body.
      Assessments will be done one hour after each change in the stimulation parameters.

      Gait will be studied using wireless sensors attached to the ankles and wrists to determine
      speed, stride length and turning time.
