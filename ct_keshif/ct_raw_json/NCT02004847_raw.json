It can be worn on the Skin above the effected skin area. In this\n      study Treatment (target) and control area as well as intensity of blue light are randomized.\n      The control area will serve as reference. 50 Patients will treat the target area daily (at\n      least 5 times/week) at home for an initial treatment period of 4 weeks. During those 4\n      weeks, patients will return to the study site for safety and effectiveness assessments\n      twice. After this initiation period patients will treat their plaque for further 8 weeks (3\n      times/week). This is followed by a 4 week follow up phase without treatment."
