Determine the response rate to this treatment in\n      these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral CC-1088 three times a day for 28 days. Treatment continues in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 11-20 patients will be accrued for this study."
