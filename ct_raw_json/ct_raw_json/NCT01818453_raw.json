Modules are organized as simulated dialogues in which the program explains and illustrates concepts and techniques, engages the user in exercises, and continuously asks users to respond by selecting from response options. Subsequent content is then tailored to the users' responses, resulting in a simulated conversational flow. Participants can access the self-help program as often as they would like and since it is self-guided, they will determine how often they access the material. Each module can be completed in 10 to 60 minutes, depending on the user's reading speed, interest, motivation, and individual path through the program.",
