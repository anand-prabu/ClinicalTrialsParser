            "textblock": "Pain, in neoplastic disease, is a symptom with severe negative impact on the quality of life\n      of patients and a high incidence, with values around 70-90% in advanced and metastatic\n      stages. Than 20 years the main reference for the pharmacological treatment of cancer pain\n      are the guidelines produced by the World Health Organization (WHO). This document shows that\n      the use of opioid drugs is the mainstay of treatment, with particular reference to opioids\n      \"major\" (3 rd step of the analgesic ladder). The 4 opioids more most commonly prescribed in\n      Italy (oral morphine and oxycodone, fentanyl and buprenorphine transdermal), based on the\n      data currently available, have an analgesic effect would partly overlap but with different\n      percentages of non-responders (NR), a different need to increase the dose over time to\n      maintain adequate analgesia, a different action to the switch to another molecule for\n      ineffectiveness analgesic. The observations described suggest that opioids, although they\n      belong to the same family drug may not be fully comparable with regard to the clinical\n      effects products. Important differences are known on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic\n      and, more recently, also in terms of pharmacogenomics. This is a comparative study of\n      analgesic strategies based on the use of the 4 mentioned opioids, going to look for possible\n      differences in terms of analgesic efficacy, changes in dose over time, use of switch or\n      permanent abandonment of treatment, parallel to the contour of the side effects. The\n      associated sub-project will link the structure gene of patients and clinical results have\n      emerged."
