      Although there are a number of pain disorders, associated with back, or lower extremity pain
      and swelling, the American Association of Sensory Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AASEM/ DTSC)
      study programs will accumulate received data following a protocol of treatment performed for
      the purpose of eliminating pain, reducing swelling, and accelerating recovery periods as
      well as to record the success or failure and/or improvement of the malfunctioning body part.

        -  Condition: Neuropathic Pain, Tingling or Numbness derived from neurological Ischemia

        -  Intervention: Treatments of Monochromatic Infrared Photo Energy (MIRE) in combination
           with Electronic Signal Treatment (TENS) therapy

        -  Study Type: Interventional

        -  Study Design:

             1. Allocation: Non-Randomized

             2. Endpoint Classification: Efficacy Study

             3. Intervention Model: Single Group Assignment

             4. Masking: Open Label

             5. Primary Purpose: Scientific record of treatment success or failure

    <description>Subjects will be treated with MIRE therapy using the Anodyne® device within 72 hours of previous treatments, and in accordance with the Anodyne® package insert indications for use 30 to 45 minutes professional units on power setting of 8,. In addition, patients will undergo TENS therapy with the use of either the Avazzia® Pro Sport or TENS 3000 (for no less than 30 mins, both on label) in accordance with the indications for use of each TENS device, for a minimum of 15 minutes at the subjective site for pain and each vertebrae nerve base, when impairment is confirmed with the objective Small Pain Fiber (SPF) Nerve Conduction Study (NCS) test performed.</description>
