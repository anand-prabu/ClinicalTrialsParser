      This is a non-interventional, descriptive, national, multi-site, longitudinal and
      prospective observational study with adults patients  who are suffering from cancer or
      malignant blood disease and whose chemotherapy treatment has induced symptomatic anaemia and
      being treated with biosimilar of epoetin to correct haemoglobin levels

        Patients with chemotherapy-induced symptomatic anaemia. Patients suffer from solid
        tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiple myeloma and have developed symptomatic anaemia
        due to their chemotherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients are 18 years of age or over.

          -  Patients present with chemotherapy-induced symptomatic anaemia.

          -  Patients suffer from solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiple myeloma and have
             developed symptomatic anaemia due to their chemotherapy

          -  Patients can be recruited at any time (from the first to the final chemotherapy
             cycle.)

          -  Patients would be suited for a course of treatment with epoetin biosimilar

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients are not undergoing chemotherapy.

          -  Patients have already taken part in a Retacrit® study.

          -  Patients with contraindications to Retacrit®

          -  Patients have hypersensitivity to the active principle or to one of the excipients.

          -  Patient with erythroblastopenia, or 'pure red cell aplasia' (PRCA)

          -  Patient with uncontrollable hypertension

          -  An adequate prophylaxis against thrombosis is not practicable
