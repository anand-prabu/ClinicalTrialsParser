Blood and saliva will be collected on the first and last day of each intervention\n      period to assess immune function.  A final stool sample will be obtained in the last week of\n      the intervention period.  Nutritional status, which can impact immune function, will be\n      assessed using the Mini-Nutritional Assessment, Block Fiber Screen, and the Block 2005 Food\n      Frequency Questionnaire.  Daily questionnaires will record intake of the probiotic or\n      placebo, level of stress, hours of sleep, visits to the physician, new medications, number\n      of stools, etc.  The Gastrointestinal Symptom Response Scale, which records gastrointestinal\n      symptoms, such as bloating, gas, diarrhea, and constipation, over the past week will be\n      completed at baseline and weekly during the interventions and the week following the\n      interventions."
