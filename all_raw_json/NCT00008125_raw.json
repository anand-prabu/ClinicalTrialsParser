            "textblock": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing\n      so they stop growing or die. Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the\n      number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's\n      immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of gemcitabine combined with docetaxel and\n      carboplatin with or without filgrastim in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine and docetaxel when\n      administered with carboplatin with or without filgrastim (G-CSF) in patients with advanced\n      solid tumors. II. Determine a safe dose level and schedule for this regimen for phase II\n      study in these patients. III. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of docetaxel and gemcitabine. Patients receive\n      gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes, docetaxel IV over 1 hour, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes\n      on day 1. Patients also receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on day 8. Treatment repeats\n      every 21 days for approximately 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine and\n      docetaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the\n      dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity\n      (DLT). If the DLT is grade 4 neutropenia, filgrastim (G-CSF) is added to the regimen\n      (administered subcutaneously on days 2-7 and 8-14 or until blood counts recover). A new MTD\n      is then determined. Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study."
