Peripheral\n      stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by\n      chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy, chemotherapy,\n      radiation therapy, and peripheral stem cell transplantation may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of alemtuzumab plus peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation in treating patients who have chronic lymphocytic leukemia."

Patients undergo peripheral blood stem cell\n      transplantation on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF SC beginning on day 1 and continuing until\n      blood counts recover.\n\n      Patients are followed at 60 days, 1 year, and then annually thereafter until disease\n      progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study."
