  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, and controlled study of
      DLBS1033 for the improvement of ankle-brachial index in diabetic patients with peripheral
      arterial disease (PAD). It is hypothesized that the addition of DLBS1033 on top of aspirin
      treatment will augment significantly the resting ABI in diabetes patient with PAD in
      comparison with that of aspirin alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects in this study will be screened consecutively and eligible subjects will be
      randomized to receive aspirin tablet 80 mg once daily and either the investigational drug,
      DLBS1033 tablet 490 mg three times daily or its placebo.

      Diabetic subjects who have been being under therapy with aspirin can directly start with
      study treatment. For those who are currently not under therapy with aspirin, though, i.e.
      newly-diagnosed diabetic subjects (with PAD) who have never been treated with aspirin, or
      those who have been being treated with antiplatelet(s) other than aspirin, there will be a
      run-in period during which they will receive (or be switched to) aspirin treatment, without
      any other antiplatelets, for two weeks. After then, they will receive study medication.

      Clinical and laboratory examinations to evaluate the investigational drug's efficacy and
      safety will be performed at baseline and at the interval of six weeks over the twelve
      week-course of therapy, while drug dispensing and accountability will be carried out at
      interval of 3 weeks.

                  mmHg, diastolic &gt; 100 mmHg).

          -  Subjects with prior experience with DLBS1033 or other oral lumbrokinase products.
