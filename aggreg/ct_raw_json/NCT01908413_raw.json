Subject enrollment and\n      dose escalation will proceed according to a standard 3+3 design.  In the absence of\n      intolerable toxicity, each subject will receive a minimum of 1 cycle (21 days) of study\n      treatment, and may continue to receive additional cycles until disease progression has been\n      documented or other treatment discontinuation criteria have been met.\n\n      No intrasubject dose escalation will be allowed.  During the dose escalation phase, up to 3\n      additional subjects may be enrolled at previously cleared dose levels to better define the\n      safety, tolerability and activity of the study treatment. Similarly, an MTD expansion cohort\n      of up to 12 evaluable subjects may also be enrolled.\n\n      Safety and tolerability will be assessed by the incidence and severity of adverse events as\n      assessed by NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.03).  A Safety\n      Review Committee comprised of the Medical Monitor, Principal Investigators, and Sponsor\n      representatives, will be convened to review safety information and to decide upon dose\n      escalation and further subject enrollment.\n\n      The antitumor activity of study treatment will be assessed according to the Response\n      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1), or the Revised Response Criteria for\n      Malignant Lymphoma as appropriate for each subject's tumor type.\n\n      Exploratory biological markers of CUDC-427 activity will be assessed in tumor samples (where\n      available), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and plasma."
