  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of ADDRESS is to quantify potential short- and long-term benefits of
      robotically-guided minimally invasive (MIS) or open spine surgery in adult spinal deformity
      patients, in comparison to image- or navigation-guided instrumentation in a matching cohort
      of control patients performed using a freehand technique, both in MIS and open approaches.

        Adult patients (age over 21 years) undergoing long (5 or more consecutive vertebrae) open
        or minimally invasive instrumentation, correction and fusion sugery in the thoracic,
        lumbar or sacral spine as a primary procedure for a significant kypho/scoliotic curve,

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult patients (age over 21 years), undergoing long (5 or more consecutive vertebrae)
             spinal fusion surgery, between T1 to the sacrum, as a primary correction surgery of a
             significant kypho/scoliotic curve, and/or sagittal and/or coronal imbalance.

          2. Including surgeries involving iliac screws (e.g., Galveston technique or S2-Ala-Iliac
             screws) although these screws will not be included in the data analysis.

          3. Including augmented cases (when one or more of the screws are inserted into vertebrae
             after a vertebral augmentation procedure, such as kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty).

          4. Patient capable of complying with study requirements

          5. Signed informed consent by patient

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Infection or malignancy

          2. Primary abnormalities of bones (e.g. osteogenesis imperfecta)

          3. Primary muscle diseases, such as muscular dystrophy

          4. Neurologic diseases (e.g. Charcot-Marie Tooth, Guillain-Barre syndrome, cerebral
             palsy, spina bifida, or neurofibroma)

          5. Spinal cord abnormalities with any neurologic symptoms or signs

          6. Spinal cord lesions requiring neurosurgical interventions, such as hydromyelia

          7. Paraplegia

          8. Patients who have participated in a research study involving an investigational
             product in the 12 weeks prior to surgery

          9. Any other significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             may either put the participants at risk because of participation in the study, or may
             influence the result of the study.

         10. Pregnancy

         11. Patient cannot follow study protocol, for any reason

         12. Patient cannot or will not sign informed consent
