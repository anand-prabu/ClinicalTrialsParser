  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study hypothesizes that milk protein consumed together or shortly before a white rice
      or white bread carbohydrate meal exerts different influence on the glycaemic, insulinaemic
      responses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consumption of milk proteins increase satiety and reduce glucose response when consumed
      alone or with carbohydrate. Milk proteins are of interest because proteins are more
      satiating than either carbohydrate or fat, and they regulate food intake and metabolic
      functions by the intact protein, encrypted peptides and amino acids on gastrointestinal and
      central pathways. White rice and white bread are two common carbohydrates types mostly
      consumed in Asia. Both of them are known to result in high glycaemic and insulinaemic
      responses. However, in most meals, they are accompanied by other foods such as soy milk, cow
      milk products. The glyceamic and insulinaemic responses are determined by the type of
      protein and the type of carbohydrates. And also the consumption time of protein and
      carbohydrate.  Recent research points to an intrinsic value of small amounts of milk protein
      or dairy consumed shortly before a meal can reduce the glycemic response to carbohydrate and
      that this is not at the cost of increased demand for insulin. The objective of the present
      study is to investigate how glycaemic, insulinaemic and satiety responses to a white rice or
      white bread meal changed when a soy milk or cow milk consumed together or shortly before the
      meal.  Whole soy milk and whole cow milk will be added to the meal. Healthy subjects (n 15)
      will ingest the test meals once. The meals will be provided as breakfasts, on 10 different
      occasions, in random order with â‰¥ 7 days between each.  Blood samples (from the cannula and
      finger pricks) will be then drawn for 3 h, and glucose and serum insulin, plasma glucagon,
      satiety markers, inflammation markers, amino acids et.al will be analysed.  The objective of
      the study is determining if different liquid protein consumed shortly before or with
      carbohydrate has different effects on metabolism. And also we will compare the difference of
      white rice and white bread. Determining the consuming time effect, milk protein type and
      carbohydrate type on glycaemic and insulinaemic are critical for the provision of dietary
      advice and formulation of public health guidelines.
