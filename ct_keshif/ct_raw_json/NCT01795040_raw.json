Children with ADHD symptoms >90th percentile will\n      participate in a following diagnostic process. The children (n = 150) will be randomised\n      doubleblind to a control group (taking every day four capsules Equazen eye q, containing 400\n      mg fish oil and 100mg evening primrose oil - EPA (372mg), DHA (116mg), GLA (40mg) and\n      vitamin E (7.2 mg) ) or placebo group. The study is divided into two phases with four months\n      each. After unblinding after the first phase pre-school children taking placebo receive\n      Omega-3/Omega-6 Fatty Acids. Children (n = 75) taking verum during first four months will be\n      randomised doubleblind to verum or placebo. In this way the progress of the behaviour\n      symptoms will be evaluated after a significant period of time (eigth months). Clinical\n      examination (questionnaires, intelligence test, medical examination) and evaluation of ADHD\n      symptoms through parents and teachers with several questionnaires will be used before\n      beginning, after four months and after eight months. In addition the pre-school children\n      will be taken a blood sample (finger prick test) to measure the omega-3/omega-6 fatty acids\n      levels. Additionally regular phone calls will be implemented. Medical examinations and\n      meetings will taken place if required. If symptoms increase, children will be treated\n      medical and/ or psychotherapeutically."
