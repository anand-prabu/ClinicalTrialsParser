The hypothesis is that it is possible to increase peak\n      oxygen consumption by incrementally increasing CF-LVAD pumpspeed during exercise.\n\n      The study population will consist of severe heart failure patients with CF-LVADs treated at\n      The Heart Centre of Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet."
