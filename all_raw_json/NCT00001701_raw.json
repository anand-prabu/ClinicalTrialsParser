To test this hypothesis, we propose to analyze the allelic\n      frequencies of 15 different genes (mannose binding lectin, Fc-gamma receptor IIa and IIb,\n      Fc-gamma receptors IIIa and IIIb, myeloperoxidase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and -beta,\n      interleukin 1A and 1B, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, interleukin-10, NRAMP-1,\n      chitotriosidase, and chemokine receptor 5) and their intragenic polymorphic forms and to\n      compare this data to the incidence and severity of C neoformans infection.  With this study\n      we hope to identify a group of molecules of innate immunity which influence the risk and\n      severity of invasive C neoformans infection."
