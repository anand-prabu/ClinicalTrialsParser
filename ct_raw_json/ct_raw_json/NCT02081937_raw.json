Determine the safety and efficacy of the chimeric antigen receptor T cells transduced\n      with the anti-CD19 (cluster of differentiation antigen 19 ) vector (referred to as CART-19\n      cells) in elderly patients with MCL.\n\n      II. Determine duration of in vivo survival of CART-19 cells. RT-PCR (reverse transcription\n      polymerase chain reaction) analysis of whole blood will be used to detect and quantify\n      survival of CART-19 TCR (T-cell receptor) zeta:CD137 and TCR zeta cells over time.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-tumor response due to CART-19 cell\n      infusions.\n\n      Estimate relative trafficking of CART-19 cells to tumor in bone marrow and lymph nodes.\n\n      Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-CD19, and\n      assess correlation with loss of detectable CART-19 (loss of engraftment)."
