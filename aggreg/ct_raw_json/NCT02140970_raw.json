Some patients experience pain after removal of a\n      ureteral stent. The investigators plan to learn how often this occurs and whether it can be\n      prevented.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that children who have a temporary, indwelling ureteral stent\n      will experience a significantly less post-operative pain if given a non-steroidal\n      anti-inflammatory (NSAID) prior to removal of the ureteral stent when compared to placebo.\n      The investigators hypothesize that the incidence of severe post-stent removal pain is\n      similar to an adult population."
