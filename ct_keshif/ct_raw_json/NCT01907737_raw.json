            "textblock": "Cerebrovascular disease is a major cause of disability worldwide. The catastrophic burden of\n      stroke is more dramatic in low- and middle- income countries, and the scarcity of\n      evidence-based rehabilitation interventions represents a major challenge to global health\n      care. Upper limb weakness is frequent after stroke, but there is no universally accepted\n      treatment to effectively improve hand function in patients with moderate and severe motor\n      impairment. These are the patients in deepest need of rehabilitative interventions. This\n      project addresses this important issue, by testing effects of a novel approach. We will\n      non-invasively stimulate the brain and peripheral nerves in order to enhance effects of\n      motor training aided by an electrical stimulation device in patients with moderate to severe\n      hand weakness. Our hypothesis is that brain stimulation, when added to peripheral nerve\n      stimulation, will enhance effects of motor training to a greater extent than brain\n      stimulation alone, peripheral stimulation alone, or no stimulation."

The working hypothesis of this proof-of-principle\n      study is that either tDCS or PNS will enhance effects of functional electrical stimulation\n      (FES) to a greater extent than placebo tDCS and PNS, and that the combination of tDCS and\n      PNS will further improve motor outcomes than either tDCS or PNS alone.\n\n      The interventions will consist of outpatient motor training of the paretic wrist with FES in\n      four experimental sessions separated by two weeks. In each session, either active tDCS +\n      sham PNS, active PNS + sham tDCS,active tDCS + active PNS or sham tDCS + sham PNS will be\n      applied. PNS will be applied for 2 hours and tDCS will be applied in the last 20 minutes\n      before completion of PNS. The order of the sessions will be randomized across patients.\n      Before the first session, patients will be familiarized with the FES device."
