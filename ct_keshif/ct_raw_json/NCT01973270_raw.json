            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to perform a double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) in\n      young patients with recent-onset (RO) schizophrenia to target improvement in cognitive\n      functioning within real-world treatment settings. We will compare the effects of web-based\n      targeted cognitive training (TCT) vs. web-based general cognitive exercises (GCE), both\n      delivered via portable laptop computers.  We will investigate the behavioral and functional\n      changes seen immediately after the intervention as well as at 6-month follow-up, compared to\n      a no-training control group (NTC). The aims of this project are based on the current state\n      of early psychosis research, as well as our own experience with neuroscience-informed\n      cognitive training in schizophrenia.\n\n      H1.  TCT subjects will show significantly greater gains in global cognition, verbal\n      learning/memory, and social cognition compared to GCE and NTC subjects.  These gains in the\n      TCT group will be sustained at 6-month follow-up.\n\n      H2. GCE subjects will show improvement in problem-solving and global cognition compared to\n      no-training subjects. At 6 month follow-up, GCE subjects will show lower gains in global\n      cognition and verbal learning/memory than TCT subjects.\n\n      H3.  In TCT subjects, gains in global cognition and processing speed, and in social\n      cognition, will correlate with improvements on 6-month measures of occupational and social\n      functioning, respectively, as well as internalized stigma. These associations will be\n      significantly greater in TCT subjects vs. GCE or NTC subjects.\n\n      H4.  Symptom ratings will show improvement in all subject groups at 6 months. H5.  At least\n      70% of randomized clients will complete >20 hours of training in the TCT and GCE arms.\n\n      H6.  Providers, clients, and carers will rate the TCT and GCE interventions as equally\n      feasible, tolerable, and acceptable.\n\n      H7A. Improvement in auditory processing speed (APS) on the frequency sweep discrimination\n      task in the TCT subjects at 10 hours of training will indicate target engagement of auditory\n      cortical processing, and will correlate with changes in global cognition by the end of\n      training, and with changes in role functioning at 6-month follow-up.\n\n      H7B. Improvement in the brain performance index (BPI) measure in the GCE subjects at 10\n      hours will indicate target engagement of general cognitive control operations, and will\n      correlate with changes in global cognition by the end of training, and with changes in role\n      functioning at 6-month follow-up.\n\n      H8A. Reward sensitivity (TEPS Anticipatory Pleasure) at baseline will show a significant\n      association to change in global cognition in the TCT group.\n\n      H8B Exploratory. Reward sensitivity (TEPS Anticipatory Pleasure) at baseline will show a\n      significant association to change in global cognition in the GCE group."
