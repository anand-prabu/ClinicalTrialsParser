The\n      purpose of this study is to investigate the incidence of CAS, atrioventricular (AV) block\n      and effect of BP lowering drugs on CAS in hypertensive patients treated with BP lowering\n      agents. The investigators will register consecutive patients who underwent coronary\n      angiography with an acetylcholine (Ach)-induced provocation test. The investigators will\n      include hypertensive patients who were taking antihypertensive drugs, and exclude patients\n      who had a documented history of cardiovascular disease or who were not treated with\n      antihypertensive agents. CAS is defined as >70% luminal narrowing on Ach provocation and /or\n      concurrent chest pain. The study population will be divided into quartiles of rising\n      systolic BP and diastolic BP. The incidence of Ach-induced CAS according to each systolic\n      BP/diastolic BP quartile will be evaluated."

Among them, patients with\n      documented cardiovascular disease and/or any other serious medical condition, such as an\n      increased serum creatinine level (>2mg/dl), will be excluded.

The first reading was discarded, and the mean of the next two\n      consecutive readings was used. Next, coronary angiography was performed. Hypertension is\n      defined as systolic BP \u2265140mmHg and/or diastolic BP \u226590mmHg on at least two consecutive\n      readings in the outpatient clinic. Patients taking antihypertensive medications are also\n      categorized as hypertensives.
