  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of food on the bioavailability (how much
      medication is in your blood) of mebendazole from a single 500 mg oral dose of a
      fast-disintegrating chewable tablet formulation of mebendazole in healthy adult
      participants.

      This is an open-label (the participant and the study physician know what the participant is
      getting), randomized (like the flip of a coin), single-center, single-dose, 2-way crossover
      (method used to switch participants from one treatment arm to another in a clinical study)
      study in approximately 16 healthy adult participants. Participants will receive study
      medication under fed state first and later under fasted state or vice versa. The study
      consists of 3 phases: screening phase of approximately 3 weeks, an open-label treatment
      phase consisting of two 6-day treatment periods (Treatment period 1 and 2) with a 7- to 10
      day washout between Day 1 of each treatment period, and a safety follow-up phase occurring 7
      to 10 days after the last study-related procedure on Day 5 of Treatment Period 2. The study
      physician will check participant's general health during the study. Total duration of study
      for each participant will be approximately 48 days.
