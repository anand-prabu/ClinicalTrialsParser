  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in medical therapy for diabetes, significant numbers of patients fail to
      achieve adequate blood glucose control. Diabetic patients who engage in more self-care
      behaviors have better glycemic control, as measured by HbA1C. Patient &quot;activation&quot;, defined
      as the knowledge, skills, beliefs, and behaviors to manage a chronic disease, is key to the
      performance of these self-care behaviors.

      There is a growing literature on diabetes behavioral change interventions; however
      interventions are often developed and implemented without consideration of patients
      readiness to engage in lifestyle changes. Additionally, patient-tailored interventions
      require intensive clinical and financial resources, making them difficult to integrate into
      clinical practice. Mobile text messaging (SMS) programs have been successfully used to
      promote smoking cessation, alcohol cessation, and weight loss in diverse patient
      populations. SMS interventions for diabetes have also been developed, but they have been
      designed primarily to provide feedback on blood glucose management, rather than to motivate
      behavioral change. The few studies that included motivational content as a primary feature,
      did not tailor their intervention to a patient's readiness for change or rigorously describe
      their motivational intervention, and show limited efficacy.

      To address these concerns, we will perform a three-month randomized controlled pilot study
      to develop and test a Motivational Interviewing (MI)-informed SMS intervention tailored to
      patient level of activation for patients with poorly controlled type II diabetes.
