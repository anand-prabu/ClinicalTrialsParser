Near-infrared\n      spectroscopy has increasingly been used in perioperative setting of heart surgery and many\n      studies have outlined an increased incidence of postoperative morbidity in patients with\n      significant perioperative reductions in rSO2. Although a relationship between rSO2\n      reductions and adverse outcomes has been reported, there is not compelling evidence that\n      interventions to correct rSO2 during cardiac surgery lead to improved clinical outcomes.\n\n      Hypothesis of the study is that interventions to normalize intraoperatively decreased\n      cerebral rSO2 would reduce the overall incidence of postoperative complications in cardiac\n      surgery patients with left ventricle ejection fraction less than 35%."
