II. Determine the effect on quality of life of this regimen in\n      these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour weekly for 4 weeks. Patients receive\n      oral estramustine the day before, the day of, and the day after paclitaxel administration\n      each week. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity and disease\n      progression. A quality of life questionnaire is completed before treatment and 2 months\n      after treatment initiation.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17 patients will be accrued for this study."
