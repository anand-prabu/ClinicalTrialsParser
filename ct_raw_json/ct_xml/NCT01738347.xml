        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria for all Participants:

          -  The subject has a clinically normal or acceptable medical history and physical
             examination at screening.

          -  The subject has an acceptable kidney function (eGFR &gt;60 mL/min/1.73m2) for
             administration of Gadolinium.

          -  The subject has a trans-locator protein (TSPO) platelet assay conducted / genotype
             screen within the past 3 months and is a high or mixed affinity GE-180 binder.

        Inclusion criteria specific for healthy volunteers:

          -  The subject has no clinical history or signs of neurological impairment.

          -  The subject has a normal MRI without central white matter lesions.

        Inclusion criteria specific for participants with relapsing and remitting multiple
        sclerosis (rrMS):

          -  The subject meets McDonald criteria for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.

          -  The subject at screening has at least two central white matter plaques evident on
             MRI.

          -  The subject at screening has a MRI scan of sufficient quality for Volume of Interest
             (VOI) definition and co-alignment with Positron Emission Tomography (PET).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        General Exclusion Criteria for all participants:

          -  The subject has known allergies to Gadolinium contrast agent.

          -  The subject has received significant ionising radiation exposure from clinical trials
             or medical examinations in the last 12 months.

        Exclusion Criteria specific for healthy volunteers:

          -  The subject has family history of multiple sclerosis (MS).

          -  The subject is undergoing monitoring of occupational ionising radiation exposure.

        Exclusion Criteria specific for participants with remitting multiple sclerosis (rrMS):

          -  The subject has a past history of cerebrovascular disease or vasculitis.

          -  The subject has a history of head injury with prolonged coma.
