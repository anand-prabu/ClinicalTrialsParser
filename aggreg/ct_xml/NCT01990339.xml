      To evaluate the efficacy of 4-week lansoprazole (Takepron) therapy for subjective
      symptomatic improvement in gastroesophageal reflux disease patients with dyspepsia symptoms
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a special drug use surveillance of lansoprazole (Takepron) with a 4-week
      observational period, designed to evaluate the efficacy in gastroesophageal reflux disease
      patients with dyspepsia symptoms (planned sample size, 15000).

      The dosage regimen is as follows:

        -  For reflux esophagitis, the usual adult dosage is 30 mg of lansoprazole administered
           orally once daily for up to 8 weeks. For maintenance treatment of repeatedly
           recurring/relapsing reflux esophagitis, the dosage is 15 mg of lansoprazole
           administered orally once daily. If insufficient efficacy is observed, the dosage may be
           increased to 30 mg administered orally once daily.

        -  For non-erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease, the usual adult dosage is 15 mg of
           lansoprazole administered orally once daily for up to 4 weeks.
