This research project translates a well established\n      cognitive bias in major MDD, working memory bias, into a novel intervention target.  In a\n      double-blind, randomized, controlled study, MDD participants undergo 6 weeks of cognitive\n      training sessions, with three sessions per week."

Pregnant women are excluded from the study because research has\n             shown that hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy can mimic and/or influence\n             symptoms of depression. Including patterns of mood and cognition. These mood and\n             cognitive changes could mask the effect of the cognitive training in this study, so\n             pregnant women will be excluded for that reason.\n\n          -  Enrolled participants can be currently taking medication but must be stabilized on\n             their medication regimens before enrolling in the study (i.e., no medication has been\n             started within 8 weeks, stopped within 6 weeks or titrated up or down within 4 weeks\n             of study entry).  Accordingly, if a patient's medication status must change during\n             the course of the study, we will discontinue them in the study.  We do not anticipate\n             that this will occur frequently, as again, patients' medication regimens must be\n             stable before enrolling in the study.  No medications will be discontinued for the\n             purpose of enrollment into the study.\n\n        Subjects must exhibit no or only moderate alcohol use. Subjects with current excessive use\n        of alcohol (> 8 ounces/day for men and > 6 ounces/day for women) are ineligible for\n        participation, as such drug use could confound the results."
