Almost 2 million persons (about 5 percent\n      of the U.S. population over age 65) are now affected, and this number will triple by the\n      year 2020.  This study will target patients with neovascular AMD (NV-AMD), a form of AMD\n      which can lead to sudden vision loss, substantial disability, and depression.  Because\n      depression is itself disabling and not likely to be recognized nor treated by\n      ophthalmologists, preventing depression in people with NV-AMD is important.\n\n      Patients are randomly assigned to either PST or a usual care control condition. The primary\n      outcome measure is a DSM-IV diagnosis of depression. Patients are evaluated at baseline,\n      Month 2 (immediately post-intervention), Month 6 (for the primary efficacy analysis), and\n      Month 12 (to evaluate sustained effects). The study will also assess the impact of PST on\n      levels of disability and vision-related quality of life."
