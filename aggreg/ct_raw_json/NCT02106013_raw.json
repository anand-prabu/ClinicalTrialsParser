            "textblock": "Selection: Study participants are initially selected trough the evaluation of consecutive\n      lipid profiles from individuals who spontaneously seek governmental primary care centers of\n      the city of Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil. Telephone-based screening interviews are performed,\n      followed by in-person clinical evaluation and blood exams.\n\n      Biochemical analyses: Glucose, triglycerides, HDL-C and c-reactive protein (CRP) are\n      measured in an automated Modular\u00ae Analytics Evo (Roche Diagnostics, Burgess Hill, West\n      Sussex, UK), using Roche Diagnostics\u00ae reagents (Mannheim, Germany). LDL-cholesterol is\n      calculated by the Friedewald formula. Serum insulin levels are measured using ELISA\n      (Millipore, Massachusetts, USA). The Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) Calculator version\n      2.2 (University of Oxford, UK) is used to estimate insulin sensitivity. Apolipoproteins A-I\n      and B-100 and lipoprotein (a) are determined by nephelometry in an  automated system and\n      reagents from Dade-Behring\u00ae (Marburg, Germany).\n\n      Carotid artery ultrasound: Carotid artery atherosclerosis is estimated by using\n      high-resolution B-mode ultrasound, at the posterior wall of the common carotid artery.\n\n      Lipoprotein isolation: HDL from each study participant is isolated from plasma, through\n      ultracentrifugation (Beckman Coulter Inc., Palo Alto, USA).\n\n      HDL chemical composition: Using commercially available enzymatic kits, HDL content of total\n      proteins, total cholesterol, free cholesterol, phospholipids, triglycerides  and\n      apolipoprotein A-I are measured. Cholesteryl ester (CE) is calculated as the difference\n      between total cholesterol and free cholesterol times 1.67. HDL molar concentration is\n      estimated based on particle total mass and molecular weight.\n\n      HDL physical-chemical characterization: HDL particle size is determined using dynamic light\n      scattering, and zeta potential using laser Doppler micro-electrophoresis.\n\n      Determination of proteins involved in HDL metabolism: Cholesteryl ester transfer protein,\n      phospholipids transfer protein, lipoprotein lipase, hepatic lipase and lecithin:cholesterol\n      acyl transferase activities are determined trough radiometric exogenous assays.\n\n      HDL functions: Cholesterol efflux capacity, antioxidant activity, susceptibility to\n      oxidation, anti-inflammatory activity and platelet aggregation inhibition are measured using\n      straightforward and consolidated methodologies.\n\n      Statistical Analyses: Differences between groups are evaluated using ANOVA or\n      Kruskal-Wallis, with Bonferroni's post-hoc multiple comparison analysis, according to\n      variable distribution. Chi-Square is used to compare categorical data. Analysis of\n      covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted for confounding variables is also used, after checking\n      variables with histograms, normality plots, and residual scatter plots that tested for\n      linearity, normality, and variance. Pearson's correlation test is used to assess the\n      relationships between variables. A two-sided p-value of 0.05 is considered significant."
