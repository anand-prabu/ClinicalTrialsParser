  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been increasing in Hong Kong. The
      management of inflammatory bowel disease involved the use of immunosuppressant, however, the
      use of immunosuppressant in patients with hepatitis B infection has been associated with
      hepatitis B reactivation. It is estimated that around 7% of the Hong Kong population is
      infected with HBV. The information on the prevalence of hepatitis B in IBD patients in Hong
      Kong is lacking. Moreover, limited information is available on the effect of different
      immunosuppressive regimens given for longer periods of time in lower doses in patients with
      chronic HBV infection and IBD. There is therefore a need to determine the incidence and
      predictive factors for HBV reactivation in these patients.

      Rheumatologic diseases, including systemic lupus erythematous, rheumatoid arthritis,
      psoriasis and anklyosing spondylitis are inflammatory conditions which commonly affect the
      locomotors system as well as other organs. Epidemiological data from China have suggested
      that patients with ankylosing spondylitis have a higher risk of hepatitis B infection; while
      the rates of hepatitis B for those with rheumatoid arthritis, and other spondyloathropathies
      are similar to that of the general population. However, there are no such local data in Hong
      Kong aspect.

      This study aims to determine the prevalence of HBV infection in patients with IBD and
      rheumatologic disease, and to assess the impact of immunosuppressive therapy on viral load
      and clinical course of IBD patients.
