Hormone therapy using tamoxifen may fight breast cancer by\n      blocking the uptake of estrogen by the tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy with hormone\n      therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of epirubicin and tamoxifen\n      with or without docetaxel in treating postmenopausal women who have breast cancer that has\n      spread to the lymph nodes."

Patients are stratified according to\n      participating center. Patients are randomized to one of two adjuvant chemotherapy treatment\n      arms within 30 days after surgery.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive adjuvant epirubicin IV on days 1 and 8. Treatment continues\n           every 28 days for 6 courses.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive adjuvant epirubicin IV on days 1 and 8. Treatment continues\n           every 28 days for 3 courses. Patients then receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1.\n           Treatment continues every 21 days for 3 courses.\n\n      Patients may be further randomized to one of two tamoxifen arms. Patients not randomized to\n      the tamoxifen arms receive oral tamoxifen daily for 5 years concurrently with adjuvant\n      chemotherapy.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive tamoxifen as above concurrently with adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive sequential tamoxifen as above after completion of adjuvant\n           chemotherapy.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 9 months, 2 years, and then at 5 years.\n\n      Patients are followed at 9 months, 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2\n      years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 800 patients will be accrued for this study."
