Because\n      relapse after treatment occurs in over 50 percent of cases, chronic maintenance therapy with\n      intravenous (IV) amphotericin B is usually given. However, amphotericin B is not always\n      effective, has toxic effects, and must be given by the intravenous route. Fluconazole is an\n      antifungal agent that can be given orally and has been shown to be effective against\n      cryptococcal infections in animals and against acute CM in a few AIDS patients. Also, the\n      side effects experienced by over 2000 patients or volunteers given fluconazole have seldom\n      been severe enough to require withdrawal of the drug."
