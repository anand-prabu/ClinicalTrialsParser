This situation may lead to many disadvantages for ventilation and airway\n      protection of critically ill patients during the procedures. The use of double lumen\n      endotracheal tube dedicated to the percutaneous tracheostomies may:\n\n        1. improve the ventilation of patients during the procedure,\n\n        2. protect the posterior tracheal wall from damage related to the different step of\n           tracheostomies,\n\n        3. protect the lungs from blood and secretions coming down from the chosen site of\n           tracheostomy.\n\n      So the aim of this study is to evaluate the oxygenation, gas exchange, ventilation and\n      complications of percutaneous tracheostomies performed in ICU with a dedicated double lumen\n      endotracheal tube."
