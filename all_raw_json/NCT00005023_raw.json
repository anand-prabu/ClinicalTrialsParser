Determine the safety of serial intradermal or subcutaneous vaccinations of\n      HER-2 derived p369-377 peptide incorporated into polylactide-co-glycolide (PLG) microspheres\n      with adjuvant sargramostim (GM-CSF) in patients with stage III or IV HER-2 expressing\n      cancers. II. Determine whether cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) specific for the HER-2 protein\n      can be elicited in patients with HLA-A2 by immunization with this regimen. III. Determine\n      which route of immunization, intradermal or subcutaneous, is more effective in generating\n      HER-2 specific CTL in these patients on this regimen. IV. Determine the extent to which\n      escalated dose of PLG peptide affects the immune response in these patients on this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients undergo leukapheresis prior to study and after final vaccination. Patients\n      are sequentially entered into one of three treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive an\n      intradermal vaccination of HER-2 derived p369-377 peptide incorporated into\n      polylactide-co-glycolide (PLG) microspheres with adjuvant sargramostim (GM-CSF). Arm II:\n      Patients receive a subcutaneous vaccination of HER-2 derived p369-377 peptide incorporated\n      into PLG microspheres with adjuvant GM-CSF. Arm III: Patients receive a higher dose of\n      subcutaneous vaccination of HER-2 derived p369-377 peptide incorporated into PLG\n      microspheres with adjuvant GM-CSF. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in\n      the absence of unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients (5 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
