  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is an important health problem in the rapidly-aging demographic.   Fragility
      fractures are devastating consequences of osteoporosis. The most common treatment approach
      in osteoporosis is inhibition of bone resorption with drugs like alendronate (ALN).
      Parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates bone formation and is the only anabolic drug available.
      Dual therapy with ALN and PTH is not as effective as single-drug therapy in preventing
      fracture. Bone progenitor cells (MSCs) are recruited to sites of bone remodeling when a
      growth factor called TGF-β1 is released from bone. Different osteoporosis medicines may have
      differing effects on this process. The effects of ALN versus PTH on bone progenitor
      recruitment in humans are unknown. This is a randomized, clinical trial of ALN, PTH, and
      calcium and vitamin D in post-menopausal women with low bone mass.  Women will be treated
      for 3 months with ALN or PTH or calcium and vitamin D.   Data collected will include bone
      biopsies for histomorphometry and µCT, bone marrow aspirates for molecular studies,
      peripheral blood to detect circulating bone progenitor cells and dual X-ray absorptiometry.
      We hypothesize that in humans, PTH will 1) increase bone progenitor number, 2) enhance
      recruitment of bone progenitor cells to bone resorption sites, and 3) increase bone
      progenitor number in peripheral circulation. Furthermore, we hypothesize that ALN treatment
      will have the opposite effect. Understanding the differences in bone progenitor cell
      activity and recruitment during osteoporosis therapy will provide a mechanistic rationale
      for effective use of PTH and anti-resorptive drugs in osteoporosis treatment.
