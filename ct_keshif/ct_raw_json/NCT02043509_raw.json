            "textblock": "Epidemiological evidence indicates that smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of many\n      pregnancy related complications and is associated with many adverse postnatal problems.\n      Around 15% of women still smoke throughout their pregnancy; younger women and those from\n      more deprived backgrounds are much more likely to smoke. Behavioural support, available\n      through NHS Stop Smoking Services, is effective but only accessed by a minority of smokers\n      with most trying to quit alone. For this large group, self-help interventions may be an\n      effective alternative.\n\n      MiQuit is a 12 week tailored, self-help, text-message intervention developed for pregnant\n      smokers. A pilot study found this was feasible and acceptable for recipients, thus if MiQuit\n      could have such an impact in routine NHS care, its low cost would make it highly\n      cost-effective.\n\n      Before MiQuit could be used in routine care, a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT)\n      would be needed but currently there is insufficient information to justify conducting this.\n\n      This proof of concept (POC) trial will investigate whether it is possible to evaluate MiQuit\n      in a multi-centre RCT located within the NHS, using research network resources. This study\n      will recruit 400 pregnant smokers who will be randomly allocated to either MiQuit or\n      control, and will provide estimates for the parameters required for determining the\n      necessary resources for a definitive trial.  These include: the range of recruitment rates\n      in different centres; quit rates amongst participants; feasibility of assessing smoking\n      status of trial participants in later pregnancy and ascertainment rates obtained; and the\n      likely effect of MiQuit when women are offered this in NHS settings.\n\n      Secondary objectives include; To estimate and model the likely effectiveness and cost\n      effectiveness of MiQuit compared with usual care including a generic smoking cessation\n      information leaflet; To document participants' use of MiQuit interactive features and of NHS\n      cessation support; To assess the effect of MiQuit on social cognitive determinants of\n      quitting smoking and; To explore participant views and experiences of using MiQuit.\n\n      The participants will be recruited before 25 weeks gestation when they attend  NHS hospital\n      clinics for routine antenatal ultrasound scans.  Recruitment will take place in around 12\n      United Kingdom (UK) centres over a 12 month period.  Follow-up will be via telephone at 1\n      month after randomization and again at week 36 gestation. The follow-up is over a 9 month\n      period.  If a participant reports they have stopped smoking, this \"quit\" will be validated\n      with a exhaled Carbon Monoxide (CO) measurement and/or salivary cotinine measurement.\n\n      A small number of semi-structured telephone interviews will be carried out with a selection\n      of participants from the MiQuit arm to explore their views and experience of the\n      intervention."
