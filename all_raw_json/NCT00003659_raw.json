Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.\n      Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing\n      substances to them without harming normal cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of fludarabine plus high-dose\n      cyclophosphamide and rituximab in treating patients who have previously untreated chronic\n      lymphocytic leukemia."

Treatment is repeated every 4 weeks\n      for 3 or 6 courses.\n\n      Three weeks later, cyclophosphamide is administered intravenously every 2-3 weeks for 3\n      courses.

Beginning 4 weeks after the last\n      dose of cyclophosphamide, patients receive rituximab by intravenous infusion once weekly for\n      4 weeks.\n\n      Patient are followed every 3 months until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 30 patients within 3 years."
