      The purpose of this pilot trial, Transitioning to Adult Care (TRANSIT), is to develop and
      test an intervention (i.e., a standardized, tailored transition program focused on enhancing
      adherence)  to improve outcomes for emerging adults who underwent heart transplantation as
      children and transfer to adult care.

    <measure>To assess the feasibility of TRANSIT by measuring the transition program adherence for those randomized to the intervention and survey completion for all participants.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Investigators hypothesize that by the end of the 3 month transition program and 6 months of follow-up, 84% of patients will be retained; 80% will participate in the program (module completion, discussion, and follow-up); and 100% will complete at least 80% of the survey instruments at each data collection point.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine the efficacy of TRANSIT on patient-level outcomes .</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The following patient level outcomes will be measured:
At 3 months post intervention and 6 months follow-up, emerging adult heart transplant recipients who participate in TRANSIT will have lower CNI SD (i.e., SD &lt;2.5 for tacrolimus and cyclosporine), than patients who receive usual care.
At 3 months post intervention and 6 months follow-up, emerging adult heart transplant recipients who participate in TRANSIT will have a higher percentage of CNI levels within the target range (i.e., &lt; 50% of CNI blood levels out of target range for individual patients as reported by their transplant center), better self-reported adherence to the medical regimen, and  fewer episodes of treated acute rejection, than patients who receive usual care.
At 3 months post intervention and 6 months follow-up, emerging adult heart transplant recipients who participate in TRANSIT then patients who receive usual care.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine the efficacy of TRANSIT on meso-level outcomes.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>These will be measured based on the use of health care resources: rates of appointments for clinic and CNI blood draws and number of all-cause days re-hospitalized</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have received a heart transplant at a children's hospital and are ready to
             transition, as determined by the pediatric heart transplant cardiologist, to the
             adult heart transplant center with whom a collaborative relationship has been
             established;

          -  18 years or older;

          -  Able to speak, read at a fifth grade level or above, and write English;

          -  Physically able to participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of psychiatric hospitalization within the last 3 months, assessed on a
             case-by-case basis with exclusion only if patients could not potentially benefit from
             the intervention.
