  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a high-dose vitamin D supplementation
      regimen in reducing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)-related side effects in older
      prostate cancer patients on ADT. The proposed study is a randomized, double-blind, 2-arm,
      controlled clinical trial that will accrue 76 prostate cancer patients without severe bone
      loss, aged 60 and older, beginning ADT, and scheduled to receive at least 6 months more of
      ADT.  Participants will be randomized to: 1) weekly high-dose vitamin D3 (50,000 IU) or 2)
      vitamin D placebo only for a period of 24 weeks. Both groups will also receive a daily
      multivitamin and calcium supplement.

      The investigators hypothesize high-dose vitamin D supplementation will reduce androgen
      deprivation therapy (ADT)-related side effects including ADT-induced bone loss, decreased
      muscle mass, falls, reduced muscle strength, and diminished physical performance in older
      prostate cancer patients. The vitamin D supplementation is aimed at reducing fracture risk
      by maintaining proper bone density, thereby preventing osteoporotic/osteopenic conditions
      and increasing muscle mass.  Both vitamin D and exercise are efficacious in maintaining
      proper bone health and muscle mass among the general population, but little research has
      been done on prostate cancer patients and survivors.  Vitamin D could reduce fracture risk
      among prostate cancer survivors.
