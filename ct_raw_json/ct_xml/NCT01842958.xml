  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of the Straumann Bone
      Level Ø 3.3 mm NC SLActive Roxolid Implants compared to Straumann Bone Level Ø 4.1 mm RC
      SLActive Roxolid Implants based on mean crestal bone level changes measured between surgery
      and 12 months post-implant placement.  The secondary objectives will assess differences in
      clinical outcomes between the test and control implants, including implant success and
      survival, gingival recession, subject satisfaction and additional early bone level
      measurements.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have voluntarily signed the informed consent form

          -  Subjects must be males or females who are a minimum of 20 years of age

          -  Subjects must have a single tooth gap in the pre-molar or anterior region of the
             mandible or maxilla (ADA tooth positions 4-13 and 20-29; FDI tooth positions 11-15,
             21-25, 31-35, and 41-45)

          -  Subjects must have opposing dentition (natural teeth, fixed or removable
             restorations)

          -  Subjects must have a full mouth plaque score ≤ 25%, according to O'Leary, at the time
             of screening

          -  Subjects must have adequate bone to encapsulate the implant and allow placement of an
             Ø 4.1 mm Bone Level Implant.

          -  Adequate bone height of at least 1 mm longer than the length of the study implant

          -  Subjects must have substantially healed (at least 16 weeks after tooth extraction)
             extraction sockets

          -  Subjects must be committed to the study and the required follow-up visits

             bleeding disorders, weakened immune system, illness requiring periodic use of
             steroids, uncontrollable endocrine disorders, uncontrolled diabetes)

          -  Subjects with any contraindications for oral surgical procedures (e.g. inadequate
             wound healing capacity, poor oral hygiene, maxillary and mandibular growth not
             completed, xerostomia)

          -  Subjects with mucosal diseases (e.g., erosive lichen planus) in the localized area
             around the study implant site

          -  Subjects with a history of local irradiation therapy in the head/neck area

             adjacent to the implant site

          -  Subjects receiving, or having a history of receiving, intravenous or subcutaneous
             antiresorptive agents, such as bisphosphonates

          -  Subjects with severe bruxing, parafunctional habits, or temporomandibular joint
             dysfunction

          -  Subjects with existing implants in the adjacent positions to the planned implant site

          -  Subjects requiring bone augmentation or socket grafting within 6 months prior to
             surgery

          -  Subjects requiring more than minimal simultaneous augmentation for minimal buccal
             dehiscence defects (defect cannot be greater than 3mm in height)

          -  Subjects with inadequate oral hygiene or who are unmotivated for adequate home care

          -  Subjects who have physical or mental handicaps that would interfere with the ability
             to perform adequate oral hygiene

          -  Subjects who are pregnant or intending to become pregnant during the duration of the
             study

          -  Subjects who are heavy smokers (defined as &gt;10 cigarettes per day or &gt;1 cigar per
             day) or chew tobacco

          -  Subjects who abuse alcohol or drugs

          -  Subjects who have undergone administration of any investigational device within 30
             days of enrollment in the study

          -  Subjects with conditions or circumstances, in the opinion of the Investigator, which
             would prevent completion of study participation or interfere with analysis of study
             results, such as history of non-compliance or unreliability
