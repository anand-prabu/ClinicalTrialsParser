The study\n      team anticipates the chronic exercise improvements with ranolazine will be incrementally\n      higher than the acute effects provided by ranolazine alone and demonstrated in previous\n      trials.  Key secondary objectives include the acute ranolazine and chronic exercise plus\n      ranolazine effects on total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) and angina-related quality of\n      life."
