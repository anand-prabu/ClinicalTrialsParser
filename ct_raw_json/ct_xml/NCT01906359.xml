  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disorder determined by lifestyle and genes. It
      is associated with chronic hyperglycaemia along with other metabolic abnormalities. It is
      also one of the risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). This disease is due to
      insulin resistance and/or deficiency as well as increased hepatic glucose output. According
      to the Third National Health and Morbidity Survey (3rd NHMS), the prevalence of T2DM for
      adults aged 30 years and above is 14.9%, increased by almost 80% from 1996 to 2006. Dietary
      composition may affect insulin sensitivity, postprandial triacylglycerol concentration and
      the risk of T2DM. The role of dietary fats in T2DM is of particular interest and has been
      clinically studied for many decades. The type of fat we ingest every day consists of
      different types of fatty acids and different degree of saturation, which in turn influence
      glucose metabolism by altering cell membrane function, enzyme activity, insulin signalling
      and gene expression. Previous studies demonstrated that interesterification of dietary fat
      alter postprandial lipaemia. Saturated fat such as palm olein has been reported to display
      lower postprandial lipaemia after interesterification.  Changing the structure of
      triacylglycerol (TAG) alters the physical properties of dietary fat which affects
      digestibility, metabolism and atherogenicity. A recent study conducted by Sanders and
      co-workers demonstrated reduced levels of plasma glucose-dependent insulinotropic
      polypeptide (GIP) following both the lard and interesterified palm olein (IPO) compared with
      the palm olein (PO) and high oleic sunflower oil (HOS) diets in healthy subjects. The GIP
      and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) are major players in the modulation of postprandial
      insulin secretion by the pancreas. Although GIP secretion in response to meals is normal in
      patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), GIP induced secretion of insulin is defective
      in diabetes. This is observed to be predominantly a defective stimulation of the late phase
      of insulin response (20-120 minutes). The effect of IPO on GIP may be exaggerated in T2DM
      patients with impaired insulin sensitivity. Hence, IPO may change the concentrations of gut
      hormones, postprandial lipaemia, insulinaemic response and CVD related haemostatic markers.

      Subjects aged between 30 and 60 years old (male and female) with Type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM) will be recruited for this study. A randomized, crossover, double-blind study design
      will be carried out to investigate the acute effects of high fat meals prepared using palm
      olein (PO), chemically interesterified palm olein (IPO) and high oleic sunflower oil (HOS)
      (control) on study subjects with T2DM. Study subjects will have to undergo three
      postprandial challenges, separated by at least one week interval. Fasting blood sample and
      duplicate baseline blood samples will be taken in the morning of postprandial day. After
      that, subjects will be asked to consume a test meal consisting a high fat muffin baked using
      the aforementioned oils  and a milkshake within 10 minutes. After meal, venous blood samples
      will be taken at time-points 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 min, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h and post-heparin
      plasma 5 min and 15 min for analysis. Pulse wave analysis will be conducted to evaluate
      central blood pressure and arterial stiffness. Meal appreciation will be assessed by
      utilising visual analogue scale (VAS) before eating, after eating and at each time-point.
