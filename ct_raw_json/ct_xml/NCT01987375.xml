      This study is an open label, single institution, Phase 1 dose-escalation study to determine
      the safety profile of cetuximab-IRDye800 used in subjects with head and neck squamous cell
      carcinoma (HNSCC) that undergo surgery with curative intent. Participants will be given a
      dose of an approved head and neck cancer drug (Cetuximab) along with an investigational
      study drug called Cetuximab-IRDye800. Cetuximab-IRDye800 is a drug that is given prior to
      surgery that attaches to cancer cells and appears to make them visible to the doctor when he
      uses a special camera during the operation.  The investigators are evaluating whether or not
      the use of the study drug along with the special camera will better identify the cancer
      while patients are in the operating room.

      This study will be a conventional 3+3 phase I study evaluating three escalating dose levels
      of intravenous infusion of cetuximab-IRDye800 for patients who tolerate after a 100 mg
      test/loading dose of unlabeled cetuximab as part of the screening process. A fourth and
      fifth cohort will be added that does not include a 100 mg unlabeled test/loading dose of
      cetuximab, but will include a 10 mg test dose prior to enrollment

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Biopsy confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

          2. Patients diagnosed with any T stage, any subsite within the head and neck that are
             scheduled to undergo surgical resection. Patients with recurrent disease or a new
             primary will be allowed.

          3. Planned standard of care surgery with curative intent for squamous cell carcinoma

          4. Age ≥ 19 years

          5. Have life expectancy of more than 12 weeks

          6. Karnofsky performance status of at least 70% or ECOG/Zubrod level 1

          7. Have acceptable hematologic status, coagulation status, kidney function, and liver
             function including the following clinical results:

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9gm/dL

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3

               -  Magnesium, potassium and calcium greater than or equal than the lower limit of
                  normal range per institution normal lab values

               -  TSH &lt;10 micro International Units/mL

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Received an investigational drug within 30 days prior to first dose of
             cetuximab-IRDye800

          2. Had within 6 months prior to enrollment: MI, CVA, uncontrolled CHF, significant liver
             disease, unstable angina

          3. Inadequately controlled hypertension with or without current antihypertensive
             medications

          4. History of infusion reactions to cetuximab or other monoclonal antibody therapies.

          5. Women who are pregnant or breast feeding

          6. Patients who have a grade 2 or greater reaction with the test/loading cetuximab dose.

          7. Evidence of QT prolongation on pretreatment ECG (greater than 440 ms in males or
             greater than 450 ms in females).

          8. Lab values that in the opinion of the primary surgeon would prevent surgical
             resection.

          9. Patients receiving Class IA (quinidine, procanamide) or Class III (dofetilide,
             amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents.
