            "textblock": "Studies suggest that lutein and n-3 fatty acids may influence the development of a child's\n      brain and may be related to how well children learn. Both lutein and the n-3 fats (also\n      known as omega-3 fats) are not made by the body and must be obtained in the diet. The\n      investigators are interested to understand the importance of n-3 fats and lutein to child\n      brain development. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will make it possible to\n      look into the brain from the outside and see which parts of the brain are being used as\n      children complete working memory tasks. The investigators will study brain function using\n      fMRI among children with different intakes of n-3 fats and lutein.\n\n      Hypothesis:\n\n        1. Children 6 years of age consuming < 25 mg/day DHA and < 400 \u03bcg lutein/day will show\n           poorer activation of brain areas on fMRI than children consuming > 150 mg/day DHA and >\n           1,200 \u03bcg/day lutein.\n\n        2. Children consuming < 400 \u03bcg lutein/day and > 150 mg/day DHA will also show differences\n           in fMRI results when compared to children consuming > 150 mg/day DHA and > 1,200 \u03bcg/day\n           lutein."
