  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In heart failure (HF), the leading cause of decompensation and subsequent visits to
      emergency rooms and hospital readmission is congestion. The Diuretic Treatment Algorithm
      (DTA) was developed for adjustment of diuretics conducted by telephone by North-American
      nurses, with a focus on non-pharmacological and pharmacological evaluation and home
      management of patients with HF. This algorithm has proven to be an effective tool in
      preventing decompensation, significantly decreasing the rates of readmissions and 50% of
      hospitalizations related to HF at 30 days. In Brazil DTA proved applicable in clinical
      practice after adaption and appears to result in better congestion management in patients
      with heart failure. The clinical effectiveness of the tool should be tested in a larger
      patient sample aiming assess the Effectiveness of the algorithm diuretic in clinical
      stability and readmissions in heart failure patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In heart failure (HF), the leading cause of decompensation and subsequent visits to
      emergency rooms and hospital readmission is congestion. The identification of early signs
      and symptoms interrupts progressive exacerbation of the condition, with a direct impact on
      reduced costs, hospitalizations and mortality. One of the strategies that has already been
      proven to prevent exacerbation is intensive and systematic monitoring through telephone and
      home visits. In light of this, the Diuretic Treatment Algorithm (DTA) was developed for
      adjustment of diuretics conducted by telephone by North-American nurses, with a focus on
      non-pharmacological and pharmacological evaluation and home management of patients with HF.
      In Brazil DTA proved applicable in clinical practice after adaption and appears to result in
      better congestion management in patients with heart failure. This study aims to evaluate the
      Effectiveness of the algorithm diuretic in clinical stability and readmissions in heart
      failure patients.

      The hypothesis is that patients randomized to the intervention group (IG) - management by
      DTA followed with four 30-day telephone contacts reduce the signs and symptoms of
      congestion, body weight, submit improvement in functional class and fewer emergency room
      visits or readmissions when compared to the Control Group (CG) which will fit diuretic as
      medical management (no protocol) and no telephone contact followed during the same period.
      In 90 days everyone will receive a telephone call to assess hospitalizations at the end of
      the period.

    <description>The intervention group is conducted by a nurse in a systematic way during one time per week. If signs and symptoms of congestion, the dose of diuretic ( furosemide ) is revised , nonpharmacological guidelines are provided.
