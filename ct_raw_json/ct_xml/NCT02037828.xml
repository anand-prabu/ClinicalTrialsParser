      Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) is a worldwide leading and still increasing cause of
      chronic morbidity and mortality. The important issue of COPD is its delayed diagnosis.
      Previous studies have found that accelerated loss of forced expiratory volume in 1 second
      (FEV1.0) in an individual is considered an indicator of developing COPD. This functional
      predictive system, due to lower sensitivity, is very difficult to discover high-risk
      population and earlier stage of the disease. The inflammation occurs earlier than the lung
      function impairment. Therefore, early detection of the inflammation may theoretically
      predict the occurrence of COPD and thus may guide early intervention.

      Proteomics techniques and protein chip techniques provides us high throughput screening
      method to figure out characteristic inflammatory or metabolic markers of a diseases. It can
      be used for searching the biomarkers relating to lung function loss. EBC is collected from
      exhaled gas and is a good non-invasive method for exploring the pathologic process of the
      airways.

      Thus we designed this study. This study is divided into two parts: screening target
      biomarkers and identifying biomarkers. The first step is to screen target biomarkers. 20
      COPD patients and 20 controls are to be enrolled in the study and their EBC are to reserved.
      Proteomics techniques and protein chip techniques are to be used to screen COPD specific
      biomarkers. The second step is to  the biomarkers screened from the first step and make sure
      which can predict rapid decline of lung function. The study will be a community based,
      multicenter prospective cohort designed, which including a total of 2,400 study subjects.
      EBC are to reserved at the baseline and followed up for two years. Case group is defined as
      subjects with rapid decline of lung function and new COPD patients. Control group is
      selected according to 1:1 matching with age and gender of case group. ELISA are to be
      applied to compare the expressions of biomarkers of the two group at baseline.

      Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) is a worldwide leading and still increasing cause of
      chronic morbidity and mortality. It was estimated that 8.2% of adults population had the
      disease. Its mortality rate was doubled at 2002 than that of 1970 according to the data from
      America. COPD is the 4th leading cause of death worldwide. The earlier prediction and then
      earlier intervention of COPD will be one of the major tasks of pulmonary medicine in the
      21st Century.

      The important issue of COPD is its delayed diagnosis. Previous studies have found that
      accelerated loss of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1.0) in an individual is
      considered an indicator of developing COPD. The rapid decline in spirometry among geriatric
      population is one of the characteristics of COPD, and usually before the appearance of
      symptoms. Therefore functional test is still the only objective methods for diagnosis of
      COPD and guide its prevention and treatment in clinical practice. This functional predictive
      system, due to lower sensitivity, is very difficult to discover high-risk population and
      earlier stage of the disease. As ventilation dysfunction appears, the patient's
      pathophysiologic change would not be reversable completely. It is urgent to search sensitive
      and specific biomarkers correlating with the decline of pulmonary function and the
      occurrence of COPD in large-scale prospective epidemiological studies. The core
      pathophysiologic process of COPD is abnormal inflammatory response of the airway and lungs
      to the toxic particles or gases. The inflammation occurs earlier than the lung function
      impairment. Therefore, early detection of the inflammation may theoretically predict the
      occurrence of COPD and thus may guide early intervention. It is rational to establish a
      completely new predicting system basing on early inflammation discovery rather than only on
      function test. Then it is more convenient for large-scale population screening for COPD, and
      can even be used as high-risk groups of the periodic medical examination project. So as to
      achieve early intervention to prevent disease progression and improve quality of life, it is
      crucial to do some research to find out the sensitive and specific biomarkers correlating to
      accelerating FEV1.0 decline in Chinese population. It will be helpful to establish the early
      warning model of COPD among Chinese and thus to improve the ealy diagnosis and intervention
      of COPD. The predicting system may be with great value to prevent the development of the
      disease, improve the quality of life, reduce its burden and decrease its mortality rate.

      Proteomics techniques and protein chip techniques provides us high throughput screening
      method to figure out characteristic inflammatory or metabolic markers of a diseases. It can
      be used for searching the biomarkers relating to lung function loss. EBC is collected from
      exhaled gas and is a good non-invasive method for exploring the pathologic process of the
      airways.

      Thus we designed this study. This study is divided into two parts: screening target
      biomarkers and identifying biomarkers. The first step is to screen target biomarkers. 20
      COPD patients and 20 controls are to be enrolled in the study and their EBC are to reserved.

      which can predict rapid decline of lung function. The study will be a community based,

      EBC are to reserved at the baseline and followed up for two years. Case group is defined as

      selected according to 1:1 matching with age and gender of case group. ELISA are to be
