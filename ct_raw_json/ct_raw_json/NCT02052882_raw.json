Nucleoside Analogue, including gemcitabine and fluorouracil\n\n          2. Carboplatin or cisplatin\n\n          3. Anthracycline\n\n          4. Alkylating agent\n\n          5.

Defined as platelet count <100,000/mcL.\n\n        B.

Patients have undergone bone marrow aspirate and biopsy in the prior 2 weeks without\n        evidence of leukemia or myelodysplasia by fluorescent in situ-hybridization (FISH)FISH.\n        Dysplastic changes, based on morphology only, will not exclude the patient if FISH panel\n        for MDS is normal.\n\n        4.KPS > 50 or ECOG performance status <2 .\n\n        5.Ability to provide written informed consent.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1.
