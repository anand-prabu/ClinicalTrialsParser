A maximum of 12 sites will enroll 160 patients.\n\n      Each patient will be screened and then undergo a baseline evaluation followed by unilateral\n      or bilateral implantation of the Deep Brain Stimulation system.\n\n      During the implantation procedure, each patient will undergo a trial of stimulation in the\n      operating room.  The device may be internalized after a successful intra-operative trial or\n      at a later surgery (no later than 4 weeks after initial lead placement). If the device is\n      not activated immediately post-surgery, the patient may return to the clinic to determine\n      optimum stimulation programming. Device programming will be optimized in as many visits as\n      necessary following implantation. The day that the device is fully implanted will be\n      classified as \"Day 0\" for each patient.\n\n      After \"Day 0\" the patient will return to clinic for evaluations at, Day 90 (+ 14 days), and\n      Day 180 (+ 14 days) and Day 365  (approximately 12 months + 30 days after Day 0).  These\n      evaluations consist of the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST), the Quality of Life in\n      Essential Tremor (QUEST), the Short Form questionnaire (SF36), Patient and caregiver Global\n      Ratings and the Patient Satisfaction Rating.\n\n      At Baseline and Day 180, the CRST evaluation session will be video recorded for analysis by\n      an independent evaluator unaware of the functioning of the device. Additionally, at the Day\n      180 visit, the physician will have the option to provide the patient with amplitude control.\n       A comparison of measures within the same person from pre-treatment to post-treatment will\n      be performed. Also, pre-treatment and post-treatment group means and standard deviations\n      will be determined.\n\n      After the 1 year study patient may be enrolled in another protocol (C-06-03) for an\n      additional 4 years.  This observational, long term follow up study will continue to monitor\n      the safety and efficacy of the Libra Deep Brain Stimulation System.\n\n      If necessary, after the C-06-03 protocol the patients will have continued access to the\n      investigational device through a compassionate use protocol (C-13-02)."
