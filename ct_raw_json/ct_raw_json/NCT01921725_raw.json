The first layer is a material of\n      polyethylene terephthalate (PET) weave which is great breathable; Second layer, the\n      activated carbon fiber cloth, is as the absorption of excess tissue fluid, bacteria and\n      contaminations. It reduces the smell of wound and restrains the development of bacteria. In\n      addition, activated carbon has features of far-infrared and anion, which promote blood\n      circulation, speed up metabolism and shorten the time of wound healing. The third layer is a\n      polyethlene (PE) film, which touches the wound surface and provides the anti-adhesion\n      effects.\n\n      The aim of this study is to investigate how the application of the dressing affects the\n      wound healing conditions on four different types of wounds, including general traumatic\n      wounds, elective surgery wound, diabetes foot ulcer (level 2) and chronic wounds. Due to the\n      characteristics of great fluid absorption and far-infrared features, the hydrophilic-based\n      dressing (KoCarbonTM) is expected to work perfectly on improving the wound repair\n      conditions."
