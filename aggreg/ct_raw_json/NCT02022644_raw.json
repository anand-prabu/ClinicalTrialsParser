            "textblock": "High grade gliomas (HGG) are the most common brain tumor in adults, with 15,000 new\n      cases/year in the USA. Despite progress made using combination therapies including surgery,\n      radiation and/or chemotherapy, the treatment of HGG remains challenging with a typical\n      median survival of 6-12 months for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme\n      (GB) and 24-36 months for patients with anaplastic astrocytoma. The time to tumor\n      progression of patients with recurrent GBM is nine weeks and the median survival is 25\n      weeks, while for recurrent anaplastic astrocytomas (AA), the time to tumor progression is 13\n      weeks and the median survival is 47 weeks. More recently, single-agent Avastin has been seen\n      to improve 6-month progression-free survival (PFS-6) to 42.6% as well as increase Median\n      Overall Survival to 9.3 months in patients with recurrent GBM. However, chemotherapy\n      treatment for malignant gliomas has limitations given the low activity of available\n      antineoplastic agents, the emergence or de-novo presence of resistance to such agents, the\n      sensitivity of the brain to irreversible damage from a therapeutic modality, and the\n      compromised delivery of these agents to partially privileged intracranial sites. Effective\n      agents with novel mechanisms of action need to be evaluated in HGG which account for these\n      limitations.\n\n      With these limitations in mind, this study directs attention to two particularly appealing\n      delivery modalities which may improve the efficacy of neuro-oncologic chemotherapeutic\n      agents: liposomes (liposomal irinotecan) and convection enhanced delivery (CED). Liposomes\n      are typically composed of double chain phospholipid amphiphiles (chemical compounds with\n      combined hydrophilic and lipophilic properties) in combination with cholesterol, forming\n      spheroidal bilayer membrane structures that encompass an aqueous internal domain.  Based on\n      structural/pharmacologic features, distinct liposome classes have been developed to package\n      various therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer. From the circulating bloodstream,\n      liposomes are able to diffuse across the blood brain barrier (BBB) due to their lipophilic\n      characteristics. An example is liposomal irinotecan which may reduce the toxicity of\n      irinotecan to healthy tissues while maintaining or increasing its anti-tumor potency.\n\n      CED improves chemotherapeutic delivery to brain tumors intraparenchymally by utilizing bulk\n      flow, or fluid convection, established as a result of a pressure gradient, rather than a\n      concentration gradient. As such, CED offers markedly improved distribution of infused\n      therapeutics within the central nervous system (CNS) compared to direct injection or via\n      drug eluting polymers, both of which depend on diffusion for parenchymal distribution.\n      Additionally, CED obviates the challenges of systemic agents crossing the blood brain\n      barrier while minimizing systemic exposure and toxicity. Through the maintenance of a\n      pressure gradient from the delivery cannula tip to the surrounding tissues, CED is able to\n      distribute small and large molecules, including high molecular weight proteins, to\n      clinically significant target volumes centimeters rather than millimeters in diameter.\n      Although developed independently, work combining the two delivery options, liposomes and\n      CED, is presently underway in an effort to improve treatment efficacy in the treatment of\n      CNS malignancies. This clinical trial is a step in this direction with a prospective,\n      single-arm, open-label trial that delivers liposomal-irinotecan and gadolinium (which\n      provided real time imaging of delivery) by CED in patients with recurrent malignant glioma.\n\n      Added to this logic is support from a recent preclinical study at the University of\n      California, San Francisco (UCSF) which compared routes of delivery for liposomal irinotecan\n      (CED versus IV) and showed superior anti-tumor activity of CED administration in treating\n      mice with intracranial glioblastoma xenografts. In total, such results indicate that\n      liposomal formulation plus direct intratumoral administration of therapeutic are important\n      for maximizing the anti-tumor effects of irinotecan and support the current clinical trial\n      evaluation of this therapeutic plus CED route of administration combination."
