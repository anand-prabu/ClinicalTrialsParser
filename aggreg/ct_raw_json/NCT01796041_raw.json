            "textblock": "According to the World Health Organization, breast cancer is the most common cancer in\n      women, and is responsible for 686,000 new cases every year. The WHO also posit that nearly\n      420,000 women perished from the disease in 2002. Surgery remains the best option for\n      patients presenting with operable Stage I, II or III cancers.  Breast conservation surgery\n      has been shown to be as efficacious as mastectomy.  About 60-70% of these women with\n      operable breast cancer are breast conservation candidates.  However, the need to achieve\n      negative tumor margins often requires a second operation (re-excision) in up to 70% of the\n      women having lumpectomy surgery. Currently, tumor margins assessment in the operating room\n      is often assessed grossly by palpation. The ability to evaluate tumor margin using our\n      proposed intraoperative imaging technique may provide the surgeon with an alternative, and\n      hopefully, more sensitive method to assess tumor margins which may decrease re-excision and\n      the morbidity associated with additional surgery, and, perhaps, lower the risk of local\n      regional recurrence."
