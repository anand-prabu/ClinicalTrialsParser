Adenomatous polyps are growths in the colon that may develop into colorectal cancer\n      overtime. Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response\n      to kill polyp cells. MUC1 peptide-poly-ICLC adjuvant vaccine may also prevent the recurrence\n      of adenomatous polyps and may prevent the development of colorectal cancer."

To compare the immunogenicity at week 12 of a mucin 1 (MUC1) peptide vaccine with\n      adjuvant (MUC1 peptide-poly-ICLC adjuvant vaccine) (administered at 0, 2, and 10 weeks) in\n      participants with a history of an advanced adenoma, randomized to receive MUC1 peptide\n      vaccine versus placebo.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To evaluate the ability of the vaccine to elicit a long\u2010term memory response.\n\n      II. To compare the adenoma recurrence rate from surveillance exams occurring at least 1 year\n      and up to 3 years after week 0 vaccine administration - MUC1 versus placebo.\n\n      III. To compare the adenoma recurrence rates between MUC1 and placebo by excluding the\n      following types of adenomas: participants with adenomas =< 5 mm; participants with\n      adenomatous tissue which may represent residual adenoma at the site of the previous advanced\n      adenoma; participants with adenomatous tissue detected in the same segment of the bowel as\n      the previous advanced adenoma.\n\n      IV. To assess adverse events to the MUC1 peptide vaccine in comparison to placebo during\n      Parts I and II.\n\n      V. To assess patient reported injection site reaction events from the Vaccine Report Card.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To compare the anti\u2010MUC1 antibody titer at the time of surveillance colonoscopy for the\n      purpose of evaluating the anti\u2010MUC1 antibody response in relation to adenoma recurrence.\n\n      II. To evaluate MUC1 expression on baseline advanced adenomas and on recurrent adenomas\n      detected at surveillance colonoscopy.\n\n      III. To evaluate levels of circulating myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in the\n      vaccinated and the placebo group and correlate with anti\u2010MUC1 antibody levels and adenoma\n      recurrence.\n\n      IV. To establish a biospecimen repository archive including live cells, plasma, and germline\n      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for future immunologic (e.g. MUC1\u2010specific T cells) and other\n      assays (systems biology approach to detect differences between responders and\n      non\u2010responders), testing not currently accommodated within the budget of this trial.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I: Participants receive MUC1 peptide-poly-ICLC adjuvant vaccine subcutaneously (SC) in\n      weeks 0, 2 and 10 and a booster injection in week 53.\n\n      ARM II: Participants receive placebo vaccine SC in weeks 0, 2, and 10 and a booster\n      injection in week 53.\n\n      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 3 years."
