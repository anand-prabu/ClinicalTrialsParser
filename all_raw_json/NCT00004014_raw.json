Determine the toxic effects\n      (including any cumulative cardiotoxicity) of this regimen in these patients. III. Assess the\n      effect of this regimen on pain and quality of life of these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 45 minutes every 3 weeks.\n      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality\n      of life is assessed at baseline and then every 9 weeks thereafter. Patients are followed\n      every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 50 evaluable patients will be accrued for this study."
