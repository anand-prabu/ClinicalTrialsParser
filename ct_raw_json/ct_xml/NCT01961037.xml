  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls are the leading cause of death and injuries in adults over age 65 both nationally and
      in West Virginia.  Rurality, age, physical inactivity, and chronic conditions, such as
      arthritis, are strong risk factors for falls in this population.  West Virginia has a higher
      than average fall rate, the second oldest population, the greatest proportion of inactive
      adults, and the second highest prevalence of arthritis in the US.  Thus, older adults in
      rural West Virginia are at high risk for falls and in great need of public health fall
      prevention programs.  The Tai Chi: Moving for Better Balance (MFBB) program is a
      community-based, fall-prevention exercise program for older adults.  A waiver of informed
      consent will be requested to conduct the telephone screenings to determine study
      eligibility.  We will enroll up to 300 people in classes to be held at 20 churches in West
      Virginia.  Classes will be held twice per week for 16 weeks and taught by certified MFBB
      instructors.  Participants will be interviewed by telephone, have a brief physical function
      ability exam, and complete a questionnaire before starting the exercise class, at the end of
      the class, and 4 months later.  The study is being conducted to answer the following
      questions: 1) What are the functional improvements of older adults who participate in a
      16-week MFBB program; 2) What is the rate of falls for those adults; 3) What is the rate and
      severity of those fall-related injuries of the MFBB participants?  The purpose of the study
      is to: 1) implement a 16-week intervention of MFBB with a 16-week follow-up, in older adults
      in churches in rural West Virginia; 2) describe functional and fall/injury outcomes.
      Ultimately, we will translate an efficacious and effective fall-prevention intervention into
      a new setting.
