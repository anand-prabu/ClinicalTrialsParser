  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test a new vitamin D compound for its ability to reduce
      parathyroid hormone levels in patients who are on hemodialysis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the vitamin D analog
      2-methylene-19-nor-20S-1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (DP001) in patients with end-stage renal
      disease (ESRD).  The effect of 12 weeks of oral administration of DP001 on serum parathyroid
      hormone (PTH) levels will be evaluated in ESRD patients who have secondary
      hyperparathyroidism.
