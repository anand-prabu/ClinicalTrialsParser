  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1b of the study will evaluate the safety of talimogene laherparepvec in combination
      with ipilimumab.  Phase 2 is a randomized study that will evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of talimogene laherparepvec in combination with ipilimumab versus ipilumumab alone.
      Talimogene laherparepvec will be administered by intratumor injection, and ipilimumab will
      be administered by intravenous infusion for a total of 4 infusions.  Subjects will be
      treated with talimogene laherparepvec until complete response, all injectable tumors have
      disappeared, disease progression per a modified Immune-Related Response Criteria (irRC), or
      intolerance of study treatment.
