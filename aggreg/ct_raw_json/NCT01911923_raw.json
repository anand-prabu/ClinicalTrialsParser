Even a\n      recruitment maneuver, followed by ventilation with 100% oxygen with a PEEP/CPAP of 10 cm H2O\n      until extubation, failed to improve postoperative oxygenation compared with that achieved\n      with zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP).This failure may have been caused by the presence\n      of lung regions with high oxygen concentrations.\n\n      The investigators hypothesized that by inducing and discontinuing anesthesia during\n      CPAP/PEEP and deliberately reducing FIO2 after extubation, postoperative atelectasis would\n      be reduced compared with standard protocols. To test our hypothesis, the investigators\n      studied 1) a control group with no CPAP/PEEP and a FIO2 of 1.0 while breathing spontaneously\n      after extubation, and 2) an intervention group that was on CPAP/PEEP of 6 cmH2O from\n      induction to extubation and that received an FIO2 of 1.0 until extubation and then an FIO2\n      of 0.3 via a facemask while on CPAP after extubation."
