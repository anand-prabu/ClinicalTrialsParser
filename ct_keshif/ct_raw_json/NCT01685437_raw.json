Subjects\n        who completed their participation in Auxilium-sponsored studies AUX-CC-803 or AUX-CC-804\n        and received placebo in that study may enroll in this study provided they continue to meet\n        the eligibility requirements. To qualify for the study a subject must:\n\n          1. Have penile curvature of at least 30\u00b0 in the dorsal, lateral, or dorsal/lateral plane\n             at screening. It must be possible to delineate the single plane of maximal curvature\n             for evaluation during the study\n\n          2. Be judged to be in good health, based upon the results of a medical history, physical\n             examination,and laboratory profile\n\n          3. Have participated in Study AUX-CC-803 or Study AUX-CC-804, received placebo in that\n             study,and completed that study\n\n          4. Voluntarily sign and date an informed consent agreement approved by the Institutional\n             Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC). The subject must also sign an\n             authorization form to allow disclosure of his protected health information (PHI). The\n             PHI authorization form and informed consent form may be an integrated form or may be\n             separate forms depending on the institution\n\n          5. Be able to read, complete and understand the various rating instruments in English.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        A subject will be excluded from study participation if he:\n\n          1. Has a penile curvature of less than 30\u00b0 or greater than 90\u00b0 at the screening visit\n\n          2. Has any of the following conditions:\n\n               -  Chordee in the presence or absence of hypospadias\n\n               -  Thrombosis of the dorsal penile artery and/or vein\n\n               -  Infiltration by a benign or malignant mass resulting in penile curvature\n\n               -  Infiltration by an infectious agent, such as lymphogranuloma venereum\n\n               -  Ventral curvature from any cause\n\n               -  Presence of an active sexually transmitted disease\n\n               -  Known active hepatitis B or C\n\n               -  Known immune deficiency disease or be positive for human immunodeficiency virus\n                  (HIV)\n\n          3. Has previously undergone surgery for Peyronie's disease\n\n          4. Fails to have an erection which in the opinion of the investigator is sufficient to\n             accurately measure the subject's penile deformity after administration of\n             prostaglandin E1 or trimix or another suitable injectable pharmacologic stimulant\n             according to the standard practice at the investigator's institution\n\n          5. Has a calcified plaque as evident by appropriate radiographic evaluation, penile\n             x-ray or penile ultrasound that would prevent proper injection of study medication.\n             Non-contiguous stippling of calcium is acceptable for inclusion provided the calcium\n             deposit does not interfere with the injection of AA4500 into the plaque\n\n          6. Has an isolated hourglass deformity of the penis\n\n          7. Has the plaque causing curvature of the penis located proximal to the base of the\n             penis, so that the injection of the local anesthetic would interfere with the\n             injection of AA4500 into the plaque\n\n          8. Has previously received alternative medical therapies for Peyronie's disease\n             administered by the intralesional route (including, but not limited to, steroids,\n             verapamil, and the naturally occurring low molecular weight protein, interferon-\u03b12b)\n             within 3 months before the first dose of study drug or plans to use any of these\n             medical therapies at any time during the study\n\n          9. Has received alternative medical therapies for Peyronie's disease administered by the\n             oral (including, but not limited to, vitamin E [>500 U], potassium aminobenzoate\n             [Potaba], tamoxifen, colchicine, and pentoxifylline, ,) or topical routes (including,\n             but not limited to, verapamil applied as a cream) within 3 months before the first\n             dose of study drug or plans to use any of these medical therapies at any time during\n             the study\n\n         10. Has had extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) for the correction of Peyronie's\n             disease within the 6-month period before screening or plans to have ESWT at any time\n             during the study\n\n         11. Has used any mechanical type device for correction of Peyronie's disease within the\n             2-week period before screening or plans to use any these devices at any time during\n             the study\n\n         12. Has used a mechanical device to induce a passive erection within the 2-week period\n             before screening or plans to use any of these devices at any time during the study\n\n         13. Has significant erectile dysfunction that has failed to respond to oral treatment\n             with phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors\n\n         14. Has a penile Duplex Doppler ultrasound evaluation at screening that shows compromised\n             penile hemodynamics that in the opinion of the investigator is clinically significant\n\n         15. Has uncontrolled hypertension, as determined by the investigator\n\n         16. Has a known recent history of stroke, bleeding, or other significant medical\n             condition, which in the investigator's opinion would make the subject unsuitable for\n             enrollment in the study\n\n         17. Has received an investigational drug or treatment within 30 days before the first\n             dose of study drug, except for placebo in Studies AUX-CC-803 or AUX-CC-804\n\n         18. Has a known systemic allergy to collagenase or any other excipient of AA4500\n\n         19. Has a known allergy to any concomitant medication required as per the protocol\n\n         20. Has received anticoagulant medication (except for \u2264 150 mg aspirin daily) during the\n             7 days before each dose of study drug\n\n         21. Has received any collagenase treatments within 30 days of the first dose of study\n             drug\n\n         22. Has, at any time, received AA4500 for the treatment of Peyronie's disease\n\n         23. Is unwilling or unable to cooperate with the requirements of the study including\n             completion of all scheduled study visits"
