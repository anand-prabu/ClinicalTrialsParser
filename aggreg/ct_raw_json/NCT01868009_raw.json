At the end of the second period, subjects will\n      complete the study by answering 7 questions to assess their preference of device attributes\n      and dosing regimens between the two inhalers.\n\n      The null hypothesis for device preference for a specific attribute is that 50% subjects\n      express a preference in that attribute for ELLIPTA and 50% do NOT express a preference in\n      that attribute for ELLIPTA, i.e., the odds for preferring ELLIPTA to not preferring ELLIPTA\n      is unity.\n\n      The null hypothesis for dosing regimen preference is that 50% subjects express a preference\n      of once daily dosing and 50% do not express a preference of once daily dosing (prefer twice\n      daily dosing or have no preference)."

Drug/alcohol abuse: Subjects with a known or suspected alcohol or drug abuse at\n             Visit 1 which in the opinion of the investigator could interfere with the subject's\n             proper completion of the protocol requirement\n\n          -  8. Medication prior to spirometry: Subjects who are medically unable or unwilling to\n             withhold their COPD medications prior to spirometry testing at Visit 1.
