After consultation w/ FDA, design was\n      modified to eliminate the Lupron arm and continued the study as an open-label non-randomized\n      study.\n\n      Primary endpoint was testosterone suppression, as assessed by the percent of patients whose\n      testosterone indicated chemical castration levels (<=50 ng/dL) through 52 weeks of treatment\n      with an implant."
