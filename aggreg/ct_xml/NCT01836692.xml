  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients having a course of chest radiotherapy treatment after receiving
      chemotherapy for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Patients with non-small cell
      lung cancer have a risk of the tumour in the lung recurring or progressing after treatment.

      In this study, we will investigate:

        -  whether giving a more targeted and individualised type of chest irradiation or
           radiotherapy to the lung tumour (known as Isotoxic IMRT), is practical and whether it
           causes side effects which can be tolerated

        -  whether this new method of delivering the radiotherapy can reduce the risk of the
           tumour in the lung recurring or progressing

        -  whether survival can be improved by using this new radiotherapy method

      The dose of chest irradiation will be calculated specifically to suit patient's body shape,
      the position of the lung cancer, and how close healthy tissues are to the tumour.
      Radiotherapy will be delivered twice a day over a maximum period of 4.5 weeks. The duration
      of treatment will vary individually according to the delivered dose to the tumour area.

      Background:

      Approximately 12,000 patients are diagnosed with stage III NSCLC in the UK each year and
      their survival is ~15% at 5 years. As the majority of patients are not suitable for the gold
      standard treatment (concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CTRT), novel strategies integrating
      radiotherapy (RT) technological advances and radiobiological knowledge need to be evaluated
      in patients treated with the alternative treatment option, sequential CTRT. There is solid
      evidence that improving local control in lung cancer leads to increased survival. Strategies
      to improve local control in stage III NSCLC include dose escalation and individualisation
      which are limited by the dose delivered to surrounding normal tissues. We hypothesise that
      this will be facilitated by the use of IMRT.

      Objectives:

      To demonstrate the feasibility of delivering isotoxic RT using IMRT and hyperfractionated
      accelerated RT in stage III NSCLC patients who are not suitable for concurrent CTRT.

      Endpoints:

      Primary endpoint: Delivery of isotoxic IMRT to dose &gt;60 Gy EQD2 (total biologically
      equivalent in 2 Gy fraction).

      Secondary endpoints: Estimation of the suitability for lung isotoxic IMRT, estimation of
      proportion of patients with acute grade 3+ non haematological toxicity, estimation of late
      toxicity,  estimation of local control/overall survival and development of a robust Quality
      Assurance (QA) process for lung IMRT.

      Design:

      Prospective multicentre, non-randomised feasibility study with early stopping rules.

      35 patients will be recruited in this prospective multicentre feasibility study. Stopping
      rules are in place to ensure the safety of patients. We estimate that this regimen would be
      of added value to a national randomised phase II trial if 80% of the patients can be planned
      to a dose &gt;60 Gy EQD2.

      Intervention:

      Patients with stage III NSCLC, PS 0-2, not suitable for concurrent CTRT, will be treated
      with individualised doses of radiation based on pre-specified normal tissue doses (spinal
      cord, brachial plexus, lung tissue, heart and great vessels/proximal bronchial tree).
      Radiotherapy will be delivered twice-daily over a maximum period of 4.5 weeks using IMRT and
      the dose of radiation will be increased until one or more of the organs at risk tolerance or
      the maximum dose of 79.2 Gy is reached.
