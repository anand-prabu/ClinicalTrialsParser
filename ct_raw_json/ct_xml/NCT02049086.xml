  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal will develop and test an indicated prevention strategy, Screening, Brief
      Intervention and Referral to Treatment with Pain-Management advice (SBIRT-PM), in Veterans
      who have filed a claim for a (military) service-connected injury for which they have
      requested financial compensation. Although typically only an information-gathering,
      forensic-styled examination, the Compensation examination is a crucial point of entry to VA
      care. Objectives are:

        1. To finalize the procedures, manual, and training materials of SBIRT-PM. The goals of
           this stage will be (1) optimizing SBIRT-PM's appeal to Veterans concerned about their
           musculoskeletal conditions and their Compensation claims; and (2) finalizing the
           counseling materials and procedures.

        2. To conduct a randomized clinical trial comparing SBIRT-PM to a no referral arm and a
           pain module only arm.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Veteran of OEF/OIF/OND

          -  Scheduled exam for back, neck, knee, or shoulder. These four body parts were selected
             because they are classified as MSD by the VBA and are common causes of chronic
             non-cancer pain. Including other conditions (e.g. osteomyelitis, muscle injuries)
             would introduce more heterogeneity in illness course.

          -  Able to participate psychologically and physically, able to provide informed consent,
             complete assessments, and participate in study procedures.

          -  Self-reports peak pain of at least 2 on a numeric pain rating scale (0 &quot;no pain&quot; to
             10 &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot; in the last 28 days in the joint that is the focus of the
             claim. This broad pain inclusion criterion may be narrowed after the Counseling
             Refinement Stage. Some Veterans apply for service connection for injuries that are
             not currently symptomatic, in case the injury recurs. This criterion will exclude
             these asymptomatic Veterans

          -  Risky substance use within the last 28 days, defined as one of the following:

               1. Risky alcohol use: i.e. &gt;14 drinks/week or&gt;4 drinks/occasion for men 65 or
                  younger; &gt;7 drinks/week or &gt;3 drinks/occasion for women. A standard drink will
                  be 14 grams of absolute alcohol, equivalent to 12 oz of beer, 5 oz of wine, or
                  1.5 oz of 80-proof liquor

               2. Self-reported use of an illicit drug in the preceding 28 days. Use of opioids or
                  sedative hypnotics not prescribed to the Veteran will be considered illicit drug
                  use.

               3. Misuse of prescribed opioid medications in the preceding 28 days. Two questions
                  adapted from the CIDI for use in a NIDA Clinical Trials Network study, were
                  modified to describe misuse of prescribed opioid medications: &quot;How often have
                  you taken your pain medications in larger amounts than prescribed or for a
                  longer period than prescribed?&quot; and &quot;How often have you used your pain medicines
                  to get high, to relax, or to make you feel more alert?&quot;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Will not be able to attend the follow-up appointments.

          -  Attended VA or non-VA substance abuse treatment during the three months prior to
             randomization. Veterans who are receiving mental health treatment but indicate it is
             not addressing substance use will be enrolled.

          -  Physiological dependence on alcohol, illicit drugs, or non-prescribed opioids. People
             with more severe dependence have not benefited from SBIRT in prior studies.
