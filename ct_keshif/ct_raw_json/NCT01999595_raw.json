All participants meeting entry requirements will be invited\n      to participate in the experiments which take place on a separate occasion.\n\n      Each participant will sign the consent form and will be told again that they can withdraw\n      from the study at any time and without explanation. Each participant will be required to\n      experience a 10-minute pre-stimulation period, a 30 minute TENS intervention, a 30 minute\n      follow-up period.\n\n      Participants will be seated on a chair with arm support provided by a side table. The\n      investigator will be then informed the stimulation intervention and used pad size on the\n      stimulation periods in written form contained in a sealed envelope. After the participant's\n      verbal permission is obtained, the investigator will apply the pads on the dorsal forearm\n      area.\n\n      Either the large size pad, 5cm x 10cm, or the small size,2.5cm x 2.5cm, will be choose to\n      place on the dorsal side of the forearm to straddle the site for blunt pressure pain. The\n      muscle bellies of the forearm are mainly located on the proximal half part. The proximal pad\n      will be attached to the lateral epi-condyle of the elbow, and the distal electrode will be\n      placed 3cm distal to the proximal one along the line between the lateral part of  elbow and\n      the mid-point of the wrist. The pads will be then connected to the intervention stimulator.\n      The investigator will relay instructions to the participants using cue cards displayed 30\n      seconds before any required action.\n\n      Before each blunting pressure pain test, the participant will sit comfortably and place\n      their right upper extremity on a side table with the shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, the\n      forearm pronation. The test will be induced using a pressure algometer with a flat circular\n      probe, measuring 1.1cm in diameter (1cm2 on skin surface). Force will be displayed digitally\n      in increments of 0.1 Newton. The algometer will be applied to the mid-point between the\n      intervention pads. The rate of the pressure algometer application will be around 6 Newtons\n      per second on average. The participants will be asked to concentrate on the sensations in\n      the forearm. When the pressure becomes definitely painful, the participant will state\n      \"Pain!\" and the force will be stopped. The pain threshold will be taken twice in a minute\n      for one test and each measurement will take no more than 30 seconds.\n\n      There will be seven 1-minute tests performed in this experiment. The first test in\n      pre-stimulation period. The second and third tests were administered and started at 9, 19,\n      29 minute time points in the stimulation-on period. A 30 minute post stimulation period will\n      be then followed. Another 3 tests will be performed in this period in ten-minute intervals\n      at 39, 49, 59 minute time points after the stimulation start."
