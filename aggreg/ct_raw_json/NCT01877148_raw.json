Furthermore, before and\n      after each session the patients were submitted to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to\n      evaluate cortical excitability through motor threshold and motor evoked potential.\n\n      In experimental sessions, the subjects always received physiotherapy with conventional\n      techniques, the protocol followed the clinical practice guideline for physical therapy in\n      Parkinson disease with  the Royal Dutch Society Therapy. During tDCS protocol the patients\n      seated in a comfortable chair with head and arm rests. Continuous current was applied using\n      a pair of saline-soaked surface sponge electrodes (surface 35 cm2), the anode electrode was\n      placed over the primary motor cortex and cathode above contralateral orbit. tDCS was applied\n      of twice stimulation of 13 minutes with 20 minutes of interval between them and a current\n      strength of 1mA.
