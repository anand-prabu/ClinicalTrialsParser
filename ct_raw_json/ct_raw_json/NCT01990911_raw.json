Restoration of autonomic imbalance may therefore prevent\n      new-onset AF.\n\n      Renal artery denervation (RDN) is a novel percutaneous procedure that uses radio-frequency\n      energy to destroy the sympathetic renal nerves. Symplicity 1 and -2 studies have shown that\n      RDN effectively reduces blood pressure in up to 80% of treated patients. LVH regression and\n      improvement of diastolic dysfunction follow as a consequence of afterload reduction and\n      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system modulation. RDN may thus also reduce intra-atrial\n      pressure resulting in less stretch of the pulmonary venous ostia where most ectopic AF-foci\n      originate.\n\n      Hypothesis: RDN restores autonomic imbalance in HTHD and lowers intra-atrial pressure by\n      reducing afterload. These synergistic mechanisms may prevent new-onset AF."
