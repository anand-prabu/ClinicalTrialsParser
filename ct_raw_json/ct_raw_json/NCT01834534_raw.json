            "textblock": "This project will test a practical intervention that uses low cost technologies to activate\n      depressed patients' existing social networks for self-management support. The intervention\n      links patients with a \"CarePartner\" (CP), i.e., a non-household family member or close\n      friend who is willing to support the patient in coordination with the clinician and any\n      existing in-home caregiver (ICG). Through weekly automated telemonitoring, patients report\n      their mood and self-management status, and receive tailored guidance on self-management. The\n      CP receives a corresponding update along with guidance on how to best support the patient's\n      self-management efforts, and the primary care team is notified about clinically urgent\n      situations. The intervention will be tested among depressed primary care patients from\n      clinics serving low-income and underinsured patients, whom the intervention was especially\n      designed to benefit. Specific Aim 1 is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare\n      the effectiveness of one year of telemonitoring-supported CP for depression versus usual\n      care (control) on depression severity. Specific Aim 2 is to examine key secondary outcomes\n      (response and remission, impairment, well-being, caregiving burden, healthcare costs) and\n      potential moderators. Specific Aim 3 is to use a mixed-methods approach to enrich our\n      interpretation of the statistical associations, and to discover strategies to enhance the\n      intervention's acceptability, effectiveness, and sustainability.  If the intervention proves\n      effective without increasing clinician burden or marginal costs, then its subsequent\n      implementation could yield major public health benefits, especially in medically underserved\n      populations."
