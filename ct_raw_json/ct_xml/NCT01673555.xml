  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to explore whether short-term therapy with GSK1278863 affects PASP
      under normoxic and hypoxic conditions in healthy volunteers. Healthy subjects will be
      evaluated using echocardiography to estimate PASP based on the velocity of the tricuspid
      regurgitant jet. Resting PASP will be assessed under normoxic (room air) conditions, as well
      as after 30 minutes' exposure to 15% O2 before, during, and after short-term treatment with
      GSK1278863.

      This is a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blinded (subjects and
      investigators will be blinded, GSK internal personnel will not be blinded) study designed to
      test whether short-term administration (5 days) of GSK1278863 affects PASP under normoxic
      and hypoxic conditions in healthy volunteers. Approximately 45 healthy subjects with
      mild-moderate baseline tricuspid regurgitation (sufficient to allow reliable assessment of
      PASP) will be enrolled into this study and will provide ~15 evaluable subjects in each arm
      [Placebo, 5 mg, and 100 mg GSK 1278863].

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin less than and equal to 1.5xULN (isolated

             evaluation including [medical history, physical examination and laboratory tests]. A
             subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference
             range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and
             the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional
             risk and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  A hemoglobin value at screening between 13.5- 16 g/dL.

          -  Male subjects between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one
             of the contraception methods listed in the protocol. This criterion must be followed

          -  Screening echocardiogram of at least good quality, without clinically significant
             abnormalities, and with mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation sufficient for the
             reliable estimation of PASP, as determined by the echocardiography core laboratory or
             responsible cardiologist.

          -  Screening PASP within the normal range under normoxic conditions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             result.

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary
             abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen.

          -  Any history of IV drug abuse.

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody.

             average weekly intake of greater than 14 drinks for males or greater than 7 drinks
             for females. One drink is equivalent to 12 g of alcohol: 12 ounces (360 ml) of beer,
             5 ounces (150 ml) of wine or 1.5 ounces (45 ml) of 80 proof distilled spirits.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.
