      This proposal aims to demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of adapting TEAMcare for
      patients with schizophrenia.  The aim of this innovative mental health center-based team
      intervention is to improve diabetes, cardiovascular and psychiatric outcomes among patients
      with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. The study will be conducted in two phases over the
      2-year grant period.

      Phase 1.  Development of the adapted TEAMcare intervention and training of team members.

      Phase 2.  During year 2, we will implement the intervention on the caseload of 40
      outpatients at Harborview Mental Health Services with schizophrenia and poorly controlled
      type 2 diabetes. The intervention involves the management of subjects' diabetes,
      hypertension, and hyperlipidemia by a CMHC diabetes team for 6 months (advanced nurse
      specialist on-site at supervised in weekly meetings by a psychiatrist and a UW Diabetes
      Center endocrinologist).

      The primary aim of this pilot research grant is to evaluate the feasibility of implementing
      this complex intervention, in order to guide the design of a larger scale efficacy study
      (R01). Both process and outcome measures will be evaluated at baseline, and at 3- and
      6-month follow-up visits for the 40 subjects enrolled in this feasibility trial.

    <description>TEAMcare is an evidence-based collaborative care approach to the treatment of diabetes and psychiatric illness. It involves structured visits with a study nurse to monitor psychiatric symptoms, control of medical disease, and self-care activities. The nurses use motivational coaching to help patients solve problems and set goals for improved self-care and medication adherence. Medications for diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia are monitored and therapy intensified based on treat-to-target guidelines. All of these process and outcome measures are tracked in a registry designed for the study, and the nurses receive weekly supervision with a psychiatrist, an endocrinologist and a psychologist in order to review new cases and to track progress. Once a patient achieves targeted levels for relevant measures, the patient and the nurse develop a maintenance plan.</description>
