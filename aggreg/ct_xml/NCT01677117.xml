  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS) fatality
      rate can be as high as 20% -41%, once progress is severe of ARDS, mortality rose to 90%, the
      main cause of death was refractory hypoxemia. Mechanical ventilation as the main measure to
      improve hypoxemia cannot correct all hypoxemia and relating complications of mechanical
      ventilation, mechanical ventilation in the treatment of severe ARDS has gradually been
      challenged.  Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation（ECMO) technology matures, so that
      clinicians have more choices in the face of hypoxemia, and with the deepening understanding
      of ECMO, ECMO may become severe ARDS first-line treatment. Currently, ECMO therapy has been
      recognized by the majority of medical workers. Therefore, we assume that accurately grasping
      the ECMO indications and standardizing the implementation of treatment can significantly
      improve the prognosis, shorter hospital stays, lower hospitalization costs.
