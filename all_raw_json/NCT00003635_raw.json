Determine the\n      safety (including incidence of infection) of this drug in these patients. III. Evaluate the\n      pharmacokinetics of 506U78 and ara-G, and assess the intracellular pharmacokinetics of\n      ara-GTP in patients receiving multiple treatment courses (at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center\n      only). IV. Determine the response rate, time to maximal response, and duration of response\n      in patients treated with this drug. V. Determine two-year survival and progression-free\n      survival of patients treated with this drug.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to cellular type of\n      disease (B cell vs T cell). Patients receive 506U78 IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5.\n      Treatment repeats every 28 days for a maximum of 8 courses in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 28 days and then every 2\n      months for 2 years until disease progression. After disease progression, patients are\n      followed every 3 months for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 14-100 patients will be accrued for this study."
