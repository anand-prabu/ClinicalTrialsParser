  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent large clinical studies have demonstrated the interest of LAMA therapy in the
      management of asthma, when compared to LABA.

      V0162 is a compound with a very long lasting bronchodilator effect when compared to
      reference treatment in non-clinical models and in COPD patients. Secondary properties of
      V0162 (i.e.H1/H4 and PDE IV-inhibition) could enhance the efficacy of this antimuscarinic
      compound and could bring option in the treatment obstructive lung disease. The objective of
      the study is to assess the bronchodilator properties of V0162 during 8 days in adult
      patients with asthma usually treated with ICS and LABA. The study is a randomised,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-period crossover, preceded by an open-label
      active-control period before randomisation.
