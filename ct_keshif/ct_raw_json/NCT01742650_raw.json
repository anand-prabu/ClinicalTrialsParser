Screw fixation is widely and mostly used transfixation but\n      suture-button is also shown to be a biomechanically stable and probably more physiologic\n      transfication method. It is shown that even 50 % of the syndesmosis srews and thus fibulas\n      are in malposition. With more physiologic suture-button transfixation this malposition is\n      thought to be less commmon. There is no studies comparing screw and suture-button\n      syndesmosis transfixation methods in AO/OTA Weber C ankle fracture patients.\n\n      Our hypothesis is that 50% of screw fixed fibulas but only 5% of suture-button fixed fibulas\n      are in malposition assessed in the intraoperative computed tomography. Malposition is\n      assessed to present if difference between fractured and non-fractured side is at least 2 mm\n      in the tibiofibular joint. Thus, the sample size is assessed to be 19 patients per group\n      (alpha=0.05, Beta=0.2, 20% drop out).\n\n      All skeletally mature patients (16 years or older) with AO/OTA Weber C type fractures\n      operated within a week after trauma are included into the study. Exclusion criteria are\n      previous ankle fracture, concomitant tibial fracture, diabetes with peripheral neuropathy,\n      pathological fracture or inadequate co-operation.\n\n      After bony fixation the tibiofibular transfixation is randomly performed either by a 3,5 mm\n      tricortical screw or a suture-button (TightRope). An intraoperative computed tomography is\n      imaged from the both ankles of all patients. The operation is continued with six weeks\n      casting without weight-bearing.\n\n      Clinical outcome was assessed using the Olerud-Molander scoring system, RAND 36-Item Health\n      Survey, and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to measure pain and function after a minimum 1-year\n      of follow-up."
