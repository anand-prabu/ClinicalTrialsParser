This research is expected to help\n      develop techniques and hypotheses for future research on these topics.\n\n      We will conduct:\n\n        -  Pilot Substudy: Pilot substudies are exploratory in nature, in order to develop enough\n           information to generate a hypothesis.  The criterion for transition to a new full\n           protocol will be acquisition of sufficient information to generate a power analysis.\n           There are no enrollment limitations for pilot substudies.\n\n        -  Hypothesis-Testing Substudy is defined as a study with a specific hypothesis to be\n           tested that can be completed with a few healthy volunteers or patients.\n           Hypothesis-testing substudies will undergo statistical and PIRC reviews after 6\n           subjects (if there is one group) or after 12 (6 per arm) if two groups are studied\n           before additional subjects are recruited.  In the event of subject dropout or\n           unsuccessful recording, replacement will be recruited.  Together, the P.I. and PIRC\n           will decide whether to continue the hypothesis substudy with more subjects without an\n           amendment or whether an amendment or new protocol would be necessary.  A memo\n           requesting a review of hypothesis-testing substudies for possible additional enrollment\n           will be sent to PIRC and the statistical reviewer.  The memo will be forwarded to the\n           CNS IRB.\n\n        -  Technical development of new experimental paradigms and data analysis methods.\n\n      This protocol includes only non-invasive techniques with minimal risk (MRI, EEG, MEG, EMG,\n      tDCS).\n\n      Study Population:\n\n      We plan to recruit up to 120 healthy volunteers aged 18-65.\n\n      Design:\n\n      We will design small projects that are pertinent to the theme of scale-free brain activity\n      and conscious/unconscious processing. We will investigate healthy volunteers in the resting\n      state or while they perform simple motor or sensory tasks. If a hypothesis testing substudy\n      leads to results of interest and if a larger population is necessary to reach statistical\n      significance, a separate protocol will be submitted with a priori hypotheses, specific study\n      design and power analysis adapted from the pilot or exploratory substudies performed in the\n      present protocol.\n\n      In the substudies, brain activity of healthy human volunteers will be monitored by\n      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG),\n      electroencephalography (EEG), or simultaneous MEG-EEG. Anatomical MRI will be collected in\n      some subjects to allow better localization of brain dynamics. Because transcranial\n      direct-current stimulation (tDCS) is ideally suited to modulate the slow component of\n      scale-free brain activity, we will also investigate the effect of tDCS on brain activity\n      and/or behavioral performance in cognitive tasks.  tDCS will be administered sequentially,\n      but not simultaneously, with brain-activity monitoring by fMRI/MEG/EEG.  Most experiments\n      will be conducted in conjunction with cognitive tasks.  In some experiments, we will study\n      resting-state brain function, during which spontaneous brain activity is collected without a\n      specific externally administered task.\n\n      Outcome Measures:\n\n      MRI:  to analyze measures such as the anatomical structures of the brain (using structural\n      MRI); amplitude of the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal (using fMRI);\n      cerebral blood flow [using arterial spin labeling (ASL)] and different neurotransmitter\n      levels in brain regions of interest [using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)].\n\n      EEG and MEG: to quantify measures such as power spectrum, event- or task-related potentials,\n      synchronization/desynchronization, and coherence between sensors or sources located close to\n      the brain areas of interest.\n\n      tDCS: to analyze changes in behavioral measures and/or fMRI/EEG/MEG activity caused by tDCS.\n\n      Behavioral measures: to quantify measures such as hit rate, reaction times, electromyography\n      (EMG) patterns.\n\n      We may measure autonomic data during the course of the experiment (such as heart rate,\n      respiration, end-tidal CO2, skin conductance), which will be correlated with the outcome\n      measures."
