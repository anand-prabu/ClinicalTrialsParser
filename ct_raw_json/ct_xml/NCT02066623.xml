  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The German-Austrian ABSORB Register shall provide an analysis of acute and long-term safety
      as well as therapy outcomes of the ABSORB (trade mark) bioresorbable vascular scaffold
      system in patients suffering from coronary artery disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The register collects prospective data regarding the quality of care of this  therapy
      concept including specifically the following objectives:

        -  Documentation of all consecutive patients having been treated with the ABSORB
           biore-sorbable vascular scaffold system under clinical real-world conditions

        -  Documentation of indications, procedural results, and short and long-term outcomes

        -  Documentation of the technical performance of ABSORB implant procedures

        -  Collection of safety data, in particular documentation of hospital mortality, major
           non-fatal complications (especially myocardial infarction, Re-PCI (percutaneous
           coronary intervention) or CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting), stroke, thrombosis)

        -  Documentation of long-term patient safety marked by mortality and major non-fatal
           complications (especially myocardial infarction, Re-PCI or CABG, stroke, thrombosis) at
           30 days, 6 months, 2 years and 5 years

        -  Gathering of health economics data (capture of direct costs, especially with view to
           change of medication and outpatient/inpatient hospital services, and indirect costs)
           pre and post ABSORB implant

        -  Gathering data on the quality of life pre and post ABSORB implant to document
           individual QoL dimensions as well as QALY (quality adjusted life year) data

    <description>The following events will be evaluated:
Death
Myocardial infarction
Clinically motivated target vessel revascularization
Composite target parameter of the aforementioned events (MACE, major adverse cardiac event) as the primary target parameter

Composite target parameter of the aforementioned events including stroke as the primary target parameter (MACCE, major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event)

    <description>The following parameters will be evaluated to assess procedural outcome:
Technical success: If the residual stenosis is less than 30% in the ABSORB covered lesion segment at the end of the procedure based on visual estimation
Therapy success: Technical success and no periprocedural complications
Clinical success: Therapy success and no serious adverse cardiac (and cerebrovascular) events (MACE, MACCE)
TIMI (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction) flow pre and post implant
Sudden occlusion of side branch in the case of bifurcation stenosis
Optional: Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) with index treatment: final in-scaffold and in-segment percentage diameter stenosis (%DS), reference vessel diameter</description>

    <description>Effectiveness of ABSORB implantation will be assessed based on the following parameters:
* Target vessel failure (TVF): This includes cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction (Q-wave or non-Q-wave MI) or clinically motivated target vessel revascularization (TVR), percutaneous or surgical.</description>

    <time_frame>5 years follow-up period</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Changes in quality of life will be assessed by measuring
Angina pectoris scores (incl. CCS score, Canadian Cardiovascular Society score) and heart failure scores (NYHA, New York Heart Association score)
Standardized questionnaire for quality of life (EQ-5D)
Standardized questionnaire for health-related quality of life of patients with coronary artery disease (Seattle Angina Questionnaire, SAQ)</description>
