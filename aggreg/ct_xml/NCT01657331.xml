  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2 multicenter study to assess the safety and effectiveness of brentuximab
      vedotin and bendamustine, when given together, in patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma or
      Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL) that has either returned or did not respond to initial
      treatment(s). Patients will be accrued at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) and at
      two subsites in Canada.

      Brentuximab Vedotin will be given to patients on day 1 of each 21 day cycle and Bendamustine
      will be given to patients on days 1 AND 2 of each 21 day cycle. Days 3-21 will be for rest.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2 open label, multicenter study to assess the safety and efficacy of
      brentuximab vedotin in combination with bendamustine in patients with relapsed or refractory
      Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) or other CD30+ expressing hematologic malignancies. Dose escalation in
      phase 1 will proceed according to a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design. There will be no
      intracohort dose escalation. Three patients will be assigned to the starting dose level 1.
      If no dose limiting toxicities (DLT) are observed after one cycle of treatment, and if the
      start of cycle 2 treatment is not delayed greater than 7 days for any toxicity possibly
      related to drug, trial accrual proceeds to the next dose level and another cohort of 3
      patients is enrolled. If 1 patient in a cohort experiences a DLT, then the cohort is
      expanded to 6, if 2 or more patients in this cohort experience a DLT then the dose level
      decreases. If none of the additional patients experience a DLT (1 out of 6) then dose
      escalation continues. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the highest dose level
      at which &lt;33% of the dose cohort (0 of 3 or 1 of 6) experience a DLT in the first cycle.
