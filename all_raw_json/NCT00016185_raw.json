Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel and flavopiridol until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at\n      which 2 of 3 or 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-11\n      months."
