We\n      will use [11C]-(+)-PHNO PET to measure striatal DA receptor binding on two occasions: 1)\n      following corticorelin administration and 2) following saline. The change in receptor\n      binding between the two occasions (i.e., displacement of [11C]-(+)-PHNO by endogenous DA)\n      will index DA release.\n\n      SUBJECTS CD subjects will meet DSM-IV criteria for abuse or dependence and be ~10d cocaine\n      abstinent at the time of PET. HC will be recruited to match CD on age, sex, education, and\n      cigarette smoking.\n\n      PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES We will measure [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding on two occasions\n      (corticorelin, saline), with the difference between conditions indexing dopamine release;\n      this measure will then be compared between cocaine-dependent and control subjects. We will\n      also measure plasma cortisol and ACTH), physiological measures, and subjective craving and\n      mood."
