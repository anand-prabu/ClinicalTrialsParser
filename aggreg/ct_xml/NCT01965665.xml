      The purpose of this study is to prospectively evaluate the effect of Active Leptospermum
      honey utilizing the MediHoney HCS dressing, on the occurrence of PIN site infections, and
      also to see if the use of MediHoney HCS reduces the frequency of dressing changes compared
      to published reports of routine standard pin site care.

      Up to 20 Diabetic Mellitus patients undergoing Open Reduction External Fixation (OREF) for
      foot and/or ankle fusions, fracture repair, or osteotomy will be enrolled to receive weekly
      Medihoney pin site care until frame removal.  Standard size dressings and application
      technique will be used at each pin site with prefabricated materials.  No procedures, tests
      or interventions will be performed exclusively for research purposes or more frequently than
      the standard of care.  Upon completion of the study, pin sites sepsis rates will be compared
      to published reports for standard pin site care.
