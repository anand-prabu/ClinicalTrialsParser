  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose is to assess whether there is transfer of Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) from
      pregnant women receiving treatment with Cimzia® across the placenta to infants by evaluating
      the concentration of CZP in the plasma of infants at birth.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  An Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) approved written
             Informed Consent form for the maternal subject and written assent for her infant is
             signed and dated by the subject or by the legal representative. Where applicable, the
             written assent form for the infant is also signed and dated by the infant's father or
             legal representative

          -  Subject/legal representative is considered reliable and capable of adhering to the
             protocol and visit schedule according to the judgment of the Investigator

          -  Subject is female ≥ 18 years at the time of informed consent/assent

          -  Subject is ≥ 30 weeks pregnant with a singleton or twins at the time of informed
             consent/assent

          -  Subject is being treated with Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) at a dose and administration
             schedule per the locally approved label

          -  Subject started, or decided to start, treatment with CZP independently from and prior
             to being recruited for this study and in accordance with the treating physician

          -  Subject expects to receive CZP until at least 35 days prior to expected delivery.
             Additional criteria to be confirmed at Visit 2 (delivery)

          -  Subject delivers a live born infant at or near term (≥ 34  weeks gestation)

          -  Subject received CZP within 35 days before delivery

          -  Subject has not received contraindicated medication

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has participated in a study of an investigational medicinal product (IMP) or
             medical device within the previous 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)
             prior to Screening or is currently participating in another study of an IMP or
             medical device - unless the study is UCB UP0016 or a registry study

          -  Subject has any obstetrical or psychiatric condition, or she or her infant has any
             medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could jeopardize or would
             compromise the subject's ability to participate in this study or the outcome of the
             pregnancy

          -  Subject has history of chronic alcohol abuse or drug abuse during pregnancy

          -  Subject has any pregnancy-related clinically significant abnormality noted on
             obstetric ultrasound, or other imaging assessment, or the subject has significant
             laboratory abnormalities during her pregnancy, as judged by the Investigator

          -  Subject is taking a prohibited medication or has taken a prohibited medication

          -  Subject has evidence of a condition suggesting chronic or acute uteroplacental
             insufficiency such as intrauterine growth restriction, severe maternal hypertensive
             disorders of pregnancy, or abruption

          -  Subject has a documented history of primary or secondary antiphospholipid syndrome or
             hypercoagulable state

          -  Subject has received treatment with any biological therapeutic agent, including
             anti-Tumor Necrosis Factors (TNFs) other than CZP, during pregnancy

          -  Subject has previously participated in this study

          -  Subject has a positive or indeterminate QuantiFERON®-TB GOLD In Tube test at
             Screening. In case of indeterminate result, a retest is allowed if time permits; 2
             results of indeterminate require exclusion of the subject. Tuberculosis (TB) test
             results that have been obtained within the previous 60 days prior to Screening are
             acceptable (QuantiFERON®-TB GOLD or Purified Protein Derivative [PPD] test)

          -  Subject has known TB infection, at high risk of acquiring TB infection or latent TB
             infection
