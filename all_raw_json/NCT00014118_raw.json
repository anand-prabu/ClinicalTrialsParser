Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by\n      radiation therapy and chemotherapy in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV\n      cancer of the larynx or stage III or stage IV cancer of the oropharynx."

Patients are stratified according to disease site\n      (larynx vs oropharynx).\n\n      Patients receive induction therapy comprising paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by\n      carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 22. Within 28 days after completion of\n      induction therapy, patients with responding or stable disease receive paclitaxel IV over 60\n      minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43 and radiotherapy once daily, 5 times weekly,\n      for 7 weeks beginning on day 1.\n\n      Within 6-8 weeks after completion of therapy, patients who initially had bulky neck disease\n      (N3) or who have residual palpable lymphadenopathy undergo surgical neck dissection.\n      Patients with N1-N2 disease with complete response may also undergo neck dissection.\n      Patients with initial complete response who recur at the primary site undergo surgical\n      salvage.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after induction therapy, and at 3, 12, and 24\n      months after completion of all therapy.\n\n      Patients are followed at 6 weeks, 3 months, every 6-8 weeks for 1 year, every 3 months for 1\n      year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 5 years thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 110 patients (55 per stratum) will be accrued for this study."
