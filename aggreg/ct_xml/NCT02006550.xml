  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer results when undifferentiated cells grow in an uncontrolled manner, crowding out
      normal cells, causing morbidity and ultimately mortality. The cancer stem cell theory
      suggests that most tumors undergo a process of differentiation through which a relatively
      rare cancer stem or progenitor cell (CSC) gives rise to more differentiated populations of
      cells (including transiently amplifying cells) comprising the bulk of the tumor. As a result
      of this cellular diversity, one or more cells within the tumor are likely to be resistant to
      therapy. Among cells resistant to a given therapy, only CSCs can repopulate the tumor. A key
      feature of this resistant subset of CSCs is that they repopulate a tumor resistant to the
      original intervention. The cellular programs driving the uncontrolled proliferation of many
      solid tumors result from aberrant activity of Wnt, Shh, and/or Notch signaling pathways in
      CSC. Thus, therapies that down-regulate the activity of these fundamental pathways in CSCs
      will be effective in the treatment of cancer. The investigators' research program focuses on
      the elucidation of signaling mechanisms, control of cellular processes and discovery of
      small molecules that selectively target Wnt, Shh, and Notch signaling pathways that are
      fundamental to CSCs. Our preliminary results identified a novel Notch associated protein
      NACK that functions as a transcriptional co-activator of Notch. Moreover, Nack is expressed
      in human solid tumors and is required for cell survival and tumor growth in notch -dependent
      tumor cells. The investigators' aim is to further interrogate the link between Notch and
      Nack.
