After\n      consent, baseline measures will be collected including height, weight, body composition\n      measurements using calipers, 24-hour dietary recalls, and blood and urine samples. Women\n      will also complete questionnaires regarding ADHD symptoms, stress, depression, and\n      lifestyle. Women will be given a one-week food diary to fill out at home, which will be\n      mailed in upon completion. Upon receipt of the food diary, women will be randomized into\n      either a nutrition intervention group or a standard-of-care group. Women who are randomized\n      to the intervention group will receive individual nutritional counseling every 2 weeks\n      during their 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Before delivery, the baseline measures described\n      above will again be collected. At delivery, placenta and cord blood samples will be taken.\n      After birth, the infant will undergo an MRI between 2 and 5 weeks of age. The scan is\n      completed while the baby sleeps, and special ear protection is worn to limit sleep\n      disruption from the noise of the MRI. When the infant is 3 months old, mothers will complete\n      questionnaires about infant feeding, sleep and behavior."
