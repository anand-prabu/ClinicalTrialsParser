  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether obese women (BMI &gt;= 30) who give birth by
      caesarean section have a reduced incidence of wound infection and dehiscence when incisional
      Negative Pressure Wound Therapy is applied prophylactically following caesarean section.

      This study is a non-blinded randomised controlled trial and a concurrent Health Economic
      Evaluation. The study examines the effect on wound healing using incisional Negative
      Pressure Wound Therapy (iNPWT) compared with standard postoperative dressings in women with
      a BMI &gt;= 30, who has a Caesarean Section (CS). We expect to find a lower frequency of wound
      complications when using iNPWT directly on primary suturing compared to standard
      postoperative dressings in this high-risk subpopulation.

      Women, who have given informed consent, will be randomised to either intervention or control
      group via a computer-generated randomisation program. Elective and emergency CS will be
      stratified to ensure roughly equal numbers in each category of CS in each arm of the study
      and permit valid separate and pooled analysis. The analysis will be carried out on an
      intention to treat basis.

      The iNPWT or standard postoperative dressings will be applied in theatre immediately
      following the operation. In the intervention group the therapy will be left in situ for five
      days corresponding to the date of removal of stitches. In the control group the dressing
      will be left in situ for at least 24 hours as standard procedure.  Women, who do not wish to
      participate, will be asked for permission to use their data in the analysis.

    <description>Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) is a mechanical wound care treatment using controlled sub-atmospheric pressure to assist and accelerate wound healing.  Incisional Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (iNPWT) is a new NPWT devices, which can be used over clean closed surgical incisions. The device behaves in a similar fashion to existing conventional NPWT devices, i.e. transmission of negative pressure levels at the wound bed, tissue contraction and establishing a characteristic pattern of peri-wound blood flow and that it reduces and normalises tissue stresses at the incision</description>
