Knowledge about perceived health status can help to guide inpatient\n      practise and outpatient follow-up. Furthermore, it can be used to evaluate differences\n      between diagnostic groups, regional differences and predicting factors for perceived health\n      status at hospital discharge and long term morbidity and mortality. Also economic analysis\n      of healthcare utilisation and work ability status are possible.\n\n      Five Danish heart centres (Rigshospitalet, Gentofte Hospital, Odense University Hospital,\n      Aarhus University Hospital and Aalborg University Hospital) are all including patients from\n      April 2013 to April 2014. All patients discharged or transferred from one of the heart\n      centres are potential participants in the study. Patients are unselected and consecutively\n      included at hospital discharge. Included patients will be asked to complete and return a\n      questionnaire before they leave the hospital.\n\n      The following questionnaires will be used to measure the perceived health status of the\n      patients at hospital discharge: SF-12, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, EQ-5D, Brief\n      Illness Perception Questionnaire, HeartQoL and Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale.\n      Furthermore 14 ancillary about health and health behaviour are included in the\n      questionnaire. This amounts to a total of 62 items in the questionnaire.\n\n      The DenHeart study data collection, database development and reporting of primary outcomes\n      are funded by the five participating heart centres in Denmark. Further funding for registry\n      data, analyses and reporting will be applied for in external funds."
