DBS is a therapy modality in which\n      electrodes are implanted within specific sub-structures of the brain in order to modulate\n      the activity in targeted neural circuits associated with different neurological disorders.\n      The results of this novel approach to psychiatric disorders have been optimistic. This study\n      aims to investigate wether or not the distance to target location has an influence on the\n      outcome.\n\n      In order to deliver DBS, leads containing four electrodes are implanted into the  brain\n      target in the ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS). After an optimization period,\n      patients enter a triple blind randomised two fazed crossover design of two periods of three\n      months. In both crossover branches, patients, evaluating psychiatrist and psychologist are\n      blinded for the stimulation conditions. These conditions are stimulation ON (at optimal\n      parameters) and stimulation OFF. Stimulation parameters are constant during the entire\n      period.  During the second crossover branch, stimulation conditions are reversed for all\n      patients."
