            "textblock": "Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are compounds that form when sugars abnormally attach\n      to proteins or lipids.  High levels of AGEs in the blood may cause inflammation, problems\n      with controlling blood sugar, and problems with the health of blood vessels. Many of the\n      foods we commonly eat have high amounts of AGEs, which may increase AGEs in the blood of\n      people with kidney disease.  The amount of AGEs in foods can be lowered when prepared using\n      special cooking techniques such as using moist heat or longer cooking times at lower\n      temperatures.  New research has shown that preparing food in this way can lower inflammation\n      and improve blood vessel health in people with normal kidney function.\n\n      In this study, the investigators would like to examine the effect of lowering the AGE\n      content of foods on inflammation, blood sugar control, and blood vessel health in\n      individuals with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease."
