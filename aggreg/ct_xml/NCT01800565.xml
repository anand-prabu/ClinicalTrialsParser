    <textblock>
      Precocious puberty (PP) in girls is classically defined by the onset of secondary sexual
      characteristics before eight years of age, but subsequent pubertal maturation can be quite
      varied. In many girls, PP takes a rapid course of progression (rapidly progressive
      precocious puberty; RP-PP) with an early menarche and fusion of the epiphyseal growth
      plates, leading eventually to a reduced final height if not treated. In a subset of girls
      with PP however, the growth rate slows to normal for age, skeletal maturation progresses in
      accordance with chronological age and there is little to no risk of impairment of final
      height (slowly progressive precocious puberty; SP-PP). Other conditions of non-progressive
      PP include premature breast budding and unsustained PP that is characterized by a
      spontaneous regression of sexual precocity. Due to their benign course, slowly progressive
      (SP) PP and other non-progressive forms of PP do not warrant therapy with GnRH agonists.
      Differentiating these forms from RP-PP is therefore essential to prevent unnecessary
      intervention in a population that accounts for at least 50% of girls with PP. A distinction
      between these forms of PP may be difficult on clinical grounds however, since all these
      patients may present initially as isolated breast development.

      The gold standard for the diagnosis of  true (central) PP is the measurement of
      gonadotropins following GnRH stimulation test. There is however an overlap between
      prepubertal and early pubertal values and between girls with premature breast budding and
      progressive PP. It was suggested therefore that progressive pubertal development and growth
      acceleration should be documented over a 3- to 6-months period before GnRHa therapy in
      initiated.

      More than a decade ago several studies demonstrated that urinary gonadotropins are age
      related and significantly increased during puberty. It has been suggested that urinary
      gonadotropins measurements can be used for differential diagnosis of pubertal disorders.
      This is based on the assumption that gradual elevation of nocturnal LH secretion prior to
      and at the onset of puberty can be reflected by first-voided urinary LH (ULH). In this
      prospective study, the investigators aimed to evaluate the value of first-voided ULH
      measurements in predicting pubertal course and differentiating SP-PP from RP-PP, by
      comparison to GnRH-stimulated gonadotropins.

      Precocious puberty (PP) in girls is classically defined by the onset of secondary sexual
      characteristics before eight years of age, but subsequent pubertal maturation can be quite
      varied. In many girls, PP takes a rapid course of progression (rapidly progressive
      precocious puberty; RP-PP) with an early menarche and fusion of the epiphyseal growth
      plates, leading eventually to a reduced final height if not treated. In a subset of girls
      with PP however, the growth rate slows to normal for age, skeletal maturation progresses in
      accordance with chronological age and there is little to no risk of impairment of final
      height (slowly progressive precocious puberty; SP-PP). Other conditions of non-progressive
      PP include premature thelarche and unsustained PP that is characterized by a regression of
      sexual precocity. Due to their benign course, slowly progressive (SP) PP and other
      non-progressive forms of PP do not warrant therapy with GnRH agonists. Differentiating these
      forms from RP-PP is therefore essential to prevent unnecessary intervention in a population
      that accounts for at least 50% of girls with PP. A distinction between these forms of PP may
      be difficult on clinical grounds however, since all these patients may present initially as
      isolated breast development.

      The gold standard for the diagnosis of  true (central) PP is the measurement of
      gonadotropins following GnRH stimulation test , where peak LH and peak LH/FSH ratio are the
      most valuable diagnostic parameters. There is however an overlap between prepubertal and
      early pubertal values and between girls with premature thelarche and progressive PP. It was
      suggested therefore that progressive pubertal development and growth acceleration should be
      documented over a 3- to 6-months period before GnRHa therapy in initiated.

      More than a decade ago, along with the development of high-sensitive immunoassay for
      gonadotropins that replaced the RIA, Demir and colleagues have shown that urinary
      gonadotropins are age related and significantly increased during puberty. It has been
      suggested by others that urinary gonadotropins measurements can be used for differential
      diagnosis of pubertal disorders. This is based on the assumption that gradual elevation of
      nocturnal LH secretion prior to and at the onset of puberty can be reflected by first-voided
      urinary LH (ULH). In this prospective study, the investigators aimed to evaluate the value
      of first-voided ULH measurements in predicting pubertal course and differentiating SP-PP
      from RP-PP, by comparison to GnRH-stimulated gonadotropins.
