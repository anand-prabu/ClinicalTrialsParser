The study examined the extent to which family process variables were\n      cross-sectionally associated with and longitudinally influenced adherence to asthma\n      treatment and asthma treatment outcome as well as the consistency of this relationship\n      across the three sites.  The study also determined whether adherence with treatment mediated\n      the relationship between specific family processes and asthma treatment outcome, as well as\n      the consistency of this relationship across the three sites."
