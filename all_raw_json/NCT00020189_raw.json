Courses repeat every 3\n      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients also receive oral aspirin and clopidogrel bisulfate beginning on day 0 and\n      continuing throughout the study.\n\n      Patients are followed until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-3\n      years."
