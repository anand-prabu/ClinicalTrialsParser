This research will also\n      estimate inter and intra-observer variability of treatment planning, relative to GTV,\n      between and amongst radiation oncologists."

V 20 Both lungs (Combined total lung volumes including PTV): Volume of both lungs\n      receiving \u2265  20 G y, including  planning target volume.\n\n      II. Mean lung dose: Mean radiation dose received by both lungs in a given radiation plan,\n      calculated by the planning computer.\n\n      III. V 55 Esophagus: Volume of esophagus receiving\u2265 55Gy.\n\n      IV. Mean esophageal dose : Mean radiation dose received by whole esophagus in a given\n      radiation plan, calculated by the  planning computer\n\n      V.  Spinal cord dose: Maximum dose received by the spinal cord in a given radiation plan.\n\n      V1.. V40 Whole heart: Volume of heart receiving \u2265 40Gy\n\n      2A Inter observer variation: This will be determined for the data sets GTV A and B only\n      delineated by 4 radiation oncologists blinded to each other, for first 20 patients. The\n      resident involved in this project will be responsible to co-ordinate this part of the\n      project. GTV will be measured and recorded in cubic centimeters for each volume.\n\n      2B Intra observer variation: This will be determined for the data sets GTV A and B only\n      delineated by the same radiation oncologist (treating physician) at two different occasions,\n      for first 20 patients. Minimum time interval between the two contours will be one month .The\n      resident involved in this project will be responsible to co-ordinate this part of the\n      project.
