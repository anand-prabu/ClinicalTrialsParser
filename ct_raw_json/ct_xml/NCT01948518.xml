    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the acute effects of sildenafil on diffusion
      capacity, a commonly performed pulmonary function test, which is used to assess the lungs'
      gas exchange capability.

      This study does not assess safety or efficacy of the drug.  The study does not have clinical
      end points.  The variables studied are diffusion capacity and 6 minute walk after a single
      dose of sildenafil.

      This study has been completed.

    <textblock>
      Sildenafil is a cyclic GMP selective phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor approved for use by
      the FDA in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. There has been recent interest in
      the use of the drug in patients with diffuse parenchymal lung diseases. This is largely
      based on sildenafil's salutary effects observed in small studies (Collard et al.
      897-99;Ghofrani et al. 895-900;Collard et al. 897-99) and the frequent coexistence of
      pulmonary hypertension in these patients (Nathan et al. 657-63).  In eight patients with
      pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension, sildenafil reduced pulmonary artery pressure
      and improved shunt fraction as determined by multiple inert gas elimination technique
      (Ghofrani et al. 895-900;Nathan et al. 657-63). Collard et al demonstrated a 49 meter
      improvement in 6 minute walk distance in 11 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and
      pulmonary hypertension after 3 months of therapy with sildenafil.

      Main theoretical concern with the use of pulmonary arterial vasodilator therapy has been
      worsening of ventilation perfusion matching due to release of hypoxic vasoconstriction. Such
      a phenomenon is well recognized during prostacyclin infusion(Ghofrani et al.
      895-900;Walmrath et al. 1084-92). Inhaled route seems to circumvent this side effect by
      preferentially delivering the drug to the alveoli with high V/Q ratios and augmenting blood
      flow to these regions (Ghofrani et al. 895-900;Walmrath et al. 1084-92). In the only study
      to address possible effect of systemically administered sildenafil on gas exchange, Ghofrani
      et al observed improvement in V/Q matching in eight patients using the multiple inert gas
      elimination technique (MIGET). The authors postulated an enhancement of local defense
      mechanisms against hypoxia i.e. increased nitric oxide availability to hypoxic alveoli
      despite oral route of administration(Ghofrani et al. 895-900). In a recent study of 14
      normal subjects, oral sildenafil did not effect DLCO measurements at rest, after exercise
      and under hypoxic conditions(Snyder et al. 421-30).

      Diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is the clinically available method
      of assessing gas exchange for practitioners. It is frequently used as a tool for serial
      monitoring of diffuse parenchymal lung disease. American Thoracic Society has endorsed its
      use in the assessment of patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonias(American Thoracic
      Society/European Respiratory Society International Multidisciplinary Consensus
      Classification of the Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonias . This Joint Statement of the
      American Thoracic Society (ATS), and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) was adopted by
      the ATS Board of Directors, June 2001 and by The ERS Executive Committee, June 2001
      277-304).

      The aim of our study was to delineate the effects of orally administered sildenafil on
      diffusion capacity. The significance of this information was twofold. First, it would be
      helpful clinically to determine the contribution of a pulmonary vasodilator to the change in
      DLCO to separate this effect from a true clinical change. Second, sildenafil's effect on gas
      exchange may lead to modifications in therapy such as changes in oxygen flow delivered to
      patients.

      This is not a study that measures clinical outcome or safety of sildenafil.  A single dose
      was administered and effect on diffusion capacity and 6 minute walk were assessed compared
      to baseline.  This study was completed and found no acute change in diffusion capacity or 6
      minute walk after a single dose of oral sildenafil.  While we would caution clinicians for
      rare exceptions to these findings, we believe our data exclude a significant confounding
      effect in interpretation of diffusion capacity in patients with parenchymal lung disease who
      are treated for pulmonary hypertension with oral sildenafil.  Whether this conclusion holds
      true at higher doses of sildenafil and in patients with vasodilator response may offer
      further venues for research.

      We were asked to retrospectively register the study at the request of BMC Pulmonary Medicine
      Journal Editorial Office prior to publication.
