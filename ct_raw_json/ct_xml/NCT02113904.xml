      The main objective of this studies therapeutic : to determine the effect of Adalimumab
      (HumiraR) on clinical inflammatory manifestations of patients with Netherton syndrome after
      3 months of treatment , with a post treatment period follow-up of 3 months.

      Second objectives are To evaluate the safety of Adalimumab in the context of NS To evaluate
      the improvement of the quality of life at 3 months To evaluate the improvement of pruritus
      and pain in the patients To study markers of inflammatory and allergy in NS prior and after
      treatment Benefit of the study An improvement by at least 20% of the cutaneous signs in
      these patients who suffer from a genetic incurable, chronic, painful and very afflicting
      disease would be of a great help for these patients. NS is a major source of social
      exclusion.

      Risks They are inherent to the risks of biotherapies, especially for an anti-TNF therapy,
      they comprise a risk of infection. Cutaneous infections occur mainly during infancy, and we
      have therefore chosen to treat patients over 4 years of age in this study.

      A close clinical surveillance will be set up (initially every week during the first month of
      treatment, then every month). This will represents a large number of visits but will provide
      a high level  of security.

      Benefits/risks ratio In the absence of curative treatment for these patients with a severe
      genetic skin disease, the benefits/risks ration clearly appears to be in favour of an
      expected benefit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Netherton syndrome (NS) is a rare (incidence is estimated at 1 in 100 000) but severe
      genetic skin disease characterized by scaly erythroderma at birth, abnormal hair and severe
      psoriasiform /atopic dermatitis-like lesions with high IgE levels and allergic
      manifestations. It has  considerable impact on the quality of life of patients, as a result
      of inflammatory and painful flares, the chronicity of the lesions, severe growth retardation
      with definitive short stature.

      NS is caused by loss of function SPINK5 mutations which lead  to unregulated epidermal
      protease activity : kallikrein 5, kallikrein 7 and elastase proteases are found overactive
      following loss of inhibition. Secondly, KLK5 activates PAR-2 receptors at the keratinocyte
      surface leading to the activation of the NF-KB pathway and the release of different
      pro-inflammatory cytokines such TNF-alpha .

      There is no specific treatment for NS. The different therapeutic attempts by Soriatane
      (acitretin) have worsen the skin inflammation and dryness. The use of topical calcineurin
      inhibitors (Tacrolimus) has sometimes improved skin inflammation but with an important
      systemic diffusion. The use of immune suppressive drugs in severe patients with NS followed
      in our labelized Centre  (Cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil) have not
      brought a significant and durable improvement. So NS is a very distressing genodermatosis.

      For these clinical and biological considerations, a benefit with anti TNF treatment could be
      expected and the evaluation of such treatment is justified in NS. The  clinical case of an
      adult patient with severe NS, improved by anti-Tnf treatment has recently been published in
      the literature
