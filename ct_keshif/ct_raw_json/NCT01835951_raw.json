Debriefing\n      following simulation is fundamental in order to reduce the emotional impact of the session\n      and to asses the technical and non-technical skills (behavior). Even if the ideal debriefing\n      method is still to be found, individual debriefing is considered as the gold standard but\n      time consuming. The DEBRIEF-SIM study is a prospective, single blinded, multicentric and\n      randomized study that will compare the individual (defined by learning couple resident and\n      nurse) approach to a grouped (several couples) debriefing. The primary end point is to\n      define the noninferiority of this approach compared to the individual one on the educational\n      impact.\n\n      The learners will be debriefed according to their randomization after the first session, but\n      will all undergo individual debriefing following the second session."
