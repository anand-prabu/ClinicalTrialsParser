To determine the biologic activity of the hCE1m6-NSCs by comparing SN-38 concentrations\n      in the brain after treatment with hCE1m6-NSCs and irinotecan compared to irinotecan alone.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To investigate the relationship between hCE1m6-NSC dose and SN-38 concentrations in brain\n      interstitium.\n\n      II.
