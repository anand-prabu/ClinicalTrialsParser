            "textblock": "The use of bariatric surgery in adolescents is controversial. On one side, bariatric surgery\n      is the only effective treatment to achieve sustained weight loss in adults with extreme\n      obesity. Comorbidities are reversed and mortality is reduced. In adolescents, bariatric\n      surgery is equally effective; however, due to the paucity of long-term data, the long-term\n      effects and risks are unknown. Thus, due to surgical risk and ethical implications,\n      bariatric surgery is considered experimental in Germany. Nevertheless, case volumes are\n      increasing.\n\n      The aim of this study is to evaluate the benefits and risks of adolescent bariatric surgery\n      in the context of a structured preparation and follow-up program. The study is a subproject\n      of the study \"Medical and psychosocial implications of adolescent extreme obesity -\n      acceptance and effects of structured care\" (DRKS00004172). At 5 German university centers\n      (Ulm, Datteln, Berlin, Essen, Leipzig), youth who undergo bariatric surgery and are\n      participants in the overall project will be enrolled in a structured preparation and\n      follow-up program. The program is designed to improve adherence and compliance and will\n      result in comprehensive follow-up data. In addition to the data gathered in the overall\n      project, subjects participating in subproject 3 will undergo assessments pertinent to\n      bariatric surgery, as proposed in the American Teen-LABS study\n      (http://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/ research/divisions/t/teen-labs/default/). Comparison\n      will be made with BMI matched adolescents who participate in the overall project but do not\n      undergo bariatric surgery."
