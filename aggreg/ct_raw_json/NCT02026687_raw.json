Infusion rate is chosen by the attending anesthetist. Postoperatively the epidural anesthesia is continued until the morning of the third postoperative day  using bupivacain 1 mg/ml, fentanyl 2 \u00b5g/ml and epinephrine 2\u00b5g/ml. Infusion rate is set by the responsible physician, maximum rate is 10 ml/hour."
