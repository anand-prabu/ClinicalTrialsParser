Participants will receive a detailed, standardized clinical\n      assessment, fill out a brief behavioural questionnaire and then be treated with therapy for\n      syphilis according to their stage of disease. In addition to the routine tests performed, if\n      and after they consent to participate in this study, they will have their serum analyzed for\n      a number of other immunological markers. A control group will be recruited, consisting of 30\n      convenience selected patients who are HIV infected but have no evidence of syphilis (Rapid\n      Plasma Reagin, T. pallidum antigenaemia , or clinical evidence that could be suggestive of\n      syphilis infection) are attending the HIV clinic regularly, who were seen in the same month\n      as one of the acute syphilis cases and who consent to take part in the study. The control\n      group will only undergo the investigations planned for the baseline visit.\n\n      Noteworthy, it is hoped that the results of the study will also allow to develop and\n      evaluate the utility of a composite diagnostic rule for the diagnosis of syphilis\n      reinfection."
