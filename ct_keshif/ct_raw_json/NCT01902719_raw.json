African Americans are also more likely than Whites to suffer end organ\n      damage as a result of hypertension.  Patients' hypertension self-management behaviors\n      (including adherence to prescribed care, self-blood pressure monitoring, lifestyle changes,\n      and shared medical decision-making) represent a cornerstone of hypertension therapy.\n      Evidence suggests some African Americans with hypertension may experience difficulties\n      carrying out positive self-management behaviors, in part due to cultural beliefs and\n      practices, knowledge and perceptions regarding the nature and consequences hypertension, and\n      lack of systems to support ongoing engagement in prescribed care within their communities.\n      Substantial evidence has demonstrated the important role of family and community support in\n      improving patients' management of a variety of chronic illnesses.\n\n      The goal of this study is to rigorously test the effectiveness of hypertension\n      self-management interventions that engage African American patients, their families, and\n      their community-level resources to improve African American patients' blood pressure.\n\n      We hypothesize patients' hypertension control rates may be improved when combining community\n      health worker self-management support with other types of hypertension self-management\n      skills training."
