Twenty-eight days will constitute one course and subsequent courses will immediately follow with no break in the administration of the drug.

The maximum time on study is 24-months, but if there is no disease progression or adverse events, the patient may speak with a doctor about continuing the treatment off-study."

For this reason and because everolimus are known\n                  to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use\n                  adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)\n                  prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman\n                  become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,\n                  she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n\n               -  Female patients of child bearing potential must not be breastfeeding or pregnant\n                  as evidenced by a negative pregnancy test.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Patients receiving concomitant medication that may interfere with study outcome.

Close contact with those who have\n             received attenuated live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with everolimus.\n             Examples of live vaccines include intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral\n             polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella and TY21a typhoid vaccines\n\n          -  Hepatitis B/C blood test must be done at screening for all patients. Patients who\n             test positive for Hepatitis C antibodies and the Hepatitis B antigen are ineligible.\n\n          -  A known history of HIV seropositivity. HIV-positive patients on combination\n             antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic\n             interactions with everolimus. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of\n             lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.\n\n          -  Patients receiving chronic, systemic treatment with corticosteroids or another\n             immunosuppressive agent.

HBV DNA and HCV RNA PCR testing are required at screening\n        for all patients with a positive medical history based on risk factors and/or confirmation\n        of prior HBV/HCV infection."
