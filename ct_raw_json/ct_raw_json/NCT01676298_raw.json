All calls were made using the Spartan FRX CYP2C19 genotyping diagnostic system.\nAll data analyses was qualitative, based on the genotype calls determined by the FRX system (using on-board automated data analysis). A printed result listing the genotype call for each SNP was generated by the FRX system at the end of each run. If the result of a test is \"Inconclusive\" for one or more SNPs, the test were immediately repeated for the corresponding SNP(s) only, per the instructions for use. Results are reported based on both first-pass and second-pass (i.e. repeated test). For both the first-pass and second-pass results, 1-sided 95% confidence lower limits were calculated using the score method for the % correct calls (i.e. % agreement).",

A printed result listing the genotype call for each SNP was generated by the FRX system at the end of each run. If the result of a test is \"Inconclusive\" for one or more SNPs, the test were immediately repeated for the corresponding SNP(s) only, per the instructions for use. Results are reported based on both first-pass and second-pass (i.e. repeated test). For both the first-pass and second-pass results, 1-sided 95% confidence lower limits were calculated using the score method for the % correct calls (i.e. % agreement).",

            "textblock": "The FRX system is comprised of hardware and consumable components. The hardware components\n      of the system include an Analyzer (thermal cycler with fluorescence detection capability), a\n      notebook computer and a printer. The consumable component of the FRX system is a sample\n      collection kit. Each kit contains a buccal swab (used to collect the patient sample) and a\n      tube containing the reagents required for genomic DNA extraction and PCR (polymerase chain\n      reaction) amplification stages of the test.\n\n      The Spartan FRX System is capable of detecting three CYP2C19 SNPs(single nucleotide\n      polymorphism) (*2, *3, *17) in each test performed. An individual sample collection kit is\n      required for each SNP tested; therefore three sample collection kits are required for each\n      test performed on the system.\n\n      To perform a test, the user collects three buccal samples from the patient and then inserts\n      a sample into each of the three reagent tubes (one for each of the CYP2C19 loci *2, *3 and\n      *17). The reagent tubes are placed into the Analyzer and the FRX system automates the\n      processes of DNA extraction, PCR amplification, fluorescent signal detection and data\n      analysis. The system provides the user with a printed result listing the patient genotypes\n      at the *2, *3 and *17 loci.\n\n      The objective of the study is to evaluate the performance of the FRX System under\n      multivariate conditions. Specifically, the following variables will be included in the\n      study:\n\n        -  Test site - x3\n\n        -  Operator - x6 (2 per site)\n\n        -  Day  - x15 (5 non-consecutive days per site)\n\n        -  FRX System  - x16\n\n      Test performance is defined as the number of correct genotype calls, expressed as a\n      percentage of the total number of tests performed on the system.\n\n      For both the first-pass and second-pass results, 1-sided 95% confidence lower limits will be\n      calculated using the score method for the % correct calls (i.e. % agreement).\n\n      Genotype results from the FRX system will be compared with results of DNA sequencing. The\n      result of the FRX System test will be determined to be correct if the genotype calls for all\n      three SNPs are identical to the genotypes determined by DNA sequencing for that\n      sample/individual.\n\n      Results of the Reproducibility Study will be acceptable if the lower bound of a 1-sided 95%\n      confidence limit of the total correct call rate per genotype is greater than or equal to\n      95%, based on second-pass results."
