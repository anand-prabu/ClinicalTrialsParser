      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of TAK-385 for achieving and
      maintaining testosterone suppression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-385. Men with prostate cancer benefit from
      receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to minimize testosterone levels before, during
      and after EBRT.  This combination increases the potential success of treating their disease.
      This study will see if TAK-385 [an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist]
      brings testosterone levels down sufficiently, with the convenience and comfort of taking a
      pill. It will look at the time it takes to restore testosterone levels after radiation
      therapy as well. One hundred participants will be assigned by chance (like flipping a coin)
      to a treatment group: 60 to TAK-385, and 40 to degarelix.

      Those assigned to TAK-385 will take a daily pill. Those assigned to degarelix will receive
      an injection under the skin once every four weeks at the clinic. They will start radiation
      therapy when testosterone is low enough, after at least 12 weeks of treatment. This trial
      will be conducted at clinics in the United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK). Participants
      will visit the clinic up to 14 times over 37 weeks for physical exams and blood tests, and
      might receive one follow-up telephone call.

             lifestyle of the participant. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation,
             symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner] and withdrawal are not
             acceptable methods of contraception.).

          9. Has given voluntary written consent before performance of any study-related procedure
             not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may be
             withdrawn by the participant at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

         10. Has suitable venous access for the study-required blood sampling, including
             pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic sampling.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has metastatic disease (based on investigator evaluation and assuming no likely
             metastatic pelvic lymph nodes &gt; 1.0 cm in long axis diameter).

          3. Had diagnosis of or treatment for another malignancy within 2 years before the first
             dose of study drug, or previous diagnosis of another malignancy with evidence of
             residual disease. Participants with nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of
             any type are not excluded if they have undergone complete resection.

          4. Has abnormal screening and/or baseline laboratory values that suggest a clinically
             significant underlying disease, or the following laboratory values:

               1. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 1.5 ×
                  institutional upper limit of the normal range (ULN);

               2. Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL;

               3. Total bilirubin &gt; 2.0 × institutional ULN (unless documented Gilbert's disease);

             any ongoing cardiac arrhythmias of Grade &gt; 2 (chronic stable atrial fibrillation on
             stable anticoagulant therapy is allowed), thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein
             thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or symptomatic cerebrovascular events), or any other
             significant cardiac condition (e.g., pericardial effusion, restrictive
             cardiomyopathy) within 6 months before receiving the first dose of study drug.

          6. Has electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities of:

               1. Q-wave infarction, unless identified 6 or more months before screening;

               2. Heart rate-corrected QT interval (msec) (QTcF interval) &gt; 480 msec. If QTcF is
                  prolonged in a participant with a pacemaker, the participant may be enrolled in
                  the study upon discussion with the project clinician;

               3. If the QTcF interval is 450-480 msec, inclusive, in a participant with current
                  use of medications with known effects on QT interval, the participant may be
                  enrolled in the study following discussion with the project clinician.

             amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications.

          9. Has uncontrolled hypertension despite appropriate medical therapy (sitting blood
             pressure [BP] of greater than 160 mmHg systolic and 90 mmHg diastolic at 2 separate
             measurements no more than 60 minutes apart during the Screening visit). Participants
             with systolic BP measurements &gt; 160 mmHg may be rescreened. Participants with
             systolic BP measurements 141-160 mmHg, although eligible, should be referred for
             further management of hypertension if indicated.

         10. Has known, previously diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, active
             chronic hepatitis B or C, life-threatening illness unrelated to prostate cancer, or
             any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion,
             potentially interfere with participation in this study. Specific screening for
             chronic viral illness is at the discretion of the site and/or local institutional
             review board (IRB).

         11. Has received treatment with any investigational products within 3 months before the
             first dose of study drug.

             the conduct of the study or is a study site employee.

             with the oral absorption or tolerance of TAK-385, including difficulty swallowing
             tablets.

         14. Is using any medication or food products listed in the excluded medications and
             dietary products table within 2 weeks before the first dose of study drug. This list
             includes moderate and strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4/5) and
             P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Participants must have no history of amiodarone use in the 6
             months before the first dose of TAK-385.

         15. Has admission or evidence of alcohol or drug abuse or use of illicit drugs.
