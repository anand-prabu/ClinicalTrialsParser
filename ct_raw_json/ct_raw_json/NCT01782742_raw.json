The study drug \"bexarotene\" is an FDA approved anti-cancer agent but is not\n      approved for use in Alzheimer's disease. Bexarotene acts as an RXR agonist that has reduced\n      A\u03b2 (harmful protein) in the brain in experimental models of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n      This study aims to determine the safety and effect on abnormal  proteins found in the brain\n      (based on brain scans) of 300 mg of \"bexarotene\" administered for one month compared to\n      placebo (inactive agent)."
