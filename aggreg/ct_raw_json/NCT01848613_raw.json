A phase IV study.\n\n      ShortTitle/ Acronym: VIVOS\n\n      Protocol Code :IRST162.05\n\n      Study Design: Randomized, open label cross-over study\n\n      Study Duration: Two years\n\n      Study Center(s): Multicenter study\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      Primary: Patient preference for oral or intravenous vinorelbine Secondary: Overall  Response\n      Rate, Time to Progression, Toxicity, Survival, Subjective reasons for treatment choice.\n\n      Number of Subjects: 120\n\n      Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria:\n\n      Patients affected by stage IIIB or stage IV NSCLC candidates to receive a first line\n      chemotherapy with vinorelbine due to age \u2265  70 and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)\n      Performance status \u22642 or age \u2264 70 but ECOG PS \u2265 2\n\n      Study Product, Dose, Route, Regimen and duration of administration :\n\n        -  Arm A: first cycle of IV vinorelbine (30 mg/m2)  and second cycle of PO vinorelbine\n           (60mg/m2)\n\n        -  Arm B:  first cycle with PO vinorelbine (60mg/m2) followed by a second cycle of IV\n           vinorelbine (30mg/m2) In both arms vinorelbine  will be given at day 1 and day 8 every\n           3 weeks. From the third cycle onwards patients will have to choose to receive oral or\n           intravenous vinorelbine. Vinorelbine capsules will be administered at the dosage of 60\n           mg/m2 for the first course and then may be increased to 80 mg/m\u00b2 at physician's choice.\n\n      Treatment will be repeated every  21 days and continued until disease progression,\n      intolerable toxicity or patient refusal.\n\n      Reference therapy: Vinorelbine 30 mg/m2 intravenous day 1 and 8 every 21 days\n\n      Statistical Methodology: The sample size is calculated based on 75% of patients preferring\n      \"oral\" vinorelbine and 25% preferring \"intravenous\" vinorelbine. Therefore, the\n      investigators would compare patients preferring \"oral\" vinorelbine as 75% compared to a null\n      hypothesis of 50% (no difference in proportion of patients preferring \"oral\" to\n      \"intravenous\"). With 80% power and a total alpha of 0.05, the estimated sample size is 60\n      for group (120 total). During recruitment period, a formal interim analysis was planned when\n      60 patients (30 for group) have been enrolled, with a p-value <0.0001. To claim statistical\n      significance in the final analysis, the overall p-value is still 5% (referred to\n      Peto-Haybittle rule)."

Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be\n             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded)  as\n             >20 mm with conventional techniques or as >10 mm with spiral CT scan.

Patients with recurrent disease after previous surgery are eligible\n\n          6. Life expectancy > 3 months\n\n          7. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function\n\n          8. Female participants of child bearing potential and male participants whose partner is\n             of child bearing potential must be willing to ensure that they or their partner use\n             effective contraception during the study and for 3 months thereafter\n\n          9.

Patients who have had previous chemotherapy for lung cancer or radiotherapy on target\n             lesions.\n\n          2.

Patients with known symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases should be excluded from\n             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop\n             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic\n             and other adverse events.\n\n          7. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic\n             composition to vinorelbine or other agents used in the study.\n\n          8.
