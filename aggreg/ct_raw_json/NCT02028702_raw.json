            "textblock": "Menopausal symptoms are a common phenomenon causing discomfort to many middle aged women\n      throughout the world. The core symptoms are experienced as hot flushes (HF), night sweats,\n      vaginal dryness and sleep disturbance. Other secondary symptoms are sexual dysfunction,\n      depression, anxiety, memory loss, fatigue, headache, joint pains and weight gain. Moreover\n      there is increased risk of further complications such as osteoporosis, cardiovascular and\n      negative changes in lipid profile associated with the reduction in oestrogen during and post\n      menopause.\n\n      Trifolium Pratense or Red Clover (RC) has arisen as a popular source for women experiencing\n      HF because it contains a variety of phytoestrogen's, namely isoflavones, lignans and\n      coumestans. Phytoestrogens are shown to have positive effects on menopausal disorders such\n      as breast cancer, cardiovascular risk factors, osteoporosis and have been shown to exert\n      non-hormonal antioxidant effects. Additionally these isoflavones appear to reduce bone\n      resorbtion, help maintain bone mineral density and improve lipid profile (reducing LDL: HDL,\n      lipoprotein A, total cholesterol and may also reduce triglycerides).\n\n      RC is particularly high in estrogenic isoflavones biochanin A, formononetin and to a lesser\n      degree genestein and diadzein, although the two former are precursors to genestein and\n      diadzein. Asian populations with a high intake of soy (rich in genestein and diadzein) have\n      long shown a lower reported incidence of the symptoms of menopause.\n\n      The study will be carried out as a 3-month parallel randomized control intervention study,\n      consisting of 61 menopausal women. During summer 2012, 61 participants will be randomised\n      into 2 groups (~30-31 in each group). The two groups are as follows:\n\n        1. Menopausal women receiving RC treatment - 150ml/d Red Clover (80mg/d of isoflavones as\n           aglycone)\n\n        2. Menopausal women receiving placebo - 150ml placebo"
