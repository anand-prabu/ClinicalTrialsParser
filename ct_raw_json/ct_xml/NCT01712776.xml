      To determine the efficacy and safety of vapocoolant spray (Pain Ease Medium Stream) in
      decreasing the pain of  venipuncture (&quot;blood draw&quot;)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, blinded, comparator study. This study design is
      considered standard for establishing safety and efficacy data.  Active treatment vapocoolant
      spray (Pain Ease Medium Stream) spray) will be used. There will be a placebo (sterile water)
      in this study. The population selected for this study, adult nongeriatric patients and
      pediatric patients (excluding the very young) represents a patient population that may
      benefit from vapocoolant spray. This is a patient population that according to the treating
      health care provider already requires venipuncture for &quot;blood draw&quot; but not intravenous
      cannulation. Because venipuncture is a painful procedure, vapocoolant may confer benefit for
      the relief of pain.
