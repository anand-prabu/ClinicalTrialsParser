The 2 arms of the study are:\n\n        -  Arm A - Scaling and root planing plus PeriZone PerioPatch;\n\n        -  Arm B - Scaling and root planing alone (control group).\n\n      Procedures (methods): After potential patients have been screened, informed consent forms\n      are signed, and patients have completed the remaining screening evaluations, each patient\n      will be randomized to a treatment group. Patients must present with generalized, moderate to\n      severe chronic periodontitis defined as having at least two periodontal pockets measuring 6\n      mm or more and bleeding on probing (at Baseline).\n\n      Periodontal probing measurements (PD, CAL, GI and PI) will be performed at Baseline (prior\n      to randomization), and at Weeks 4, 8 and 12. All subjects will receive scaling and root\n      planing (full mouth during at most 2 sessions within two weeks following the Baseline exam).\n      Thereafter, PeriZone PerioPatch will be dispensed to subjects per randomization for\n      administration over the trial period (i.e., Days 1-6; Days 14-20; Days 28-30; Days 42-44).\n      Intraoral soft tissue inspection will be performed at Screening, Baseline and at Weeks 4, 8\n      and 12. Adverse event collection will be performed at Weeks 4, 8 and 12. Compliance will be\n      will be evaluated via collection of unused study devices.\n\n      Analysis Plan: Baseline and demographic data will be summarized by treatment.

Changes in probing depths, bleeding scores, clinical attachment levels Gingival\n      Index and Plaque Index scores (from Baseline) will be expressed as means per subjects and\n      tested for inter-group differences using nonparametric rank analysis of covariance."
