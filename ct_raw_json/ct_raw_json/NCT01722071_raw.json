Oxytocin is hypothesized to\n      facilitate social behaviors via its modulation of motivational networks. With this study, we\n      will characterize oxytocin's effects on the neural processing of salient stimuli. We will\n      utilize a noninvasive brain imaging technique, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),\n      to assess brain activity while participants perform tests designed to engage neural circuits\n      associated with the processing of social and non-social stimuli."
