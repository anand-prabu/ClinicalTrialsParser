Women with a singleton pregnancy between 23w0d and 31w6d in preterm labor\n      randomly assigned to 50mg indomethacin by mouth followed by 25mg by mouth every 6hour for 48\n      hours or placebo. Patients receive betamethasone for fetal lung maturity, if not previously\n      administered, and magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection. Ultrasound performed before\n      initiation of study drug and after completion of study medication for amniotic fluid index\n      and fetal cardiac assessment."
