  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the public health importance of clinical depression, more than 50% of depressed
      adults receive inadequate or no treatment, with even higher rates of under-treatment in men
      and minorities.  Family members and/or friends often assist older adults in their health
      care and may help overcome barriers to formal care, yet there is a lack of primary
      care-based interventions that mobilize family members and friends to improve depression
      treatment.  In partnership with a community-based clinic, this research will address this
      scientific gap by developing and then testing the feasibility and acceptability of a
      family-based intervention that can be delivered pragmatically in a primary care setting
      serving large numbers of older minorities.

      The family-based intervention will be tested in a 6 month randomized controlled trial of 24
      depressed older men-family member dyads (18 intervention and 6 controls).  The purpose of
      the RCT is to test the acceptability of the intervention, as well as the feasibility of the
      study methods.  Patients from the RCT will be identified from a family practice clinic based
      on their scores on the PHQ-9 as well as additional inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Once
      they and their family member have agreed to participate, patients will be randomized either
      to the family based intervention or a usual care control condition augmented by family
      psychoeducation. The investigators will recruit English and Spanish speaking age 60 and
      above older men from SJGH who have 1) significant depressive symptoms (i.e. PHQ &gt; 15, 2)
      have at least one criteria A symptom (depressed mood or anhedonia), 3) depression-related
      functional impairment) and 4) an adult family member willing to participate in the study.
      We have chosen a higher cut-off to minimize false positives.  We will exclude psychotic,
      demented or institutionalized men.  After enrollment, 24 dyads (i.e. older man and family
      member) will be randomized one of two groups: intervention or usual care augmented by
      written psychoeducational materials on depression. Dyads will be randomized to achieve a 2:1
      ratio of intervention versus usual care dyads (i.e. 18 intervention and 6 control dyads).
      To ensure adequate numbers of ethnic minority patients in each arm of the trial, we will
      conduct a stratified randomization such that each arm of the RCT is 50% English language
      preferring and 50% Spanish language preferring (i.e. 3 in control and 9 in intervention
      arm).  The research assistant conducting subject assessment at baseline, 1-month, 3-months
      and 6 months will be blinded to intervention and control assignments.

    <description>The primary focus of our approach is on effectively engaging family members of depressed older men in the care of the patient.  The interventionist (social worker) will 1) work jointly with a family member and older men to strengthen depression self-management and participation during primary care visits and 2) conduct a brief training module for primary care provider skills to strengthen their skills in working with family members.</description>
