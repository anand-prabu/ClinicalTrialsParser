      Acute aortic dissection (AD) is a deadly, difficult to diagnose disease presenting with an
      array of common and unspecific symptoms. Aortic dissection detection (ADD) risk score as a
      bedside clinical tool to estimate the risk of AD. D-dimer has been evaluated in several
      studies as a biomarker of AD, and has showed a pooled diagnostic sensitivity of 97%.
      However, considering the severe morbidity and mortality of AD, a negative D-dimer per se is
      considered insufficient to rule-out AD in unselected patients.

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether the diagnostic performance of D-dimer
      differs in patients at different clinical risk of AD based on ADD risk score, and in
      particular whether a negative D-dimer test may allow safe rule-out of AD in any patient
      subgroup without necessity to perform urgent aortic imaging.

      Consecutive adult patients with suspected AD presenting to ED will be enrolled before the
      establishment of a final diagnosis; at presentation a standardized clinical form
      comprehensive of presence/absence of 12 risk markers allowing ADD risk score will be
      fulfilled and d-dimer levels measured.

      The aortic imaging exam used to confirm or refuse of AD will be computed tomography
      angiography or transesophageal echocardiography and final diagnosis established after
      reviewing of all available data except for ADD risk score and d-dimer.

      The accuracy, failure rate and efficiency of a diagnostic strategy combining standardized
      clinical stratification via the ADD risk score with D-dimer testing will therefore be
      assessed.

    <description>The diagnostic performance of D-dimer will be assessed by computing sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values and negative and positive likelihood ratios with their 95% confident interval (95% CI) in all patients and in patients with different ADD risk score. The ADD risk score will be calculated based on the number of categories where at least one risk marker is present. Patients will be divided in low-risk (0 risk markers, ADD risk score 0), intermediate-risk (ADD risk score 1, at least 1 risk marker in 1 ADD risk category) and high-risk (ADD risk &gt;1, at least 1 risk marker in &gt;1 ADD risk categories). For diagnostic accuracy analyses, also a category of non-high-risk patients (ADD risk score ≤1) will be used.</description>

    <description>More than conventional accuracy measures even failure rate and the efficiency of D-dimer will be also calculated in high-risk patients (ADD score &gt;1), in low-risk patients (ADD risk score 0) and in the intermediate and low-risk patients combined (non high-risk patients, ADD risk score ≤1). Failure rate (false negative proportion) will calculated as the number of patients with a negative D-dimer and a final diagnosis of AD divided by all patients with negative D-dimer in the same risk group. The efficiency of the diagnostic strategy will be calculated as the number of patients with a negative D-dimer within a risk group divided by all included patients.</description>
