      The aim of this study is to compare Dysport treatment results after current clinical
      practice injection technique and high-concentration dilution to the neuromuscular junction
      targeted injection technique and low-concentration dilution in the elbow joint assessed by
      Modified Ashworth Scale 4 weeks post treatment. The hypothesis is that one high volume
      injection centrally located in the area/band of the NMJ zones will be as effective as the
      technique used today in current medical practice.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provision of written informed consent prior to any study related procedures

          -  Subjects male or female, aged 18 or older

          -  Upper limb spasticity post stroke or traumatic brain injury

          -  Spasticity position pattern type 1, 3 or 4

          -  Elbow flexor muscles spasticity MAS 2 to 3

          -  At least 2 consecutive previous treatment cycles of BoNT-A for current diagnosis

          -  The latest treatment cycle demonstrating good treatment efficacy where the Dysport
             dose administered was considered to be adequate according to Investigator judgement

          -  Need of the same treatment modality as the previous treatment cycle,

          -  Last BoNT-A treatment 12-24 weeks ago

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Poor response to BoNT-A treatment, according to Investigator

          -  Need of Dysport doses &gt;800U in the upper limb

          -  Concomitant treatment with BoNT-A for other indications than spasticity

          -  Any elbow flexor contracture prohibiting MAS evaluation and/or elbow flexion
             improvement of at least 1 step on the MAS

          -  Cutaneous or joint inflammation in the affected upper limb

          -  Is likely to start other spasticity treatment during the study

          -  Is likely to start physiotherapy treatment during the study

          -  Other ongoing neurological disorder (e.g., myasthenia gravis)

          -  History of dysphagia or aspiration

          -  Use of agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., aminoglycosides)

          -  Treated with an investigational medicinal product within 30 days before start of the
             study

          -  Known sensitivity to BoNT-A or any components of Dysport,

          -  Is at risk of pregnancy or is lactating. Females of childbearing potential must
             provide a negative pregnancy test (U-hCG) at visit 1 and must be using adequate
             contraception. Non childbearing potential is defined as post-menopause for at least
             one year, surgical sterilisation or hysterectomy at least three months before the
             start of the study,

          -  Has a history of, or known current, problems with alcohol or drug abuse,

          -  Has a mental condition rendering the subject unable to understand the nature, scope
             and possible consequences of the study, and/or evidence of an uncooperative attitude,

          -  Has abnormal baseline findings, any other medical condition(s) or laboratory findings
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, might jeopardise the subject's safety or
             decrease the chance of obtaining satisfactory data needed to achieve the objective(s)
             of the study.
