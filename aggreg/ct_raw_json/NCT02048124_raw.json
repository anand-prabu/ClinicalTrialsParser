            "textblock": "Objectives of the study\n\n      The primary objective is to compare the diagnostic yield of biopsies performed by EUS-FNA\n      using the 25d ProCor needle versus the standard 25g needle.\n\n      The primary outcome is the diagnostic yield defined as: sensitivity for the presence of\n      cancer based on the analysis of EUS-FNA samples.\n\n      The secondary objectives are:\n\n        1. to compare the size of the \"core\" samples produced by the two types of needles.\n\n        2. to compare the incidence and severity of immediate complications associated with the\n           two types of needles\n\n      Methods\n\n      Design:  This a prospective clinical study for the validation of a new instrument (ProCor\n      biopsy needle) for application to clinical medicine, namely the diagnosis of cancer.\n\n      Endoscopic procedures:\n\n      Informed consent by the patient will be obtained before each procedure by a single research\n      assistant.\n\n      All EUS examinations will be performed under conscious sedation (midazolam, fentanyl) by one\n      two experienced endosonographers according to the standard procedures at the CHUM and using\n      a linear echoendoscope. , If the lesion is considered solid and EUS-FNA is considered\n      clinically indicated and safe, the patient will be enrolled and the randomisation envelope\n      will be opened. EUS-FNA Biopsies will be obtained with both the 25S and 25P needles in each\n      lesion; a randomisation sequence will set in order to determine which of the two needles\n      will first be used (25S or 25P).\n\n      EUS-FNA passes will be performed without stylet. One \"needle pass\" is defined as 5 strokes\n      in 4 different areas of the lesion.  The material from the first 2 needle passes (one 25S\n      and the other 25P) will be expressed into formalin to look for core samples. Material from\n      the next 2 needle passes (again one 25S and the other 25P) will be expressed onto slides for\n      cytological analysis. Ease of puncture will be scored qualitatively as poor (scored 1), good\n      (scored 2) or excellent (scored 3).\n\n      Immediate complications will be assessed and recorded by nurses and/or physicians during the\n      procedure as well after the procedure while the patients will be monitored in the recovery\n      room for at least 60 minutes before discharge.\n\n      The areas which will be investigated by biopsy will be the pancreas, the retroperitoneal\n      and/or  the mediastinal lymph nodes.\n\n      Cytological and Histological analyses:\n\n      Samples from all needle passes will be stained using a standard Papanicolaou stain  and\n      analyzed by one experienced pathologist who will be blinded as to needle type. The\n      cytological or histological diagnoses will be made; . for histological diagnosis, the\n      pathologist will first establish the presence or absence of a tissue core (defined as a\n      measurable cylinder of tissue). The pathologist will assess the adequacy of each specimen:\n      cellularity (score 1 \"poor\"; score 2 \"good\"; score 3 \"excellent\"),[14] sample bloodiness\n      (score 1 \"minimal\";score 2 \"moderate\"; score 3 \"significant\", and the presence or absence of\n      malignancy(\"positive\" / \"negative\" / \"suspicious\" /  inconclusive).\n\n      Diagnostic yield Diagnostic yield is defined as sensitivity for the presence of cancer based\n      on the analysis of EUS-FNA samples. The gold standard will be the presence of cancer as\n      defined on the basis of at least one of the following two criteria:   positive cytological\n      or histological results and malignant disease after clinical follow up (clinical worsening\n      and radiologic evidence of progression within the 6 months following FNA).\n\n      Data collection\n\n      Clinical data will be collected prospectively and saved in a database. In addition to\n      demographics, these will include:\n\n        -  size and location (pancreas, lymph node, liver, adrenal gland, others)  of the target\n           lesion\n\n        -  technical and procedure variables ( FNA path, , number of needle passes, needle\n           visibility, ease to puncture, needle failure, cellularity, bloodiness)\n\n        -  cytological diagnosis\n\n        -  final diagnosis\n\n        -  immediate complications. Research data and project-related documents will be preserved\n           during 15 year after the end of the study.\n\n      Statistical analysis Results for continuous variables will be summarized using mean \u00b1\n      (Standard Deviation) SD, . and categorical variables using proportions. The 25S and 25P\n      groups will be compared using Chi-square test for categorical variables and,  Student t test\n      for continuous variablesTwo-sided p values less than 0.05 will be considered statistically\n      significant. Data will be analyzed using SPSS v 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago IL) statistical\n      software.\n\n      Sample size The sample size is calculated as a study of non-inferiority. Assuming a\n      sensitivity for cancer of 85% for the 25S needle and a difference of sensitivity of 15% as\n      clinically significant, a sample size of 112 patients per group would be needed (\u03b1 = 0.05\n      and \u03b2 = 0.2). Since we perform approximately 400 EUS-FNA biopsies for solid lesions\n      annually,.  it is expected that this study could be completed within approximately 6 months."
