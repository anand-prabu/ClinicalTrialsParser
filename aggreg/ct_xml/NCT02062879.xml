  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare ketamine and hydromorphone as alternative patient-controlled
      interventions for trauma-related pain.  Patients receiving ketamine PCA are expected to
      require less total and breakthrough opioid and to have similar or improved objective pain
      scores.  Patients receiving ketamine are also expected to have shorter duration of
      supplemental oxygen requirement, fewer episodes of oxygen desaturation, improved pulmonary
      toilet, lower use of antiemetics, and shorter times to first bowel movement.  Ketamine is
      further expected to be associated with decreased intensive care unit and hospital lengths of
      stay, faster time to maximum allowable ambulation, decreased opioid dosage at discharge, and
      lower report of chronic pain syndromes.
