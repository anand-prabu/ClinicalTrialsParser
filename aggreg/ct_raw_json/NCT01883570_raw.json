The\n           search strategy was then reproduced using a dynamic cursor moving across the\n           corresponding chest x-ray, and incorporated into a teaching program accessible via the\n           internet.\n\n        -  Participants are 3rd year medical students who will be randomized into two groups. The\n           experimental group will have access to the teaching program as described. The control\n           group will have access to the same x-rays but not the expert's search strategy.\n\n        -  At the end of the study period the investigators will collect performance data (the\n           participants' accuracy at reading a series of chest x-rays) and process data (using\n           gaze-tracking to evaluate the participants' search strategies); the experimental and\n           control groups will be compared.\n\n      Expected results:\n\n      The investigators expect the group trained in expert search strategy to show improved\n      accuracy at reading chest x-rays, and an improvement in their visual search strategy"
