  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is prompted by the urgent public health need to identify novel strategies to
      prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The higher prevalence of
      CVD, T2D, and metabolic syndrome in obese individuals is a major healthcare concern.
      Therefore, finding optimal intervention strategies to combat these growing epidemics is
      imperative.

      At present, the extent to which dietary components can modify endothelial function, monocyte
      inflammation and glycemic variations is not well defined, although different carbohydrates
      are known to vary in their abilities to induce plasma glucose and insulin responses.
      Epidemiologic work suggests that high dietary glycemic load (GL) is associated with
      increased concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, endothelial dysfunction markers, and
      increased risk of T2D and coronary heart disease (CHD). We are examining using randomized
      control trials low vs. high-GL diet to determine if low-GL diets induce improvements in
      endothelial function or monocyte inflammation.  Furthermore, resistance training is an
      alternate form of exercise from conventional aerobic training. Resistance Training has the
      potential to improve endothelial function or monocyte phenotype, but there is very little
      data in this area.  We hypothesize that resistance training may augment the beneficial
      effects of a low-GL diet in improving metabolic health.

    <description>Monocytes will be isolated from subject whole blood and will be phenotyped in 2 ways: 1) as pro- or anti-inflammatory based on flow-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of monocyte-specific markers TLR-4, CD14 and CD16.
Serum-Stimulated Cell Culture. Subject serum will be incubated with L6 cells as we have previously performed in monocytes and adipocytes as well as endothelial cells 18, 130.  Following 48 hr incubation, cellular insulin-stimulated glucose transport will be assayed as described 129 and conditioned medium assayed for myokine levels (ex. IL-15, 1L-6, etc).
Fasting plasma (and conditioned media where appropriate) will be taken to determine a panel of adipokines and hormones (e.g. insulin, adiponectin, HSP-72, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1, CRP, 8-iso PGF2α) will be measured using the Millipore Multiplex assay kit or with specific ELISA kits</description>
