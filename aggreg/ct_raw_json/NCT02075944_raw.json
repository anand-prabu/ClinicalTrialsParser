Subjects randomized to the exercise groups will complete 30\n      minutes of aerobic exercise 3 times a week for 9 weeks incorporating low (group I) or high\n      (group II) intensity aerobic exercise. The exercise will be conducted as running or indoor\n      cycling (supervised). At baseline and 9-weeks follow-up all subjects will complete two\n      cognitive tests (measures of concentration and sustained attention), a maximal cycling test\n      (direct measures of VO2max), an intelligence quotient test, anthropometric measures, fasting\n      blood samples and blood samples immediately following the cycling test. The blood samples\n      will be analyzed for growth factors including BDNF and metabolic factors."
