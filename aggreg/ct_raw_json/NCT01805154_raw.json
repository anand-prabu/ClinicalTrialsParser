The\n      criteria used for determining the response to CRT will be captured.\n\n      After the 12 months follow-up, non-responders will continue to be followed at every 3 months\n      whereas responders will be followed at every 6 months until the study completion.\n\n      During the office follow-up visits, arrhythmic episode diagnoses, device data and stored\n      electrogram will be collected. All clinical events such as hospitalization for HF, all-cause\n      hospitalizations, and all-cause death will also be collected.  For patients who are\n      non-responders to CRT, any re-optimization of the device, i.e., AV/VV interval optimization,\n      LV lead repositioning and pacing vector reconfiguration as well as modified/new clinical\n      therapies administered in an attempt to improve HF condition will be collected."
