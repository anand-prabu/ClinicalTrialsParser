Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to\n      replace immune cells that were destroyed by radioimmunotherapy used to kill tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody\n      therapy plus peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have stage IV\n      breast cancer."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of yttrium Y\n      90 monoclonal antibody MN-14 (Y90 MOAB MN-14) plus peripheral blood stem cell rescue in\n      patients with stage IV breast cancer. II. Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of Y90 MOAB\n      MN-14 in the blood, normal organs, and tumors of this patient population. III. Determine the\n      antibody response to Y90 MOAB MN-14 in these patients. IV. Determine the antitumor effect of\n      this regimen in these patients. V. Determine the radiation absorbed dose to normal organs\n      and tumors.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF)\n      subcutaneously (SC) with or without chemotherapy on days -28 to -14 and peripheral blood\n      stem cell (PBSC) collection on days -14 to -11. If an adequate number of CD34+ cells are not\n      harvested, bone marrow may be collected. Patients receive pretherapy imaging with indium In\n      111 monoclonal antibody MN-14 IV for up to 40 minutes on day -7 followed by whole body\n      imaging on days -7 to 0. Patients receive yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody MN-14 (Y90 MOAB\n      MN-14) IV for up to 40 minutes on day 0. PBSC or bone marrow is reinfused on days 6 to 14,\n      depending on antibody clearance. Patients receive G-CSF SC or IV until blood counts recover.\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Y90 MOAB MN-14 until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed weekly for 2 months,\n      monthly for 6 months, and then every 6 months for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5\n      years."
