Patients will be randomized to modify (add or switch or initiate)\n      their current antiretroviral therapy and will add Viracept or remain on their current\n      background antiretroviral therapy for a 2 month period. Initially 20 patients will be\n      randomized in a 2:1 ratio (i.e., 14 Viracept, 6 control) for a 2 month period. Response to\n      therapy will be evaluated at the end of the 2 month control phase. At this point, patients\n      who were initially assigned to the control arm will continue on open label Viracept for an\n      additional 10 month period."
