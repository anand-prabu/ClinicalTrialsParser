If an insufficient number were collected,\n           we will ask for another similar collection in about 1 week.\n\n        -  After the patient has completed the full 6 weeks of radiation, all of the lymphocytes\n           will be returned to the patient through a simple intravenous infusion.  A larger\n           intravenous access (i.e. midline) might be needed.  Any cells that are not reinfused\n           will be stored for 1 year and then discarded.\n\n        -  Study bloods (10 ml) will be collected at the time of lymphocyte collection, prior\n           lymphocyte reinfusion, and then every 2 weeks until week 20th.  These blood samples\n           will be stored and used for future analysis.\n\n      Blood counts are obtained weekly as part of standard care for patients with this kind of\n      brain tumor.  For the first 14 weeks after the lymphocyte reinfusion we will be doing some\n      extra tests on the routinely collected blood to see how the effective the reinfused\n      lymphocytes are in raising the patients lymphocyte counts.   These results will be available\n      to the patients treating physician.\n\n      At no time will this study interfere with the patients planned standard of care radiation\n      and chemotherapy."
