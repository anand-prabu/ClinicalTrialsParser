The secondary outcome variables include keratinized\n      tissue and gingival thickness gain.\n\n      Sample size has been estimated as 13 in each treatment arm. All recessions are treated with\n      modified coronally advanced flap. On test sites PRF membrane and on control sites connective\n      tissue grafts will be placed under modified coronally advanced flaps. Random allocation of\n      the treatment sites to test and control groups were performed using a computer software\n      designed for randomization.\n\n      Clinical parameters such as gingival index, plaque index, keratinized tissue width, gingival\n      recession depth and width were measured at 1, 3 and 6 months. Probing pocket depth, clinical\n      attachment level, gingival thickness and gingival recession area were measure at baseline\n      and 6 months. All gingival recession-related parameters such as recession height, recession\n      width and recession area  and keratinized tissue width along with mean root coverage and\n      complete root coverage were assessed on standardized clinical photographs using an image\n      analysis software.\n\n      Clinical photographs were obtained at baseline and 1, 3 and 6 months after surgical\n      intervention. 4 mm length wire was placed on gingiva to check reproducibility and to obtain\n      standardized pictures.\n\n      Gingival tissue thickness were measured with an #15 endodontic reamer attached to rubber\n      stopper inserted perpendicularly into the gingival tissue 2 mm below the gingival margin;\n      thickness of the reamer will be measured with a digital caliper.\n\n      Mean root coverage percentage was calculated as percentage of covered root surface area at 6\n      months.\n\n      Follow up of subjects was 6 months."
