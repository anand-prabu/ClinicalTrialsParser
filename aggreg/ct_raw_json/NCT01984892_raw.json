A very close second step is optimal Th1-weighted\n      priming through the in-situ combination of the poly-ICLC danger signal with the tumor\n      antigens released in step 1 and further processed and cross-presented by poly-ICLC activated\n      mDC, etc.   The repeated administration of the Hiltonol danger signal IT in the context of\n      the patient's own tumor antigens and in a way that mimics a natural viral infection may be\n      critical to this step.  Once the system is optimally primed, the third step is targeting and\n      maintenance of the immune response and its facilitation at remote tumor sites with IM\n      poly-ICLC through chemokine release, inflammasome activation and other costimulatory\n      factors."
