The Best Visual Acuity\n      (BCVA) measured by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (EDTRS).\n\n      Secondary objectives:\n\n      To evaluate differences in Optic Coherence Tomography (OCT) retinal thickness and total\n      macular volume of combined treatment regiment including intravitreal injection of 0,5 mg of\n      Lucentis (ranibizumab) and laser photocoagulation for patients with PDR at visit 7 compared\n      to the baseline assessments.\n\n      To evaluate the percentage of patients that present with vitreous hemorrhage after the\n      beginning of the laser treatment at visit 7 compared to the baseline assessments.\n\n      Strategic goal:\n\n      The main goal of this study is to evaluate if the use of intravitreal ranibizumab in eyes\n      submitted to Pan-Retinal Photocoagulation (PRP) due to PDR induces less macular edema and\n      less vitreous hemorrhage and therefore leads to a better visual outcome"
