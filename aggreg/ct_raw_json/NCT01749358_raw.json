Dosage of therapy refers to the amount of time (in this case, the total number of\n      hours) that a person participates in treatment.  The investigators hope to learn how much\n      therapy time is needed in order for change to occur in arm and hand function after a person\n      has had a stroke. Eligible candidates must have had a stroke affecting the use of an arm or\n      hand at least 6 months ago."
