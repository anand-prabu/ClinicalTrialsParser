The surgical treatment of anterior cruciate\n      ligament injury is the gold standard in the treatment of these injuries in young and active,\n      the postoperative rehabilitation is extensive and full return to sport occurs only after 6\n      months postoperatively. Based on this gap, the investigators seek to draw properly through\n      our study methods and more complex techniques, that comparing two rehabilitation programs\n      can achieve high precision early rehabilitation. This will include 32 athletes who had\n      complete ACL rupture confirmed by MRI and underwent ACL reconstruction using patellar\n      tendon.All subjects will be followed from the pre-surgery, the fourth and sixth month after\n      surgery with: KT1000 measures the ligamentous laxity, knee function by applying the\n      International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC 2000); Isokinetic Muscle Strength (Cybex).\n      Through a random draw of sealed envelopes, patients will be allocated in their\n      rehabilitation groups: Accelerated (4 months) or Conventional (6 months). Preoperatively,\n      fourth and sixth month after surgery will be an assessment of laxity by (KT1000), Muscular\n      Strength (CYBEX) and knee function affected by IKDC (2000) and Hop Test. The assessor and\n      the patients were blinded to treatment group. This study will have the locus Institute of\n      Orthopaedics and Traumatology, School of Medicine, S\u00e3o Paulo. The comparative results of the\n      two groups are analyzed using specific statistical tests to prove an improved significative\n      without damaging the integrity of the graft."
