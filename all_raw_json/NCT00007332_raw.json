For this reason, the development of safe, effective vaccines to\n      prevent HIV infections worldwide is needed. ALVAC vCP1452 and MN rgp120/HIV-1 have been\n      shown to be well tolerated in Phase I and II studies. ALVAC vCP1452 given alone or in\n      combination with subunit antigens [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/12/00: antigen] is a candidate\n      vaccine to be evaluated for the ability to produce and express vaccine antigen in greater\n      quantity for a longer time and with improved immunogenicity.\n\n      Volunteers are randomized to 1 of 7 [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/12/00: 1 of 4]  groups and\n      stratified by risk status. Prior to immunization, evaluations and blood draws are done to\n      monitor hematological, chemical, and immunologic parameters.

[AS PER AMENDMENT 10/12/00: Volunteers record all\n      relevant signs and symptoms occurring 48 hours after each vaccination and provide that\n      information at each clinic visit.] HIV testing is conducted every 3 to 6 months and\n      volunteers are asked to complete social harms questionnaires once at Day 168 and once at the\n      end of the study. Volunteers are followed on the study for a minimum of 18 months after the\n      first immunization. Safety is evaluated by closely monitoring for local and systemic adverse\n      reactions during the course of the trial."
