  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following a first, dose ascending study that enrolled 144 normal healthy volunteers (NHVs),
      this study, to be conducted in approximately 36 NHVs, will provide pertinent information in
      determining the dose-response of MDCO-157 for platelet aggregation inhibition and P2Y12
      receptor inhibition effects and in selection of doses that match the antiplatelet effects of
      300 mg PLAVIX® ®. The study will also provide additional data for pharmacokinetics (PK),
      safety and tolerability of single doses of MDCO-157.
