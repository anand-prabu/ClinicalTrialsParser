The goals of the current study, based largely upon the core principles of the\n      Social Ecological Model, are to design, implement, and evaluate an innovative multi-level\n      intervention promoting physical activity among churchgoing Latinas.\n\n      The evidenced-based intervention targets three \"tiers\" of environmental influences (i.e.,\n      church, immediate neighborhood surrounding the church, and community) on activity, as well\n      as MVPA-related personal factors (i.e.., intra/interpersonal, cultural, and perceived\n      environmental variables). The physical activity intervention will be compared with an\n      attention-control condition providing health education on cancer prevention and control via\n      screening.\n\n      Sixteen churches will be randomly assigned to either the physical activity intervention or\n      the attention-control condition. The primary aim of the study is to determine whether a\n      multi-level intervention will increase MVPA among Latina churchgoers in the intervention\n      condition relative to the attention-control condition."
