This optimal dose will be given 3 times a day for a 6 week primary observation\n      period, plus an optional 6 month extension.\n\n      NOTE: During the single dose portion of this study, patients may be untreated or may\n      continue treatment with their current nucleoside antiretroviral therapy. During multiple\n      dose administration of Viracept, antiretroviral therapy will be intensified by either adding\n      or modifying therapy. Antiretroviral therapies will be limited to those currently licensed\n      including zidovudine, lamivudine, stavudine, didanosine or zalcitabine."
