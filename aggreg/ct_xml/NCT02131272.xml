  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted globally. The aim of the trial is to investigate the efficacy and
      safety of insulin detemir versus insulin Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) in combination
      with metformin and diet/exercise on glycaemic control in children and adolescents with type
      2 diabetes insufficiently controlled on metformin with or without other oral antidiabetic
      drug(s) with or without basal insulin.
