Genes are the units of\n      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) the chemical structure carrying genetic information that\n      determine many human characteristics. Certain genes in cancer cells may determine how the\n      tumor grows or spreads and how it may respond to different drugs. Part of this study is to\n      test those genes in esophageal cells using FISH."

Determine if sponge cytology with FISH is a reliable screening tool for esophageal\n      dysplasia/cancer, and determine its sensitivity and specificity and compare it to the gold\n      standard procedure (the upper endoscopy).\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. Determine if the cytology screening with FISH biomarkers is less expensive and cost\n      effective than upper endoscopy for esophageal dysplasia/cancer.\n\n      II. Determine the limitations and future needs to improve this technique.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Participants swallow the capsule (Oesotest from Actimed) and then wait 10 minutes before the\n      sponge is gently pulled out from the esophagus.
