  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single center, open label, single dose, four way crossover study in
      fasted healthy male subjects to compare the pharmacokinetics of nicotine following
      administration of 3 prototype 4mg nicotine lozenge to an internationally marketed 4mg
      nicotine lozenge. Blood samples will be drawn at pre-specified intervals for a total of 12
      hours post dose in each treatment session and plasma samples analyzed for nicotine levels.

    <measure>Area under the curve from time 0 to t, AUC (0-t)</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood samples were collected pre-dose and at 5, 10, 15, 30 and 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 hours post dosing</time_frame>
