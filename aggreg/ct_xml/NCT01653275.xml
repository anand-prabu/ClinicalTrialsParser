      We propose a 24 week clinical research trial (12 week observational period followed by 12
      week MedSD intervention) with feasibility of diet adoption and markers of bone turnover as
      the primary outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postmenopausal women are at increased risk of osteoporosis and fracture.  Components of a
      Mediterranean style diet (MedSD) are associated with reduced bone loss and fracture risk;
      however, the MedSD has not been tested in this population in the U.S. Therefore, we propose
      a 24 week clinical research trial (12 week observational period followed by 12 week MedSD
      intervention) with feasibility of diet adoption and markers of bone turnover as the primary
      outcomes.  The 12 week intervention will include provision of olive oil, walnuts and high
      n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) fish to replace other fats and oils, processed snacks
      and red meat, respectively; accompanied with fruit, vegetable, whole grain and legumes
      intake recommendations.  We hypothesize the MedSD intervention will increase serum n-3 PUFA
      and decrease saturated fatty acids and n-6 PUFA and this will result in an improvement in
      bone turnover markers.  The outcomes of the proposed intervention trial will promote further
      study of the benefits of a MedSD in the US.  We envision the research team to expand to
      other systems such as cardiovascular, metabolic, and inflammatory mechanisms in which less
      risk of disease is associated with a MedSD.

    <description>Subjects will receive key foods (olive oil, walnuts, frozen portions of high n-3 LCPUFA fish) and instructed in the quantity to consume each week.  Olive oil : minimum of 3 tablespoons per day.  Walnuts:10.5 oz/week (1.5 oz/day).  High n-3 LCPUFA fish: 3 or more fish meals per week.  Additional guidelines for altering diet include incorporation of fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains to replace sweets, white bread and starches, red meat and highly processed foods.</description>
