            "textblock": "AADvac1 is a candidate therapeutic vaccine for Alzheimer's disease that targets misfolded\n      tau protein, a common denominator of neurofibrillary pathology. Based on preclinical\n      results, the intervention is expected to reduce the number of neurofibrillary tangles,\n      remove hyperphosphorylated tau protein and reduce the amount of oligomerized and insoluble\n      pathological tau in the brain, to halt the spread of neurofibrillary pathology through the\n      brain, and thus prevent associated cognitive decline.\n\n      The vaccine's antigenic determinant is a synthetic peptide derived from a tau protein\n      sequence, which is coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and uses aluminum hydroxide\n      (Alhydrogel) as an adjuvant.\n\n      At present AADvac1 is intended as an active immunotherapy for patients with diagnosed\n      Alzheimer's disease (AD). According to need, patients will receive additional immunization\n      doses beyond those administered in the preceding pase 1 trial; the raised titers of\n      therapeutic antibodies and possible benefits of the treatment can extend beyond the duration\n      of the study.\n\n      Because of the central role of pathological misfolded tau protein in the etiology of AD, the\n      vaccine is expected to be more effective than active or passive immunotherapies aiming to\n      eliminate the amyloid \u03b2 plaques that have been clinically investigated so far."
