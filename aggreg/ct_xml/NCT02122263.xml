    <textblock>
      The effect of bariatric surgery on the extent of fat and extent of liver fibrosis following
      sleeve gastrtrectomy is unknown. Methods : 60 obese NAFLD patients will undergo sleeve
      gastrectomy surgery. Measurements will be conducted at: baseline, and at 6 Month and will
      include: abdominal US, Fibroscan elastography , biochemical tests, anthropometric
      measurements, and questionnaires for demographic details, quality of life, food intake, food
      tolerance and habitual physical activity. Primary Outcome Measures: Liver fat quantification
      (controlled attenuation parameter;CAP ) and stiffness at baseline and at 6 months by
      fibroscan. The liver stiffness is measured by Fibroscan in a volume of approximates 1 cm
      wide and 4 cm long cylinder, representing 1/500 of liver tissue (100 times greater than a
      biopsy sample). The results of the Fibroscan will be expressed in KiloPascals (kPa). The
      Fibroscan XL probe reduces Fibroscan failure and facilitates reliable liver stiffness
      measurement in obese patients compared with the common M probe.  Secondary Outcome Measures:
      metabolic parameters including insuline resistance, CRP, MDA, Paraoxonase, and bile acid
      levels. Quality of life and Food tolerance after bariatric surgery
