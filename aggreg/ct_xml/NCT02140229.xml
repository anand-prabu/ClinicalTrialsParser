  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Remission is nowadays an achievable objective for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients thanks
      to a large choice of therapies, early treatment and tight control (30% relapse).

      Ultrasound (US) driven-therapy, complemented with a clinico-biological follow-up, may
      improve the prognosis of RA in remission by increasing the duration of sustained remission
      and by preventing radiographic structural progression.

      The tested hypothesis is: The US coverage of RA allows to increase the duration of sustained
      clinical remission.

    <textblock>
      REVECHO is an international prospective multicentre simple blinded randomized study with a
      longitudinal follow-up of 18 months and a total study duration of 36 months. During the
      first visit, after having signed the consent form, Patients undergo at each visit, a
      clinical evaluation comprising an assessment of tender joint count (TJC), of swollen joint
      count (SJC), pain assessment, patient global assessment of the activity of disease, as well
      as a physician global assessment of the disease activity, an ultrasound examination of small
      and large joints by an independent physician blinded to the clinical data, and to the
      results of biological exams (blood sampling to assess CRP, complete blood count (CBS), and
      renal and hepatic functions). The clinical, biological and ultrasound assessments will be
      performed every 3 months.

      Patients will be then randomly assigned to one of the 3 groups: 1) &quot;Usual care group&quot;, 2)
      &quot;Clinical (DAS28)-ultrasound follow-up group&quot; (ultrasound-driven therapy) or 3)
      &quot;DAS28-ACR/EULAR remission criteria group&quot; (ACR/EULAR remission criteria-driven therapy),
      with a follow-up of 18 months.

      Therapeutic decisions are taken by the Referring Rheumatologist. He/she will have DAS28 + US
      results in the group US follow-up or DAS28 + ACR/EULAR remission criteria results in the
      group ACR/EULAR follow-up. Therapeutic recommendations (therapeutic options, according to
      the randomization group, a threshold of activity will be decided by a scientific committee
      for increasing, stop or change therapy) will be given according to the group of
      randomization and based on the level of inflammation. The Referring Rheumatologist, will be
      free to follow or not the therapeutic advices.

      In &quot;Usual care&quot; group, DAS28 and PDUS assessment will be performed at each time point,
      however, no suggestion neither DAS28 nor PDUS results will be given to the Referring
      Rheumatologist. The Referring Rheumatologist will be free to manage the patient as he/she
      thinks more appropriate.

      Conventional radiography (hand and feet) will be performed at baseline and at M18 follow-up.

      Centralized evaluation of radiographs will be performed by 2 independent readers, using SvH
      score. Radiographic progression will be defined by a change of SvH score between baseline
      and M18 &gt;0.

      PDUS examination will be performed every 3 months by an independent Physician in each
      centre, blinded to clinical, biological and radiographic data. Shoulders, elbows, wrists,
      MCP 1 to 5, PIP 1 to 5, knees, ankles (tibia-talar) and MTP 1 to 5 will be examined in B
      mode and in Power Doppler mode.

      Each joint will be scored for synovitis according to the OMERACT definition and to the
      OMERACT scoring system (semi-quantitative score from 0 to 3 for grey scale, PD and for
      combined score).

      Questionnaire (RAPID and HAQ) scores will be also evaluated every 3 months in each group.

    <description>The DAS28 (Disease Activity Score for Rheumatoid Arthritis) score is calculated on the basis of swollen joint count (SJC) and tender joint count (TJC) out of 28 (shoulder, elbow, wrist, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) I-V, proximal interphalangeal (PIP) I-V, and knee) as follows:
DAS28-CRP= 0.56 x √TJC + 0.28 x √SJC + 0.36 x Ln (CRP + 1) + 0.014 x GA + 0.96
As a result, the DAS28 index gives a value between 0 and 10, with:
&gt;5.1 indicating high disease activity
3.2-5.1 indicating moderate disease activity
&lt;3.2 indicating low disease activity
