Measurements of body sway were made in the sagittal (forward/backward) planes by positioning of the subject relative to the apparatus, with a string attached to the waist. The contribution of vision to postural control was eliminated by asking subjects to close their eyes. Subjects were instructed to wear the same pair of comfortable, low-heeled shoes in each session. Before starting a measurement, subjects were asked to stand still and comfortable, with their feet approximately 10 cm apart and their hands in a relaxed position alongside the body. Measurements were taken at 20 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, and 10 hours post-dose.",
