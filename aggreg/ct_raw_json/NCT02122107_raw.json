Thinking and memory abilities normally\n      decrease with age and the investigators want to see if the long-term effects of cancer\n      treatments may make these problems worse. The investigators will also look at how thinking\n      and memory abilities of older women are affected by genetics and smoking history. Genetics\n      and other factors may affect the brain's chemicals or structure, and may either protect\n      against the negative effects on thinking or make someone more at risk for them."
