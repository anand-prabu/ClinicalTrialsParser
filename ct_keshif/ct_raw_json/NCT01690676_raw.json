FMD and\n      endothelium-independent nitrate-mediated vasodilatation (NMD) of the left brachial artery\n      will be investigated with ultrasonography at the start and end of both treatment periods.\n      Biomarkers of vascular function and epicatechin (and metabolite) concentrations will be\n      determined from blood samples taken at the start and end of both treatment periods. Diet\n      diary data will be collected for the evaluation of the possible effects of diet on the study\n      results. Adverse events data will be collected throughout the study. Safety laboratory\n      determinations will be performed at the last visit of both treatment periods."
