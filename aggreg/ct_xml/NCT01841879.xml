  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are designing and testing the effectiveness of an integrated tobacco
      control and occupational health (OH) intervention aimed at promoting tobacco cessation among
      workers and supporting the adoption, implementation, and enforcement of tobacco control
      policies in 20 manufacturing worksites in the greater Mumbai region of India.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Through 6 health education events at the worksites, blue-collar workers (who face dual
      health risks through their exposures to occupational hazards and their high rates of tobacco
      use) will gain the knowledge, skills, and social support needed to quit tobacco use.

      Simultaneously, management will receive OH and tobacco policy consultations to help build a
      healthy and safe work environment, where workers' hazardous exposures are reduced.
