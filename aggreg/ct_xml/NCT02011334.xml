    <textblock>
      This multi-center, open-label, single-arm, Phase IIIb study will evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of subcutaneous RoActemra/Actemra alone or in combination with non-biologic disease
      modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in rheumatoid arthritis patients in Latin America
      with an inadequate response to non-biologic DMARDs.
