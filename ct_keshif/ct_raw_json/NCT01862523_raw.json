            "textblock": "As an essential step towards the improvement of the treatment of IR we will investigate the\n      neural mechanisms underlying the therapeutic action of capsaicin. In particular, we plan to\n      evaluate the effects of capsaicin on the functional properties of the innervation of nasal\n      mucosa by monitoring the trigeminal nerve activity using measurements of negative mucosa\n      potentials (NMP). NMPs, will be evoked by chemical and thermal stimuli in IR patients and\n      healthy controls. Considering the evidence suggesting a role of sensory C-fibers in the\n      pathophysiology of IR, we will employ low concentrations of irritants that specifically\n      activate receptors expressed in those fibers, i.e., capsaicin for TRPV1 and cinnamaldehyde\n      and allyl-isothiocyanate (mustard oil) for TRPA1. The same stimulations will be performed\n      immediately after capsaicin treatment, and after 4 weeks, 3 months and 6 months. This will\n      allow for an objective assessment of the functionality of the C-fiber innervation before the\n      treatment, during the phase of therapeutic response and during the period of recurrence of\n      the IR symptoms. The results of the NMP measurements will be contrasted with the therapeutic\n      response and with evaluations of nasal congestion, nasal sensitivity and the presence of\n      neuro-mediators found in nasal biopsies. Importantly, the independent assessment of the NMP\n      responses mediated by either TRPV1 or TRPA1 will allow determining the specific role of\n      these nociceptors in the pathophysiology of IR, which, in turn, may help to design more\n      specific and effective therapies."
