Participants will be given a\n      dose of an approved head and neck cancer drug (Cetuximab) along with an investigational\n      study drug called Cetuximab-IRDye800. Cetuximab-IRDye800 is a drug that is given prior to\n      surgery that attaches to cancer cells and appears to make them visible to the doctor when he\n      uses a special camera during the operation.  The investigators are evaluating whether or not\n      the use of the study drug along with the special camera will better identify the cancer\n      while patients are in the operating room."
