            "textblock": "Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by loss of myelin and\n      axonal damage, having typical contrast-enhanced MRI foci as an imaging counterpart. MS shows\n      three main patterns of clinical course: relapsing/remitting, primary progressive and\n      secondary progressive.Concerning disease pattern, secondary progressive is the standard\n      indication, to avoid overtreatment in relapsing/remitting patients or ineffectual treatment\n      in primary relapsing patients.\n\n      Currently, MS is the most common autoimmune disease that have been treated with autologous\n      HPC transplants (Fagius et al, 2009; Burt et al, 2009; Saccardi et al, 2006). More than 350\n      consecutive cases have been reported by the EBMT over the last decade. Most patients who\n      underwent autologous HPC transplant for MS in the early studies had secondary progressive\n      MS, and relatively fewer had relapsing remitting disease, with a Kurtzke Expanded Disability\n      Status Scale (EDSS) of 3.0-9.5 at the time of transplant. Significant objective and\n      subjective improvements have been reported in up to 70% of these patients.\n\n      The following conditioning regimens will be used, with Alemtuzumab, Fludarabine, and\n      Cyclophosphamide will be used for all patients. Prophylaxis of Acyclovir, Levaquin, and\n      Fluconazole will be given to prevent infections. The autologous HPC will be infused within\n      48-72 hours of completing the chemotherapy. The patients will receive additional supportive\n      care medications and treatments as necessary. Neutrophil engraftment will be defined as the\n      day on which the ANC rises to > 500 cells/ml for two consecutive days. Platelet engraftment\n      will be defined as the first day on which the platelet count rises to > 20,000/ml over a\n      7-day interval without transfusion support."
