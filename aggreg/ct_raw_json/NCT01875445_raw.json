Inositol is used for\n      diabetic nerve pain, panic disorder, high cholesterol, insomnia, cancer, depression,\n      schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism,\n      promoting hair growth, a skin disorder called psoriasis, and treating side effects of\n      medical treatment with some medications, including lithium. The hypothesis to be tested is\n      that Inositol will be effective and well tolerated in patients with trichotillomania\n      compared to placebo. The proposed study will provide needed data on the treatment of the\n      disabling disorder that currently lacks a clearly effective treatment."

            "textblock": "Pathological hair-pulling, trichotillomania, has been defined as repetitive, intentionally\n      performed pulling that causes noticeable hair loss and results in clinically significant\n      distress or functional impairment (1). Trichotillomania appears relatively common with an\n      estimated prevalence between 1-3% (2). Data on the pharmacological treatment of\n      trichotillomania is limited to case reports and conflicting double-blind studies of\n      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (3).\n\n      Inositol is used for diabetic nerve pain, panic disorder, high cholesterol, insomnia,\n      cancer, depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit-hyperactivity\n      disorder (ADHD), autism, promoting hair growth, a skin disorder called psoriasis, and\n      treating side effects of medical treatment with some medications, including lithium. A small\n      study (n=3) found that subject's showed improvement while taking Inositol in both\n      trichotillomania and pathological skin picking (4). This suggests that Inositol might be\n      effective in treating a large sample of subjects with trichotillomania and it also suggests\n      that it may be effective for impulse control disorders in general. Inositol has also been\n      shown to be effective in treating obsessive compulsive disorder  and showed significantly\n      lower scores on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (5). Both studies indicate the\n      effectiveness of Inositol in treating impulsivity and compulsivity in subjects. There is no\n      medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration for trichotillomania. Inositol\n      represents a potentially safe and effective treatment."
