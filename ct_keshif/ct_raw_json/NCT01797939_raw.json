Recent reporters suggest that\n      depressive disorders, anxiety, sleep dysfunction were related with the symptomatic responses\n      to a PPI treatments. Nevertheless, the predictive factors of response to PPI treatment still\n      remain controversial. Therefore, the aims of this study were to investigate the efficacy of\n      PPI therapy, and to evaluate the predictors of the PPI response in patients with symptomatic\n      GERD by using the questionnaire which consisted of GERD symptoms, GERD impact scale (GIS),\n      Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), Hospital anxiety and\n      depression scale (HADS), and WHO quality of life scale abbreviated version (WHOQOL-BREF)."
