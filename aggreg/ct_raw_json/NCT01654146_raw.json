Stage 1 will be conducted to confirm feasibility\n      and safety of protocol treatment in all patients and separately in the Delayed Primary\n      Surgery (DPS) patients.  The outcome measure for stage 2 will be 9-month progression-free\n      survival (PFS) rate.  The primary outcome measures for stage 3 will be PFS and overall\n      survival and secondary outcomes will be toxicity, Quality of Life and Health Economics.  If\n      pre-defined levels of deliverability, at stage 1, or activity, at stage 2, are not met then\n      the research arms will be reconsidered."
