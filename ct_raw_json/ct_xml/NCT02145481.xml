      The objective of the DeQCAD study is to measure the quality of the decision-making process
      for patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) who are making treatment decisions.
      In particular, this study is seeking to answer: a) How informed are patients about their
      treatment choices, b) are patients participating in the decision-making process as much as
      they would like to, and c) do the treatment decisions made match patients' preferences?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), having a stent (or percutaneous coronary
      intervention or PCI) involves both risk and inconvenience, and thus it represents a classic
      &quot;preference-sensitive&quot; situation, in which treatment decisions should be aligned with the
      patient's values and preferences.

      In this project the investigators will develop the first comprehensive, patient-reported
      measure of decisional quality for CAD that is feasible to implement in a variety of
      settings. The investigators will accomplish this by: 1) Identifying the key elements to
      capture decisional quality and identifying candidate questions to address these elements,
      using patient and expert feedback; 2) Pilot testing a preliminary instrument in a diverse
      patient population to assess measurement properties and select a reduced set of candidate
      questions for further testing; and 3) Establish the reliability and validity of a new
      comprehensive decisional quality measure for single and repeated examinations. This will
      result in a multidimensional decisional quality instrument for patients with CAD that will
      be ready for implementation into routine care.
