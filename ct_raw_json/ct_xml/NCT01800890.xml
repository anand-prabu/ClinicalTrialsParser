      The aim of the current clinical investigation is to evaluate the performance and safety of
      new 2-piece ostomy product concepts.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The new products have been developed to reduce the degree of leakage and other problems
      related to ostomy appliances in people with a stoma.
