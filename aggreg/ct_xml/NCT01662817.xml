  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of systematic screening for
      depression in high-risk patient participants in everyday clinical practice.  Systematic
      screening for depression in high-risk patients is recommended to be included as a usual
      practice but its effectiveness in this context remains controversial. In this study, 35
      primary care physicians (PCPs) in Spain were assigned to intervention (receive one day
      training in depression screening guidelines and use guidelines for six months) and 34 PCPs
      were assigned to a control group (manage depression in the usual way for six months).  There
      were a total of 525 patient participants with MDD.
