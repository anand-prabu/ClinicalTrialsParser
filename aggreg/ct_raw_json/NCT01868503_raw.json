To evaluate the feasibility of assessing breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) using flow\n      cytometry and single cell gene expression profiling (SCGEP).\n\n      II. To determine the change in the proportion of BCSCs after combined modality therapy.\n\n      III. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of lapatinib and radiotherapy.\n\n      IV. To assess the pathologic complete response rate (pCR) in those undergoing surgical\n      resection.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on day 1 until completion\n      of radiation therapy. Beginning on day 7, patients undergo radiation therapy for 5-7 weeks.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2-4 weeks and then at 6-12\n      weeks."
