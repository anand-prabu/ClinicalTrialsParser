            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Variations in the genes in some tumors play an important role in how a cancer grows and\n      develops. Looking at these variations and finding drugs that target them is one possible way\n      to treat cancer. However, researchers do not yet know if this way works better than standard\n      cancer treatments. Researchers are interested in studying people who have tumor gene\n      variations in different types of cancer cells. They want to see if these people benefit more\n      from being treated with a drug that specifically targets that variation than from being\n      treated with drugs that do not. To do so, they will look at the genes from people with\n      different sorts of cancers. Based on this analysis, they will offer treatments based on the\n      specific gene variations found on the tumor cells.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To see if choosing specific treatment options for tumor gene variations is more safe and\n      effective than standard cancer treatments.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced solid tumors that have not\n      responded to standard treatments.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  This study will try four different drugs or drug combinations for cancer treatment.\n           Some of these treatments target specific tumor gene variations, while others do not.\n           However, all drugs are intended to be used as possible cancer treatment options.\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine\n           samples will be collected. Imaging studies and heart and lung function tests will also\n           be performed.\n\n        -  Participants will provide a tumor tissue sample for study. This sample will be used to\n           determine possible tumor gene variations.\n\n        -  Participants will be divided into groups based on their tumor gene variation. Within\n           these groups, they will be further divided into two possible study arms. One arm will\n           receive a drug or drug combination designed to target the tumor gene variation. The\n           other arm will receive a drug or drug combination that is not designed to target the\n           variation.\n\n        -  Participants will receive their study drugs according to the standard dosing schedule\n           for their treatment. Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging\n           studies. If the cancer gets worse while a participant is on a study drug not designed\n           to work on the tumor   s gene variation, the study doctors may change the drug to one\n           thought to work on that variation.\n\n        -  Participants will have frequent follow-up visits to monitor the outcome of the\n           treatment. These visits may include additional tumor biopsies."

            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      -Targeted therapy based on identifying underlying genetic aberrations within the tumor is\n      the goal of personalized medicine. This pilot trial aims to establish whether advanced\n      cancer patients who have no treatment options with proven benefit, and with tumor\n      mutations/amplifications in one of 3 genetic pathways (DNA repair, PI3K, or RAS/RAF) are\n      more likely to derive clinical benefit if treated with agents targeting that pathway than if\n      treated with agents that do not. Each patient will be randomly assigned to receive the\n      recommended Phase II dose of either a study drug identified to work on their tumor   s\n      mutation/aberrant pathway, or an agent from the complementary set not identified to work on\n      the mutations/amplifications of interest.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      -Compare the response rate (CR+PR) and/or 4-month PFS for treatment with agents chosen based\n      on the presence of specific mutations/amplifications in patient tumors with the response\n      rate for treatment with agents randomly chosen from the complementary set of agents not\n      identified to work on the mutations/amplifications of interest.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n        -  Adult patients with histologically documented solid tumors whose disease has progressed\n           following at least one line of standard therapy and/or for which no standard treatment\n           is available that has been shown to improve survival.\n\n        -  Tumor amenable to percutaneous biopsy, and willingness to undergo tumor biopsy.\n\n      Study Design:\n\n        -  Patients enrolled on study will have a tumor biopsy sequenced in a CLIA-certified lab\n           for specific mutations/amplifications of interest: DNA repair pathways, PI3K pathway,\n           or RAS/RAF/MEK pathway. If such mutations are not detected, the patient will be taken\n           off study.\n\n             -  Patients with melanoma and known BRAF V600E mutations need to have received and\n                progressed on specific BRAF inhibitor therapy.\n\n             -  Patients with ovarian or breast cancer and BRCA mutations will not receive ABT-888\n                on study for the treatment of BRCA-positive tumors. They will only be eligible to\n                receive any of the study treatments if they have other mutations of interest.\n\n             -  Patients with NSCLC should have been previously tested for the presence of EGFR\n                and ALK mutations, and, if detected, should have received and progressed on EGFR\n                or ALK TKI therapy.\n\n        -  Patients in whom a mutation of interest is detected will be randomized 2:1 into Arms A\n           or B: Arm A will receive an agent prospectively identified to target that\n           mutation/pathway; Arm B will receive an agent from the complementary set (not\n           prospectively identified to target one of their mutations). Patients in Arm B will be\n           allowed to cross over at the time of disease progression to a treatment regimen based\n           on their mutational analysis.\n\n        -  Targeted drugs will be administered at recommended Phase II doses and schedules: (1)\n           ABT-888 (PARP inhibitor) with temozolomide for defects in the DNA repair pathway; (2)\n           MK-1775 (Wee1 inhibitor) plus carboplatin for defects in DNA repair pathway; (3)\n           Everolimus (mTOR inhibitor) for mutations in the PI3K pathway; or (4) Trametinib DMSO\n           (MEK inhibitor) for mutations in the RAS/RAF/MEK pathway.\n\n        -  Given the relative frequencies of the mutations, approximately 700 patients will need\n           to be enrolled to acquire 180 evaluable patients; the initial feasibility part of the\n           trial will be conducted in the first 60 evaluable patients, requiring enrollment of\n           100-150 patients."

Patients whose brain metastatic disease status has remained\n             stable for greater than 3 months and are off steroid treatment are eligible to\n             receive ABT-888; patients whose brain metastatic disease status has remained stable\n             for greater than or equal to 4 weeks following treatment of the brain metastases are\n             eligible for other study agents. Patients who have a history of seizures are not\n             eligible to receive ABT- 888, but patients who have either not had seizures or who\n             have been on stable doses of anti-seizure medicine and had no seizures for 1 month\n             will be eligible for other study agents. Enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants are\n             contraindicated.\n\n          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to\n             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study\n             requirements, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac\n             arrhythmia, myocardial infarction in the past 6 months, or left ventricular ejection\n             fraction (LVEF) less than or equal to the institutional lower limit of normal (by\n             ECHO or MUGA), invasive fungal infections, or active hepatitis B infection are not\n             eligible to participate. Testing for hepatitis B or other infections for eligibility\n             will be performed only if clinically indicated.\n\n          -  Patients with gastrointestinal conditions that might predispose for drug\n             intolerability or poor drug absorption (e.g., inability to take oral medication or a\n             requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption,\n             malabsorption syndrome, and active peptic ulcer disease) are excluded. Subjects with\n             ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or a partial or complete small bowel\n             obstruction are also excluded, as are any patients who cannot swallow tablets or\n             capsules whole.
