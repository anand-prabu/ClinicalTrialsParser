The Mirena\u00ae is an FDA approved intrauterine contraceptive device that\n      provides contraception for 5 years with excellent effectiveness. Women enrolled in this\n      study will only have the Mirena\u00ae placed. This is a randomized trial. The control group will\n      receive the standard of care and have the Mirena placed at 6-7 weeks postpartum in the\n      standard fashion. Six to seven weeks is the current standard of care at our institution. The\n      treatment group will have the Mirena placed at 2-3 weeks postpartum in the standard fashion.\n      For the new treatment group, we will be using the Mirena in an off-label manner.  However,\n      the main risk of placement in this off-label time period is increased expulsion, which is\n      when the device does not remain in the uterus"
