  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the use of the medication ondansetron (zofran) in the
      emergency department.  There are studies of the ability of ondansetron to cause a
      prolongation in the QT interval (a certain measurement on an EKG) in anesthesia and cancer
      patients, but not on emergency department patients.  This is an observational study where
      patients that are going to receive the anti-nausea medicine ondansetron in the emergency
      department will have an EKG performed every 2 minutes for 20 minutes to determine if the QT
      interval prolongs and returns to normal in that time period.  Any serious outcomes will be
      reported.  There is expected to be no adverse outcomes from this routinely used medication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous ondansetron is routinely used in adult emergency department patients
      experiencing nausea or vomiting.  The FDA has changed the drug label to warn of prolongation
      of the QT interval and required the manufacturer to perform additional studies.  There are
      rare case reports of cardiac electrical toxicity to include QT prolongation, atrial
      fibrillation, severe bradycardia, ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and
      the potential for Torsades de Pointes.  All of the reported literature on ondansetron comes
      from post-operative patients, patients receiving chemotherapy, and healthy volunteers, but
      has never been assessed in the emergency department population.  Adult emergency department
      patients that do not meet the exclusion criteria will be enrolled prior to receiving
      intravenous ondansetron.  Administration of ondansetron will be at the discretion of the
      attending physician.  A twelve-lead electrocardiogram (EKG) or 12-lead rhythm strip will be
      generated prior to drug administration, and every 2 minutes following drug administration
      for 20 minutes after administration.  During the entire 20 minutes the patient will be on a
      cardiac monitor and if any of the defined adverse cardiac electrical events occur (non-sinus
      rhythm, severe bradycardia, sudden cardiac death) the patient will be treated using standard
      Advanced Cardiac Life Support methods and admitted for continued monitoring.  The mean
      maximal QTc prolongation (as measured by the Bazett formula), as well as the rate of adverse
      cardiac events with 95% confidence intervals will be reported.

      The global objective of this study is to determine if routine use of intravenous ondansetron
      in the emergency department is associated with cardiac risks.  The primary objective is to
      determine the mean maximal prolongation in QTc interval from baseline as measured by the
      Bazett formula. The secondary objective is to determine the number of severe adverse cardiac
      electrical events (non-sinus rhythm, severe bradycardia, sudden cardiac death) associated
      with routine use of intravenous ondansetron in the adult emergency department patient.

    <description>The primary objective is to determine the mean maximal prolongation in QTc interval from baseline as measured by the Bazett formula.  A baseline EKG will be obtained and then after drug administration an EKG will be performed every 2 minutes until 20 minutes has passed.  The mean maximal QTc change will be calculated.</description>
