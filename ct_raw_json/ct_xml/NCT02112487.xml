        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed informed consent prior to any study-mandated procedure.

          2. Patients with PAH who completed the ORCHESTRA study (AC-055-310) as scheduled

          3. Women of childbearing potential (as defined below) must:

               -  Have a negative serum pregnancy test at Visit 1 (i.e., Visit 4 of study AC 055
                  310) and agree to perform monthly serum pregnancy tests.

               -  Agree to use two reliable methods of contraception in parallel, from Visit 1
                  until 1 month after study drug discontinuation (see details below).

                    -  A female is considered to have childbearing potential unless she meets at
                       least one of the following criteria:

                         -  Previous bilateral salpingo and/or oophorectomy, or hysterectomy.

                         -  Premature ovarian failure confirmed by a specialist.

                         -  Pre-pubescence, XY genotype, Turner syndrome, uterine agenesis.

                         -  Postmenopausal, defined as 12 consecutive months with no menses
                            without an alternative medical cause.

                    -  Of the two contraceptive methods that must be used, one must be from Group
                       1, and one must be from Group 2, defined as follows:

                         -  Group 1: Oral, implantable, transdermal or injectable hormonal
                            contraceptives, intrauterine devices, female sterilization (tubal
                            ligation or non-surgical sterilization, e.g., permanent contraception
                            with Essure procedure), or partner's sterilization (vasectomy). If a
                            hormonal contraceptive is chosen from this group, it must be taken for
                            at least one month prior to enrollment. Alternatively, if the Essure
                            procedure is chosen as a contraceptive method, a hysterosalpingogram
                            must have been performed to confirm correct location of the
                            microinserts and tubal occlusion (as per manufacturer's
                            recommendations).

                         -  Group 2: Female or male condoms, diaphragm or cervical cap, any of
                            them in combination with a spermicide.

                    -  Sexual abstinence, rhythm methods, or contraception by the partner alone
                       are not considered as acceptable methods of contraception for this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who prematurely discontinued study drug in study AC-055-310.

          2. Females who are lactating or pregnant (positive Visit 1 pregnancy test) or plan to
             become pregnant during the study.

          3. AST and/or ALT more than 3 X ULN.
