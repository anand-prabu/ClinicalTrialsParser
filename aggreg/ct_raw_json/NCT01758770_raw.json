In this study we utilize the large-scale population based epidemiology study (PURE)\n      population,spine and hip QCT and/or DXA will be obtained for the subject to investigate the\n      prevalence of osteoporosis and osteoarthritis in elderly Chinese population. We also study\n      the relation between bone mineral density with osteoporotic fracture and OA More than 3000\n      subjects selected from the PURE study participants in Beijing and other centers in China\n      will be recruited to this study. More precisely, the subjects are consisted of the females\n      over 55 years and males over 60 years old, along with the 20% randomly selected PURE\n      participants for blood sampling.\n\n      Beijing ji shui tan hospital will be the coordinate center for the whole study, Beijing shi\n      jing shan hospital, Beijing shun yi traditional medicine hospital and Taiyuan central\n      hospital of shanxi will participate, other centers may be added late.\n\n      Bone mineral density of spine and hip will be measured with QCT and/or DXA. Quantitative\n      computed tomography QCT pro (Mindways software, inc. USA) will be used for all QCT\n      measurement, the CT scanner will be the clinical CT scanner of the local participated\n      center.\n\n      Quality control and monitoring will be conducted by Beijing ji shui tan hospital, as well as\n      the centralised image interpretation.\n\n      Therefore, this study is designed to provide the current and reliable prevalence of\n      osteoporotic fracture, osteoporosis, OA in elderly Chinese population using QCT and/or DXA.\n      The performance of QCT and DXA in the diagnosis of osteoporosis , as well as the association\n      of body composition with osteoporosis will be assessed."
