Cidofovir is\n      an antiviral drug that acts against many types of herpesvirus, and may be an effective\n      treatment for Kaposi's sarcoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of cidofovir in treating patients with\n      Kaposi's sarcoma with or without HIV infection."

Assess the antitumor activity of intravenous cidofovir in patients with\n      Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) with and without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. II.\n      Assess the effect of intravenous cidofovir on the load of KS-associated herpesvirus/human\n      herpesvirus-8 in KS lesions and peripheral blood mononuclear cells by quantitative\n      polymerase chain reaction. III. Assess the toxicity of cidofovir in KS patients with and\n      without HIV infection. IV. Assess the effect of cidofovir on angiogenic cytokines related to\n      the pathogenesis of KS.\n\n      OUTLINE: All patients receive intravenous cidofovir weekly for 2 weeks, then every other\n      week for 6 months. Patients with a complete or partial response may continue treatment until\n      disease progression intervenes.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 25 evaluable patients will be entered over approximately 6 months\n      if there are at least 2 responses in the first 15 patients."
