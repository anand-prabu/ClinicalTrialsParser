To determine patterns of intervention utilization among parents/patients in different\n           arms of the intervention,\n\n        2. To measure the quality of the HPV vaccine decision among parents/patients in different\n           arms of the intervention, and\n\n        3. To determine if different arms of the intervention affect the likelihood of HPV\n           vaccination among patients.\n\n      The implementation of this educational intervention in clinic waiting rooms is intended to\n      assist primary care providers in communicating HPV vaccine awareness and education to\n      parents and patients in a culturally tailored format."

All\n      groups reported vaccine cost, access to insurance, and a general lack of awareness and/or\n      understanding of either HPV or the vaccine as barriers. All groups also wanted substantially\n      more \"general\" information about both HPV and the vaccine in order to make informed\n      vaccination decisions. The educational intervention was generally well received but there\n      were universal suggestions from all the groups to provide additional basic information about\n      HPV infection, to add information about the vaccine for boys/young men, and to modify the\n      color scheme and logo to make it more eye-catching and pleasing.\n\n      This next phase of the project will be comprised of real world testing of an iPad-based\n      educational intervention about HPV, \"Combatting HPV Infection and Cancer\" (CHICOS) that has\n      been revised and developed per focus group feedback to target the Hispanic population.\n\n      By providing information that patients and parents have clearly indicated they want in a way\n      that is culturally sensitive and meaningful and also individually personalized, the\n      investigators hope to improve both the HPV vaccination decision-making process and HPV\n      vaccination rates."
