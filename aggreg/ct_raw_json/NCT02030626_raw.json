Assessments will be performed before each treatment, then 1 hour\n      after the end of the third day session, then 2 days and 1 week after the stimulation.\n      Assessments will include pain questionnaires, quality of life, anxiety and depression,\n      catastrophizing and evaluation of treatment effect on experimental pain using Quantitative\n      sensory testing."
