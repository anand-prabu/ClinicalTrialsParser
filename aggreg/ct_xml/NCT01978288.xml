    <textblock>
      This study tests the hypothesis that an increase in pathogenic bacteria within the infant
      airway leads to increased airway inflammation, decreased airway function and ultimately
      airway obstruction throughout the first two years of life.

      With the prevalence of asthma increasing each decade, our focus has shifted from treatment
      to understanding the pathogenesis of asthma so we may develop methods of prevention. With
      the advent of new bacterial detection techniques, we have the opportunity to examine the
      infant microbiome (collection of genetic information from organisms that live on humans and
      pose no threat) prior to the development of wheezing and subsequent asthma. Based on our
      knowledge that certain bacteria are associated with recurrent wheezing, we believe that an
      increase in pathogenic bacteria alters the airway epithelium resulting in airway
      inflammation. This chronic inflammation leads to airway obstruction, resulting in recurrent
      wheezing. By prospectively following children over two years we have the opportunity to
      determine if changes seen in early infancy are established early and persist until 2 years
      of age. In addition, we propose to determine if the microbiome contributes to airway
      obstruction and episodes of wheezing with respiratory illness. This study tests the
      hypothesis that an increase in pathogenic bacteria within the infant airway leads to
      increased airway inflammation, decreased airway function and ultimately airway obstruction
      throughout the first two years of life.

      Once enrolled, study procedures will consist of 3 nasal swabs collected at enrollment, 4-6
      months, and 22-24 months; spirometry will be performed through infant pulmonary function
      tests at 4-6 months and repeated at 22-24 months of age; and finally surveys completed every
      three months starting after the 4-6 month time point and ending before the 22-24 month time
      point.
