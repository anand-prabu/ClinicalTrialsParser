  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess if proactive, 2 times-weekly application of tacrolimus ointment can extend
      remission time to relapse and reduce the incidence of disease exacerbation (DE) in
      paediatric patients over a period of 6 months.

      This study includes three periods.  First a screening period of up to one week.  Second an
      open-label treatment period of up to six weeks where all participants apply tacrolimus
      ointment. Third an open-label disease control period of up to six months where half of the
      participants apply tacrolimus ointment and the other half of the participants do not apply
      treatment.
