        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy non-smoking male and female volunteers, 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Male volunteers and their partners of childbearing potential must use two adequate
             methods of contraception. Female volunteers who are not either surgically sterile or
             postmenopausal must commit to use two adequate methods of contraception throughout

          -  Any condition or disease detected during the medical interview / physical examination
             that would render the volunteer unsuitable for the study, place the volunteer at
             undue risk or interfere with the ability of the volunteer to complete the study in
             the opinion of the Investigator

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory test results

          -  Confirmed resting pulse rate greater than 90 or less than 40 beats per minute (bpm)
             at screening

          -  Confirmed systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than 140 or less than 90 mm Hg, and
             diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than 90 or less than 50 mm Hg at screening

          -  Any major illness within the 4 weeks prior to dosing or any acute disease state
             within 7 days of study start

          -  Any confirmed allergic reaction against any drug or multiple allergies
