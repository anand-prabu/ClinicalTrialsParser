            "textblock": "RATIONALE: Lenalidomide and bortezomib may stop the growth of multiple myeloma by blocking\n      blood flow to the tumor. Also, bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking\n      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as elotuzumab, can\n      block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and\n      spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to\n      them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as lenalidomide and dexamethasone also work in\n      different ways to kill tumor cells or stop them from growing. Giving elotuzumab together\n      with chemotherapy may be a better way to block cancer growth.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of elotuzumab and\n      to see how well it works when given with lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone in\n      treating patients with multiple myeloma."
