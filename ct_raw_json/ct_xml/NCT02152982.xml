    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II/III trial studies how well temozolomide and veliparib works and
      compares it to temozolomide alone in treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma
      multiforme. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work to stop the growth of
      tumor cells by killing the cells. Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether temozolomide is more
      effective with veliparib in treating glioblastoma multiforme.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Test whether the experimental combination of ABT-888 (veliparib) combined with TMZ
      (temozolomide), compared to the control of placebo combined with TMZ, significantly extends
      overall survival in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients with tumor
      O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter hypermethylation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Test whether the experimental treatment significantly extends progression-free survival.

      II. Test whether the experimental treatment improves objective tumor response. III. Test
      whether the experimental treatment is associated with significantly greater rates of grade 3
      or higher adverse events.

      IV. Evaluate the effect of the experimental treatment on overall survival, progression-free
      survival, and objective tumor response for the subset of patients that have confirmed MGMT
      promoter hypermethylation as determined by the central laboratory.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the utility of dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) and diffusion weighted
      imaging (DWI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques in defining time to progression in
      the setting of a large multi-institutional clinical trial.

      II. Test the concordance between site-determined MGMT methylation status and central
      laboratory determination of MGMT status.

      III. Evaluate whether genetic or epigenetic alterations in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
      repair or replication genes are associated with overall survival, progression-free survival,
      and objective tumor response.

      IV. Test whether polymorphisms in MGMT, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), or other DNA
      repair proteins, are associated with overall survival, progression-free survival, objective
      tumor response, or rates of grade 3 or higher adverse events.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and veliparib
      PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive temozolomide as in Arm I and placebo PO BID on days 1-7. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years and
      then every 6 months for 2 years.
