The 5-ALA for recurrent\n      glioma study will correlate presence of fluorescence in tumor tissue with pathological\n      findings. This will be done using three cohorts in dose escalation.  The investigators'\n      hypothesis is that (for both low- and high-grade gliomas,) a lower dose of 5-ALA will result\n      in less false positive fluorescence."

To determine the impact of the dose of 5-ALA in improving volumetric extent of\n           resection in patients with recurrent high grade gliomas\n\n        2. To determine the impact of the dose of 5-ALA in improving overall survival of recurrent\n           high grade glioma patients\n\n        3. To determine the impact of the dose of 5-ALA in improving progression-free survival of\n           recurrent high grade glioma patients\n\n        4. To determine the impact of the dose of 5-ALA on the neurological morbidity of recurrent\n           high grade glioma patients.\n\n      Patients with presumed recurrent glioma will be entered into the trial. Those with recurrent\n      disease will receive study drug (5-ALA) in one of three dose-escalated cohorts (5 mg/kg; 10\n      mg/kg; 20 mg/kg).  Intraoperatively, patients will undergo resection with combined\n      fluorescence microscopy and confocal microscopy.  Resected tissue specimens corresponding to\n      the presence of fluorescence will be sent to pathology for examination. Postoperatively,\n      patients will have an MRI with and without contrast within 48 hours of surgery.  Subsequent\n      analysis of each patient will include assessment of the primary endpoint (volume of residual\n      disease) by volumetrically quantifying the tumor before and after surgery using T1-weighted\n      contrast-enhancement.  Similarly, volumetric extent of resection will also be measured."
