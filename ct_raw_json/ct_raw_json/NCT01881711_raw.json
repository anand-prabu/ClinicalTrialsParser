Parent/guardian or alert subject (age 18 or over) capable of giving consent; subject\n             less than 18 and of assent age must give assent to participate if appropriate and\n             required by the institution. If the subjects are incapable of giving assent, then\n             only parent/guardian consent is required.\n\n          3. Possess an unambiguously identifiable chronically indwelling ventricular shunt which\n             crosses the clavicle.\n\n          4. Suspicion of shunt obstruction is great enough to warrant the performance of any\n             diagnostic test for this condition\n\n          5. Will be available for follow-up for up to 7 days\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Inability or unwillingness of the parent/guardian or alert subject to give informed\n             consent/assent (when appropriate) as required by the Institutional Review Board.\n\n          2. Presence of multiple shunts or known non-functioning shunts crossing the clavicle.\n\n          3. Evaluating staff rule out shunt obstruction on the basis of a physical/clinical\n             examination.\n\n          4. SCMP test would interfere with emergent subject care or if the subject is scheduled\n             to go the OR in short order.\n\n          5. Presence of an interfering open wound or edema over the shunt.\n\n          6. Likelihood, in the judgment of the investigator, of the subject being lost to\n             follow-up as a result of subject unavailability or clinical outcome being\n             unobtainable.\n\n          7. Any other condition that would preclude or bias the results of the study according to\n             the judgment of the investigator.\n\n          8. Judgment of the investigator that participation in the study will interfere with, or\n             be detrimental to, administration of optimal health-care to the subject."
