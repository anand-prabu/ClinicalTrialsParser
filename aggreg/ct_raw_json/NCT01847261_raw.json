Protein consumption may be one opportunity to alleviate this\n      problem especially when consumed in appropriate amounts following resistance training.  This\n      study is designed to determine if a soy dairy protein blend, shown to be effective in\n      younger adults, will produce beneficial muscle protein synthesis in older healthy adults\n      following resistance exercise."
