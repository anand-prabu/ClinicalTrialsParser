Up to 12 patients will be treated at the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD).\n\n      The neratinib dose-escalation for the study will proceed on the basis of dose-limiting\n      toxicity (DLT) during cycle 1.  DLT will be defined as the occurrence of 1 or more of the\n      following events during cycle 1: any grade diarrhea that is associated with fever or\n      dehydration requiring IV fluids; grade 3 diarrhea lasting more than 2 days on optimal\n      medical therapy; grade 4 diarrhea of any duration; grade 3 or 4 neutropenia associated with\n      fever; grade 4 neutropenia lasting more than 7 days; grade 4 thrombocytopenia; grade 3 or 4\n      non-hematological toxicity (excluding grade 3 rash or allergic reaction/hypersensitivity);\n      or any toxicity-related delay of more than 2 weeks to initiate cycle 2.  Patients will be\n      enrolled at the next dose level when all evaluable patients at the same dose level have\n      completed the first treatment cycle.  Enrolled patients will remain on the assigned dose\n      level treatment until toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      The Phase II part of this study will proceed with a two-stage design with a maximum of 46\n      patients.  Between 6 and 12 patients at the Phase I MTD level will be included in the Phase\n      II, stage-one analysis.\n\n      Toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology\n      Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0.\n\n      Submission of tumor and blood samples for FC-7 correlative science studies will be a study\n      requirement for all patients.  A core biopsy procedure to procure fresh tumor samples from\n      an accessible site of metastasis will be performed before study dose level assignment (after\n      the patient has signed the consent form and has been screened for eligibility).\n\n      Optional biopsy samples of metastatic disease will be procured from consenting patients\n      after Cycle 1 of treatment and at the time of disease progression."
