However, the mutual interactions of different\n      inflammatory pathways and their relation to disease course have not been sufficiently\n      studied. This study therefore aims to explore the interaction of neuroinflammatory\n      mechanisms in patients with schizophrenia and to assess whether the inflammatory activity in\n      schizophrenia is state-dependent and occurs mainly during psychotic episodes."
