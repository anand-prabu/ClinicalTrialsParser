  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pathological and clinical studies have consistently demonstrated that abnormalities in
      thrombosis and hemostasis play a major role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and
      atherothrombosis.  Screening for abnormalities in thrombosis and hemostasis by measuring
      platelet activity, thrombin generation, and markers of coagulation have been proposed to
      identify individuals at high-risk for cardiovascular events, however, it remains a research
      tool not ready for implementation in standard care.

      The proposed study will add to the growing understanding of platelet activity and markers of
      coagulation in cardiovascular disease; examine a comprehensive battery of platelet activity
      markers, thrombin generation, markers of coagulation, and inflammatory biomarkers in
      subjects undergoing vascular surgery; and will provide important data on the mechanism of
      increased platelet activity using micro RNA, RNA and DNA expression profiling.  The study
      design is prospective and the main outcome measures are platelet activity, coagulation
      markers and incident cardiovascular and bleeding events.

  <detailed_description>

      The main aim is to determine whether preoperative platelet activity measurements are
      independently associated with short-term cardiovascular events in PAD patients undergoing
      open non-emergent lower extremity vascular surgery. We will characterize the platelet
      phenotype in 350 PAD patients before vascular surgery and use Cox proportional hazard models
      to determine the independent association of the platelet phenotype with risk of
      cardiovascular events in the first 30 days after surgery. The next aim is to determine
      whether platelet activity measurements are independently associated with long-term
      cardiovascular events in patients with established PAD. We will characterize the platelet
      phenotype following surgery and use Cox proportional hazards models to determine the
      independent association of the platelet phenotype with risk of long-term composite of
      myocardial infarction, stroke, or all-cause mortality with a mean follow-up of 2-years
      following vascular surgery.  The final goal is to investigate mRNA-microRNA co-expression
      profiles in patients with and without elevated platelet activity measurements. We will
      establish the relationship between differentially expressed microRNAs and their target mRNAs
      related to platelet activity and identify new diagnostic markers and potential therapeutic
      targets of increased platelet activity.

      Blood collection at three different time points (before surgery, following surgery while
      still in the hospital, and at the subjects' first return visit to the vascular surgeon
      following surgery) will allow us to assess the dynamic change in platelet activity,
      coagulation and inflammation during the perioperative period.  We believe that markers of
      clotting and bleeding will change during the course of surgery, and that some of these
      markers may be used to help predict the likelihood of developing a clotting or bleeding
      event following surgery.  The long-term goal is to develop a clinically useful assessment of
      platelet activity, thrombin generation, coagulation and inflammation for risk stratification
      that may ultimately serve as a target for therapeutic intervention.

      Blood will be obtained from the patient using standard aseptic phlebotomy techniques at 3
      time points throughout the study. This will be pre-operatively, at post-op day 2 and at the
      30-day follow up. A urine specimen will be collected  as well.
