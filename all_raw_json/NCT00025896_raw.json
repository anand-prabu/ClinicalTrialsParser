            "textblock": "Pompe disease is caused by a deficiency of a critical enzyme in the body called acid alpha\n      glucosidase (GAA).  Normally, GAA is used by the body's cells to break down glycogen (a\n      stored form of sugar) within specialized structures called lysosomes.  In infants with\n      severe cases of Pompe disease (called Classical Infantile Pompe disease), an excessive\n      amount of glycogen accumulates and is stored in various tissues, especially heart, skeletal\n      muscle, and liver, which prevents their normal function.  This study being conducted to\n      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA) as\n      a potential enzyme replacement therapy for Pompe disease.  Patients diagnosed with Classical\n      Infantile Pompe disease  who have a small, but inactive, amount of natural GAA enzyme\n      present in their bodies (called Cross-Reacting Immunologic Material-Positive or \"CRIM (+)\"\n      patients), will be studied."
