Taken together analysis\n      of these biomarkers in relation to clinical course and in relation to healthy subjects will\n      inform us about biological mechanisms contributing to illness onset, effects of\n      antipsychotic medication on these mechanisms, and the predictive value of the biomarkers for\n      clinical course. This information will provide the foundation for future early intervention\n      trials targeting biological mechanisms utilizing a personalized medicine approach.\n\n      The baseline visit for 20 schizophrenic patients and 20 healthy age and gender matched\n      controls consists of structural and functional  MRI in addition to a blood draw for\n      biomarkers including BDNF, inflammation markers, DNA, oxidative stress, and folate status\n      and additionally a salivary cortisol sample collection.  Biomarkers and imaging will be\n      repeated after 8 weeks of antipsychotic treatment in patients."
