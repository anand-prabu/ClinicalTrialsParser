Also, recent study show that\n      chronic disease such as end stage renal disease with depressive symptoms have decreased\n      cerebral glucose metabolism in several brain areas in F-18-FDG PET/CT. So this protocol was\n      designed to evaluate usefulness of PET/CT to detect systemic inflammation and abnormality of\n      cerebral glucose metabolism and association with metabolic syndrome/major depressive\n      symptoms in patients with psoriasis."
