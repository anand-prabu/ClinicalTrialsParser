    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate the scheduled use of intravenous (IV) acetaminophen
      among cesarean section patients. The study hopes to find out if patients who receive
      scheduled IV acetaminophen for 48 hours following delivery have lower self-reported pain
      scores and use less narcotic pain medication than patients who do not receive IV
      acetaminophen.
