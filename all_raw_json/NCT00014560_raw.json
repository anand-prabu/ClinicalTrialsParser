Treatment repeats weekly for a total of 3 courses in the absence of\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BsAb 4G7xH22 until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed weekly for 4 weeks, monthly for 3 months, and then periodically for 1\n      year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18 patients will be accrued for this study."
