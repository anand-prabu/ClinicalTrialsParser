Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 4 courses.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of IL-2 until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 3 of 6 patients experience\n      dose-limiting toxicity. Six additional patients receive IL-2 at 1 dose level preceding the\n      MTD.\n\n      Patients are followed at least 3 times during year 1 and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
