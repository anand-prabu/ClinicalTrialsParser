  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through a patient participation aid (PPA) the investigators hope to improve the psychosocial
      well-being of women diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer by empowering them to be active
      participants in clinical encounters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The team has developed a brief Patient Participation Aid (PPA) to promote patient health
      literacy and encourage women to be active in the decisions that are being made about their
      healthcare which will lead to their satisfaction with healthcare and improves their
      psychosocial well-being. The paper-based PPA uses adult learning principles to limit and
      sequence plain language messages that have been framed from a patient's perspective. The PPA
      uses theory-based design to increase patients' involvement in the medical visit by modeling
      - through text and images - how a patient can: 1) set the visit agenda, 2) formulate
      questions, and 3) assert personal preferences. The specific aims of this study are to: 1-
      Assess the effectiveness of the PPA to increase patient involvement during clinical
      encounters. 2- Evaluate the effectiveness of the PPA to improve patient psychosocial
      outcomes. 3- Explore if the effect of the PPA varies by patients' literacy skills. To
      achieve this aims, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate
      the PPA among patients with a new diagnosis or progression of metastatic breast cancer at
      two cancer centers that serve diverse patient populations.

    <description>Participants will begin with a pre-visit structured interview to determine emotional and physical well-being, anxiety, depression, and self-efficacy. Then they will be helped through the Patient-Participation Aid (PPA) by the research assistant (RA). Then they will meet with their doctor while the visit is video-recorded. After they will complete a post-visit interview to see if there were any health decisions made, patients level of involvement, and doctor communication. Follow up phone interviews will be conducted at 1 week and 3 months to assess patients self-reported changes in well-being, anxiety, depression, and decision regret.</description>

    <description>The PPA consists of a folder that addresses the three behaviors we hope to influence: agenda setting, asking questions, and making preferences known. The information inside contains sample questions for each section, with room for the patient to write her own questions.  Each section models behavior by giving context for the items and specific example questions.  It also addresses barriers to understanding by indicating that it is acceptable to ask questions when something is not clear or terms are unfamiliar.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  female patients with metastatic breast cancer seeing one of the study physicians at
             one of the identified study clinics

          -  age 21 or older

          -  having suspected progression of metastatic disease

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with an uncorrectable hearing impairment or having limited English
             proficiency, as this would adversely affect their ability to communicate with the

             the patient to read the intervention
