  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Law enforcement officials (LEOs) demonstrate an elevated risk for occupational injury.  The
      effectiveness of exercise-based work injury prevention programs (WIPPs) to reduce the risk
      and costs associated with occupational injury has yet to be tested rigorously in LEOs.  The
      accuracy of existing field tests of physical functioning to predict occupational injuries
      and related expenses remains unclear.  The objectives of this study are to: (i) determine
      the effect of an exercise-based WIPP on occupational wellness and productivity in a cohort
      of LEOs, and (ii) to determine the accuracy of 2 common field assessments of physical
      function to predict lost work productivity and related expenses in a cohort of LEOs.

    <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) Questionnaire was developed to measure the personal and economic effects of lost workplace productivity in the context of clinical trials. In this study, the WPAI-General Health (GH) version will be used in order to assess lost productivity and wellness during the study period.  The WPAI-GH is a 6-item scale that solicits the number of hours missed from work and level of functional impairment perceived at work during the previous week.  Four scores are calculated from the WPAI-GH, including percentage of work time missed due to health, percentage impairment while working due to health, percentage activity impairment due to health, an overall percentage work impairment. Time series data will be collected to observe trends over time that may relate to independent variables in this study, as well as to examine for previously unknown and uncontrolled variation (ie, seasonal variability).</description>

    <measure>Functional Movement Screen</measure>
    <time_frame>One time, at 3 months following enrollment into the study</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The purpose of the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) is to provide the clinician with a rapid triage for potentially problematic regions that can contribute to symptoms, disablement, or injury.  As a triage tool, FMS is used to determine regions that require additional clinical investigation.  The FMS is a battery of 7 tests that are intended as an integrated assessment for limitations in range of motion, weakness, and incoordination.  FMS tests consider spine, upper extremity, and lower extremity movements in the context of their respective regional kinetic chain.  Component tests of the FMS involve rating of performance by a standardized examiner on a 3-point scale, and specific criteria exist for each rating.  A composite score for the FMS may be calculated by summing the item scores.</description>

    <time_frame>One time, at 3 months following enrollment into the study</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Star Excursion Balance Test is a clinical test of dynamic balance.  Subjects will assume unilateral stance in the center of a grid marked circumferentially in 45-degree increments.   After a learning trial consisting of 6 repetitions in each of the 8 test directions, subjects will complete 3 repetitions of single limb squat reach.  The evaluating therapist will record the distance achieved between the stance toe and heel of the reaching extremity in each of 3 repetitions in each direction.</description>
