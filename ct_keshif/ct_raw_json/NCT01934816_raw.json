Previous animal work and initial human studies suggest that incretins\n      may be cardioprotective and act as vasodilators through opening of KATP channels.\n\n      Initial evidence suggests that beneficial vascular effects of incretin modifying agents may\n      be nullified by the co-current treatment of the sulfonylurea (SU) drug glibenclamide. The\n      investigators hypothesis is that the GLP-1 and SUs may have conflicting effects on the KATP\n      channels and thus vascular function.\n\n      Interestingly the vascular actions of GLP-1 were not modified by a different treatment SUs\n      called glimepiride, thereby raising the possibility that SUs differentially modulating the\n      vascular actions of GLP-1 though this remains controversial."
