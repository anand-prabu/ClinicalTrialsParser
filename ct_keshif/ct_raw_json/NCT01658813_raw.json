Monthly bolus 5-FU + interferon-alfa-2b has not undergone formal\n      phase II testing.  In a small pilot study, a 5 consecutive day schedule of 5-FU and\n      interferon-alfa-2b resulted in the limiting toxicities of diarrhea and mucositis. A more\n      limited schedule was recommended.  Therefore, it is reasonable to examine such a schedule.\n      In the current study, 5-FU will be followed by interferon-alfa-2b daily for 3 days to\n      attempt to benefit from both the biochemical and immunologic mechanisms described above."
