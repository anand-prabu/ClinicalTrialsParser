If nasal intubation is not indicated or preferred, then oral intubation is usually\n      performed.\n\n      This study is looking to explore whether or not the nasal route significantly improves the\n      ease and time for successful fiberoptic intubation compared to the oral route in children\n      less than or equal to 2 years of age. This study will also examine if operator experience\n      influence time to tracheal intubation with either route?\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that the nasal route of fiberoptic intubation will be faster\n      than the oral route, for both the trainee and the expert, and that there will be minimal\n      differences between experts and trainees with nasal fiberoptic intubation."
