The primary\n      objective of this study is to examine factors that are related to sleep-disordered breathing\n      and upper airway patency in critically ill patients who have been recently mechanically\n      ventilated. Our primary hypothesize is that sedatives and neuromuscular blocking agents\n      given in the ICU prior to extubation and during the first night following extubation are\n      associated with sleep-disordered breathing. The secondary hypotheses are that duration of\n      mechanical ventilation, BMI, and muscle strength are associated with sleep-disordered\n      breathing during the night after extubation.\n\n      The secondary objective is to evaluate if sleep-disordered breathing in the ICU can be\n      predicted by standard pulmonary function testing in the ICU."
