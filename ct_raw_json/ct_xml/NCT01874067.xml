  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a collaborative study with 11 Occupational Therapy (OT) departments in  North-West
      England.   The OTs provide compression gloves to  25% of out-patients with inflammatory,
      rheumatoid and osteoarthritis.  The glove pressure aims to relieve hand pain, swelling and
      stiffness. People find they help but there is little research testing this. Of the five
      small studies published: two found little or no benefit; one found similar effects from
      compression and ordinary thermal gloves; two found some benefits. Testing if gloves work
      helps therapists and patients judge if they will help.

      This is a feasibility study to help us plan a future trial testing if compression gloves
      work for people with arthritis. We aim to find out:  the rate we can recruit people to the
      study; if   OTs can  assess people's hands and provide gloves as agreed; how many people do
      we need to take part in a trial; what do people think (if any) is the gloves' most important
      effect and how long should we test them for?     We will analyse the data to see what effect
      the gloves have.

      The study will last 12 months.  People will get compression gloves as part of their usual
      care.  The OTs have agreed a standard way of assessing and providing the gloves to ensure
      best practice across departments. The assessments include:  difficulties using hands, pain
      and stiffness levels, and measuring hand and finger joint size and movement. People can take
      part if they: have one of the three types of arthritis; are willing to  wear Isotoner
      three-quarter length gloves;  can attend the usual 4 week review appointment for
      re-assessment; will allow us to use their anonymized hand assessments. We will also
      interview some people about their views of the assessment and their treatment. Each patient
      will be involved for 4-8 weeks.
