Part A will ascertain whether the pharmacokinetic (PK) of\n      salbutamol delivered via the UD-DPI is comparable to the salbutamol delivered via the Diskus\n      or MDI. For this reason four treatment doses consisting of three dose strength and two\n      percentage blends will be assessed in Part A delivered via UD-DPI. Part A will also provide\n      preliminary PK variability estimates to allow for better sample size/precision calculations\n      for Part B. Part B will explore whether the UD-DPI has a pharmacokinetic exposure profile\n      that is comparable to either Diskus or MDI in the presence of the charcoal block."
