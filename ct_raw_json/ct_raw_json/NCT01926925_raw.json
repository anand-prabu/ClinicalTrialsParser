            "textblock": "Type 2 diabetes is now more frequent in children/adolescents, especially in those from\n      minority populations, including Hispanic Americans (HA). Diabetes and the pre-diabetes state\n      markedly increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Endothelial dysfunction is seen in the\n      earliest stages of atherogenesis, which ultimately leads to cardiovascular disease.  The\n      main aim of this study is to evaluate the endothelial function in HA children/adolescents\n      who are at risk for developing type 2 diabetes (obese children/adolescents from the Hispanic\n      population).\n\n      The investigators' hypothesis is that endothelial dysfunction is present in this population\n      and that it is associated with metabolic abnormalities linked to the insulin resistance\n      syndrome. The investigators will study 2 groups of 15 individuals each, age 10-18 years.\n      Group 1 will consist of obese (body mass index greater than 85th percentile for age and sex)\n      Hispanic American children/adolescents and group 2 will consist of healthy, non-overweight\n      (body mass index between the 25th and 50 th percentile for age and sex) Hispanic American\n      children/adolescents.\n\n      The study will be carried out at the Joslin Diabetes Center. During the first day,\n      participants will have a medical history and full physical examination, a standard OGTT and\n      measurement of blood cell count, plasma glucose, insulin, lipids, HbA1c, BUN, creatinine,\n      electrolytes, estradiol, testosterone, free fatty acids, CRP, endothelial markers, urinary\n      microalbumin and hCG, if appropriate. An OGTT will be performed in order to rule out IGT or\n      Diabetes. Estimations of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity will be assessed using\n      the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). In the second day, the body composition and the\n      brachial artery vasodilatory response to hyperemia will be assessed. Those found with\n      diabetes will be tested for GAD-65 and IA2.\n\n      The investigators' hypothesis is that Hispanic American children/adolescents at risk for\n      type 2 diabetes have impaired endothelial function and vascular reactivity that are\n      associated with the degree of insulin resistance and its metabolic abnormalities."
