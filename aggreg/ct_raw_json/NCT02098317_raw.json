Several studies suggest that inflammatory\n      pathways and oxidative stress could be responsible of disease progression.\n\n      The purpose of this interventional study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of\n      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and Vitamin D in children and adolescents with biopsy-proven\n      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)."
