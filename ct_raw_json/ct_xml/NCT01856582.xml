  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if infusing additional special donor cells will
      help to improve graft or immune function in previously transplanted children with immune
      deficiencies and bone marrow failures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the usefulness of infusing purified CD34+ cells
      of donor origin in order to augment graft function in response to declining chimerism after
      initially performing an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for children
      with primary immunodeficiency diseases. This protocol will be utilized for patients with
      waning mixed donor chimerism that is inadequate for correction of clinical condition or
      disease for which stem cell transplant was performed, or for augmentation of immune
      function.  An infusion of selected CD34+ stem cells will be given without any preparative
      regimen.  As the children eligible for this protocol have reduced immune function and
      pre-existing donor chimerism, we hypothesize that stem cells will be able to engraft and the
      infusion will augment graft function.  This therapy serves as an alternative to a second
      stem cell transplant that is known to be associated with significant morbidity and
      mortality.  CD34+ stem cells will be collected from the donor used for initial stem cell
      transplant.  Cells will be T-cell depleted (TCD) by performing a CD34 selection using the
      CliniMACS device (Miltenyi Biotec)  in order to prevent development of new or exacerbation
      of existing graft versus host disease (GVHD), as avoidance of GVHD in nonmalignant diseases
      is desirable.  There is sufficient data showing that mixed donor chimerism is adequate for
      reverting disease phenotype in certain primary immunodeficiencies.  Observations from Europe
      and CCHMC show that donor chimerism might be boosted by CD34+ stem cell infusion alone
      without any specific preparative regimen.  This therapy is likely to be associated with low
      toxicity due to the absence of a preparative regimen and lack of exposure to fresh donor
      cells capable of initiating GVHD, and offers potential significant benefit.

    <description>Graft function will be measured in two ways.  Firstly the percentage of donor chimerism, and secondly measured improvement in immune function; improvement in numbers of circulating white blood cells and/or platelets, and/or clearance of opportunistic viral infections.
Improvement in immune function studies compared to baseline levels.
In the case of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, improvement of platelet count to &gt;20,000/L.
Clinical response to infection, if applicable.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be eligible for this protocol, patients must have the following:

          1. Primary immunodeficiency (e.g. SCID, Wiskott-Aldrich and/or other more rare
             conditions and other bone marrow failure syndromes) with prior allogeneic stem cell
             transplant.

          2. Waning donor chimerism or immune function that is inadequate to correct their disease
             or clinical condition, for which primary transplant was given, as determined by their
             attending physician.

          3. Available primary donor.

          4. Must not have other organ dysfunction deemed by the attending physician to preclude
             this procedure.

          5. Age &lt; 30 years at time of transplant

          6. One of the following must be true:

               -  Patients must have evidence of persistent or recurrent immunodeficiency or
                  thrombocytopenia.

        -OR-

        • Primary immunodeficiency disease with known potential to progress to malignant condition
        if untreated.

        -OR-

        • Debilitating secondary disease known to be a consequence of inadequate immune response
        to known agent or pathogen, uncontrollable by other available medical therapies (e.g.
        third patient described on page 5).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Absence of an available original donor

          2. Failure to sign consent form, or inability to undergo informed consent       process

          3. Pregnant or lactating female

          4. Uncontrolled GVHD
