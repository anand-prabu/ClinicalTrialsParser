  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Leg ulcers are a serious and debilitating complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). This
      pilot study will explore factors, namely microbial, genomic, and environmental (social and
      physical), that may influence the onset and progression of leg ulcer formation and delayed
      healing in individuals living with SCD. There is variation in the incidence and duration of
      SCD leg ulcers. They are often very painful, resistant to treatment, and recurrent in
      nature. The etiology of SCDassociated leg ulcers is unclear, and we hypothesize that
      predisposition to developing leg ulcers is multifactorial. This pilot study is an
      exploratory study of the microbiome and environment of individuals living with sickle cell
      disease leg ulcers. The study   s objective is to identify triggers that may be integral in
      leg ulcer onset and progression. The central goal of this study is to obtain an improved
      understanding of the participants    leg ulcer microbiome and the psychosocial and
      environmental factors that may increase one   s likelihood of developing this complication.
      To achieve these goals, we will characterize the leg skin microbiome of SCD patients living
      with and without leg ulcers within the United States. In addition to assessing the
      microbiome, we will collect social and physical environmental data to assess quality of life
      indicators of individuals with SCD without leg ulcers and with leg ulcers.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Each subject must meet all of the following inclusion criteria during the screening
        process in order to participate in the study:

          -  All subjects must have a diagnosis of sickle cell disease (HbSS, HgSC, HbSB 0 or
             HBSB+)

          -  Be at least 18 years old.

          -  Provide written informed consent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Any subject that meets any of the following criteria during baseline evaluation will be
        excluded from the study:

          -  Pediatric population (&lt; 18 years old)

          -  Participants for microbiome study (only) who have received oral and/or topical
             antibiotics or antifungals &lt;  2 weeks prior to enrolling in the study for leg ulcers
             (for those with leg ulcers only)

          -  Subjects presenting with clinically diagnosed bacterial infection (i.e. clinical
             appearance, clinical judgment, fever, redness around ulcer, purulent drainage etc.)
             at the site of ulceration.
