    <textblock>
      Sustainable Methods, Algorithms, and Research Tools for Delivering Optimal Care Study (SMART
      DOCS) will develop and evaluate a new approach (patient-centered outcomes and
      coordinated-care management [PCCM]) for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders.
      Specialized and pertinent information and resources regarding sleep disorder management will
      be developed and made available through an online portal, allowing patients to make informed
      health care decisions, and providers to assist patients in achieving what they feel are the
      most important goals regarding their care. Half of participants will be randomized into the
      conventional diagnosis and treatment (CONV) arm and the other half into the patient-centered
      outcomes and coordinated-care management (PCCM) arm. Validated objective and subjective
      assessment measures will be administered at intervals throughout a 13 month participation
      period in both the CONV and PCCM arms to determine whether the new PCCM approach for sleep
      medicine results in increased patient satisfaction, quality of care, and improved health
      outcomes. Qualifying participant will be 18 years of age or older, presenting with a new
      sleep disorder. Patients will be enrolled for 13 months and will receive no monetary
      compensation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SMART DOCS is a randomized comparative clinical trial designed to evaluate a new approach of
      outpatient medical care.  In current sleep medicine practice, a consultation lasting one
      hour or less is allotted for the assessment, diagnosis, planning, and implementation of
      sleep disorders among patients and their health care provider. Patients are expected to
      convey their complex medical history and relevant symptoms, while clinicians must
      effectively and appropriately diagnose and create a treatment plan in this given period of
      time.

      New technology for home-based diagnostic testing and electronic access to diagnostic results
      and outcomes provides functional advantages to the delivery of healthcare in an outpatient
      setting. The proposed project challenges and seeks to compare the traditional diagnostic and
      treatment medical outpatient approach to a patient-centered outcomes and coordinated-care
      management (PCCM) approach for sleep medicine. New or refined methods, algorithms, and tools
      are expected to improve clinical practice and the patient's experience of care. The specific
      aim of this study is to determine whether a new patient-centered outcomes and
      coordinated-care management (PCCM) approach for sleep medicine provides better care and
      improves the health of patients compared to a conventional diagnostic/treatment outpatient
      medical care (CONV) approach.

      Patients will be randomized to one of two arms; Conventional Diagnostic/Treatment Outpatient
      Medical Care (CONV) and Patient-Centered Outcomes and Coordinated-Care Management (PCCM).
      Randomization will be conducted using a permuted block design. Each new patient
      consecutively seen at the Stanford Sleep Medicine Center and each patient seen at Stanford
      Primary Care who is suspected of having a new sleep disorder will be informed about the
      study. The patient will be notified that the study is a randomized trial and he or she could
      be assigned to either the CONV or PCCM arms. The patient will also be apprised that he or
      she will be consenting to grant access all clinical data collected during his or her
      evaluation and treatment. If the patient agrees to participate, informed consent will be
      obtained. He or she is then randomized to one of the study arms in order to diagnose and
      treat his or her sleep disorder.
