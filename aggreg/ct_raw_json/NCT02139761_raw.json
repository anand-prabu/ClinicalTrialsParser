            "textblock": "Cocaine continues to be one of the most widely used substances of abuse around the world. In\n      the US, an estimated 1.4 million individuals (0.5%) > 12 years were current (past month)\n      cocaine users in 2011. Currently, no FDA-approved pharmacologic treatments are available for\n      cocaine addiction; thus, this remains a serious public health problem without an effective\n      pharmacological treatment. A promising lead towards an effective treatment comes from a\n      recent finding that pretreatment with oral l-tetrahydropalmitine (l-THP) in rats attenuated\n      the cocaine seeking associated with a cocaine challenge, while having no motor effects. This\n      finding stimulated our group to test the pharmacokinetics and safety of l-THP in a phase I\n      study of people with cocaine use. Preliminary findings show l-THP is safe and well tolerated\n      in cocaine users, with no adverse interactions with cocaine.\n\n      This study will test the efficacy and safety of l-THP for abstinence in those with cocaine\n      addiction in a phase II pilot study (N=24). Secondarily, we will examine the effects of\n      these medications on craving."
