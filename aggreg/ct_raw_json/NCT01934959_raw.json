Probiotics are live microbes\n      that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer health benefit to the host.Based on this\n      previous knowledge on the beneficial effects of probiotics during pro-inflammatory\n      conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, investigators hypothesized that oral probiotics\n      could decrease the incidence and severity of Hirschsprung's disease associated\n      enterocolitis(HAEC).Investigators conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized and\n      controlled trial to assess whether oral probiotics could decrease the incidence and severity\n      of Hirschsprung's disease associated enterocolitis(HAEC)."
