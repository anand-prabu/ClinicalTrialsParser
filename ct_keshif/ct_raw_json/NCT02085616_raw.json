Our hypothesis was that the effectiveness is about 5% higher in proactive than in\n      reactive service.\n\n      The structured treatment protocol is a mixture of motivational interviewing (MI), cognitive\n      behavior therapy, and pharmacological consultation.The standard process at the SNTQ is to\n      offer the client a choice of callback (proactive service) or no callback (reactive service).\n      In the present study clients were not offered a choice, but were randomized to proactive\n      service on even dates and to reactive service on odd dates. Data are collected through\n      postal questionnaires, one baseline and one follow-up after 12 months."
