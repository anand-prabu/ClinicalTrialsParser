            "textblock": "Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a technique used to investigate the functional\n      activity of the brain.  The PET technique allows doctors to study the normal processes of\n      the brain (central nervous system) of normal individuals and patients with neurologic\n      illnesses without physical / structural damage to the brain.\n\n      When a region of the brain is active, it uses more fuel in the form of oxygen and sugar\n      (glucose).  As the brain uses more fuel it produces more waste products, carbon dioxide and\n      water.  Blood carries fuel to the brain and waste products away from the brain.  As brain\n      activity increases blood flow to and from the area of activity increases also.  Knowing\n      these facts, researchers can use radioactive water (H215O) and PET scans to observe what\n      areas of the brain are receiving more blood flow.\n\n      This study will attempt to determine the areas of the brain activated by planning processes\n      and decision making.  Researchers will ask patients to participate in tests and games\n      (chess) that will stimulate the areas of the brain involved with decision making and\n      planning while undergoing the water PET blood flow technique."

We will\n      administer perception, motor, simple decision, and planning tasks using the game of chess\n      and the Tower of Hanoi Test as paradigms.  Utilizing a \"subtraction technique\" we hope to\n      identify those areas of cerebral cortex which are most activated by planning processes.  It\n      is predicted that the dorsolateral frontal areas will be most prominently activated.  It is\n      also predicted that the essential components of the planning process will be the same\n      regardless of the type of plans being executed.  The data we collect will be of value in\n      determining 1) the neural representation of planning processes and 2) in guiding cognitive\n      models of the planning system."
