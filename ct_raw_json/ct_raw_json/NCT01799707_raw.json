If the patient has visual field defects in this central area, 80% of the stimuli are presented in the intact part of the training region. The task is to identify the orientation of the line segment and press, as fast as possible, one of 4 assigned buttons on the keyboard."

Behavioral vision restoration training\n      (VRT), shown to improve visual fields in hemianopia and optic nerve damage, might comprise\n      such a method.\n\n      Objective: To determine if behaviorally activating areas of residual visual (ARV) using VRT\n      by daily one hour training for 3 months improves detection performance in perimetry compared\n      to a vision discrimination task in the intact visual field sector."

Secondary endpoints are 30\u00b0 white/white and 30\u00b0 blue/yellow\n      near-threshold perimetry.
