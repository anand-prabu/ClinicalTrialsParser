    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment of epileptiform abnormalities in
      children with autism spectrum disorder will improve any behaviors in these children. The
      investigators will study a number of different behavioral outcomes including behaviors
      related to attention, social communication, repetitive behaviors, maladaptive behaviors,
      language, motor and sensory, and sleep.  The investigators will use an anticonvulsant
      medication called valproic acid (in the form of sodium divalproex).

    <textblock>
      Epilepsy and epileptiform EEG abnormalities are common co-morbidities in Autism Spectrum
      Disorders (ASD) that can be considered important biomarkers of cortical dysfunction in these
      disorders.  They may represent a measure of the excitatory-inhibitory imbalance posited to
      be involved in the pathogenesis of the disorder.  Treatment of epilepsy is always indicated,
      but treatment of isolated epileptiform EEG (i.e. in the absence of clinical seizures) is
      frankly controversial.  Since data suggest that these epileptiform discharges are associated
      with deficits in attention, language and behavior, the investigators believe that they may
      represent an important and novel treatment target in this population.  The proposed study
      brings together a group of investigators long interested in this problem in order to
      investigate the efficacy of using an anticonvulsant medication with spike suppression
      capabilities (VPA in the form of divalproex sodium) to treat children with ASD and isolated
      epileptiform EEGs.  Recruiting from 3 large autism centers (Boston Children's Hospital (BCH)
      and Vanderbilt University (VU) and University of Louisville (U of L)) with very large
      pediatric epilepsy units, the investigators propose a 26 week randomized placebo controlled
      cross over study of VPA in 4-8 year old children with ASD with frequent epileptiform EEG
      discharges.

    <description>To determine if administration of VPA results in improvement in behavior compared to placebo.  Based on preliminary data the investigators hypothesize that VPA will be significantly associated with improvement in the areas of aggression, attention and externalizing behaviors as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the primary behavioral outcome variables.  A wide range of other behavioral measures (secondary outcomes) including those related to core ASD symptoms, language, adaptive functioning, sensory and motor behaviors to identify will also be examined.  Behavioral measures will be examined in relation to reduction of epileptiform discharges.  The investigators will also include both objective and subjective measures of sleep and examine the effect of sleep changes in relation to EEG discharge profiles and behavior.</description>
