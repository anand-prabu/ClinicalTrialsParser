The amount of Hu3F8  that patients gets will depend on when they start\n      treatment on this study.  The amount of rIL2 will be the same for all patients.

If fresh or\n             frozen tumor is not available for immunostaining, patients will be considered\n             eligible if published reports show that >50% of that tumor type is GD2-positive by\n             immunohistochemistry. (Note: Tissues must be fresh/frozen as fixed, paraffin-embedded\n             specimens are unsuitable for anti-GD2 immunostaining). Tumors known to be GD2-\n             positive by this criteria do not need immunostaining. These include: Melanoma (>50%),\n             Desmoplastic small round cell tumors (70%), Osteosarcoma (88%) and Soft tissue\n             sarcomas including liposarcoma, fibrosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma,\n             leiomyosarcoma, and spindle cell sarcoma (93%).\n\n          -  Patients must have either (1) refractory or relapsed high-risk NB (including\n             MYCN-amplified stage 2/3/4/4S of any age and MYCN-nonamplified stage 4 in patients\n             greater than 18 months of age)resistant to standard therapy*, or (2) refractory or\n             relapsed GD2-positive tumor after receiving available life-prolonging therapies.\n\n             *For NB, standard therapy generally includes 5-8 cycles of high dose induction\n             chemotherapy followed by resection of gross residual tumor, with or without\n             myeloablative chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell rescue and radiation\n             therapy to the primary site. There are also salvage chemotherapy regimens for\n             residual disease after standard induction therapy or for relapsed NB. Some examples\n             of these chemotherapy combinations are: high-dose cyclophosphamide, topotecan and\n             vincristine; high-dose cyclophosphamide, irinotecan and vincristine; irinotecan and\n             temozolomide; or ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide.\n\n          -  Patients must be older than 1 year of age.\n\n          -  Prior treatment with murine 3F8 is allowed.
