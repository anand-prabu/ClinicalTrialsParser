            "textblock": "Probiotics are commercially available live bacteria thought to have health benefits when\n      ingested. A literature review of probiotic studies in the intensive care unit (ICU) found\n      that in patients who receive probiotics, there is a 25% reduction in lung infection, known\n      as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). There is also an 18% reduction in the chance of\n      developing any infection in the ICU. However, the studies reviewed were small and not well\n      done.  Therefore, whether probiotics are really helpful or not is unclear. Before a large\n      carefully performed study is done to evaluate the effects of probiotics in critically ill\n      patients, a pilot trial is needed. The investigators plan to study the feasibility of such a\n      trial in mechanically ventilated ICU patients in 11 ICUs in Ontario, investigating whether\n      orally ingested L. rhamnosus GG (a common probiotic) prevents VAP and other infections. The\n      4 goals of the pilot study will be to ensure that we can successfully enrol patients; follow\n      the protocol faithfully; make sure patients don't receive additional probiotics, and\n      estimate how much pneumonia exists in these patients. In a separate substudy, the\n      investigators will evaluate the effects of probiotics on lower lung infiltration with\n      potential harmful bacteria, stool bacteria, markers of immunity called cytokines, and\n      markers of infection called endotoxin levels. The investigators plan to enroll 150 adults\n      admitted to ICU and receiving mechanical ventilation. Following informed consent, patients\n      will be randomized to either L. rhamnosus GG group or an identical placebo. Twice daily,\n      patients will receive probiotics or placebo in a feeding tube. The investigators will record\n      all infections and other important outcomes in the ICU. This study is very important in the\n      ongoing search for more effective strategies to prevent serious infection during critical\n      illness. Probiotics may be an easy-to-use, readily available, inexpensive approach to help\n      future critically ill patients around the world."

            "textblock": "Background:Probiotics are live microorganisms thought to have health benefits when ingested.\n      Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have documented favourable impact on a range of clinical\n      problems, including prevention of upper respiratory tract infections, antibiotic-associated\n      diarrhea, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, and irritable bowel syndrome. Our\n      recent meta-analysis of probiotic RCTs in the intensive care unit (ICU) also suggests 25%\n      lower rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and 18% lower infection rates overall\n      when administered to critically ill mechanically ventilated patients. However, these\n      estimates arise from small, modest quality single-center RCTs yielding imprecise estimates\n      of effect and uncertain generalizability, and require confirmation in a large\n      methodologically rigourous RCT. Before such a trial is launched testing whether probiotics\n      confer benefit, harm, or have no impact on infectious and non-infectious outcomes, a pilot\n      trial is needed to confirm feasibility.\n\n      Specific Aim: To determine the feasibility of performing a large RCT in mechanically\n      ventilated critically ill patients adequately powered to investigate whether orally ingested\n      L. rhamnosus GG prevents VAP, based on metrics of successful timely pilot trial recruitment;\n      high adherence to protocol; and minimal contamination and cross-overs. We hypothesize that a\n      full scale RCT will be feasible.\n\n      Setting: 11 ICUs in Ontario.\n\n      Methods: 150 patients 18 years of age or older, admitted to ICU and receiving mechanical\n      ventilation for <48 hrs, with an anticipated duration of ventilation of \u226572 hs will be\n      included. Exclusion criteria are patients at increased risk of iatrogenic probiotic\n      infection, strict contraindication or inability to receive enteral medications, known or\n      suspected pregnancy, hopeless prognosis or intent to withhold or withdraw advanced life\n      support, prior history of mechanical ventilation during current hospital stay, previous\n      enrolment in this or a related infection prevention trial. Following informed consent,\n      patients will be randomized in variable unspecified block sizes of 4-6 in a fixed allocation\n      ratio of 1:1, stratified by ICU. Twice daily, patients will receive either 1x1010 colony\n      forming units (CFU) of L. rhamnosus GG (Culturelle, Locin Industries Ltd) in 1 capsule or an\n      identical placebo capsule. Both will be suspended in sterile water administered via\n      nasogastric tube. Research Nurses will notify local Study Pharmacists after informed consent\n      is obtained. Study Pharmacists will obtain the allocation from the PROSPECT website. Only\n      the Database Manager and Study Pharmacists, who have no role in the clinical care of\n      patients, will have access to the randomization schedule. Thus, all other members of the\n      research team, the clinical team, patients and families will be blinded. Patients will\n      receive the trial intervention from the first administration until:1) first extubation\n      sustained >24 hrs or unsupported breathing >24 hrs in patients with tracheostomy; 2) death;\n      or 3) isolation of Lactobacillus spp. cultured from a sterile site, or if cultured as the\n      sole or predominant organism from a non-sterile site. Analysis of feasibility, clinical and\n      mechanistic outcomes will be by a blinded biostatistician, conducted according to the\n      intention to treat principle.\n\n      Pilot Trial Outcomes: The primary outcomes relate to feasibility: 1) recruitment success in\n      one year; 2) >90% adherence to the probiotic administration protocol; and 3) <5% cross-overs\n      and contamination. Clinical outcomes of VAP, other infections, and diarrhea will also be\n      measured.\n\n      Mechanistic Sub-Study: In a separate funded sub-study of this pilot, we will examine\n      endotracheal aspirates, stool and serum to determine the impact of orally ingested L.\n      rhamnosus GG on lower respiratory tract (LRT) and lower gastrointestinal (GIT) colonization\n      with potential pathogens; and we will examine immune effects measured by serum cytokines and\n      endotoxin levels.\n\n      Full Trial Outcomes:VAP, other ICU-acquired infections, diarrhea (total, antibiotic\n      associated and Clostridium-difficile associated diarrhea), ICU and hospital mortality.\n\n      Relevance: Despite clinical uptake of some existing VAP prevention strategies, the ongoing\n      morbidity, mortality and cost of VAP underscore the need for further cost-effective\n      interventions to reduce its impact. When rigorously evaluated, probiotics may have salutary\n      effects decreasing nosocomial infections; alternatively, probiotics may have no demonstrable\n      effect, or actually cause infections in critically ill patients with impaired immune\n      function."
