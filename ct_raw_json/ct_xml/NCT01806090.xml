      This double-blind, randomized trial aims to evaluate whether uninterrupted anti-platelet
      therapy (clopidogrel) will increase the risk of bleeding associated with removal of polyp
      during colonoscopy in patients with coronary artery disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clopidogrel is a potent anti-platelet agent that, when combines with aspirin, is essential
      in treating acute myocardial infarction and preventing coronary stent thrombosis. However,
      adding clopidogrel to aspirin has been shown to substantially increase the risk of
      gastrointestinal bleeding by 70%. This increased bleeding risk is a particular concern for
      patients requiring colonoscopy. The latter is a gold standard for screening colorectal
      cancer. This endoscopic procedure is increasingly performed for patients on anti-platelet
      drugs because coronary artery disease is associated with increased risk of colorectal
      neoplasia. We have shown that over 30% of patients with coronary artery disease have
      colorectal neoplasia.

      Management of patients on clopidogrel who undergo colonoscopy is a clinical dilemma.
      Continuation of clopidogrel may increase the risk of bleeding associated with endoscopic
      resection of polyps (post-polypectomy bleeding). This is a potentially serious complication
      because post-polypectomy bleeding is often delayed, difficult to locate, and may provoke
      acute coronary syndrome. Conversely, prolonged discontinuation of clopidogrel increases the
      risk of recurrent myocardial infarction and coronary stent thrombosis.

      There is a lack of prospective data on the risk of post-polypectomy bleeding attributable to
      clopidogrel. Current American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and British Society of
      Gastroenterology Guidelines recommend withholding clopidogrel for 7 to 10 days in planned
      high risk endoscopic procedures such as colonoscopic polypectomy. However, this guideline is
      largely based on retrospective data and expert opinion. In fact, the anti-platelet effect of
      clopidogrel lasts for about 5 days only. Coronary stent thrombosis has been reported as
      early as 7 days after stopping clopidogrel. There remains a large gap in our knowledge on
      the risk of bleeding in patients taking clopidogrel who undergo gastrointestinal endoscopic
      procedures.

      No randomized trials have assessed whether clopidogrel should be discontinued before
      colonoscopy. This randomized trial aims to assess whether uninterrupted clopidogrel therapy
      during colonoscopy will increase the risk of post-polypectomy bleeding. Irrespective of the
      outcome, this trial will be the first to provide controlled data on the risk of
      post-polypectomy bleeding with uninterrupted clopidogrel during colonoscopy. Unfortunately,
      this important clinical question is not a priority of pharmaceutical companies because
      clopidogrel will be off patent soon. The outcome of this industry-independent clinical trial
      may encourage health authorities and international guideline committees to review their
      recommendations on the management of anti-platelet therapy for high-risk endoscopic
      procedures.

      Hypothesis Uninterrupted clopidogrel therapy increases the risk of post-polypectomy bleeding
      in patients undergoing elective colonoscopy

      Aim

        1. To investigate whether uninterrupted clopidogrel therapy before elective colonoscopy
           will increase the risk of post-polypectomy bleeding

        2. To assess the impact of platelet reactivity on risk of bleeding in patients on
           clopidogrel therapy undergoing polypectomy

        3. To assess the impact of CYP2C19 polymorphism on bleeding events in patients on
           clopidogrel therapy undergoing polypectomy

      Study Design This is a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial in which patients
      receiving clopidogrel for coronary stents who require elective colonoscopy will be
      randomized to either clopidogrel or its placebo for one week prior to the endoscopic
      procedure

      Drug Allocation &amp; Randomization Seven days before scheduled colonoscopy, eligible patients
      will be instructed to stop taking their prescriptions of clopidogrel. They will be randomly
      assigned to receive the study drug (clopidogrel) or its placebo for 7 days until the morning
      of the endoscopic procedure (refer to schematic trial design). The study drug and its
      placebo will be prepared by the School of Pharmacy at Chinese University of Hong Kong as
      identical-appearing capsules, according to international good manufacturing practice
      guidelines for pharmaceuticals. A computer-generated randomization schedule is used to
      assign patients to the intervention sequences.  Concomitant aspirin therapy, if any, will be
      continued. Randomization is stratified for concomitant use of other anti-platelet drugs.

      Colonoscopic Procedures This study will be carried out in two regional hospitals that
      collectively serve a population of 1.5 million. Around 4,000 colonoscopies are performed
      annually in each hospital. All patients will have blood test for hemoglobin level, platelet
      function and CYP2C19 Genotyping before colonoscopy. Experienced colonoscopists will perform
      colonoscopy under conscious sedation with midazolam and pethidine. Bowel preparation
      consists of polyethylene glycol taken orally the evening and the morning before procedure
      together with a minimum of 2 liters of clear fluids. The adequacy of bowel preparation will
      be documented (poor, fair, good, or excellent). Colonoscopists will be instructed to remove
      all polyps during the colonoscopic examination. The location and morphologic feature of each
      polyp will be recorded. The size is measured using an open biopsy forceps (6 mm apart). Each
      lesion will be fixed in formalin and sent to the pathologist for histologic evaluation. No
      prophylactic clips or detachable loops will be applied if immediate bleeding is not observed
      after polypectomy. Intervention for immediate post-polypectomy bleeding including injection
      therapy alone or in combination with endoclip application, if any, will be recorded.

      Follow-up assessment All patients will resume their usual prescriptions of clopidogrel after
      colonoscopy when oral intake is allowed. They will be monitored hourly for hemodynamic
      instability and any delayed post-polypectomy bleeding for 24 hours. After discharge, a
      designated research nurse will contact the patients by telephone on Day 2 and Day 7 for
      symptoms of bleeding. On Day 30, they will return for a full blood count and symptoms of
      delayed post-polypectomy bleeding. Emergency visits and hospital discharge summaries will be
      scanned for up to 6 months after colonoscopy for recurrent cardiothrombotic events. A
      24-hour hotline will be provided for patients to report any adverse or serious events.

      Study End Points The primary endpoint is delayed post-polypectomy bleeding. The latter is
      defined as rectal bleeding, starting after the colonoscope has been retracted from the anus
      to 30 days after the procedure. Bleeding is considered significant if there is hypotension,
      a decrease in hemoglobin of ≥2 g/dL from baseline or ≥10 percentage points decrease in
      hematocrit, requirement of transfusion, prolonged hospitalization, rehospitalization, and
      hemostatic interventions using endoscopic therapy, angiographic embolization, or surgery.

      Secondary endpoints include immediate post-polypectomy bleeding and cardiothrombotic events.
      Immediate post-polypectomy bleeding is defined as bleeding at the time of polypectomy that
      persists despite continuous irrigation with diluted epinephrine solution for 5 minutes.
      Interventions for immediate post-polypectomy bleeding include epinephrine injection alone or
      in combination with endoclip application. The volume of epinephrine and number of endoclips
      used will be recorded.

      The study endpoints will be confirmed by an independent blinded adjudication committee.

      Sample size estimation Sample size estimation is based on the assumptions that the rate of
      delayed post-polypectomy bleeding in 30 days is 0.3 percent with clopidogrel interrupted for
      7 days [15], and that the rate of delayed bleeding is 3% with uninterrupted clopidogrel
      therapy [7]. Accordingly, 290 patients undergoing polypectomy in each group will be required
      to achieve 90% power at 5% significance level using a 2-sided log-rank test (PASS software,
      NCSS 2008, Kaysville, Utah). The investigators previously showed that 34% of patients with
      coronary artery disease will have colonic polyps [13]. Thus, The investigators need to
      perform colonoscopy on 1706 patients receiving clopidogrel to recruit 580 patients (290 per
      group) with polyps in this study.

      Statistical analysis The primary analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat
      population, which is defined as all randomized patients who undergo colonoscopic
      polypectomy. Demographic and clinical characteristics will be compared between clopidogrel
      group and placebo group. Homogeneity of the two groups at baseline will be analyzed using
      the Pearson's chi-square test for categorical data and Student's t-test for continuous
      variables. All P values and 95% CIs are two-sided. Statistical analyses will be carried out
      exclusively by an independent statistician.

      Quality assurance: Data Management Only the research nurse and the PI have access right to
      the blinded database using their login user names and passwords. Subjects' information is
      kept anonymous. They are identified by their study numbers to maintain subjects'
      confidentiality.

      Quality assurance: Monitoring An independent staff will perform source data verification (a
      comparison of the data in the CRFs with the subject's medical records at the hospital or
      practice, and other records relevant to the study).
