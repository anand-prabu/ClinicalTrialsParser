Unfortunately, barriers to accessing\n      psychosocial intervention are common, and many are unable to access those services.\n      Internet- based psychosocial interventions improve accessibility of care and offer\n      additional methodological advantages, including the ability to easily collect self-report\n      data, track exposure to the intervention, and evaluate effects of specific intervention\n      components. The proposed study will evaluate whether a website developed specifically for\n      providing psychological treatment and enhancing communication between cancer survivors can\n      improve distress among cancer survivors who indicate that they have high levels of distress.\n      If successful, the study will also provide valuable information needed to improve the\n      treatment and to adequately conduct a larger trial comparing internet-based and face-to-face\n      treatments."
