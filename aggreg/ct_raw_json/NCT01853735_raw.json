Additionally, an internal study\n      control will be performed by analyzing concurrent injured patients requiring an open abdomen\n      who did not have a bowel injury.\n\n      Specific aims:\n\n      Hypothesis 1: EN in patients with a traumatic bowel injury requiring an open abdomen\n      improves fascial closure rate compared to patients who remain NPO.\n\n      Hypothesis 2: EN in patients with a traumatic bowel injury requiring an open abdomen reduces\n      infectious complications compared to patients who remain NPO.\n\n      Hypothesis 3: EN in patients with a traumatic bowel injury requiring an open abdomen have a\n      lower mortality rate compared to patients who remain NPO."
