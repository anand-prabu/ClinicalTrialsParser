  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to explore differences in oncologic and surgical safety between
      robotic assisted laparoscopy and conventional abdominal surgery for high risk endometrial
      cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Robotic assisted laparoscopy (RAL)is equal in terms of oncologic and surgical
      safety as conventional abdominal surgery (AS) for high risk endometrial cancer (EC).

      Methods: Women with high risk EC (defined as high grade endometrial, clear cell or serous)
      are randomized to either RAL or AS. Both groups will undergo complete surgical staging
      (hysterectomy, bilateral salpingoophorectomy, pelvic and paraaortal lymphadenectomy)

      Primary endpoint: Number of harvested lymph nodes per station Secondary endpoints:
      Recurrences up to 3 year after surgery. Lymphatic side-effects, quality of life, cost,
      surgical morbidity.
