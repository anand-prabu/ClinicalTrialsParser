  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the current study is to investigate the therapeutic effect and especially the
      mode of action of Wobenzym® plus, an anti-inflammatory drug containing proteolytic enzymes,
      on exercise induced muscle damage (eiMD) and recovery time in male amateur sportsmen with
      medium proficiency level compared to placebo.
