  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of male pattern hair loss (MPHL) or androgenetic alopecia (AGA) with 5Î±-reductase
      inhibitor (5-ARIs) has been associated with sexual dysfunction including erectile
      dysfunction and loss of libido. This will be a multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to assess the impact of dutasteride treatment on
      sexual function as well as subject satisfaction with hair growth and quality of life in men
      with AGA. This study will consist of a Screening Visit, a 4-week Placebo Run-in Phase, a
      Treatment Phase of 24 weeks, and a subsequent Follow-up Visit after 4 weeks.  An extended
      6-month Follow-up Visit will be conducted for any individuals with a change in erectile
      function at the end of treatment.

             subject's safety, obtaining informed consent, or compliance with study procedures.
             Note: the investigator may consult with the GSK medical monitor if a condition could
             interfere with the subject's safety.
