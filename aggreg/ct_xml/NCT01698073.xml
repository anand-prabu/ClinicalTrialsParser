    <description>Onset of sexual activity is measured by youth self-reported answers in an online survey to a question on lifetime sexual activity.  Specifically, youth are coded &quot;1&quot; if they report having had sex ever before in their lifetimes, &quot;0&quot; otherwise. In conjunction with age data and date of survey administration (also collected in the surveys), these questions provide us the timing (age) of onset of sexual activity.  This question is repeated at each data collection point with youth who reported not ever having had sex at the prior survey. Over time, then, we can assess onset of sexual activity prospectively.</description>
