            "textblock": "ScopeGuide (Magnetic endoscopic imaging) is a device used during some colonoscopies which\n      provides real-time 3D image of the shape and configuration of the colonoscope as it travels\n      through the colon.  Whilst it is being used in clinical practice in most units in the UK, it\n      is not a device which is routinely used on all lists, and most departments do not own enough\n      ScopeGuides to have on all lists. Studies have shown it can potentially aid colonoscopy by\n      improving completion rates and times as well as patient comfort in selected endoscopists\n      (persons who perform the colonoscopy). However data on its benefit have been conflicting.\n\n      Subjective mental workload (the individuals mental resources required as a result of the\n      multiple demands placed on him/her from a task)in healthcare employees is known to be\n      important for the performance and safety of healthcare delivery. Increased workload during\n      task performance may increase fatigue, facilitate errors and lead to overall inferior\n      performance.\n\n      In colonoscopy high mental workload could potentially be responsible for longer procedural\n      time, lack of trainee learning, inadvertent missing of lesions in the bowel as well as poor\n      technique leading to patient discomfort. The effect of the endoscopist mental workload on\n      their performance and potential facilitators to reduce mental workload is an area that has\n      been neglected in this field.\n\n      This study aims to look at the mental workload of endoscopist during colonoscopy and the\n      effect ScopeGuide may have on this workload.\n\n      Hypothesis: The use of ScopeGuide during colonoscopy will reduce the mental workload of the\n      endoscopist performing the procedure"
