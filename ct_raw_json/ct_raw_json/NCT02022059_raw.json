            "textblock": "Enteral nutrition is the treatment of choice for malnourish patient.  Nasogastric tube (NGT)\n      is although a common act.  Unfortunately, this procedure can be painful.  Also, many\n      patients will need many NGT re-insertion.  Therefore, the investigators need to increase the\n      acceptability of this procedure by increasing comfort during NGT passage. Professionals\n      guidelines of HAS (recommendations professionnelles de bonne pratiques de soins) and SFNEP\n      (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Nutrition Clinique et M\u00e9tabolisme) talk about the possibility of using\n      local anesthesic without ordering their use.  However, NGT tube insertion is often put\n      without pre-medication in the face of an accumulating body of evidence indicating that local\n      anesthetic prior NGT insertion decrease discomfort of the procedure.  On the other hand,\n      these studies have been done in the emergency room with NGT of a bigger gauge and for many\n      reasons except enteral nutrition.\n\n      The investigators primary objective of this prospective monocentric study is to evaluate the\n      efficacy (patient comfort) of lidocaine 5 % spray versus placebo (physiologic serum) before\n      NGT insertion in patient needing enteral nutrition, using visual analogue scale.  Secondary\n      objectives are to evaluate nurse and patient satisfaction using questionnaires, facility of\n      NGT insertion using Likert scale, numbers of try, time of procedure, complications like\n      tracheal insertion and success of the insertion using thorax x-ray.\n\n      The study will be held in CHU Nice at nutrition unit support.  After signed consentment,\n      patients will be separate in two groups :  group A (lidoca\u00efne spray 5 %) and group B\n      (physiologic serum).  There will be 2 spray in nostril and 2 in orophagyngeal cavity 2\n      minutes before NGT insertion, which will be done by a competent nurse. Vital signs will be\n      noted at the beginning of the procedure and 10 minutes after.  At the end, the nurse and the\n      patient will have to answer a questionnaire. Pain will be grade using visual analogue scale\n      immediately after the procedure. Demographic data and complications will be note by the\n      investigator.  Finally, thorax X-ray will be done at the end of the procedure.  There will\n      be 34 patients by group.  If the investigators find a benefit, this can change their\n      practice and guidelines."
