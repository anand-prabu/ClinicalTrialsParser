Treatment\n      continues for at least 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. After 12 months, patients with responding or stable disease may continue\n      treatment.\n\n      Tumors are measured every 2 months for 6 months, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months\n      for years 3 and 4, and then annually for years 5 and 6.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
