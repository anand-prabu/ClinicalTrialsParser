        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is judged to benefit from adjunctive treatment with brexpiprazole
             according to the clinical opinion of the investigator.

          -  The patient had MDD at entry in lead-in brexpiprazole studies, NCT01838681 / 14570A
             or NCT01837797 / 14571A, diagnosed according to DSM-IV-TRâ„¢.

          -  The patient agrees to protocol-defined use of effective contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has a disease or takes medication that could, in the investigator's
             opinion, interfere with the assessments of safety, tolerability, or efficacy, or
             interfere with the conduct or interpretation of the study.

          -  The patient has been diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder other than MDD during the
             lead-in studies NCT01838681 / 14570A or NCT01837797 / 14571A.

          -  The patient, in the opinion of the investigator or according to C-SSRS, is at
             significant risk of suicide.

          -  The patient has any relevant medical history or current presence of systemic disease.

          -  The patient has, at the Baseline Visit an abnormal ECG that is, in the investigator's
             opinion, clinically significant.

          -  The patient has a moderate or severe ongoing adverse event related to study
             medication from the lead-in studies considered of potential safety risk by the
             investigator.

          -  The patient is, in the investigator's opinion, unlikely to comply with the protocol
             or is unsuitable for any reason.
