We adapted the existing\n      LifeSkills video (which was already been shown effective in patients with heart diseases) to\n      the specific needs of patients with AICD's. Before its development, we held separate focus\n      groups with healthcare providers of AICD patients, pre-implantation patients, and\n      post-implantation patients.  After the video/accompanying workbook was produced, we held an\n      additional focus group with patients who had received the video/workbook before receiving\n      their AICD."
