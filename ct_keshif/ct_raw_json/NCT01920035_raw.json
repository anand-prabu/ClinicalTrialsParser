The study will evaluate the safety and\n      effectiveness of the device in inducing hypothermia of the neuromuscular tissues impacting\n      continence during RARP.\n\n      The UroCool system is designed to apply targeted temperature control to the pelvic anatomy\n      during RARP. The pelvis is cooled transrectally via a closed cycle recirculation of chilled\n      sterile saline using a single-use disposable balloon catheter connected via a circulation IV\n      set to a control console that is covered by a current 510(k) and commercially available.\n\n      The UroCool polymeric catheter is designed to be inserted within the rectal cavity adjacent\n      to the prostate prior to surgery and removed upon completion of surgery. It is used in\n      conjunction with the InnerCool Console which circulates cold saline in a closed loop within\n      the UroCool catheter to allow for therapeutic localized cooling of the prostate gland and\n      surrounding areas during prostate surgery."
