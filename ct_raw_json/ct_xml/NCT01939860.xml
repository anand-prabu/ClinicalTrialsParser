  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a major health problem, however its control is unsatisfactory. One of the
      reasons for such a high prevalence of this disease includes poor patient compliance to
      treatment. Approximately 30 % of newly diagnosed hypertensive patients stop taking their
      blood pressure medication by six months and 50% by 12 months.

      The UK government is keen to encourage community pharmacists to play an active role in
      participation of services that can improve patient adherence to their medications. The New
      Medicines Service (NMS) and targeted Medicines Use Reviews (MUR) are established services
      which fund community pharmacists to review and explain medicine use to patients, with
      hypertension a common condition for which advice is given within these schemes.  Within
      these schemes, advice is verbal and unstructured, with no specific written information
      provided on drugs or the disease being treated.

      This study aims to determine whether structured information provided to participants
      verbally and in writing by community pharmacists about blood pressure and current
      medicine(s) within NMS and targeted MURs will be retained and will be associated with
      improved hypertension control. Participants will be recruited from people eligible for NMS
      and MURs and attending community pharmacies.
