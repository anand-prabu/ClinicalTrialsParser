Bone marrow transplantation may allow doctors to give higher\n      doses of chemotherapy and kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy with\n      thiotepa, carboplatin, and topotecan followed by bone marrow transplantation in treating\n      patients who have metastatic or progressive rare cancer."

Autologous bone\n      marrow or PBSC are reinfused on day 0. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV twice daily\n      beginning on day 1.\n\n      Patients are followed for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years."
