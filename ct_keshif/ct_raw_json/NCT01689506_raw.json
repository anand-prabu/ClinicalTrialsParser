This pilot study will compare two burns fluid\n      resuscitation regimes (supplementation with 6% HES 130/0.4 in an isotonic electrolyte\n      solution, Volulyte 6%, versus supplementation with Human Serum Albumin, HSA 50g/L) on\n      patient outcome with particular regard to fluid balance at 24 hours after burns injury\n      (primary variable)."
