Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. It is not yet known whether external-beam radiation therapy plus chemotherapy is more\n      effective with or without internal radiation therapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare chemotherapy and external-beam radiation\n      therapy with or without internal radiation therapy in treating patients with stage I, stage\n      II, or stage III esophageal cancer."

Compare the complete local remission rate in patients with unresectable stage\n      I, II, or III esophageal cancer treated with chemoradiotherapy with or without endoluminal\n      brachytherapy. II. Compare the complete remission rate (local, locoregional, and distant) in\n      these patients. III. Compare the overall and disease-free survival in these patients at 2\n      and 5 years after therapy. IV. Compare the toxicity and quality of life experienced by these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to\n      participating center, tumor stage, and chemotherapy. All patients receive fluorouracil IV\n      continuously over 4 days (days 1-4) and/or cisplatin on day 2 of weeks 1 and 5. External\n      beam radiotherapy begins on day 1 of chemotherapy and is delivered in daily fractions, 5\n      days per week, for 5 weeks, followed by a cone down dose administered during week 6.\n      Patients randomized to brachytherapy (Iridium 192, high-dose rate) are treated on weeks 11\n      and 12 and receive 2 additional courses of chemotherapy at weeks 9 and 14. Patients\n      randomized to no brachytherapy receive additional chemotherapy courses on weeks 9 and 13.\n      Quality of life is assessed. Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then\n      annually for 3 years years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 326 patients will be accrued for this study."
