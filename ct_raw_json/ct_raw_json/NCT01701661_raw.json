Uncomplicated disease, where there\n      is no skin changes but varicose veins with or without leg swelling, can be totally\n      asymptomatic but also cause various symptoms as pain, aching and discomfort of leg usually\n      caused by increased venous pressure. Varicose veins may also cause cosmetic problem.\n      Compression stockings relief the symptoms as they normalize venous pressure. In surgical\n      treatment, axial reflux is treated usually by removing incompetent superficial veins. The\n      aim of the study is to compare conservative treatment with compression stockings with\n      surgical treatment of superficial venous reflux. In operative treatment the great saphenous\n      vein or lesser saphenous vein are removed after flush ligation by femoral vein and stripping\n      of the trunk. If the main trunk has been removes previously, axial refluating veins are\n      removed or ligated according to the DUS finding. The patients in both groups are examined at\n      the baseline and followed up to two years by ultrasound scanning. Patients clinical\n      classification, venous disability score, venous disease severity score, anatomical path of\n      reflux as well as quality of life are studied at the baseline, at one year follow-up and two\n      years follow-up."
