In this view, various bio-feedback mechanisms have been\n      proposes along the years,  for example, to tackle hypovolemia-related hypotension. Their\n      scientific rationale is the control of either blood volume or directly natremia, in order to\n      pilot plasma refilling towards the vascular compartment [2].\n\n      Despite the great achievements obtained, the forecasting of acute hypotension during\n      hemodialysis still remains a complex problem, likely involving more than one variable.\n\n      SO2 can be considered an indirect expression of the hemodynamic stability. Moreover, in\n      dialysis, it has always been regarded as a bio-compatibility marker for membranes [3].\n      Nowadays, SO2 changes during dialysis are easy to measure with a fully, non-invasive sensor\n      assembled on the arterial line.\n\n      We planned this study to analyze on a large number of sessions the short-term variability of\n      SO2 during hemodialysis in relationship with hemodynamic tolerance."
