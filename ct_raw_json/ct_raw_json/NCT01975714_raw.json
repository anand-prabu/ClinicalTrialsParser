The individual active component of\n      BUDPF, bimatoprost is an established therapeutic agent with well documented IOP efficacy\n      (1). Prostamides, such as bimatoprost, are believed to lower IOP mainly by increasing\n      uveoscleral outflow. The comparator, Preservative Free Latanoprost 0.005% Unit Dose (LUDPF,\n      eg. Monoprost\u00ae), was recently launched in a number of countries in Europe and contains\n      latanoprost in a new preservative free formulation.\n\n      It is clinically important to compare these newly entered preservative free products with\n      respect to tolerability and efficacy. A better tolerability combined with maximum efficacy\n      will reduce the burden of daily glaucoma therapy and provide a clear therapeutic benefit to\n      the glaucoma patient by providing enhanced compliance and real-world IOP-lowering efficacy.\n\n      The hypothesis of the study is that monodose bimatoprost is more effective than monodose\n      latanoprost by at least 1 mmHg.\n\n      (AIBILI applied for an unrestricted grant from Allergan to perform this study)"
