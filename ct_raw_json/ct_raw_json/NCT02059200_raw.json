            "textblock": "Since a few years, Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) has been used as treatment for\n      patients suffering from recurrent depression. Though a number of studies show that MBCT is\n      effective in this population and MBCT reduces the chances of relapse/recurrence in recurrent\n      depressive patients, the chance of a new depression developing after end of treatment is\n      still considerable. Ergo, there is room for improvement.\n\n      Especially the development of a non-judging or compassionate attitude towards all experience\n      seems to mediate the treatment effect. It is therefore our expectation that a follow-up\n      intervention that focuses specifically on self-compassion could prove very useful in\n      elaborating on the effects of MBCT.\n\n      The research question of this research is therefore: what is the effect of compassion\n      training in people suffering from recurrent depression who have already received MBCT\n      training?"
