        "description": "Filtering surgery adequately lowers intraocular pressure in most glaucoma patients.  However, the prognosis is less favorable for aphakic patients with glaucoma or glaucoma in phakic eyes following unsuccessful filtering operations.  Failure of filtering surgery is usually attributed to the proliferation of fibroblasts at the filtering site. The use of 5-FU, an antimetabolite, has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of fibroblasts in tissue culture, and in preliminary studies it has increased the success of filtering surgery in a nonhuman primate model.\n \n  The Fluorouracil Filtering Surgery Study (FFSS) was a randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing the success rate of standard glaucoma filtering surgery to the success rate of standard surgery with adjunctive 5-FU treatment.\n \n  Another element of this study was to evaluate the frequency and severity of possible adverse effects related to 5-FU injections.  Detailed preoperative and postoperative examinations of the cornea, lens, and retina were performed.  Systemic toxicity was assessed by preoperative and postoperative hematologic studies.\n \n  After the investigators performed the filtering surgery and determined that the new outlet channel was working, patients were randomized to receive either 5-FU injections or standard postsurgical care without 5-FU. The patients treated with 5-FU received subconjunctival injections of 5 mg of 5-FU twice daily on postoperative days 1 through 7 and once daily on postoperative days 8 through 14.  There were 213 patients recruited into the study, 162 with previous cataract extraction and 51 with previous filtering surgery.\n \n  All patients were examined at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 18 months, and 2 years postoperatively and at yearly intervals thereafter until 5 years postoperatively.  Possible concomitant risks of 5-FU treatment, such as toxic effects to the cornea, lens, or retina, were monitored.",

        "description": "Retinal branch vein occlusion (BVO) is the second most common retinal vascular disease after diabetic retinopathy.  Many treatments for this disorder were attempted before 1977, but none were proven to be effective.  The only treatment that seemed at all promising in preventing visual loss from BVO was laser photocoagulation.\n \n \n        Approximately 500 patients were enrolled in the study.  One-half were randomly assigned to treatment with argon laser photocoagulation; the other one-half remained untreated as controls.  For BVO with or without neovascularization, scatter treatment of 100 to 400 laser burns was applied in the drainage area of the occluded vein site, avoiding the fovea and optic disc.  Individual laser burns were 200 to 500 microns in diameter with an exposure time of 0.1 to 0.2 seconds.  For macular edema, burns of 50 to 100 microns in diameter with exposure time of 0.05 to 0.1 seconds were used.  A fluorescein angiogram less than 1 month old had to have been available for each patient.  Treatment was performed under topical anesthesia using the argon laser to achieve a grid pattern over the area of capillary leakage identified by fluorescein in the macular region.  Photocoagulation was extended no closer to the fovea than the edge of the foveal avascular zone and did not extend peripherally beyond the major vascular arcade.  The efficacy of treatment was judged on the basis of visual acuity measurements as well as assessment of the subsequent development of neovascularization and/or vitreous hemorrhage.  Patients were followed for at least 3 years.",

        "description": "By the 1950s, diabetic retinopathy had become a leading cause of blindness and visual disability in the United States.  The use of photocoagulation to treat proliferative retinopathy gained widespread use in ophthalmic practice following its introduction in 1959. However, only a few studies of photocoagulation incorporated any of the basic principles of controlled clinical trials, and these involved inadequate numbers of patients.  Consequently, there has been inadequate evidence of the actual value of the procedure. Because of the clinical importance of diabetic retinopathy and the increasing use of photocoagulation in its management, the Diabetic Retinopathy Study (DRS) was begun in 1971.  This randomized, controlled clinical trial involved more than 1,700 patients enrolled at 15 medical centers.\n \n   One eye of each patient was randomly assigned to immediate photocoagulation and the other to followup without treatment, regardless of the course followed by either eye.  The eye chosen for photocoagulation was randomly assigned to either of two treatment techniques, one using an argon laser and the other a xenon arc photocoagulator.  Patients were followed at 4-month intervals according to a protocol that provided for measurement of best corrected visual acuity.\n \n  Treatment was usually completed in one or two sittings and included scatter (panretinal) photocoagulation extending to or beyond the vortex vein ampulae.  The argon treatment technique specified 800 to 1,600, 500-micron scatter burns of 0.1 second duration and direct treatment of new vessels whether on or within one disc diameter of the optic disc (NVD) or outside this area (NVE).  Focal treatment was also applied to microaneurysms or other lesions thought to be causing macular edema.  Followup treatment was applied as needed at 4-month intervals.  The xenon technique was similar, but scatter burns were fewer in number, generally of longer duration, and stronger, and direct treatment was applied only to NVE on the surface of the retina.",
