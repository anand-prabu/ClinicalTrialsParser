It is associated with low hemoglobin [substance that carries oxygen and gives\n      blood its red color] or erythropoietin  [hormone secreted by kidney that helps in formation\n      of red blood cells in bone marrow] resistance), erythropoietin (EPO), hemoglobin, hematocrit\n      (amount of red blood cells in blood), reticulocyte (immature red blood cells) count,\n      ferritin (a protein that stores iron and allows the body to use iron), serum iron (iron is\n      in the blood which is bound to transferrin) and transferring iron binding capacity (TIBC),\n      level.
