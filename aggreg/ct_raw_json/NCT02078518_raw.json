As multiple myeloma survival improves, it is vital to focus on interventions that\n      will help to maximize QOL. A positive correlation may suggest that exercise is such an\n      intervention.\n\n      The hypothesis are multiple myeloma survivors are performing low levels of physical\n      activity. Higher levels of physical activity will be associated with higher levels of QOL\n      and lower fatigue levels."

And as survival for multiple myeloma continues to improve,\n      physical activity may be a supportive therapy that can help to address the multitude of QOL\n      concerns. Physical activity is a modifiable behavior, and has been proposed as an important\n      non-pharmacologic intervention to improve health-related outcomes among cancer survivors.\n      The American College of Sports Medicine examined evidence of the impact of physical activity\n      in cancer survivors, and concluded that physical activity is safe for cancer patients, both\n      during and after cancer treatment, and may lead to improved physical functioning, decreased\n      physical fatigue, and improved QOL in a number of cancer survivor groups, including\n      hematopoietic malignancies. While a small number of studies have suggested that exercise may\n      reap benefits in QOL and fatigue in multiple myeloma survivors, none were conducted in the\n      local context.Given the limited evidence, the primary objectives of this preliminary study\n      is to estimate the prevalence of physical activity among a local sample of multiple myeloma\n      survivors, and to investigate its associations with reported fatigue and quality of life."
