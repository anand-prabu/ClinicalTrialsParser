Identification of the sensory deficits, along with further insights in their\n      relation with objective neurophysiological and neuroanatomical measures will contribute to\n      the amelioration of goal-setting for the rehabilitation of upper extremity function after\n      stroke. These functions are indispensable during several daily activities as well in\n      different sports and leisure activities. This project is an important step towards a better\n      delineating of treatment interventions for the upper limb and to a better guiding of\n      individual needs for post-stroke treatment in the future."
