            "textblock": "This is a longitudinal study supported by Pfizer and is a collaboration between DMPI (Duke\n      Molecular Physiology Institute) and DIAL (Duke Image Acquisition Laboratory) to measure the\n      effects of carnitine supplementation and acute exercise on carnitine and acylcarnitine\n      levels in the muscle and on insulin sensitivity in the plasma.  This pilot study seeks to\n      determine whether carnitine supplementation might be beneficial for elderly individuals who\n      are overweight or obese, specifically by: 1. Reducing damaging excess protein acetylation\n      (measured in muscle biopsy), 2. Improving the acylcarnitine/carnitine ratio (measured by\n      MRS), 3. Improving overall mitochondrial function as reflected in reduced phosphocreatine\n      recovery time (measured by MRS) and 4. Increasing insulin sensitivity as measured by a\n      4-hour oral glucose tolerance test.  Investigators intend to use the results of this study\n      to show feasibility in measuring mitochondrial function at Duke for a larger federal grant\n      submission.  Investigators hypothesize that carnitine insufficiency might contribute to\n      mitochondrial dysfunction and obesity-related impairments in glucose tolerance and insulin\n      action."
