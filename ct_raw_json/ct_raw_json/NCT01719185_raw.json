Physicians will select patients meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria\n      from their clinic to be approached for recruitment.  Approximately 30 patients will be\n      recruited and blindly randomized to either the treatment group (phentermine and B12 in\n      combination) or the control group (phentermine alone).  Patients will be randomized by means\n      of block randomization in a 1:1 ratio.  Neither patients nor study team members will be\n      aware of group assignments through the entire duration of the study.  Once randomized, both\n      groups will begin taking 37.5 mg/day orally of phentermine as well as receive weekly\n      intramuscular injections of either 1000 mg B12 or Saline depending on their group\n      assignment.  The study will consist of approximately 15 visits over the course of 3 months."
