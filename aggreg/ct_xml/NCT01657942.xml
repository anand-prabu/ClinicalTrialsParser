    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this feasibility study is that focal treatment with ExAblate MRgFUS has
      the potential to be an effective non-invasive treatment for low risk, organ-confined
      prostate cancer, with a low incidence of morbidity. The study hypothesis will be tested by
      measuring treatment-related safety and initial effectiveness parameters in the ExAblate
      MRgFUS treated patients, as described above.

      Objective of this feasibility trial is to assess safety and initial effectiveness of
      ExAblate MRgFUS in the treatment of low risk, localized (organ confined) prostate cancer
      tumors.

      ExAblate treatment will be implemented as a focal tumor-selective therapy, directed at
      pre-defined volume(s)/sector(s) in the prostate, identified as cancerous (by mapping biopsy
      and multi-parametric MRI), rather than a whole gland or hemi-ablation treatment.

      Safety: evaluate incidence and severity of adverse events associated with ExAblate's MRgFUS
      focal treatment of low risk organ confined prostate cancer. The risk of ExAblate
      treatment-related incontinence and impotence will also be assessed in this study.

      Effectiveness: determine the tumor control effect of ExAblate's MRgFUS focal treatment of
      low risk organ-confined prostate cancer (confirmed by TRUS-guided mapping biopsy results).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient age between 55 and 75 years, inclusive.

          -  Biopsy proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate (using a TRUS-guided 12+ core mapping
             template), obtained up to 6 months prior to scheduled treatment.

          -  Patient with low-risk, early-stage organ-confined prostate cancer (cT1c and cT2a, N0,
             M0) and voluntarily chooses MRgFUS as the non-invasive treatment, who may currently
             be on watchful waiting or active surveillance and not in need of imminent radical
             therapy.

          -  Patient with PSA less than or equal to 10 ng/mL

          -  PSAD &lt;0.15 ng/mL/gr

          -  Gleason score 6 (3+3) or less (no 4 or 5 grades), based on TRUS-guided mapping
             prostate biopsy, as defined in the protocol.

          -  Up to two (2) discrete cancerous lesions may be identified in the prostate based on
             biopsy mapping with or without supporting MRI findings; each tumor is not more than
             10 mm in maximal linear dimension; each tumor should comply with Gleason 6 = (3 + 3)
             score requirements.

          -  No definite evidence of extracapsular extension or seminal invasion by MRI

          -  Patient should be eligible for both spinal/epidural anesthesia (planned procedure),
             and general anesthesia (in case of complication, requiring intervention).

          -  Patient is willing and able to give consent attend all study visits and complete all
             questionnaires as defined in the protocol

          -  Prostate gland volume should be no greater than 60 ml, volumetrically measured.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  ASA status &gt; 2

          -  Claustrophobia

          -  Implanted ferromagnetic materials or foreign objects

          -  Individuals who are not able or willing to tolerate the required prolonged stationary
             supine position during treatment (approximately 3 hrs. sonication time)

          -  Any spinal pathology which can prevent safe administration of epidural/spinal
             anesthesia

          -  Evidence  for lymph node involvement of cancer
