            "textblock": "Colorectal Cancer is the third most common cause of cancer in Canada with an estimated\n      lifetime risk of developing the disease of 6-7%. Each year there are approximately 21,000\n      new cases and 9,100 deaths attributable to this disease. Colonoscopy is one of several\n      methods recommended for Colorectal Cancer (CRC) screening by current guidelines. While\n      colonoscopy is the most invasive, it offers high diagnostic accuracy and ability for therapy\n      (biopsy and removal of adenomas) compared to other modalities. The emerging evidence\n      regarding missed neoplastic lesions with colonoscopy has resulted in quality initiatives\n      designed to improve colonoscopy performance. I-Scan (Pentax, Montvale, NJ) is a new method\n      that uses post processing computer algorithms to revise the standard white light to\n      highlight pit patterns and vascular surface patterns.The relevant I-scan settings in the\n      colon are I-scan 1 and I-scan 2. The primary objective of the study is to compare the\n      adenoma detection rate in the right colon using High-definition white light colonoscopy\n      versus I-scan enhanced colonoscopy.\n\n      All patients referred for a screening colonoscopy at Forzani and MacPhail Colon Cancer\n      Centre will be considered for enrollment.All eligible patients that are not part of another\n      research study will be approached for enrollment into the study. During the pre-assessment\n      at the clinic a study assistant will contact all the eligible patients to describe the study\n      and provide an \"Invitation to participate in a Research study\" form. The study assistant\n      will obtain a final consent if they agree. Those not interested will simply receive the\n      Centre's standard protocol. There will be no coercion of any sort. Following Informed\n      Consent, treatment allocation through computer generated randomization will be revealed.\n      Patients will be allocated to one of the three study arms (HD Colon, I-scan 1 and I-Scan 2).\n      Patients will receive a standard bowel preparation: Split dose Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) (2L\n      at noon + 2L at 8 PM the day before) for morning procedures or (2L at 8Pm the day before and\n      2L at five hours before the procedure on the day of colonoscopy) for afternoon procedure.\n      certified gastroenterologists will perform all of the procedures with the assistance of a\n      nurse. The planned \"second look\" of the right colon will involve withdrawing from the Cecum\n      to Hepatic flexure, then re-inserting to Cecum and finally withdrawing through the entire\n      colon. The physician performing the procedure will then fill a \"Colonoscopy Report Form\"\n      including the number of polyps detected, size, shape, polypectomy method and cleanliness of\n      the bowel.\n\n      The investigators did a pilot study with 150 subjects to check the mean no.of adenomas per\n      colonoscopy, no.of adenomas detected in the right colon during the second look and to\n      estimate the recruitment rate. Based on those results the investigators started this study\n      with a large sample size. The investigators are planning to do an interim analysis after\n      recruiting 450 subjects (30% of total enrollment). The results of the analysis will\n      determine whether the investigators complete recruitment of the initially approved sample\n      size of 1500 subjects."
