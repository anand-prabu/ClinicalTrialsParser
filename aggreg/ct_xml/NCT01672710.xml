  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gulf War illness is found in about one fourth of veterans of the 1990-1991 Gulf War and is
      characterized by persistent memory and concentration problems, headaches, fatigue and muscle
      and joint pain. It is not known what causes the illness, but exposure to chemicals is
      suspected.  The Hubbard detoxification program consists of exercise and sauna therapy
      together with administration of several dietary supplements, particularly crystalline niacin
      used at increasing concentrations over a period of about four weeks.  The investigators
      hypothesize that this program will reduce symptoms, as tested by administration of cognitive
      and quality of life tests and serum clinical chemistry tests.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized controlled trial of changes in fatigue and pain symptoms, measured
      quality of life, mental health status, and neuro-cognitive functioning of a group of GWVs
      after a 4 to 6 week sauna detoxification regimen as compared to control. For control
      subjects we will also have a group of GWVs receiving usual care who are randomly assigned to
      a waitlist and who will start the intervention after a four to six week delay.  The waitlist
      group will also take part in the baseline tests a second time just prior to their treatment
      4 to 6 weeks later and a 7-day post-treatment battery of tests the same as described for the
      treatment group. Finally, there will be a 3-month follow-up with both the groups.  The
      Severna Park Health and Wellness Center (SPHWC) is a commercial center that offers the
      Hubbard detoxification program.  The investigators will contract with SPHWC to provide the
      program to the subjects of this study and to provide office space for the Study Coordinator,
      so that all components of this project except the initial Physician evaluation and blood
      sample acquisition can be done at the Center, not just the detoxification.

      Study Variables:  The investigators will examine:

        -  Quality of life as measured by the Veterans Short Form (SF36-V). The SF36-V also
           includes physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) component summary scores.

        -  Case status for GWI will be assessed utilizing the Kansas criteria.

        -  Symptoms of GWI will be measured with the Kansas Gulf War Veterans Health Project
           Questionnaire, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, and the short-form McGill Pain
           Questionnaire.

        -  Cognitive function will be measured with a battery of neurocognitive tests. These will
           include visual motor, memory and executive functioning as measured by the Trailmaking
           test, Grooved Pegboard, Wechsler Memory Abbreviated test, and the Stroop color word
           test. To account for potential confounding in neurocognitive testing, mental health
           status will be evaluated using the Symptom Checklist 90 revised and the State Trait
           Anxiety Inventory.

        -  Physical health status will be measured via standard medical examination and laboratory
           analyses of serum metabolic panel, lipid profile and hormones.

      Sampling Method:  This will be a convenience sample and will consist of Gulf War Veterans
      who meet the Kansas case definition for Gulf War illness and reside in the
      Washington/Baltimore area.  The individuals who show interest in this study, who meet
      eligibility criteria and subsequently agree to participate will be selected to enroll in the
      study.

      Randomization: Volunteers will be randomly assigned to a group when they enroll.  One group
      will be the immediate experimental intervention group and one group will be the wait-list
      control group.  Random assignment will be achieved by use of sequentially numbered, opaque,
      sealed envelopes.  Both will undergo the detoxification protocol, but the control group will
      be tested twice prior to treatment.
