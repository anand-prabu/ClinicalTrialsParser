Both diets are designed\n      to maintain weight at a constant level.  The diets are balanced nutritionally and have the\n      same amount of protein.  One diet has higher amounts of sugar, while the other has higher\n      amounts of fat.  For one 10-day period, the diet will be fed as two large meals\n      ('meal-feeding').  For the other 10-day period, the identical diet will be fed as 8 small\n      meals ('nibbling').  Half of the participants will meal-feed first, while the other half\n      will 'nibble' first.  The order of nibbling or meal feeding will be determined randomly.\n\n      At the end of each 10-day feeding period, participants will spend two nights in a research\n      ward (Clinical Research Center) to undergo testing."
