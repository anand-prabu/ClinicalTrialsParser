Approximately 100\n      patients who are planned to receive chemotherapy for malignant tumor will be invited to\n      participate in this trail. A 1 or less 1-week tenofovir prophylaxis treatment should be\n      administered by all subjects prior to the chemotherapy and eligible subjects will be\n      randomly assigned to extend 24-week prophylaxis group A or 48-week prophylaxis group B in a\n      1:1 ratio at the end of the chemotherapy. The subjects could be stopped or withdrawn from\n      this study earlier if HBV relapses or need to receive another course of chemotherapy\n      respectively. The relapse episode will be followed until 24 weeks after the end of\n      prophylaxis therapy. Data collection will take place at screening, every cyclic visit of\n      chemotherapy, at the end of chemotherapy, and the following prophylaxis period, then every 4\n      weeks during the follow-up period. Patients in both groups will be treated with tenofovir or\n      other antiviral agent according to investigator judgement when HBV relapse after\n      discontinuation of tenofovir therapy."
