Beginning on day 1, patients undergoing autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC)\n      transplantation receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily until leukapheresis is\n      completed.  Leukapheresis begins on approximately day 4 and continues until adequate CD34+\n      PBSC are collected.\n\n      PBSC are collected from syngeneic donors in a similar manner. Patients undergo total-body\n      irradiation twice daily on days -5 and -4. Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -3\n      and -2 and anti-thymocyte globulin IV on days -5, -3, -1, 1, 3, and 5.  Patients undergo\n      autologous or syngeneic PBSC transplantation on day 0.  Following PBSC transplantation,\n      patients receive oral prednisone on days 7-30 and G-CSF IV daily beginning on day 0 and\n      continuing until blood counts recover.\n\n      Patients are followed at 30, 80, and 90 days, monthly for 6 months, and then at 1 and 2\n      years."
