Insulin resistance is significantly associated with the long-term\n      risks of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Acupuncture with electrical\n      stimulation has in rats with dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-induced PCOS been shown to improve\n      insulin sensitivity. Whether these findings can be translated into women with PCOS has not\n      been investigated. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate whether acupuncture improves\n      insulin sensitivity, ovulation rate and quality of life in women with PCOS. Our hypothesis\n      is that acupuncture with combined manual and low-frequency electrical stimulation of the\n      needles improves insulin resistance, induces ovulation and improves quality of life."
