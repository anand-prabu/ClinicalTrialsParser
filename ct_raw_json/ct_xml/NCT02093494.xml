  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open label study to evaluate the Initial Specimen Diversion Device
      (ISDD) in reducing the contamination rate in blood culture analysis.  Blood culture data
      will be derived from inpatient and/or outpatient settings in a variety of hospital
      departments (e.g. ER, surgical, medical, etc.).  Only samples that are collected via PIVC's
      may be included in this study.  The ISDD will be compared to current laboratory practices
      for the collection of blood for culture purposes.  Laboratory Standard Procedures (LSP) is
      defined as collection of venipuncture blood for culture without an initial diversion method
      to divert and sequester potential blood contaminants.

    <description>As the device under study enhances the blood diversion procedure during blood culture collection, and is part of standard blood collection standards, adverse device effects are not expected as a result of use of this device.  Any issues with the function of the device will be reported by the phlebotomist on a device incident form.  The sponsor will maintain these reports in a database.  As this is a commercially available device, medical device reporting shall be performed in accordance with 21 CFR 803, as applicable.</description>
