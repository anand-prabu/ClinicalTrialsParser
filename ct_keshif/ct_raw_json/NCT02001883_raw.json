As alternatives, nonstatin drugs, such as\n      ezetimibe, are often prescribed in association with moderate-to-low intensity statin.\n\n      It remains unknown, however, whether the association between moderate-to-low intensity\n      statin therapy and and nutraceuticals (i.e. compounds derived from foods with cholesterol\n      lowering actions) can have a therapeutic role in high-intensity statin-intolerant patients."
