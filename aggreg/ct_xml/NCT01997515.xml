  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic surgery for gastric reduction is frequently associated with high levels of
      postoperative pain. Postoperative pain is very often treated with opioids. However large
      doses of opioids can result in respiratory depression with hypoxemia especially in high risk
      patients with obstructive sleep apnea.  since a large group of patients undergoing surgery
      for gastric reduction surgery also have obstructive sleep apnea, it is expected that these
      patients are also at high risk for postoperative respiratory depression and hypoxemia.

      Intraoperative ketamine has been used as an effective multimodal agent to reduce
      postoperative pain. However, ketamine alone has not been examined to improve postoperative
      pain outcomes in patients undergoing gastric reduction surgery. More importantly, it is
      unknown if the use of intraoperative ketamine can lead to better overall quality of recovery
      in the same patient population. In addition, ketamine has been shown to improve ventilation
      but it remains to be determined if the intraoperative use of ketamine will result in less
      postoperative hypoxemic events.

      The main objective of the current investigation is to examine the effect of intraoperative
      ketamine on postoperative quality of recovery after gastric reduction surgery. The
      investigators hypothesize that subjects receiving ketamine will have a greater global
      quality of recovery score than the ones receiving saline. The investigators also seek to
      determine if intraoperative ketamine would decrease the incidence of postoperative hypoxemic
      events in the same patient population.
