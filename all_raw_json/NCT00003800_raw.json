The choice of treatment is determined by the\n      physician and the patient. Patients with pathologically positive resected lymph nodes may\n      undergo treatment (observation or adjuvant chemotherapy) at investigator's discretion.\n\n      All patients are tested by quantitative radiology and blood markers (HCG and AFP) at\n      baseline and then at various times after surgery to identify pathologic stage II disease.\n      The timing of these studies depends on the stage of disease and/or type of disease\n      management.\n\n      Patients who undergo RPLND, have stage I or II disease, and do not receive adjuvant therapy\n      (radiation or chemotherapy) are followed monthly during year 1, every 2 months during year\n      2, every 6 months during years 3-5, and annually thereafter.\n\n      Patients who undergo RPLND, have stage II disease, and receive adjuvant therapy are followed\n      every 2 months during year 1, every 4 months during year 2, every 6 months during years 3-5,\n      and annually thereafter.\n\n      Patients who do not undergo RPLND are followed monthly during year 1, every other month\n      during year 2, every 6 months during years 3-5, and annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 315 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
