  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rate of adolescent extreme obesity is rapidly rising, and impacting quality of life,
      psychosocial situation, and health of the affected youth. However, as few of these
      adolescents seek medical care, little is known about the longitudinal course of adolescent
      extreme obesity.

      In this study, the investigators aim to provide structured care for adolescents with obesity
      and extreme obesity over a prolonged period of time, and to gain information on the course
      of obesity and the success of different treatment options. The study is a subproject of the
      &quot;Medical and psychosocial implications of adolescent extreme obesity - acceptance and
      effects of structured care&quot;, short: &quot;Youth with Extreme obesity Study (YES)&quot;, which aims at
      improving the medical care and social support structures for youth with obesity and extreme
      obesity in Germany. Obese youth and young adults (BMI ≥ 30kg/m2) between the ages of 14 and
      21 years are eligible to participate. Participants will have a physical check-up every 6
      months, complete questionnaires on their health, socioeconomic status and wellbeing, and are
      offered blood test and diagnostic procedures to assess comorbidities. Participants are
      offered support and guidance for social and vocational integration. The study will evaluate
      and inform treatment and support options for adolescents with extreme obesity.

      Little is known about the longitudinal course of adolescent extreme obesity. In this
      multicenter study, the investigators aim to enroll adolescents with extreme obesity (BMI ≥
      35kg/m2) in a 9 year longitudinal, prospective observation that will reveal information on
      the course of obesity and the success of different treatment options. Adolescents with more
      moderate degrees of obesity (BMI 30-34,9kg/m2) will serve as a control group. The project
      builds on the Consortium &quot;Medical and psychosocial implications of adolescent extreme
      obesity - acceptance and effects of structured care&quot;, short: &quot;Youth with extreme obesity
      Study (YES)&quot;, which comprises the recruitment and characterization of obese youth from
      different healthcare- and non healthcare settings, a randomized controlled trial to
      investigate a novel intervention targeted at improving quality of life and social
      functioning of extremely obese adolescents, a structured prospective evaluation of
      adolescent bariatric surgery, and economic assessments of the financial burden of extreme
      adolescent obesity on the healthcare system.

      Based on the current state of knowledge, the investigators have formulated the following a
      priori hypotheses in regards to the longitudinal observation study:

        1. Youth with extreme obesity (BMI ≥ 35kg/m2) achieve lower adherence with the structured
           care program compared to adolescents with more moderate degrees of obesity (BMI
           30-34,9kg/m2).

        2. Youth with extreme obesity (BMI ≥ 35kg/m2) are less likely to achieve and sustain
           weight loss over a prolonged period of time, compared to adolescents with more moderate
           degrees of obesity (BMI 30-34,9kg/m2).

        3. Youth with extreme obesity (BMI ≥ 35kg/m2) are harder to integrate in the job market
           compared to youth with more moderate degrees of obesity (BMI 30-34,9kg/m2).

        4. Youth with extreme obesity (BMI ≥ 35kg/m2) have higher incidence and severity of
           co-morbidities compared to youth with more moderate degrees of obesity (BMI
           30-34,9kg/m2).

      The investigators aim to recruit a total of 600 adolescents age 14 to 21 years with extreme
      obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2) and 600 adolescents with obesity (BMI 30-34.9 kg/m2) over a 24
      months period. The five participating university centers are distributed across 4 geographic
      regions in the North (Berlin), in the West (Essen/Datteln), in the East (Leipzig) and in the
      South (Ulm) of Germany, and will therefore render data that are representative of Germany as
      a whole. Adolescent will be examined biannually, and testing will include an array of
      standardized questionnaires and validated instruments to assess health, psycho-social
      situation, psychiatric co-morbidities and health related quality of life, as well as a
      physical examination, laboratory tests, and screenings for orthopedic co-morbidities and
      sleep apnea. Participants are offered support and guidance in regards to social and
      vocational integration with the aim of improving self esteem and social functioning. Data
      will be entered in an extended version of the &quot;German National Register for Longitudinal
      Research on Childhood Obesity&quot;. We will perform sub-analyses based on the treatment options
      these youths have followed The project will reveal the acceptance and outcomes of a
      structured healthcare program for adolescents with extreme obesity and provide unique
      information on the medical and psychosocial development of adolescents with extreme obesity
      in Germany.
