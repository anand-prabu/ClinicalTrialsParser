Age 18 to 50 years\n\n          3. Body mass index (BMI) 18-32 kg/m2\n\n          4.

Male subjects who are not surgically sterile must agree to use one of the\n                  following birth control methods if sexually active:\n\n                    -  Double-barrier contraceptive (e.g., condom plus diaphragm, condom or\n                       diaphragm with spermicidal gel/foam)\n\n                    -  Female partner is at least two years postmenopausal or surgically sterile\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1.

Concurrent clinically significant medical diagnosis that would potentially interfere\n             with the subject's study compliance or confound the study results\n\n          3. Concurrent social conditions (e.g., drug or alcohol abuse, transportation\n             difficulties) that would potentially interfere with the subject's study compliance\n\n          4. Clinically significant illness within 30 days preceding entry into the study\n\n          5. Participation in an investigational drug study within 30 days or 5 half-lives,\n             whichever is longer, before Screening\n\n          6. Use of prescription medications within 14 days before Day 1 and throughout the study.\n             (The use of non-prescription or over-the-counter medications is prohibited within 7\n             days before Day 1 and throughout the study.
