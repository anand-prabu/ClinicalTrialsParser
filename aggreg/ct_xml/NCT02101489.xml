  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This purpose of this study is to study whether the use of a 3D preoperative ultrasound is
      helpful to determine where to place the sling in the mid female urethra.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effect of 3D preoperative ultrasound in optimization of sling
      placement in the mid female urethra. Women who have chosen to undergo trans-vaginal tape
      sling (TVT) for stress urinary incontinence will be asked to enroll in this randomized
      trial. Ten women will be randomized to receive a preoperative ultrasound before surgery and
      20 women will have our normal pre-operative assessment (which does not include an
      ultrasound) for the treatment of symptomatic stress urinary incontinence. Randomization will
      be performed by the FPMRS study coordinator after a woman has given her informed consent and
      meets the study criteria. Women randomized to receive a preoperative 3-D ultrasound will
      then undergo a 5-minute trans-vaginal ultrasound (BK Flex Focus ultrasound with the 8838
      transvaginal probe). The ultrasound will measure the urethral length and identify the
      mid-urethra region for that patient. The measurement will be placed in the pre-operative
      note. Transvaginal ultrasound is well-tolerated and has no complications associated with it.
       Women who receive our &quot;usual care&quot; will have no pre-operative ultrasound performed. Women
      enrolled in the study will then proceed to surgery as scheduled.

      At the time of surgery the information on the length of the urethra will be used to
      determine the placement of the sling. The surgery will proceed in its usual fashion.

      Using the BK Flex Focus ultrasound with a trans-vaginal (8838) and translabial transducers.
      These transducers are commonly used to assess for pelvic masses, abnormalities or foreign
      body. We will measure and record the length of the urethra and will map out the mid-urethral
      point for sling placement; we will also compare the urethral length measurement obtained by
      preoperative 3D ultrasound to intra-operative urethral length measurement using a Foley
      catheter. Measurements will be recorded from the bladder neck to the urethral opening. A
      representational image will be saved.

Measurement of the urethral length in cm using the 3 D ultrasound and marking the mid-urethral point for sling placement.  We will then compare the mid-point location of the midurethral sling between the group that received a preoperative ultrasound to the group that didn't receive a preoperative ultrasound at 6 weeks for both groups using the 3 D ultrasound.
