  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral Lichen Planus (OLP) is a common condition with its erosive variant occasionally
      presenting a management challenge to the clinician. In addition it can have debilitating
      consequences on the patients' quality of life. The malignant transformation of OLP has been
      well documented. The aims of this work were to measure the number of patients developing
      malignant transformationof OLP to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) comparing patients
      undergoing traditional symptomatic treatments with those patients that were treated by CO2
      laser from 2004 - 2011. Outcome measures were rated by incisional biopsy (histology Report).
