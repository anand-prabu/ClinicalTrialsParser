Over half of new\n      cases are in East Asia. The traditional chemotherapy for AEGC remains on intravenous (IV)\n      fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin, and the anthracyclines. Trials favoured the combined use of\n      5-FU and cisplatin for superior efficacy and quality of life in AEGC patients. Recent years,\n      oral chemotherapy has a more practical and economic advantages over IV regimen. It is\n      understandable that patients prefer oral regimens as long as the clinical efficacy is\n      maintained. Oral treatment strategy preserves quality of life for AEGC patients. In\n      addition, it may also have additional cost saving in the nursing and pharmacy time. It is\n      because a significant amount of time can be saved in both nursing and pharmacy for the\n      preparation and administration of IV chemotherapy However, there is a lack of local data to\n      demonstrate the impact of pharmacy and nursing care utilizing capecitabine-based regimen\n      comparing to traditional IV chemotherapy in MCRC patients of Hong Kong."
