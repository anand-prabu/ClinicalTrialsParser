      Our objective is to develop a community-based cohort and novel genomic science resource for
      defining the biological significance of ancestry-related genomic variation in
      African-Americans within the G EN omics, Environmental FactORs and the Social DE terminants
      of Cardiovascular Disease in Africans Americans ST udy (GENE-FORECAST  ). This resource will
      enable our team to test the working hypothesis that race-ancestry differences in the burden
      of cardiovascular disease (CVD) reflects the influence of a unique interplay between the
      distinct genomic variation characteristic of African-Americans (AA) and the    exposome
      of social determinants and environmental factors that influence the pathogenesis of CVD in
      AA. The specific aims are:

      AIM I. To examine the associations between common or ancestry-related DNA variants and CVD
      risk factors (e.g. hypertension) and phenotypes (e.g. coronary artery calcification) in
      African-Americans (AA).

      AIM II. To examine the associations between health behaviors or social-environmental factors
      and CVD risk factors and phenotypes in AA.

      The study is designed to create a cohort amenable to nested case-control analyses based on a
      community-based sampling frame with a target size of approximately 1800 self-identified,
      U.S. - born, African-American (AA) men and women (ages 21-65) to be recruited over the next
      5-6 years from the metropolitan Washington DC, Montgomery County (MC) and Prince George   s
      County (PG) areas. The participant recruitment strategy will involve two complementary
      approaches: 1) we will contract with a well-established survey group (Southern Research
      Group) to conduct a random-digit telephone screening survey targeting study-eligible AA that
      will be consented and invited to an evaluation visit in the NIH Clinical Center; and 2) we
      will conduct a community outreach effort to recruit participants into the Clinical Center by
      leveraging the engagement of community-based leaders, organizations and faith-based
      institutions in the area. Given the high burden of CVD among AA, this approach will yield a
      sample with normal individuals as well as a high proportion of AA with CVD risk factors such
      as obesity and hypertension that predispose to the eventual clinical signs and symptoms of
      CVD (e.g. heart attack and stroke). Based on previous epidemiology studies, this protocol
      s participant ascertainment approach and the target demographic profile; it is anticipated
      that the prevalence of clinically manifest CVD (history of angina, heart attack or stroke)
      will be less than 10-15% of the sample. All participants (either ascertained by random
      telephone survey or community outreach) will undergo extensive evaluation in the Clinical
      Center that includes: medical evaluation (e.g. anthropometrics, blood pressure), laboratory
      tests (e.g. lipid levels, kidney function), social determinants profiles (e.g. socioeconomic
      status (SES), perceived stress, discrimination, depression, perceived neighborhood
      characteristics), blood/urine collection for deep-sequencing based    omic    analyses
      (whole exome sequencing, and RNA-Seq), as well as testing for    pre-clinical   , biomarkers
      of the pathobiological processes of CVD or    CVD phenotypes    (e.g. coronary artery
      calcification, microalbuminuria, leukocyte telomeres, or vascular dysfunction). It is
      anticipated that these deep sequencing efforts will yield novel ancestry-related DNA
      variants associated with the CVD phenotypes; yet with unclear biological significance in
      elucidating racial disparities in CVD. Accordingly, our protocol also includes a
      Genotype-to-Phenotype    (G2P) component that re- contacts subsets of the cohort based on
      their genotype (e.g. APOL1 chronic kidney disease risk alleles) for a    call-back    visit
      for more in-depth phenotyping and characterization of the potential effect of the DNA
      variant of interest on human systems biology. In some cases family members of the proband
      may also be invited to participate in these G2P studies to further characterize the
      biological significance of these putative functional DNA variants of interest.

      The primary outcome variables involve well established CVD phenotypes: 1) CVD risk factors
      (e.g. hypertension, dyslipidemia), 2) markers of pre-clinical CVD (i.e. coronary artery
      calcification, coronary plaque burden by cardiac CT angiography (CTA), carotid plaque burden
      by 3D ultrasound, vascular dysfunction, microalbuminuria, C-reactive protein, Vitamin D
      levels). The protocol will assess exposures associated with CVD and relevant covariates
      including: 1) social determinants (SES, perceived stress, discrimination, and depression);
      2) environmental factors such as neighborhood characteristics (geospatial features of
      healthy lifestyles [e.g. walkability]) and 3) behavioral factors (e.g. diet, physical
      activity). The G2P call-back visit protocol will involve additional measures of in-depth
      phenotyping that include: peripheral immune cell phenoty......

      subsets); 1) blood/immune cell RNA-seq; 2) iPSC cell line generation (endothelial; vascular
      smooth muscle cells) and analysis of cardiovascular cell systems biology; 3) HDL proteome
      analysis, 4) FDG PET/CT and/or PET/MRI scan (vascular inflammation) and 5) Echocardiography.

      It is anticipated that this multi-level, multi-dimensional analysis of genomic and
      phenotypic characteristics of AA will advance our understanding of the bio-social
      determinants of the intragroup variance and the increased overall burden of CVD observed
      among AA.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Community-based self-identified (non-institutionalized), US-born, African American men and
        women age 21-65 will be included in the study. This criterion is inclusive of
        self-identified AA of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic ethnicity.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Pregnant women and adults who are unable to provide informed consent will be excluded.
        Pregnant women will be excluded because of the potential adverse health effects from
        coronary CT angiography and PET studies. Pregnant women and nursing females will be
        excluded from FGD PET/CT and/or PET/MRI. Furthermore, all women of childbearing age need
        to have a negative pregnancy test prior to radiation exposure. Participants with
        pacemakers and/or any history of metal device implantation and/or metal in their body will
        be excluded from MRI according to clinical center guidelines. For CTA, patients with known
        allergic reaction to contrast will not be given contrast. Those with severe and disabling
        co-morbidities associated with endstage CVD will be excluded such as a recent history of
        hospitalization for manifestations of cardiovascular disease. Patients with renal failure
        (eGFR&lt; 60) will not be given either MRI or CTA IV contrast. Non-English speaking African
        Americans will be excluded.
