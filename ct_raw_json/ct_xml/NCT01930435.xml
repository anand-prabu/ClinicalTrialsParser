  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm study of the use of a personalized sterile humidification device for 12
      weeks for head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy to determine if the
      usage of this humidification system will result in a decrease in severity in head and neck
      related quality of life as measured by the MDASI HN subscale following radiation therapy as
      compared with historical experience. In addition, we are exploring correlative measures
      using CRP, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha level measurements as these are directly related to
      mucositis and presumably related to quality of life as indicated by the patient.
