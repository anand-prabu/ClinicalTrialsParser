  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Differences in human oral sensitivity for caproic, lauric, oleic, linoleic, and linolenic
      acids will be explored. Prior work indicates that there may be a learning effect in
      measuring detection thresholds for free fatty acids.  This study is designed to determine
      the number of visits necessary to attenuate this learning effect and also to test whether
      this effect continues across different types of fatty acids or is specific to each fatty
      acid.  This will aid in understanding how many visits are required to obtain reliable data
      and if less expensive fatty acids can be used to attenuate learning before testing
      thresholds for more expensive fatty acids.

    <measure>Oral sensitivity to oleic, lauric, linoleic, linolenic and caproic acids measured by the ascending 3 alternative forced choice test as described in American Society and Testing and Methods E679</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at weekly intervals over 3 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Thresholds for taste of each fatty acid will be determined using the 3 alternative forced choice test.  Participants will taste 3 samples, one of which contains a fatty acid, and select which sample they believe is different.  The concentration of fatty acid used will range from very dilute to a maximum of 5%.  The test is repeated over the range of concentrations until a participant is able to correctly identify the fatty acid or until the maximum concentration is reached.</description>

    <measure>DNA sequence of potential fatty acid receptors (e.g., CD36, GPR120, GPR48)</measure>

    <description>Saliva will be collected to analyze any correlations between fatty acid receptor genes and sensitivity.</description>
