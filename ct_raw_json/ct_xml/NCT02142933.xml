    <textblock>
      1. At the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland, a simplified screening for group B
           streptococci (GBS) of vagina and perineum has been performed since several years.
           Reliable detection of GBS is critical to prevent GBS transmission during delivery with
           antimicrobial prophylaxis. Transmission of GBS to the neonate may otherwise lead to
           severe infection and complications in the neonate. CDC and other international
           organizations recommend a vaginal and additional rectal swab.We therefore aim to test
           this simplified screening against the international gold standard.

        2. Antibiotic resistant bacteria may reside in the genital tract of an expected mother and
           may be transmitted to the new-born during delivery. In case of infection of the
           pregnant woman or the neonate, application of standard antimicrobial treatment will
           insufficiently cover these extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria.
           Therefore, colonization with ESBL in pregnancy needs to be known to potentially deliver
           adequate antimicrobial treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transmission of GBS under delivery leads in 1/1000 of live births to severe sepsis in the
      neonate and may have serious sequelae including death. Most of the cases concern early onset
      sepsis which occurs in the first three to seven days after birth. Several randomized studies
      showed that antibiotic prophylaxis during delivery reduces the risk of early onset sepsis in
      the neonate in 85%, whereas late onset sepsis was not affected. Accurate screening including
      appropriate culture methods are critical for the wealth of the newborn and the decision
      regarding application of antibiotic prophylaxis to the mother. In this study we compare a
      simplified test algorithm taking swabs from the vagina and the perineum only versus a
      combined vaginal and rectal swab for GBS culture which is the current gold standard of
      diagnosis as the culture yield for GBS increases substantially when samples are taken from
      both the lower vagina and the rectum compared to swabbing the vagina or endocervix only.
      There is certain reluctance for performing a rectal swab as it has been associated with
      discomfort.

      The study aims to demonstrate that this simplified vagino-perineal swab leads to a similar
      GBS detection rate as compared to the gold standard comprising of a combined vaginal and
      rectal swab. We further aim to systematically assess the degree of discomfort with the
      rectal swab and compare the costs when applying those different methods.

      Additionally we aim to determine the prevalance and risk factors of community acquired ESBL
      by further processing the swabs in the appropiate culture media and filling in a
      standardized questionnaire.

      We plan a prospective cohort study with inclusion of 450 pregnant women who attend the
      outpatient obstetric clinic for routine control in the third trimester.
