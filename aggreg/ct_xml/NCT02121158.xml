    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this trial is to study the safety and efficacy of ICD implantation as a
      primary prevention strategy of sudden cardiac death in patients 70 years and older. This
      study will assess the many competing factors involved with ICD implantation including 1) the
      impact on mortality, especially in the context of a declining rate of sudden death with
      advanced age, 2) the tolerability of the powerful therapeutic action of the device, and 3)
      the impact on quality of life.

      The overall aim of this trial is to study the safety and efficacy of ICD implantation as a
      primary prevention strategy of SCD in patients 70 years and older. In particular, this study
      is designed to determine the comparative effectiveness of ICD, in addition to the optimal
      standard of care (OSC), in reducing all-cause mortality, versus OSC alone; OSC includes
      standard intervention for chronic heart failure patients, i.e. lifestyle modification,
      disease management, adoption of healthy diet and exercise practices, etcetera. One
      particularly important secondary objective is to assess treatment efficacy under the
      conditions of high versus low co-morbidity burden.

      Participants will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to ICD + OSC or OSC alone, and stratified by
      participating site and co-morbidity level (Charlson score &lt;3 versus  3). Acute treatment
      visits will occur as per site-specific conventions prior to the implantation, and within 1-4
      months post-implantation; central follow-up will occur every 6 months thereafter, until
      study close. Neither  the participant nor the treating clinician will be masked to
      treatment.

      Primary Objective:

      The primary objective of this study is to determine if a primary prevention strategy with
      ICD implantation in addition to optimal standard of care (OSC) is effective in reducing
      all-cause mortality compared to OSC alone in patients 70 years of age and older who are
      eligible for ICD therapy according to current Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)
      criteria.

      Primary Hypothesis:

      The primary hypothesis of this study is that implantation of an ICD plus optimal standard of
      care will reduce all-cause mortality in patients 70 years of age and older versus optimal
      standard of care alone.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. One secondary objective of this study is to ascertain whether age, co-morbidity burden,
           or age and burden together, are determinants in mortality outcomes in the OSC versus
           ICD + OSC group.

        2. An additional secondary objective of the study is to determine the effect of ICD
           implantation plus optimal standard of care on QoL among elderly patients compared with
           optimal standard of care.
