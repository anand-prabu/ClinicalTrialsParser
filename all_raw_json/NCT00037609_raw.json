            "textblock": "Rationale for this study:\n\n      Capecitabine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as 2nd or 3rd line\n      chemotherapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer who previously have failed both\n      anthracycline and taxane chemotherapy. Capecitabine produces objective tumor response of\n      around  20% with a median duration of response of 32 weeks in these patients (1). These\n      results indicate that improvements in the treatment of anthracycline and taxane resistant\n      breast cancer are needed. Exisulind (sulindac sulfone, FGN-1, APTOSYNTM) is a sulfone\n      metabolite of sulindac, a widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drug. Sulindac\n      sulfone lacks inhibitory activity on the two isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX 1 and COX 2,\n      and is devoid of gastrointestinal and renal toxicity that is associated with NSAIDs.\n      Exisulind selectively stimulates programmed cell death in a variety of neoplastic cells\n      including colon, prostate, and mammary epithelial cells without affecting normal cells\n      (2,3). Exisulind inhibits the growth of breast cancer cell lines in vitro and also inhibits\n      chemically-induced mammary carcinogenesis in rats (4,5). The drug is also synergistic with a\n      diverse group of cytotoxic compounds including cisplatin, taxanes and retinoids (6).\n      Exisulind exerts its effects by inhibiting a novel phosphodiesterase that belongs to the\n      PDE5 family which specifically degrades cGMP (7). Inhibition of this enzyme results in a\n      rise in intracellular cGMP levels and leads to apoptosis through yet unknown mechanism.\n      Exisulind also inhibits transcription factor NF-kB (8). The NF-kB pathway is activated by\n      cellular stress including exposure to inflammatory cytokines, cytotoxic agents and oxidative\n      stress (9). It is believed that activation of NF-kB protects from cell death, therefore,\n      inhibition of this transcription factor may contribute to the proapoptotic, chemotherapy\n      potentiating effect of exisulind.\n\n      Exisulind selectively promotes apoptosis in neoplastic cells whereas chemotherapeutic drugs\n      induce programmed cell death in a non-selective manner. We hypothesize that combination of\n      the 2 drugs will increase response rates by selectively augmenting the cytotoxic activity of\n      chemotherapy. Furthermore, continuous maintenance treatment, between chemotherapy doses,\n      with a minimally toxic drug that selectively induces apoptosis of cancer cells may improve\n      response duration and ultimately may translate into improved survival and better quality of\n      life. Each drug alone has an established maximum tolerated dose in humans. However, the\n      combination of exisulind and capecitabine has not been tested. This phase I-II study is\n      proposed to test safety and efficacy of this combination in patients with metastatic breast\n      cancer."

Beta-HCG will be checked in premenopausal patients if\n             clinically indicated.\n\n          -  Patients with brain metastases whose disease remained stable for more than 6 months\n             after completing therapy to the brain are eligible.\n\n          -  Written informed consent.\n\n        In addition to the above, patients participating in the Phase II portion of this study:\n\n        Must have bidimensionally measurable or evaluable disease. Lytic lesions seen on plain\n        radiographs will be considered evaluable in conjunction with bone scan abnormalities.\n        Bone scan abnormalities alone, pure blastic bone metastases or irradiated lesions are not\n        considered measurable or evaluable and will not be accepted. Also, pleural or peritoneal\n        effusions will not be considered evaluable disease.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria\n\n        A patient must not be enrolled if any of the following criteria applies:\n\n          -  Known hypersensitivity to sulindac (CLINORIL).\n\n          -  Known hypersensitivity or contraindications to capecitabine (XELODAR) including prior\n             therapy with capecitabine.\n\n          -  Clinical or laboratory evidence of significant liver disease.\n\n          -  Concomitant treatment with cytotoxic agents other than capecitabine or participation\n             in any other investigational study.\n\n          -  Uncontrolled psychiatric, or social (addictive) disorders that would preclude\n             obtaining informed consent or patient participation in the study."
