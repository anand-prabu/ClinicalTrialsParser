  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As individuals age, their physical activity decreases and sedentary time increases. Even
      small changes in these two behaviors can greatly decrease risks for several major health
      problems, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and many cancers. Studies that use
      pedometers to encourage walking have successfully increased physical activity, but do not
      address sedentary behaviors such as television watching. The investigators propose to use a
      novel pedometer-like device (Jawbone Up) that encourages both increased physical activity
      and decreased sedentary time. First, the investigators will recruit 10 adults to participate
      in a brief intervention for six weeks. They will wear the wrist-based activity monitor and
      use a mini-tablet device to see feedback on their activity and sedentary time. They will
      also receive brief counseling weekly. The investigators will use this first study to
      investigate the basic feasibility of the intervention materials. Next, the investigators
      will recruit 20 adults and randomize them to receive the intervention for 12 weeks or to a
      waiting list. Here, the investigators will test the intervention with refinements made based
      on participant responses from the first small study. Our primary outcomes will be measures
      of feasibility and acceptability across all parts of the study. The investigators
      hypothesize that the intervention will be feasible and acceptable to the participants. The
      investigators will also measure physical activity, sedentary behavior, fitness, body fat,
      and psychological feelings of motivation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inadequate physical activity and extended bouts of sedentary time are prevalent in adults,
      increasing from middle age into older adulthood. Even small changes in behavior, such as
      standing or walking in place periodically to break up sedentary bouts, can have large
      effects on cardiometabolic risk factors. Pedometer-based walking interventions have
      demonstrated effectiveness in increasing physical activity in this population, but these
      interventions have not targeted sedentary behavior. Recent technological advances have
      produced activity monitors that are capable of intervening on both behaviors. These
      wrist-worn monitors provide feedback and motivation for walking as well as cues to action in
      the form of idle alerts. These idle alerts vibrate when the wearer has remained sedentary
      for an extended period of time. Several preliminary studies have shown that older adults are
      willing to break up their sedentary time if prompted, but interventions thus far have relied
      upon television commercials as a cue to action. Use of these monitors would allow idle
      alerts to occur throughout the day, not only during television watching periods. The purpose
      of the IMPACT study (Inactivity Monitoring and Physical Activity Controlled Trial) is to
      investigate the feasibility of using activity monitors to simultaneously target both
      physical activity and sedentary behavior. First, we will conduct a pre-pilot test (N = 10)
      over six weeks. This brief study will provide basic feasibility and acceptability
      information on the monitor, content for weekly sessions, and assessments. Results will be
      used to refine the intervention for use in a larger pilot two-arm randomized controlled
      trial (N = 20, 12 weeks). This trial, comparing the intervention to a wait-list control
      group, will test feasibility, acceptability, and health, behavioral, and psychological
      outcomes. The primary outcome will be physical activity, operationalized as
      objectively-measured minutes of moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity over seven
      days (SenseWear armband). We will also measure cardiorespiratory fitness, physical function,
      body composition, and psychosocial variables such as autonomous motivation. The results of
      this innovative project will provide a foundation for future intervention in sedentary
      behavior and potentially create a large public health impact in a population at unique risk.

    <description>Investigators will lend each participant 1 Jawbone Up activity monitor and 1 mini tablet device. Participants will receive weekly brief phone calls with counseling related to self-efficacy and self-regulation. The monitors will be programmed to provide &quot;idle alerts&quot; that vibrate when participants have reached a cut point for a bout of sedentary behavior (e.g., 30 minutes). Participants will monitor their progress using an app on the tablet that provides graphical feedback on physical activity and sedentary behavior.</description>
