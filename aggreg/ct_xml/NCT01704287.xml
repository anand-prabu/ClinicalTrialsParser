    <textblock>
      This study is being done to compare survival using pembrolizumab (MK-3475) or standard
      chemotherapy for participants with advanced melanoma (MEL) who have progressed after prior
      therapy. Participants will be randomized to receive either low dose pembrolizumab, higher
      dose pembrolizumab or Investigator-choice chemotherapy. The pembrolizumab dose will be
      blinded to Investigators and participants. The randomization to either pembrolizumab or
      Investigator choice chemotherapy will be conducted in open-label fashion. The four standard
      chemotherapy choices are carboplatin + paclitaxel, paclitaxel alone, dacarbazine, or
      temozolomide. Participants on standard chemotherapy who experience disease progression may
      be eligible to cross-over to treatment with pembrolizumab provided they meet
      protocol-specified requirements for cross-over.
