            "textblock": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and widely-impairing across racial and\n      ethnic groups. Higher rates of MDD have been observed among Latinos with limited\n      English-language proficiency relative to the general population. Although MDD is a highly\n      treatable condition, barriers to treatment access and delivery have been implicated in\n      precluding this group from utilizing and receiving mental health services. Fortunately,\n      Latinos tend to endorse positive attitudes toward psychosocial treatments for depression by\n      applying the valued belief of \"poner de su parte\" or being able to do their part in one's\n      recovery, a concept that is highly consistent with the framework of behavioral treatments\n      for depression.\n\n      The Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression (BATD), based on reinforcement theory,\n      may be well-equipped to address disparities associated with higher depression prevalence\n      rates and receipt of care among Latinos with limited English-language proficiency. Following\n      a small, open-label pilot study that yielded very promising results of BATD, the current\n      study will consist of a larger, randomized control trial (N = 60) that will compare BATD to\n      Supportive Counseling in outcomes of depression, activity level, and contact with positive\n      reinforcement in the environment.\n\n      Initial eligibility will be determined via a telephone screener, which will include\n      questions from the Mood Disorders, Substance Use and Dependence, and Psychotic Disorders\n      modules of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID-IV; First, Spitzer, Gibbon\n      & Williams, 2002).\n\n      Inclusion criteria consist of the following: 1) be a minimum of 18 years of age, 2) be of\n      Latino descent, 3) report limited English language proficiency, 4) meet current MDD\n      criteria, 5) have completed the 4th grade or higher either in their country of origin or in\n      the US, 6) not have current substance abuse or dependence, 7) have no Bipolar or Psychotic\n      Disorders, and 9) not be currently receiving psychotherapy, and 10) if currently taking\n      antidepressants, demonstrate pharmacological stability as indicated by 3 or more consecutive\n      months of use. Excluded individuals will be referred to mental health resources within the\n      community."
