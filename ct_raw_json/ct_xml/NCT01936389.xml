  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is the world's the second leading cause of irreversible blindness. The World Health
      Organization (WHO) estimated the incidence of blindness due to glaucoma to be 4.4 million
      people worldwide in 2002.   Intraocular pressure (IOP) is the sole proven modifiable risk
      factor for the development and progression of glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Medical therapy
      is aimed at lowering IOP in order to prevent or slow progression.

      Exfoliation syndrome (XFS) is the most common identifiable cause of open-angle glaucoma,
      affecting an estimated 60 to 70 million people worldwide. Approximately two-thirds of
      patients have disease in only one eye on clinical examination; however, XFS is detectable in
      the other eye with conjunctival biopsy. XFS is also a systemic disease, with effects on the
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems.

      Patients with XFS are twice as likely to convert from ocular hypertension to glaucoma.
      Glaucoma in XFS is more severe than primary open angle glaucoma. There is greater diurnal
      IOP fluctuation, greater visual field loss and optic nerve head damage at the time of
      diagnosis, poorer response to medications, more rapid visual field progression and more
      frequent need for surgery.

      Because you meet eligibility criteria for our study, we ask for your consent to participate
      in the study described below. In brief, you will be taking an investigational drug
      (AR-12286, rho-kinase Inhibitor) at either 0.5% or 0.7% once a day for 6 months. This drug
      is currently being tested in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, but not yet in
      glaucoma in exfoliation syndrome. Because of the mechanism of glaucoma in XFS and the
      mechanism of action of rho-kinase inhibitors, there is reason to think it would be more
      effective in eyes with XFS and glaucoma than in primary open-angle glaucoma (ordinary
      glaucoma). There will be a baseline and study day 1 visit, week 1 visit, month 1 and 3
      visit, week 13 visit, month 6 visit and a week 25 visit; for a total of 7 office visits.
