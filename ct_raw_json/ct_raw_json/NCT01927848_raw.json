Rosehip, that is sold as a nutritional supplement, has\n      been particular popular, and has been shown effective in relieiving pain - albeit the\n      evidence is scarce.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of specialized rosehip powder\n      nutritional additives (Rosenoids\u00ae) on knee joint function during walking in subjects with\n      knee-related walking limitations."
