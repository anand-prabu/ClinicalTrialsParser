  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to perform a double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) in
      young patients with recent-onset (RO) schizophrenia to target improvement in cognitive
      functioning within real-world treatment settings. We will compare the effects of web-based
      targeted cognitive training (TCT) vs. web-based general cognitive exercises (GCE), both
      delivered via portable laptop computers.  We will investigate the behavioral and functional
      changes seen immediately after the intervention as well as at 6-month follow-up, compared to
      a no-training control group (NTC). The aims of this project are based on the current state
      of early psychosis research, as well as our own experience with neuroscience-informed
      cognitive training in schizophrenia.

      H1.  TCT subjects will show significantly greater gains in global cognition, verbal
      learning/memory, and social cognition compared to GCE and NTC subjects.  These gains in the
      TCT group will be sustained at 6-month follow-up.

      H2. GCE subjects will show improvement in problem-solving and global cognition compared to
      no-training subjects. At 6 month follow-up, GCE subjects will show lower gains in global
      cognition and verbal learning/memory than TCT subjects.

      H3.  In TCT subjects, gains in global cognition and processing speed, and in social
      cognition, will correlate with improvements on 6-month measures of occupational and social
      functioning, respectively, as well as internalized stigma. These associations will be
      significantly greater in TCT subjects vs. GCE or NTC subjects.

      H4.  Symptom ratings will show improvement in all subject groups at 6 months. H5.  At least
      70% of randomized clients will complete &gt;20 hours of training in the TCT and GCE arms.

      H6.  Providers, clients, and carers will rate the TCT and GCE interventions as equally
      feasible, tolerable, and acceptable.

      H7A. Improvement in auditory processing speed (APS) on the frequency sweep discrimination
      task in the TCT subjects at 10 hours of training will indicate target engagement of auditory
      cortical processing, and will correlate with changes in global cognition by the end of
      training, and with changes in role functioning at 6-month follow-up.

      H7B. Improvement in the brain performance index (BPI) measure in the GCE subjects at 10
      hours will indicate target engagement of general cognitive control operations, and will
      correlate with changes in global cognition by the end of training, and with changes in role
      functioning at 6-month follow-up.

      H8A. Reward sensitivity (TEPS Anticipatory Pleasure) at baseline will show a significant
      association to change in global cognition in the TCT group.

      H8B Exploratory. Reward sensitivity (TEPS Anticipatory Pleasure) at baseline will show a
      significant association to change in global cognition in the GCE group.

    <description>Neurocognition will be assessed using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery [MCCB]. The MCCB assesses the following domains of neurocognitive functioning: 1) Speed of Processing, 2) Attention/Vigilance, 3) Working Memory, 4) Verbal Learning, 5) Visual Learning, 6) Reasoning and Problem Solving; and 7) Social Cognition. We will also assess Verbal Memory (HVLT delayed recall), Visual Memory (BVMT delayed recall), and administer an additional measure of Reasoning and Problem Solving [BACS Tower of London]. In addition to the MCCB measure of social cognition, we will assess the following constructs: affect recognition, emotional prosody [Penn Prosody Identification, and theory of mind [Faux Pas test.7 hours spread over 3 appointments in a 1-2 week period, 5 hours post-training and an additional 5 hours at a 6-month follow-up.</description>

    <description>We will measure and compare the feasibility and acceptability of the cognitive training programs integrated in the EIS through 1) attrition rates; 2) time to completion of training; 3) user and clinician ratings of acceptability.  At post-training (6 weeks), subjects will complete a Likert-type questionnaire composed of elements of a measure used previously by Brain Plasticity Institute to evaluate acceptability for their cognitive training software, and components of a measure we have used previously to assess acceptability of training in our recent-onset RCT. Items assess user experience and satisfaction with the programs, the web-based administration, and the training schedule. Clinicians and family members will complete a Likert-type questionnaire that assess their experience in supporting the clients to use the program, perceived impact on the clients, and the likelihood of using the program outside of a research study.</description>
