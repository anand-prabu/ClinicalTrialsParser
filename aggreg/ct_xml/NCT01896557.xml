    <textblock>
      Previous reports have shown a possible drug interaction between clopidogrel and proton pump
      inhibitors (PPI´s), which could result in increased number of adverse cardiovascular events
      among patients on dual antiplatelet therapy(DAPT). Because of this, ranitidin has been
      proposed as an alternative drug  to PPI´s for prophylaxis of gastrointestinal bleeding in
      patients who need DAPT. The study´s aim is to test the hypothesis that ranitidin doesn´t
      have any influence on clopidogrel pharmacodynamic.

      Study population: 100 patients with Stable Coronary Artery Disease from Heart Institute

      Inclusion Criteria:

        -  Age &gt; 18 years old

        -  Coronary artery disease, defined as previous myocardial infarction and/or coronary
           angioplasty and/or CABG surgery and/or coronariography showing obstruction of at least
           50 % in one of major epicardial vesses

        -  Treatment with Acetylsalicylic Acid (ASA) 100 mg/day

      Exclusion Criteria:

        -  Use in the last 7 days of oral anticoagulant or any other antiplatelet drug beside ASA

        -  Previous utilization of PPI or ranitidine in the last 7 days before randomization

        -  Active bleeding

        -  Pregnancy or woman of childbearing age without contraceptive method

        -  Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL or hematocrit &lt; 30 %, hematocrit &gt; 50 %, platelets &lt; 100.000/mm3
           or &gt; 500.000/mm3; creatinin clearance &lt; 50 ml/minute

        -  Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on the last 30 days before randomization (or
           PCI on the last year when drug-eluted stents are used); CABG surgery on the last 90
           days; acute coronay syndrome on the last 60 days

        -  Active malignant neoplasm

        -  Active peptic ulcer disease on the last 60 days or upper gastrointestinal bleeding any
           time in life

        -  Known allergy to the drugs clopidogrel, ranitidine or omeprazole

        -  Refuse to participate in the study]

      Methodology: The study has a double-blind, double-dummy prospective design. Clopidogrel
      action is evaluated by platelet function tests: VerifyNow, bioimpedance aggregometry and
      PFA-100. The patients  have measurements of platelet function on three moments: before
      starting clopidogrel; 1 week after DAPT with clopidogrel (without loading dose) plus ASA;
      and after 1 week of randomization to ranitidin 150 mg bid or omeprazole 20 mg bid.
