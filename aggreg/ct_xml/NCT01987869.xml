      The occurrence of severe nausea and vomiting of early pregnancy (hiperemezis gravid arum) is
      estimated between 0.3% to 1% of all pregnancies. Although hiperemezis gravid arum has been
      recognized for a long time, its pathophysiologic mechanisms are still poorly understood.
      Many theories have been advocated, but to date none of these have been convincing.

      It has been demonstrated that the nausea and vomiting associated with increased in serotonin
      liberation. This has provided a rationale for the treatment of these symptoms with specific
      serotonin antagonists.

      The aim of this trial was to investigate the possible relationship between hiperemezis
      gravid arum and serotonin liberation.
