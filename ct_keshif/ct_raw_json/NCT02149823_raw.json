Addressing these questions will further catalyze\n      research into a model of optimum social cognitive activity, and accelerate industry\n      development of agents suited to routine clinical administration."

However, the specificity\n      and mechanisms of these impairments remain unclear. Therefore, a better understanding of the\n      modulation of social cognition is a priority for developing interventions both pharmacologic\n      and psychosocial. The investigators propose here to examine the effects of oxytocin, known\n      to be a key regulator of social cognition through modulating frontolimbic neural circuitry,\n      on social cognition in schizotypal and borderline patients. In doing so, the aim is to\n      characterize a model of optimum social cognitive activity to direct the development of\n      treatments, including dosing and target population-specific effects.\n\n      To this end, the investigators propose to perform a 2-year study in which 30 patients, (15\n      schizotypal, 15 borderline) will perform 3 rounds of social cognition testing after three\n      acute single-dose treatment conditions (intranasal oxytocin dose of 24IU or 40IU or placebo)\n      separated by a washout period, in a repeated-measures, within-subjects, randomized,\n      placebo-controlled, double-blind, counterbalanced cross-over proof-of concept design. 15\n      healthy controls will not receive oxytocin/placebo and will perform 3 rounds of social\n      cognition tests separated by approximately 4 weeks, serving as a benchmark for normal\n      performance and a control for practice effects. Social cognitive testing will be performed\n      45 minutes after drug/placebo administration in an identical protocol each time. The social\n      cognitive test serving as primary outcome measure will be the Movie for the Assessment of\n      Social Cognition (MASC). as well as another test of social cognition, the Reading the Mind\n      in the Eyes test. The investigators will compare outcome measures at baseline (placebo day)\n      in schizotypal and borderline patients and healthy controls, and in schizotypal and\n      borderline patients across drug doses and placebo administration."
