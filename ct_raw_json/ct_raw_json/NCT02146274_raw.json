To achieve these goals, we\n      will link the nation's largest stroke registry, the American Heart Association (AHA) Get\n      With The Guidelines-Stroke program and nationwide Medicare claims data, coupled with\n      telephone interviews for longitudinal treatment and downstream patient-reported outcomes.\n\n      Design & Procedures:\n\n      Retrospective:  Using GWTG-Stroke database and its associated 1900 hospitals, we will\n      conduct several comparative research protocols prioritized by stroke survivor focus groups\n      and surveys. GWTG-Stroke registry clinical data linked with Medicare claims will be used for\n      analysis of effectiveness and safety of post-stroke therapies on long-term clinical outcomes\n      (n= 450,000). Outcomes of interest include:\n\n      \"Home-time\" (days alive and at home) Death Stroke/TIA readmission All-cause readmission\n      Cardiovascular readmission Bleeding readmission\n\n      Prospective:\n\n      We will use the existing AVAIL registry combined with an additional 2000 stroke survivors\n      for a combined cohort of over 5000 patients to obtain detailed information on\n      patient-reported outcomes. The AVAIL Registry (IRB # Pro00012243) collected data from 3000\n      stroke survivors between 2006 and 2008.  We plan to use these data to supplement our\n      prospective PROSPER study.  The PROSPER study will enroll a minimum of 2,000 subjects to\n      augment  the data collected from the AVAIL study. Consented patients from at least 75 sites\n      will complete interviews at 3 and 6 months after discharge.  We anticipate that the PROSPER\n      questionnaire will include the following tools: Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Patient Health\n      Questionnaire (PHQ8), modified Rankin scale (mRS), Barthel Index, EuroQOL (EQ-5D),\n      Stroke-specific quality of life (SSQOL-12) and Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily\n      Living (IADL).  Sites will consent interested patients and have them complete a patient\n      contact information form which includes, name, address, phone numbers, email address, etc.\n      Outcomes of interest include:  : Post-stroke fatigue, Depression, Chronic pain, Medication\n      intolerance, Modified Rankin scale (mRS), EuroQOL and Stroke-specific quality of life."
