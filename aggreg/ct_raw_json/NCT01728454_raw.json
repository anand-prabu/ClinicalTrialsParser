The start of dosing should commence as soon as possible after\n      ovulation following the end of the previous menstrual event.\n\n      For stage 3, subjects who are eligible to receive additional cycles of treatment and who\n      elect to continue treatment will be scheduled within a week before the second expected\n      menses (+/- 2 days), following the off-drug interval.
