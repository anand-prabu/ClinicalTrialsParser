      Background:

      - Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common motor disorder in children. CP often causes crouch
      gait, an abnormal way of walking. Knee crouch has many causes, so no single device or
      approach works best for everybody. This study   s adjustable brace provides many types of
      walking assistance. Researchers will evaluate brace options to find the best solution for
      each participant, and whether one solution works best for the group.

      Objective:

      - To evaluate a new brace to improve crouch gait in children with CP.

      Eligibility:

        -  Children 5   17 years old with CP.

        -  Healthy volunteers 5   17 years old.

      Design:

        -  All participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam.

        -  Healthy volunteers will have 1 visit. They will do motion analysis, EMG, and EEG
           described below.

        -  Participants with CP will have 6 visits.

        -  Visit 1:

      &lt; TAB&gt; 1. Motion analysis: Balls will be taped to participants    skin. This helps cameras
      follow their movement.

      &lt; TAB&gt; 2. EMG: Metal discs will be taped to participants    skin. They measure electrical
      muscle activity.

      &lt; TAB&gt; 3. Participants    knee movement will be tested.

      &lt; TAB&gt; 4. Participants will walk 50 meters.

      &lt; TAB&gt; 5. Participants    legs will be cast to make custom braces.

        -  Visit 2:

        -  Participants will wear their new braces and have them adjusted.

        -  Steps 1   3 will be repeated.

        -  EEG: Small metal discs will be placed on the participants    scalp. They record brain
           waves.

        -  Participants will have electrical stimulation of their knees and practice extending
           them.

        -  Participants will take several walks with the braces in different settings.

        -  Visits 3   5: participants will repeat the walking and some other steps from visit 2.

        -  Visit 6 will repeat visit 2.

      Objective

      The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate several configurations of a prototype Extension
      Assist Knee-Ankle-Foot Orthosis (EA-KAFO) in children with cerebral palsy (CP) who have a
      crouch gait pattern. Three forms of assistance will be provided at the knee joint including
      a passive-damper component, functional electrical stimulation (FES) to the quadriceps, and a
      motorized assist. One form will provide variable resistance at the ankle joint which can
      also promote knee extension. These will be compared to traditional bracing which typically
      improves crouch by blocking some or all motion at one or both joints.  We hypothesize that
      all assistive configurations will improve gait alignment and performance compared to the
      non-assisted conditions. We further hypothesize that a best solution for each participant
      will exist, but may vary across subjects due to the heterogeneity of CP and of crouch gait.
      Preliminary data on brain activation using EEG will be collected during all walking
      conditions.

      Study population

      Thirty (30) subjects, age 5-17, diagnosed with crouch gait from diplegic CP and 10 typically
      developing children will be recruited.

      Design

      This protocol will evaluate an EA-KAFO prototype consisting of a custom fabricated brace
      combined with a modular knee joint with three modes of operation: hinge (no assist), a
      passive spring-damper, and an active motorized assist. Since crouch can also be precipitated
      at the ankle, the orthotic ankle joint has an adjustable dynamic resistance (ADR) mechanism
      that can be locked (passive assist) to simulate a standard brace, free, or provide variable
      resistance to assist knee extension. Additionally, we will combine quadriceps FES with the
      hinge and the passive damper to create two hybrid configurations.  The hinge and the passive
      damper (Ultraflex  ) knee modules, and ADR ankle brace are FDA-approved (Class I),
      commercially available devices. The active motorized joint module and the two hybrid
      configurations have been evaluated by the FDA as non-significant risk to human subjects
      (Appendix F). Healthy controls will come for one visit, and participants with CP will
      complete 6 visits: 1) initial assessment and casting for custom leg brace; 2) EA-KAFO
      configuration and initial data collection; 3-5) accommodation to brace configurations; 6)
      final data collection. Motion capture, force plates, and electromyography (EMG) will be used
      for gait analysis while electroencephalography (EEG) will measure brain activity during
      walking.

      Outcome measures

      The primary outcome is the amount of knee crouch during gait.  The optimal solution for each
      individual will be that which provides the greatest reduction in peak knee angle. Secondary
      outcomes will include gait speed, knee extensor moment, and EEG activation profiles.

          -  A measured foot-thigh angle of -10 to 25 degrees in prone position.

          -  Diagnosed with crouch gait lacking at least 20 degrees of knee extension at mid
             stance during walking as assessed visually (exact level of crouch will be quantified
             after inclusion using gait analysis).

          -  Able to walk at least 30 feet without stopping with or without a walking aid (GMFCS
             Level I-III)

             it can modify brain activity

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        -Any neurological, musculoskeletal or cardiorespiratory injury, health condition, or
        diagnosis other than cerebral palsy that would affect the ability to walk as directed for

        -A history of a seizure in the past year or currently on medication to control seizures.
