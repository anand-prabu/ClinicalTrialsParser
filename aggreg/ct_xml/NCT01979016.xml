             that, in the opinion of the investigator, will likely require such treatment(s)
             during the first 4 weeks of study treatment:

               -  Systemic corticosteroids

               -  Immunosuppressive/immunomodulating drugs

               -  Phototherapy for AD

          4. Treatment with topical corticosteroids, tacrolimus and/or pimecrolimus within 1 week
             before the baseline visit

          5. Treatment with certain biologics

             before the baseline visit

          7. Planned major surgical procedure during the patient's participation in this study

          8. Patient is a member of the investigational team or his/her immediate family

          9. Treatment with a live (attenuated) vaccine within 12 weeks before the baseline visit

         10. Pregnant or breast-feeding women or women planning to become pregnant or breastfeed
             during the study
