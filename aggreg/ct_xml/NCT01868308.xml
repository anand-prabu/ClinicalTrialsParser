  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our objective is to investigate the predictive value of a panel of biomarkers associated
      with two biologically plausible pathways of preterm birth: membrane breakdown and cervical
      remodeling. The investigators will obtain cervical length, cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin,
      and a panel of novel cervicovaginal biomarkers associated with cervical remodeling in a
      prospective cohort of symptomatic women with a singleton pregnancy at high risk for preterm
      birth in an effort to better risk stratify this cohort.

    <textblock>
      Preterm Birth is a complex syndrome for which several different biologically plausible
      pathways have been proposed, including mechanical uterine distension, abruption,
      inflammation, and/or activation of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-axis. However, despite
      our knowing the complexity of this syndrome and the different pathways involved, there is a
      paucity of clinical studies investigating whether detection of more than one of these
      pathways in a single patient might enhance the identification of those at greatest risk for
      preterm birth. We propose investigating the predictive value of a panel of biomarkers
      associated with two biological plausible pathways - membrane breakdown and cervical
      remodeling - that must be involved in the pathogenesis of preterm birth. Specifically, we
      propose measuring cervical length and collecting cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin as well as
      a panel of novel cervicovaginal biomarkers that reflect molecular pathways involved in
      cervical remodeling in a prospectively collected cohort of symptomatic women with singleton
      fetuses at high risk for preterm birth. Through this study we hope improve risk
      stratification of this high risk cohort.
