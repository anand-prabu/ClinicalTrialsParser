Patient's fatigue status, to be measured by the Brief Fatigue\n      Inventory-Taiwanese Form (BFI-T), will be the primary endpoint. The fatigue improvement\n      response rate among patients between two study arms will then be compared as the basis for\n      efficacy evaluation at the end of the first treatment cycle, and will be the primary\n      endpoint. Other endpoints, the fatigue improvement response rate and the mean fatigue scores\n      change from baseline among patients within and between cycles will be included in the\n      secondary efficacy endpoints, and will be compared between two study arms. Patients' quality\n      of sleep, appetite, pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and global quality of life (QoL) will be\n      also measured by 11 questions (SS11) from EORTC(European Organization) for Research and\n      Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 for secondary endpoint evaluation. The other secondary endpoints\n      include Karnofsky performance scores, and weight change and its related c-reactive protein\n      level of the patients."

Patient's fatigue status will be assessed by\n      the Brief Fatigue Inventory-Taiwanese (BFI-T) Form. Each patient's fatigue improvement\n      response will be defined as an improvement in the mean fatigue scores by at least 10% from\n      baseline. Other quality of life parameters will be measured by the 11 questions (SS11) of\n      the EORTC QLQ-C30 and by Karnofsky performance scale. Patient's weight change and its\n      related c-reactive protein will be followed. There are two study arms in this trial: 1) the\n      PG2 High Dose arm; and 2) the PG2 Low Dose arm."
