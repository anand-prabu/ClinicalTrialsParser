Considering its potent reported\n      health-beneficial properties, researchers have tried to increase its bioavailability as a\n      means to enhance its biological activities.\n\n      Objective: The aim of the project was to develop novel curcumin formulations with enhanced\n      oral bioavailability and to study the safety of the formulations and potential\n      sex-differences in humans.\n\n      Design: In this single-blind crossover study with three arms separated by \u22651-week washout\n      periods, healthy subjects (13 women, 10 men) were provided standardized meals and took, in\n      random order, a single oral dose of 500 mg curcumin as native powder, micronized powder, or\n      liquid micelles. Blood and urine samples were collected in intervals for 24 h and total\n      curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bis-demethoxycurcumin were quantified."
