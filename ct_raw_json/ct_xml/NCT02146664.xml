  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, and controlled study of
      DLBS1033 in the management of acute non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) without
      early coronary revascularization. It is hypothesized that the combination of DLBS1033 with
      aspirin and clopidogrel will result in greater improvement in cardiac function, myocardial
      perfusion, other surrogate cardiovascular markers, and haemostasis parameters in comparison
      with that of aspirin and clopidogrel alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects in this study are screened consecutively and eligible subjects are randomized to
      receive either DLBS1033 at a dose of 490 mg three times daily or its placebo in addition to
      clopidogrel 75 mg once daily and aspirin 160 mg once daily for an 8-week course of therapy.
      Afterwards, the administration of DLBS1033 and its placebo is stopped, while dual
      antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) remain for another 16 weeks at the same dose
      regimen as the previous.

      Clinical and laboratory examinations to evaluate the investigational drug's efficacy and
      safety are performed at baseline, week 4, week 8, and week 24. To guard the safety of the
      study subjects, haemostasis parameters, hematology parameters, and CRUSADE bleeding score
      are evaluated every two weeks interval over the first eight weeks of treatment.
