However, recanalization rate within 24\n      hours after the administration of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator is low,\n      especially when the occlusion site involves a large intracranial artery. The low\n      recanalization rate has prompted the development of endovascular therapy.\n\n      RECO is a novel, self-expanding stent retriever, designed to yield rapid flow restoration in\n      acute cerebral ischaemia. The proposed study is a multicenter, randomized, prospective,\n      parallel-group, open-label clinical trial with a blinded outcome, to test the new approach\n      of endovascular thrombectomy, as compared with standard intravenous t-PA."
