    <textblock>
      This study will treat participants with newly diagnosed, localized rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS)
      using chemotherapy, surgery and radiation.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  Estimate event-free survival for intermediate risk participants treated with
           vincristine, dactinomycin and cyclophosphamide with the addition of maintenance
           anti-angiogenic therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Estimate the false negative rate and incidence of additional positive lymph nodes in
           participants undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by limited nodal
           dissection.

        -  Maintain a high local control rate in participants treated with surgery and/or limited
           volume proton radiation without dose escalation.

        -  Define the incidence and type of failure in participants who receive risk-adapted local
           therapy relative to the primary tumor volume.

        -  Establish the feasibility of delivering 6 cycles of maintenance anti-angiogenic
           chemotherapy in intermediate risk patients following standard chemotherapy.

        -  Define the incidence of CTC grade 3 and higher toxicities (and specific grade 1-2
           toxicities) related to proton beam therapy.

      Participants will be stratified based on both a pretreatment staging system and a
      post-surgery surgico/pathologic clinical grouping system. Treatment for low-risk (subset 1)
      participants will consist of chemotherapy.  Low-risk (subset 2) and intermediate-risk
      participants will chemotherapy and receive radiation and/or undergo surgery to
      destroy/remove the tumor.  Intermediate-risk participants will also receive 16 weeks of
      maintenance chemotherapy.

    <description>Lymph node sampling will take place pretreatment and pre-surgery.  Participants receive 12 weeks of chemotherapy (vincristine, dactinomycin and cyclophosphamide).  They are then evaluated to determine how the tumor responded to treatment.  Twelve additional weeks of chemotherapy (vincristine and dactinomycin) is given, followed by evaluation for tumor response.  No further treatment is given, and participants are observed closely.  Myeloid growth factor is given if needed.</description>

    <description>Lymph node sampling will take place pretreatment and pre-surgery.  Participants receive 12 weeks of chemotherapy (vincristine, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide).  The tumor is evaluated to determine how it responded to treatment.  Radiation therapy and/or surgical resection is performed to destroy or remove the remaining tumor.  Twelve additional weeks of chemotherapy (vincristine, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide) is given, followed by evaluation for tumor response.  If delayed for medical reasons, radiation therapy and/or surgical resection is done at this time.  Participants then receive 16 weeks of additional chemotherapy (vincristine, dactinomycin and cyclophosphamide).  No further treatment is given, and participants are observed closely.  Myeloid growth factor will be given if needed.</description>
