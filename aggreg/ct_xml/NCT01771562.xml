  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The advent of highly active antiretroviral treatment has resulted in the survival into
      adolescence of an increasing proportion of infants and children with perinatal HIV infection
      in Senegal. However, the transformation of HIV into a chronic disease needing lifelong
      antiretroviral treatment (ART)  raises new challenges, among others related to a disturbance
      of glucose metabolism, lipid abnormalities, in addition to the potential effects on
      children's growth and puberty. Little is known on nutritional and metabolic changes in
      HIV-infected children on ART in Africa, while implementation of the latest WHO
      recommendations should eventually lead to an increase in the number of children on ART in
      this region. Moreover, bio-clinical evolution of untreated children is poorly documented in
      the African context. It therefore urgently needed to institute a cohort study to evaluate,
      in the long term, the impact of HIV infection and/or ART on nutritional and metabolic
      disorders and to characterize the risk factors of their occurrence in children and
      adolescents infected as they move through adolescent into adulthood.
