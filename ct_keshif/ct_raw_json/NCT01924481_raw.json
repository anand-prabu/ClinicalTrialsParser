The main substances in the drinks\n      that are known to influence the brain are caffeine (and related chemicals such as\n      theobromine) and flavonoids. Flavonoids are chemical found in plants and are most commonly\n      associated with antioxidant activity. Caffeine, chemicals related to caffeine, and\n      flavonoids are all naturally occurring and all potentially alter brain physiology. This\n      study will evaluate changes in brain blood flow and cognition following the consumption of\n      drinks with various combinations of the Primary Ingredients. Caffeine is likely to have peak\n      effects within 1-hour of ingesting the chocolate while the flavonoids are likely to have\n      peak effects 3-4 hours after ingestion. The study proposed here will evaluate ingredients in\n      a 4-arm cross-over double-blind design in an attempt to understand the differential effects\n      of these compounds in chocolate drinks."
