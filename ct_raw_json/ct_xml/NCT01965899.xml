      The purpose of the Reveal LINQ Usability Study is to assess the functionality of the Reveal
      LINQ insertable cardiac monitor and accompanying system in patients indicated for an
      insertable cardiac monitor

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Reveal LINQ Usability Study is a prospective, non-blinded, non-randomized, multi-center
      clinical trial. Subjects will transmit device data via manual interrogation on a weekly
      basis during the first month and will be evaluated in the office at 1-month post-implant, in
      addition to an automatic nightly wireless data transmission using the MyCareLink® home
      monitor.  All subjects will be requested to wear an external Holter for 48 hours at
      approximately 4 weeks post-insertion.  Follow-up visits will continue at 6 and 12 months
      post-implant, with monthly manual interrogations.  Subjects will be exited at their 12 month
      follow-up visit. The overall study will be conducted in 2 phases which differ primarily on
      inclusion criteria: Phase I subjects (initial 30 subjects) will have any indication for an
      ICM, Phase II subjects (all subjects following the initial 30 subjects) will be atrial
      fibrillation (AF) pre-ablation patients. The study will assess functionality of the Reveal
      LINQ device by assessing sensing performance and data transmission.

    <description>The Reveal LINQ is a leadless device that is recommended to be implanted in the region of the thorax. Two electrodes on the body of the device continuously monitor the patient's subcutaneous ECG.  The device stores ECG recordings from the patient-activated episodes and ECG recordings from automatically detected arrhythmias. Documentation of episode occurrence will be retained.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is willing to sign and date the consent form.

          -  Subject is indicated for a Reveal device within the existing market approved
             indications

          -  Phase I (initial 30 subjects): Any indication for a Reveal LINQ Device

          -  Phase II (after the initial 30 subjects): Subject has atrial fibrillation and is
             indicated for and identified as an AF pre-ablation candidate*

             *Note: Atrial fibrillation must be documented in the subject's medical history.

          -  Subject has a life expectancy of 18 months or more.

          -  Subject is willing and able to set up and utilize MyCareLink® home monitor and be

          -  Subjects who are female of childbearing potential (last menses less than 1     year
             prior to enrolment) must:

          -  have a negative pregnancy test at enrollment.

          -  Subject is unwilling or unable to comply with the study procedures

          -  Subject is legally incapacitated and unable to provide written informed consent.

          -  Any concomitant condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would not allow
             safe participation in the study (e.g., drug addiction, alcohol abuse,
             emotional/psychological diagnosis)

          -  Patient is enrolled in another study that could confound the results of this study,
             without documented pre-approval from Medtronic study manager.
