After 12 weeks patients who improved with 4-ASA and those who received placebo\n      are given the option of receiving 4-ASA for an additional year.\n\n      Patients who were randomized to receive 4-ASA and continue treatment after 12 weeks are\n      followed every 3 months for 1 year.  Patients who were randomized to receive placebo and\n      begin 4-ASA therapy after 12 weeks are followed monthly for 3 months, then every 3 months\n      for 1 year."
