By using concurrent TMS and fMRI, the\n      investigators can overcome a major limitation of neuroimaging - the inability to demonstrate\n      causality. The investigators' findings will serve as a platform for future studies wherein\n      TMS treatment can be directly guided by the investigators' ability to image and causally\n      manipulate specific neural networks.\n\n      Aim 1: To examine causal interactions between two major brain networks in depression.\n\n      Aim 2: To examine the impact of antidepressant TMS on causal network abnormalities in\n      depression.\n\n      Hypothesis 1: Depressed subjects will show blunted responses, compared to healthy controls,\n      in two targeted and interacting networks, using concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation\n      (TMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).\n\n      Hypothesis 2: Treatment of patients with high-frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS) will result in\n      normalization of baseline network-level deficits, and be predicted by degree of baseline\n      network abnormalities."
