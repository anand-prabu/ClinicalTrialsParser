            "textblock": "Clinical events in atherosclerosis are largely driven by inflammation. Molecular imaging of\n      atherosclerosis can potentially identify high-risk lesions, help guide treatment and\n      illuminate the underlying biology of the disease. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET is\n      the gold-standard nuclear molecular imaging technique with well-established roles in\n      atherosclerosis imaging. However, the arterial 18F-FDG signal is non-specific, although it\n      is related to increased macrophage activity with contributions from hypoxia and\n      angiogenesis. Coronary artery imaging with 18F-FDG is particularly difficult, mainly due to\n      high background myocardial cell 18F-FDG uptake, which obscures interpretation of the\n      coronary signal. Efforts to suppress myocardial 18F-FDG uptake with dietary manipulation are\n      challenging for patients and have limited efficacy.\n\n      PET tracers currently used in cancer imaging, such as 68Ga-DOTANOC, are more specific for\n      inflammation and also lack myocardial muscle uptake. 68Ga-DOTANOC might therefore be better\n      suited than 18F-FDG for imaging inflammation, particularly within the coronary arteries. The\n      VISION study is a prospective, observational study designed to investigate the biology of\n      plaque inflammation in atherosclerosis, using PET imaging with the somatostatin receptor\n      ligand 68Ga-DOTANOC. 50 subjects with atherosclerosis will undergo sequential PET/CT imaging\n      with 68Ga-DOTANOC and 18F-FDG, along with contrast angiography of the carotid and coronary\n      arteries. Autoradiography and immunohistochemistry of excised carotid plaques will be used\n      to validate the imaging data. If successful, 68Ga-DOTANOC imaging will offer a cheaper, more\n      specific non-invasive measure of inflammation than 18F- FDG, particularly in the coronary\n      arteries. This opens up the possibility of better risk stratification for patients with\n      atherosclerosis and could provide a non-invasive platform to test the effects of novel\n      anti-atherosclerosis drugs."
