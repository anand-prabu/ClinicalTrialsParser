            "textblock": "INTRODUCTION\n\n      Neurodegeneration is the structural correlate of functional impairment in multiple sclerosis\n      (MS). Available therapies, however, target the immune response, but exert only limited\n      direct neuroprotection. Optic neuritis (ON) is one of the most frequent manifestations of MS\n      and leads to degeneration of retinal ganglion cell axons with consecutive visual impairment.\n      Due to their correlation with brain atrophy, these changes allow conclusions to be drawn\n      about inflammation-associated neurodegeneration on a more global level. Various substances\n      that interfere with pathways related to apoptosis and regeneration represent potential\n      candidates for protecting retinal ganglion cell axons. Among these, erythropoietin (EPO) is\n      one of the most potent drugs as shown in inflammatory and non-inflammatory disease models.\n      In a clinical pilot trial, we have demonstrated that EPO is safe and efficacious in\n      preserving retinal ganglion cell axons after optic neuritis. Hence, we plan to administer\n      EPO intravenously to patients with ON and to evaluate its effect on visual function and\n      retinal nerve fibre layer preservation in a prospective, double blind, placebo-controlled,\n      multi-center phase II trial.\n\n      DESIGN\n\n      The study is designed as a prospective, double blind, randomized controlled trial with 24\n      participating departments (Departments of Ophthalmology and Neurology) located at 12\n      different German University Medical Centers. Main selection criterion for the study sites\n      has been a reputation for treating large numbers of patients with MS, ON and other optic\n      nerve diseases. The trial will have 2 parallel arms, one with 3 infusions of 33.000 IU human\n      recombinant EPO, spread over 3 days, and one with placebo infusions administered in an equal\n      fashion. In both arms, patients receive 1 g methylprednisolone i.v. for 3 days in accordance\n      to national guidelines.\n\n      The treatment and follow-up of each patient will extend over a period of 6 months. An\n      unblinded post-trial follow-up of 24 months will yield information about long-term visual\n      function and clinical disease course. For each patient, a treating and an evaluating\n      neurologist (separated to maintain a blinded trial) as well as an ophthalmologist and a\n      neurophysiologist will be involved.\n\n      OUTCOME MEASURES\n\n      This clinical trial will employ two primary outcome measures in hierarchical order, 1st a\n      morphologic one (retinal nerve fibre layer thickness, RNFLT) and a 2nd functional one (low\n      contrast visual acuity, LCVA). Both are important as the morphologic measures are\n      characterized by high precision and reproducibility and the functional measures by relevance\n      for the individual patient affected by ON or MS thereafter. Morphologic parameters have\n      lower variability than functional parameters, because the variability of patients'\n      subjective cognition does not add to the overall variance when measuring morphologic\n      parameters. We consider both parameters important, as relevant neuroprotection is expected\n      to not only limit functional deterioration, but also reduce nervous tissue loss, especially\n      in the light of possible recurrences of ON.\n\n      The 1st primary outcome measure is RNFLT in the affected eye after 6 months. RNFLT became a\n      standard measure for neurodegeneration over the recent years and can be precisely measured\n      by OCT. It allows thickness measurements of the peripapillary RNFL consisting of retinal\n      ganglion cells axons. Using time domain OCT, thinning of the RNFL from 100 \u03bcm to 78 \u03bcm\n      (means, p=0.0001) was seen in the majority of ON patients (74%) within 6 months. RNFLT\n      decline reaches a plateau around 4 months. Several investigations have established that\n      RNFLT measurement by OCT is a robust tool for the quantification of optic nerve axons and\n      the degree of optic atrophy, especially after ON. The recent introduction of the spectral\n      domain OCT technique allows for more precise detection and quantification of the RNFL, in\n      particular using the Spectralis\u00ae-System which incorporates eye tracking for substantially\n      better retest variability (variation coefficient of 0.6%, as compared to 5% using time\n      domain OCT). RNFLT will be determined along a ring of 3.4 mm diameter concentrically laid\n      around the optic disc using the Spectralis\u00ae-OCT (Heidelberg Engeneering, Heidelberg).\n\n      The 2nd primary outcome measure is LCVA in the affected eye after 6 months. While high\n      contrast visual acuity (VA) recovers well after ON, contrast sensitivity (CS), however, is\n      most likely to remain subnormal: 22% of cases with fully recovered visual acuity revealed\n      subnormal CS. LCVA correlates well with health-related quality of life and correlates\n      significantly with RNFLT in MS patients after previous ON. LCVA will be recorded by 1.5%\n      low-contrast Sloan letter charts.\n\n      Secondary outcome measures: Since acute ON may lead to RNFL oedema, we will primarily\n      compare RNFLT at 6 months among both treatment groups. However, 4 additional OCT analyses\n      will be performed to increase the likelihood in capturing axonal changes: a) unaffected\n      fellow eye RNFLT at baseline minus affected eye RNFLT at 6 months, b) decrease of RNFLT from\n      baseline to follow-up at 6 months, RNFLT in the papillomacular bundle and d) macular\n      thickness of the ganglion cell layer plus inner plexiform layer after 6 months. The other\n      functional endpoints VA and CS will be assessed using standard ETDRS-charts and Mars-charts.\n      Visual fields (VF) will be recorded on automated, static perimeters (Octopus perimeter,\n      Haag-Streit, Switzerland) using the newly developed GATE strategy (German Adaptive Threshold\n      Estimation) within the entire 90\u00b0 VF in a threshold determining manner. Visually evoked\n      potential (VEP) amplitudes and latencies will be measured by standard electrophysiological\n      equipment in accordance with the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology.\n      Vision related qualitiy of life (VRQOL) shall be assessed using the validated German version\n      of 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire. Its overall score as\n      well as its 12 subscores will be analysed. Further, relapse rates of ON will be documented\n      and analysed.\n\n      READING CENTRES\n\n      The \"Bern Photographic Reading Center\" located at the Klinik und Poliklinik fu\u0308r\n      Augenheilkunde, Universita\u0308t Bern, Switzerland, will serve as the reading center for OCT. It\n      shall further provide external quality control. The \"Visual Field Reading Center\" located at\n      the Fachhochschule Aalen, Germany, will serve as the reading center for VF testing."
