Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to\n      give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy followed by peripheral\n      stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory AIDS-related\n      lymphoma."

Patients then undergo leukopheresis to collect CD34+ cells.\n\n      Patients receive conditioning chemotherapy consisting of oral busulfan every 6 hours on days\n      -7, -6, -5, and -4 for a total of 14 doses and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -3\n      and -2. Patients undergo autologous stem cell infusion on day 0. G-CSF is administered IV or\n      SC daily beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood counts recover.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5-25 patients will be accrued for this study."
