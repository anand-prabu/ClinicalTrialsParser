Given\n      that gastrointestinal transit is typically delayed by Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) and\n      also that this hormone causes decreased food intake through increased satiation, it is\n      reasonable to expect an effect of Exendin-9,39 on appetite. This may help explain the\n      effects of gastric bypass on food intake. To examine the effect of Exendin on food intake we\n      propose a dose-response study to determine whether the compound has effects in a\n      dose-dependent fashion. We will examine the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms as well as\n      food intake in the immediate aftermath of a test meal and the subsequent hours."
