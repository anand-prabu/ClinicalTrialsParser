  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IncobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin®) is a neurotoxin which inhibits the release of certain
      chemicals at the nerve terminals.   It blocks cholinergic transmission at the neuromuscular
      junction by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine from motor neurons.  In addition it
      blocks the release of Substance P (SP) and Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide (CGRP) from C
      fibers involved in pain perception.  This study is designed to see if Xeomin® is superior to
      placebo in the treatment of medically refractory trigeminal neuralgia (TN).  Subjects will
      be asked to maintain an attack diary throughout the study.  They will also be asked to
      attend 4 office visits; Visit 1- Screening Visit, Visit 2- Injection Visit, Visit 3-
      Follow-Up Visit and Visit 4- Final Visit.  At the end of the study the active (Xeomin®) and
      placebo groups will be compared to see if one group had better relief than the other.

             period

          -  Subjects who require &quot;rescue&quot; analgesic medication during the study will be allowed
             to use their current (pre-study) opioid and/or non opioid analgesics as clinically
             indicated (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, COX-2
             inhibitors, topical analgesics).

        (NOTE:  subjects who are currently using alternative therapy for pain relief can be
        enrolled if they are willing and able to maintain such therapy stable throughout the
        study.)
