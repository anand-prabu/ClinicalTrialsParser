  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-center,
      prospective (a study in which the participants are identified and then followed forward in
      time for the outcome of the study), single-arm (all participants receiving one intervention)
      study. Approximately 260 participants will be enrolled in this study. This study consists of
      two phases: screening phase and treatment phase. In the treatment phase, participants will
      receive escitalopram for 8 weeks: escitalopram 10 mg per day for 1 week and then the dose of
      escitalopram will be flexibly adjusted up to maximum of 20 mg per day for the next 7 weeks,
      based on the investigator's clinical judgment. Safety evaluations will include assessment of
      adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical
      examination which will be monitored throughout the study. The total study duration will be
      approximately 2 years.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire, Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, and Week 8</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Q-LES-Q-SF is a 14-item questionnaire in which each question is rated on a 5-point scale with scores ranging from &quot;1 = very poor&quot; to &quot;5 = very good&quot;. The total raw score is calculated by summing up the scores for the 14 items. The raw total score ranges from 14 to 70. The raw total score is transformed into a percentage maximum possible score using the following formula: (raw total score minus minimum score) divided by (maximum possible raw score minus minimum score). The minimum raw score on the Q-LES-Q-SF is 14, and the maximum score is 70. Lower score indicate worsening.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, and Week 8</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>SDS is a composite of 3 self-rated items designed to measure the extent to which 3 major sectors in the participant's life are impaired by panic, anxiety, phobic, or depressive symptoms. The participant rates the extent to which his or her (1) work, (2) social life or leisure activities, and (3) home life or family responsibilities are impaired by his or her symptoms on a 10-point visual analog scale. To get a total score add up the 3 individual scores and the total score ranges from &quot;0 = unimpaired&quot; to &quot;30 = highly impaired&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

    <measure>Remission Rate at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Remission rate is defined as percentage of participants with Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores less than or equal to 10 at the endpoint (at week 8). The MADRS is a 10-item scale designed to measure depression severity. Each item is scored on 7-point scale, from 0 = not present/normal to 6 = severe/continuous presence of the symptoms and the total score (addition of all 10-items) will range from &quot;0 to 60&quot;. The interpretations of the scores are: 0 to 6= normal/symptom absent; 7 to 19= mild depression; 20 to 34= moderate depression; more than 34= severe depression.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 1</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Onset of effect will be defined as the reduction rate greater than or equal to 20 percent change from baseline in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores. The MADRS is a 10-item scale designed to measure depression severity. Each item is scored on 7-point scale, from 0 = not present/normal to 6 = severe/continuous presence of the symptoms and the total score (addition of all 10-items) will range from &quot;0 to 60&quot;. The interpretations of the scores are: 0 to 6= normal/symptom absent; 7 to 19= mild depression; 20 to 34= moderate depression; more than 34= severe depression.</description>

    <description>The MADRS is a 10-item scale designed to measure depression severity. Each item is scored on a 7-point scale and the scores range from &quot;0 = item not present/normal&quot; to &quot;6 = severe/continuous presence of the symptoms&quot;. Total score is calculated by adding the scores for all the 10 items and it will range from &quot;0 to 60&quot;. The interpretations of the scores are: 0 to 6= normal/symptom absent; 7 to 19= mild depression; 20 to 34= moderate depression; more than 34= severe depression.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>HAMA is a rating scale developed to quantify the severity of anxiety symptomatology. It consists of 14 items, each defined by a series of symptoms. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (severe). Total score is calculated by adding the scores for each of the 14 items and the score will range from &quot;0 to 56&quot;. The interpretation of total scores are: 0 to 17 is considered to be mild, 18 to 25 mild to moderate, and 26 to 30 moderate to severe and above 30 indicate very severe anxiety. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Self-Report (QIDS-SR) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>QIDS-SR contains 16 question regarding 9 Major depression disorder symptoms (sleep, weight, psychomotor changes, depressed mood, decreased interest, fatigue, guilt, concentration, and suicidal ideation). Each question is rated on a 4-point scale (range, 0 to 3). Total score is the sum of scores calculated by adding scores for each question and the interpretation is as follows: 0-5 (no depression likely); 6-10 (possibly mildly depressed); 11-15 (moderate depression); 16-20 (severe depression); 21 or over (very severe depression). Higher scores represent more severe depression symptoms.</description>
