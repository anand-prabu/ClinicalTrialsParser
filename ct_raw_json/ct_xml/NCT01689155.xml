    <textblock>
      This is a passive-surveillance study that will accrue subjects for surveillance. For each
      accrued subject, surveillance for outcomes will continue for six months following the first
      dose. If a second dose is given within that time, then surveillance will be continued for
      six months following the second dose.

      Observational Objective:

        -  To describe and characterize adverse events occurring after vaccination with Menactra
           vaccine.

      The study will be carried out in collaboration with the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care
      Program (KPMCP) under the direction of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center (KPVSC).
      KPMCP is a closed-panel healthcare organization that maintains comprehensive encounter
      databases that capture all medical care received by enrollees.

      Vaccination will be according to routine clinical practice. Vaccination databases will be
      reviewed to identify eligible persons receiving Menactra vaccine within the KPMCP system.
