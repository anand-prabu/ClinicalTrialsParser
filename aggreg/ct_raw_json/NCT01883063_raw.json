Subjects will be enrolled in each group according to\n      physician's standard of care (either casting/splinting or surgery) for distal radius\n      fractures. Subjects will be enrolled based on the study's inclusion/exclusion criteria with\n      a final qualifying decision made by a group of three independent adjudicators. The final\n      qualifying review should allow for similar patient groups within each arm of the study due\n      to the variability that can arise in fracture classification. Review by the adjudicators\n      should be completed within 1 week."
