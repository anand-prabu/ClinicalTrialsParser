There is thus an\n      unmet need for new HBV vaccine adjuvants, in particular, for adjuvants capable of boosting\n      cell-mediated immunity (this is a particular type of immune response where killer T cells\n      are activated that are then able to attack and destroy the infection) as alum, although good\n      at stimulating antibodies is very poor at stimulating cell-mediated immunity. Alum, whilst\n      generally accepted as safe, can be associated with significant local vaccine reactions and\n      this is another reason why newer better-tolerated vaccine adjuvants would be beneficial.\n      This study will compare a range of experimental adjuvant formulations to identify those that\n      provide the safest and most effective enhancement of T- and B-cell immunity against\n      hepatitis B"
