            "textblock": "Food allergy is on the rise within the pediatric population. Having a food allergy can cause\n      medical, nutritional and psychological issues in those who suffer with it. Although making\n      the appropriate diagnosis of food allergy is very important, properly diagnosing food\n      allergy has been a challenge. Skin prick testing and food-specific IgE testing of the blood\n      can give positive results that are false. Currently, Oral Food Challenges are the best way\n      to diagnose a food allergy. Unfortunately, Oral Food Challenges are time consuming and may\n      not be readily available to suspected food allergy sufferers. This study is designed to\n      examine the effectiveness of an allergy-detecting blood test called ImmunoCAP manufactured\n      by the company, ThermoFisher.\n\n      Soybean is one of the eight allergy-inducing foods that are responsible for 90% of all food\n      allergies. A part of the study is to allow the study Sponsor to use some of the blood sample\n      collected from you to test if genetically-changed soy has more or less allergy producing\n      factors. This is important to the Sponsor to test the safety of their genetically modified\n      soy."
