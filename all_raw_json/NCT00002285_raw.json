Any prior CNS infection due to\n        Toxoplasma gondii.

Patients accepted for allogenic\n        cell transfer must meet the CDC criteria for AIDS.

Patients may be accepted for syngeneic cell transfer even if they have not\n        met the CDC AIDS criteria, provided they have had constitutional disease (CDC category\n        IV-A) or a specified non-AIDS defining secondary infection (CDC category IV-C2).\n\n        Patients must have a positive blood culture for the AIDS virus before the beginning of\n        therapy.\n\n        Patients must be skin test negative for PPD. Patients must have a life expectancy of at\n        least 6 months and a Karnofsky status of 60 or above.\n\n        Patients must sign an informed consent agreement. From eligible patients precedence will\n        be given to those with identical twin donors, then to Minnesota residents. The first\n        patient must have an identical twin donor. Among eligible Minnesota patients without\n        identical twin donors, the order of enrollment will be determined by overall good health,\n        the presence of Kaposi's  sarcoma (which permits monitoring of response by measuring\n        lesions) and/or the presence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia (which permits monitoring of\n        response by remission of CMV viremia)."
