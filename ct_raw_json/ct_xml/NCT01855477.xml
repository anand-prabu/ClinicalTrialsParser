  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A major challenge for researchers in cancer care is to expedite the development of new
      therapeutics and the Center for Personalized Cancer Treatment (a collaboration of the Dept.
      of Medical Oncology from the University Medical Center Utrecht, Netherlands Cancer Center -
      Antoni van Leeuwenhoek hospital and the Erasmus Medical Center - Daniël den Hoed clinic) is
      an initiative to achieve this goal.

      The current and future generation anti-cancer drugs are developed to specifically activate
      or deactivate deregulated gene products or signaling pathways in cancer cells. The
      development of such &quot;targeted&quot; agents is an exciting new opportunity that promises to
      deliver more anti-cancer efficacy and less toxicity. Although targeted therapy has been a
      breakthrough in medical oncology leading to the development of a portfolio of potentially
      successful new drugs, it has not yet delivered the much needed relief for large patient
      populations. We believe that the development of these agents is mainly hampered by our lack
      of successful patient selection.

      The CPCT aims to select patients for clinical trial participation based on the results of
      Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) information obtained from tumor material. The advent of NGS
      platforms enables us to probe a significant proportion of the cancer genome and thus to
      develop a realistic view on the complex genetic changes in cancer cells. The CPCT aims to
      use NGS platforms to improve the selection of patients for targeted therapy trials.

      We will obtain tumor biopsies of a (preferably) metastatic or locally advanced lesion and
      peripheral blood sample from all patients included in the trial; the biopsies to obtain
      information on the tumor related genetic mutations (mutational profile) and the blood
      samples to assess each patient's germline DNA background variation. As patients will be
      asked to undergo an invasive procedure it is important to address the potential safety
      issues. Review of the literature shows that in general tumor biopsies can be performed with
      only minor complications and acceptable risks. We will recruit patients with metastatic or
      locally advanced (incurable) solid tumors and we aim to use the information obtained from
      DNA sequencing to stratify patients for inclusion in clinical trials. The final personalized
      treatment decision will be made dependent on the availability of trials and the expected
      predictive value of the mutational profile.
