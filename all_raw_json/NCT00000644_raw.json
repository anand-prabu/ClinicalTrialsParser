Clarithromycin, a new macrolide antimicrobial agent, has\n      demonstrated activity against MAC both in the laboratory and in animals. Clinical experience\n      treating AIDS patients with clarithromycin for disseminated MAC is limited. However, early\n      studies have indicated few adverse effects and some improvement in clinical symptoms scores\n      and Karnofsky performance scores over placebo treated patients."
