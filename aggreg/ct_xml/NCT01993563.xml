  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate whether a graded rehabilitation approach including
      Implicit and explicit motor imagery training and mirror therapy is more effective than other
      treatments commonly provided in a neuro-rehabilitation department.

      Graded Motor Imagery is a graded approach recently proposed for treating chronic pain
      patients. It included three subsequent steps:

        1. Implicit Motor Imagery training (IMI), using a body part laterality discrimination task

        2. Explicit Motor Imagery trainig, using pictures and videos for improving patient's
           ability in imagining movements

        3. Mirror box therapy, using a 35x40 cm mirror,

      We are transferring this approach into stroke rehabilitation in order to improve patients'
      upper limb motor functions.

      All the patients, in both groups, will be training 2 hours a day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks.
      The first hour is standard treatment, the clinician in charge will decide treatment's
      priorities and the aim(s) of the treatment for each specific patient. The second hour will
      be focussed on patient's upper limb function.

      The treatment group will be treated accordingly to the GMI protocol. The control group will
      receive a second hour of standard treatment, centred on the upper limb. Standard treatments
      are decided by the interdisciplinary team and might include motor rehabilitation, bilateral
      arm training, virtual rehality training or occupational therapy.

    <time_frame>Before and after the 4-weeks treatment</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>We use the Upper Extremity session of the scale. The scale evaluates patient's balance, passive and active movements of shoulder, elbow, wrist and hand. It also evaluates different types of grips. Sense of position and ability to detect light touches are also evaluated.</description>

    <measure>Change in Reaching Performance Scale (RPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>before and after the 4-weeks treatment</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>It assesses the ability of subjects and the quality of the movement in reaching an object (a cone). The cone is placed either close to the subject (4 cm) or far from him/her (30 cm). The subject is asked to reach the cone and grab it. The observer evaluates only the quality of the reaching movement and not grip strength .</description>

    <time_frame>before and after the 4-weeks treatment</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>It includes 17 different tasks, which assess shoulder, elbow, wrist function and manual ability. For each task, a qualitative mark is given and time needed to complete the action is recorded.</description>

    <description>FIM is an 18-item scale developed to assess severity of patient disability and medical rehabilitation functional outcome</description>

    <description>In order to assess a possible neurophysiological effect of our treatment, we also evaluate cortical excitability using Single Stimulus TMS.</description>

    <description>GMI program includes three steps: Implicit Motor Imagery (IMI); Explicit Motor Imagery (EMI) and Mirror Box Therapy (MT).
IMI included a training based on Hand Laterality Discrimination Tasks. During these tasks 60 pictures of right and left hands are projected randomly on a 15&quot; screen. Patients are asked to choose whether the images seen are right or left and therefore to click respectively the right or the left button on a mouse.
EMI training consists in imagining a movement without actual performing it. It will be introduced during IMI's last two sessions and gradually enhanced increasing the complexity of motor skills to be imagined. The therapist shows or explains in details the movements the patient have to mentally rehearsed.
MT treatments will start with simply watching the unaffected hand in the mirror and increased toward functional movement. When possible, gentle movement with the affected hand will be encouraged behind the reflecting part of the mirror.</description>
