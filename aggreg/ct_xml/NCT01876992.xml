  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators know that metformin works at the level of the cells in the body by acting
      on a protein called CREB binding protein or CBP.  What the investigators do not know is how
      this process is affected when the dose of the metformin is increased or changed.

      Currently the same doses of metformin are often used in both children and adults, but it is
      possible that the dose of metformin should be based on age and weight.  Understanding how
      CBP works could potentially help us to tailor metformin treatment individually for patients
      based on their age, weight and CBP response.

    <description>Doses will be increased incrementally. Decisions to escalate the metformin dose will be made based upon tolerability of side effects as described in the schedule of evaluations to follow. All subjects will be monitored for safety while receiving metformin. Any participant with blood glucose of &lt;60mg/dl at any time while receiving metformin will have therapy stopped and will be withdrawn from the study.
For children &lt;50kg:
Baseline:250mg po qd, Week 2:250mg po bid, Week 4:500mg po AM/250mg po PM, Week 8:500mg po bid.
For children ≥50kg:
