The BioMatrix\n      FlexTM has been studied in randomized controlled trials and has been granted the CE mark.\n      The data have been reviewed by Health Canada and no further randomized trials were\n      requested. Prior to marketing approval, Health Canada requested that a registry be\n      implemented to provide data in Canada on 'on label patients' to supplement the data already\n      available from the Leaders trial, conducted on 'all comers' patients. The registry follows\n      the normal medical practice for drug eluting stents in Canada. 100% informed consents will\n      be checked, and at least all Major Adverse Cardiac Events up to 2 years will be source data\n      verified. All MACEs developing in the patient population will be adjudicated by an\n      independent Clinical Events Committee. The patients will be followed clinically for up to 2\n      years after stent implantation.\n\n      A third party Contract Research Organisation, Centre for Innovative Medicine has has been\n      appointed to perform site monitoring and project management.\n\n      The appropriate Data Management and Validation, Statistical Analysis, Safety, Monitoring\n      Plans and guidelines have been put into place to address quality and consistency of data.\n\n      A Clinical Event Committee (CEC) has been put in place for this registry, consisting of\n      cardiologists not participating in the registry. The mandate of this CEC will be to review\n      all Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE), to adjudicate and to classify them.  In addition,\n      and in order to protect study participants, there will be a regular review of all reported\n      safety events by the sponsor Clinical Safety Officer and a weekly assessment of the\n      incidence of the important risks pertaining to the registry in order to detect any safety\n      signals.\n\n      The sites have been trained during the Site Initiation Visits on registry operations and\n      analysis activities, such as patient recruitment, data collection, data management, data\n      analysis, reporting for adverse events, and change management."
