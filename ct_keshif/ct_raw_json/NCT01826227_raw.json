Patients with evidence for a first recurrence of ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma, with evidence of 18F-FDG avid disease on 18F-FDG PET/CT and who are able to undergo secondary CRS are eligible. 20 patients will be studied. All patients will undergo secondary cytoreduction guided by intraoperative PET probe survey. Intraoperative count levels as well as exvivo counts of the resected specimens will be done. Specimens detected with probe only will be labeled so and will be submitted to pathology for histopathologic confirmation."
