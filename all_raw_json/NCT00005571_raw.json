This disease, which causes skin rash, muscle\n      weakness, and sometimes various other symptoms, may be due to an immune system abnormality.\n      Drugs currently used to treat dermatomyositis, such as prednisone and various anticancer\n      drugs, often have serious side effects and may not work in all patients.  h5G1.1-mAb is a\n      genetically engineered antibody that blocks the activity of certain proteins involved in the\n      immune reaction that produces inflammation.\n\n      Patients age 18 years and older who have had dermatomyositis for at least 6 months and who\n      have not improved with prednisone or other therapies, or who cannot tolerate prednisone or\n      other therapies, may be eligible for this 12-week study.  Candidates will have a history and\n      physical examination, including blood and urine tests, throat culture, and muscle strength\n      testing.  Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either h5G1.1-mAb or placebo (an\n      inactive substance).  The drug or placebo will be given intravenously (through a thin tube\n      inserted into a vein) once a week for five doses and then every other week for two more\n      doses.\n\n      Participants will undergo the following additional tests at various intervals during the\n      study as follows:\n\n        1. Complete physical examination  ( visit 9)\n\n        2. Blood and urine tests (various intervals)\n\n        3. Muscle strength testing, assessment of ability to perform daily tasks, and completion\n           of questionnaire regarding functional abilities (visits 2, 6 and 9)\n\n        4. Ultrasound imaging of muscle (during certain muscle exercises) (visits 2, 6 and 9)\n\n        5. Electrocardiogram (EKG) (visits 2 and 9)\n\n        6. Throat swab (culture) (visit 6)\n\n        7. Examination and photography of skin lesions (visits 2 and 9)\n\n        8. Skin biopsy - removal of small sample of skin tissue under local anesthetic (visits 2\n           and 9)\n\n        9. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of muscles (visits 2 and 9)\n\n       10. Possible muscle biopsy - removal of small sample of muscle tissue under local\n           anesthetic (visits 2 and 9)."

            "textblock": "This is a randomized, third-party, placebo-controlled pilot study of h5G1.1-mAb, an antibody\n      directed at the complement component C5, administered to patients with dermatomyositis with\n      persistent disease.  We are one of the four groups taking part in a multicenter trial under\n      the sponsorship of Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\n      In dermatomytosis, humorally-mediated damage to muscle and skin microvasculature appears\n      very important.  The deposition of the membrane attack complex (C5-9) on the capillaries has\n      been shown to precede the destruction of muscle fibers and to be a specific finding in the\n      skin lesion.  These observations, along with the recent discovery of the effectiveness of\n      intravenous gammaglobulin (IVIG) in dermatomyositis, support the role of complement\n      activation in the pathogenesis of dermatomyositis.  Among the activated components of the\n      complement system, the products that are generated after cleavage of C5, namely, C5a and\n      C5b-9, are potent inflammatory mediators with pleiotropic activities.  Inhibition of\n      complement activation at C5 would prevent the formation of these pro-inflammatory molecules\n      while allowing the generation of C3b, which is critical for opsonization and immune complex\n      clearance.  C5 inhibition therefore represents a potentially effective therapeutic modality\n      for dermatomyositis.\n\n      Anti-C5 monoclonal antibodies are designed to prevent the cleavage of C5.  A murine\n      monoclonal antibody to human C5, m5G1.1-mAb, was humanized (h5G1.1-mAb) by grafting the\n      antibody's antigen-binding CDR regions onto human antibody-derived framework and constant\n      domains.  This antibody is being made available by Alexion Pharmaceuticals, and will be used\n      under their IND.\n\n      There will be 15 patients entered (with the goal of 12 evaluable patients) distributed among\n      two treatment groups.  Patients will be randomized at a 3 to 1 ratio between h5G1.1-mAb and\n      placebo.  Following a screening period of no less than 7 days, a 2 month double-blind,\n      randomized treatment period will commence.  Patients will receive an active (h5G1.1-mAb,\n      8mg/kg) bolus infusion every week X 5, then every 2 weeks X 2, or a placebo bolus infusion\n      every week X 5, then every 2 weeks X 2.  All patients will be receiving 7 infusions of\n      h5G1.1-mAb or placebo.\n\n      The objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of h5G1.1-mAb and to evaluate the\n      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this antibody as well as its efficacy in the target\n      population.  Safety will be assessed via the collection of adverse events and the evaluation\n      of pre- and post-treatment laboratory data.  Efficacy will be assessed by the change in the\n      manual muscle testing score relative to placebo at 2.25 months (one week following the end\n      of the active treatment period) (primary efficacy value), and the change in the muscle\n      enzyme level, MRI findings, skin examination findings and biopsy, and SF-36 (secondary\n      efficacy values)."
