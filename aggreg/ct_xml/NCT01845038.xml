  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how OTX-TP, a sustained release travoprost drug
      product, when placed in the canaliculus of the eyelid compares to timolol drops for the
      lowering of intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular
      hypertension.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age at Screening.

          -  Subject must have a documented diagnosis of ocular hypertension, open angle glaucoma.

          -  Subject has a mean baseline (Day -7 and Day 0) Hour 0 (T0) untreated IOP of ≥ 24 mm
             Hg and ≤ 34 mm Hg in each eye, and (T0 + 4h) and (T0 + 8h) IOP of ≥ 22 mm Hg at
             Baseline Visit 2. Untreated IOP must be ≤ 34 mm Hg in each eye at all time points at
             both baseline visits.

          -  Subject has a BCVA of 0.6 logMAR (20/80 Snellen) or better in each eye as measured
             using an ETDRS chart.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of any uncontrolled systemic or debilitating disease (e.g. cardiovascular
             disease, hypertension, diabetes, or cystic fibrosis).

          -  Punctum size is smaller than 0.4mm or greater than or equal to 1.0mm.

          -  Any single IOP in either eye at any time point during the Screening or either
             Baseline (Day -7/Day 0) Visits of &gt;34 mm Hg.
