A newly developed\n      technique, \"dovetail\" laser-assisted lamellar anterior keratoplasty (LALAK), will be tested\n      and compared with standard full-thickness corneal transplantation, Intralase-enabled\n      keratoplasty (IEK). The new LALAK technique replaces only the front portion of the cornea\n      and does not have the risks associated with conventional IEK. Additionally, optical\n      coherence tomography (OCT) will be used to guide the depth of the graft and donor\n      dissections.\n\n      The data will be analyzed to understand whether the new technique (LALAK) can repeatedly\n      achieve good visual outcomes with lower risk from the operation compared to the visual\n      outcomes and risk associated with the current standard of care, IEK."
