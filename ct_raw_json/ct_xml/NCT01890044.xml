    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a leading cause of death in trauma patients.  Based on
      the EAST Management Guidelines for the prevention of VTE in trauma patients, a number of
      research questions could be addressed by a thorough current literature review combined with
      a multicenter concurrent analysis.  This proposal seeks to create a data registry of trauma
      patients from multiple trauma centers around the United States that will serve as a platform
      for the study of VTE.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The VTE related research questions, identified by the EAST Management Guidelines as needing
      further study, are:

        1. While numerous risk factors for VTE have been identified and reported, there are only 2
           that have Level 1 evidence to support them—spine fracture and spinal cord injury.  Many
           of the other reported risk factors were identified in studies that did not have
           protocols for surveillance, reported only on patients with symptoms, or used data from
           large administrative databases such as the National Trauma Data Bank4.  It has also
           been shown that the frequency of diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) increases
           when more duplex imaging of the extremities is undertaken5.  Thus, if an aggressive
           concurrent surveillance program for DVT and aggressive work up of suspected pulmonary
           embolism (PE) is undertaken:

             1. Are there unknown or under-reported risk factors?

             2. Is there a hierarchy of risk among the factors?  For example, is a long bone
                fracture associated with a higher incidence of VTE than a closed head injury?

             3. Do all closed head injuries with an AIS&gt;3 have the same degree of risk or is an
                epidural hematoma more risky than a subdural hematoma?

             4. What constitutes high and very high risk?

        2. What is the comparative efficacy and value6 of unfractionated heparin (UH), low
           molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and direct thrombin inhibitors (DTI) with or without
           associated mechanical prophylaxis (MP) in preventing VTE in trauma patients? In
           examining this question, the morbidity of these agents must be carefully determined,
           particularly with respect to intracranial injury and intra-abdominal solid viscus
           injury.

        3. In trauma patients who develop VTE what is the best treatment and for how long?

        4. Should all trauma patients who develop proximal deep venous thrombosis (pDVT) undergo a
           workup for thrombophilia or should this be based up the degree of &quot;inverse risk&quot;
           (inverse risk meaning a patient with a minor injury, who is thought to be at low risk,
           who develops pDVT)?  Similarly, should trauma patients who develop pulmonary embolism
           (PE) undergo a workup for thrombophilia or should this be based up the degree of
           &quot;inverse risk&quot;   [question 4 adds importance to answering questions 1a and 1b]?

        5. A recent meta-analysis of observational studies suggests that prophylactic inferior
           vena cava filters (PICVF) significantly reduce the risk of PE (OR: 0.09-0.49)7.  The
           authors of the meta-analysis point out a number of methodological flaws with the
           studies selected for the analysis.  Most importantly, all were retrospective studies
           with historical controls and the use of pharmacologic prophylaxis was not uniform among
           the studies evaluated.  Despite this report, there is continued significant practice
           variation in the use of PIVCF and the role of PIVCF in the care of trauma patients
           remains at question. Thus, if an aggressive concurrent surveillance program for DVT and
           aggressive work up of suspected PE is undertaken:

             1. Are all patients perceived to be at high risk for VTE who also have a relative or
                absolute contraindication to pharmacologic prophylaxis  receiving a PIVCF?

             2. Do PIVCF reduce the risk of PE in trauma patients in whom risk adjustment has been
                done?

             3. Do PIVCF have value for the trauma patient at very high risk for VTE, the high
                risk trauma patient or the moderate risk trauma patient? In examining this
                question, the morbidity of PIVCF must be carefully determined, particularly with
                respect to their placement (including local complications at the insertion site,
                their migration and degree of tilt) and long-term complications.

        6. Because most DVT is asymptomatic the clinical examination is extremely insensitive.
           Therefore, surveillance of the lower extremity venous systems is necessary.  However,
           the use of routine surveillance is controversial. It is also known that venous duplex
           exams, while very accurate in the symptomatic patient, can be quite insensitive in the
           asymptomatic patient.  In addition, surveillance scanning is hampered by external
           fixators and wounds (as many as 30% of extremities cannot be scanned for this reason10.
           Finally, it is not uncommon for trauma patients to have a PE (even a fatal PE) with
           negative followup surveillance of the lower extremity (LE) and upper extremity (UE)
           venous systems.  This would suggest either that the surveillance duplex was inaccurate,
           or the clot arose in a vein that could not be well interrogated by duplex (i.e., the
           hypogastric), or that the clot arose de novo in the pulmonary artery11. Thus, if an
           aggressive concurrent surveillance program for DVT and aggressive work up of suspected
           PE is undertaken:

             1. Does &quot;protocolized&quot; surveillance (surveillance of asymptomatic patients) have
                value? In other words, does the quality of the outcome (determining the presence
                of asymptomatic thrombus in the vein of an extremity) justify the cost?

             2. What constitutes the most effective protocol in terms of when the initial scan
                should be done and the frequency of subsequent scans?

             3. What is the fate of peroneal vein and tibial vein clot? Does it vary depending on
                the degree of risk (i.e., more likely to propagate in patients who are at the
                highest risk compared to patients with lower risk)?  The same question could be
                posed with respect to soleal vein or gastrocnemius vein clot.

             4. Does magnetic resonance venography have a role in high risk trauma patients as a
                surveillance modality—particularly those with pelvic fractures or severe LE
                fractures that cannot be reliably scanned?

             5. Does contrast venography have a role in high risk trauma patients as a
                surveillance modality, particularly in patients who have had a PE and who have a
                negative duplex?

             6. Since it has been shown by numerous authors that there is surveillance bias with
                regard to the diagnosis of DVT (i.e., the diagnosis is more often reported at
                hospitals doing more frequent scanning5, does the frequency of the diagnosis of PE
                increase as the number of chest CT angiograms are performed?

        7. Recent studies suggest an association between local14 or systemic11 inflammation and
           pulmonary thrombosis (perhaps not embolism).   Is there an increased risk of DVT or
           primary pulmonary thrombosis for trauma patients who have an associated inflammatory
           process such as sepsis, urinary tract infection (UTI) or pneumonia (PNA)?  What
           constellation of local injury puts a patient at risk for pulmonary thrombosis?

      We are proposing to perform an extensive literature review on each of these questions to
      produce a state of the art publication in follow-up of the EAST Management Guidelines and to
      provide a platform for a multicenter study of each or all of these questions.

      METHODS

        1. Literature Review. The literature review of each question will cover the period
           1989-2011.  The year 1989 was selected because that was the year of the last major
           literature review (the exception is the review by Rogers (ref) who authored the EAST
           Management Guidelines).  Each review will begin with a literature search performed
           under the guidance of a medical librarian using appropriate key words and MeSH (medical
           subject headings).  The bibliography of key articles will also be reviewed for
           pertinent literature.  Authors of the review will select criteria relevant to the
           question that will be used to select articles to be used in the review.

        2. Center Selection.  Centers selected for inclusion in the multicenter studies must have
           an interest in VTE, a research and publication track record on the subject, and be
           willing to participate by submitting their de-identified data to Scripps Mercy.  The
           centers will be selected by Drs. Steven Shackford and Frederick Rogers, recognized
           experts in the field of VTE in trauma.

        3. Study Design. Observational cohort.

        4. Patients.  All adult (age &gt; 18) trauma patients admitted to each of the centers with an
           expected length of stay (LOS) of &gt; 72 hours will be eligible for inclusion.

        5. Interventions. Each patient will undergo a risk assessment for VTE in compliance with
           the Surgical Care Improvement Program (SCIP-VTE 1 &amp; 2)12, which is currently being done
           by most hospitals.  Provided that there are no absolute or relative contraindications,
           each patient will receive appropriate VTE prophylaxis in compliance with the SCIP for
           the duration of their hospitalization.  The use of SCIP is a condition of participation
           in Medicare and poses no additional risk and no alteration in care of trauma patients.
           Surveillance for VTE will not be affected by participation in the study, but will be
           whatever is usual and customary for the participating institution.  Similarly, the
           management of patients who develop VTE will not be affected by participation in the
           study, but will be whatever is usual and customary for the participating institution.

        6. Data. The following data will collected concurrent with care:

      7. Analysis. Patients will be stratified according to their perceived risk (based on the
      existing literature) on their first hospital day into one of the risk categories specified
      by the American College of Chest Physicians (ref).  This initial risk assessment in the
      current basis for the determination of the need for prophylaxis.  The effectiveness and
      morbidity of prophylaxis will be determined in the various risk categories concurrent with
      care.  The effectiveness and value of surveillance protocols as well as the rationale for
      the use of prophylactic vena cave filters will be determined.

      8. Patient Safety.  Patients will remain anonymous; all patient identifiers will be purged
      from the data at the originating center.  Patient care will NOT be affected in any way by
      participation in the study.  Data recorded on paper will be kept in the Scripps Mercy Trauma
      Research Office in locked filed cabinets.  Digital data will be kept on either encrypted
      disks or in computers requiring password access.

      9. Importance.  The results of this study will add greatly to our understanding of the
      comparative effectiveness  of the prophylaxis, surveillance and treatment of VTE in trauma
      patients 10.     Data Input/Quality Assurance.  All data will be collected via a secure web
      based data collection tool (Research Electronic Data Capture - REDCap).  Each participating
      institution will have a secure login access code to input de-identified patient information.
       REDCap allows data acquisition with set perimeters per question to ensure data quality.
      Limiters per response and questions with 'branching logic' points have been created with
      'must answer' data protection elements enabling real time data quality assurance.  Review of
      interim data will be periodic and based on the REDCap report building function.  Missing
      data will be accessed and reported to the reporting data center for validation of values.
      Depending on the type of analysis performed with the data elements, individual missing data
      may be inputted or dropped from each of the final analysis.
