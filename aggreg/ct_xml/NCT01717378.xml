      The UCSF Research Participant Registry provides a service for investigators who seek to
      enroll eligible participants in their studies and for people who want to volunteer for
      clinical research. People with any diagnosed condition/disease, as well as healthy
      volunteers, can join the Registry by visiting the website at http://registry.ucsf.edu or
      calling 855-855-8273. To register, a person consents to be contacted about future studies
      and  fills out an online form that asks for contact and health information.  The
      participant's profile is used to match him or her to a specific study. Recruitment materials
      are sent to the Registry participant, who then decides whether to contact UCSF for further
      screening and potential enrollment.

      DESCRIPTION-- The UCSF Research Participant Registry (http://registry.ucsf.edu) is a secure,
      standalone database that actively collects and stores data from willing volunteers who visit
      its website.  The UCSF Registry is the centerpiece of the UCSF Participant Recruitment
      Service (PRS). Both the Registry and the PRS are among several initiatives implemented by
      the UCSF Clinical &amp; Translational Science Institute.

      The chief purpose of the PRS is to facilitate the enrollment of research participants into
      UCSF clinical studies. The primary function of the Registry is to expand the pool of
      potential clinical research volunteers. The Registry stores self-reported identifiable
      health information in a searchable database that is compliant with the privacy requirements
      of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This information is then
      used by the PRS for the future identification and recruitment of potentially eligible
      participants for specific UCSF studies.

      Registry participants whose data matches the major eligibility criteria for a specific study
      will be sent recruitment materials about the study. Contact information for the investigator
      or PRS staff will also be included in the mailing. Participants are then free to choose
      whether to respond or ignore the study recruitment information.

      ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA-- All adults age 18 years or older. Children/minors are excluded unless
      a parent or legal guardian provides consent for them.  Parents or guardians must provide
      their own contact information and then complete the questionnaire using the child's health
      information.

      Since participation in the Registry does not involve risk of physical harm, women of
      childbearing potential will not be excluded, although the questionnaire will query women as
      to their pregnancy status.

      Registry participants are asked to self-identify their race, ethnicity, and gender at
      registration, but demographic information will not exclude any person from joining the
      registry.

      REGISTRATION METHODS-- Individuals who are interested in volunteering for clinical research
      may join the Registry by completing an online form on the Registry website or by telephoning
      PRS staff for registration assistance. Registry participants provide electronic or oral
      consent to be contacted about specific studies for which they may qualify.

      DATA COLLECTION--The registration questionnaire collects the following  self-reported
      information:

        -  Contact information, including name, postal address, email address, telephone, and date
           of birth.

        -  Demographic information including race, ethnicity, and gender.

        -  Health information, includes broad medical areas of interest (e.g., asthma, heart
           disease, diabetes); a brief health history; family history; behavioral habits such as
           gambling or use of alcohol or tobacco; current medication use; and women's or men's
           health concerns.

      DATA EXTRACTION--As the HIPAA &quot;honest broker&quot;, PRS mines the data on behalf of investigators
      who request cohort ID &amp; direct mail services. A search query is developed based on major
      eligibility criteria, and the health data are searched. Once a recruitment cohort is
      identified, the contact data are extracted, and mailers are sent to the potential
      participants.

      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS--The primary analysis will describe screening and enrollment data
      for all potential participants compared with a study's baseline recruitment data to analyze
      various screening/enrollment metrics.
