To determine if providing information from geriatric assessment to patients, their\n      caregivers and oncologists improves patient satisfaction with communication with the\n      oncologist regarding age-related concerns.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To determine if providing GA information to patients, their caregivers, and oncologists\n      increases discussions about age-related issues during clinic consultation.\n\n      II. To determine whether initially providing patients, their caregivers, and oncologists\n      with GA information plus recommendations prior to their treatment influences quality of life\n      of older patients receiving treatment.\n\n      III. To determine whether providing patients, their caregivers, and oncologists with GA\n      information plus recommendations influences caregiver satisfaction with communication about\n      age-related issues.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. Exploratory aims will evaluate whether the number of discussions about age-related issues\n      during the clinic visit correlates with patient satisfaction and will explore if\n      communication about age-related issues influences how patients, caregivers, and oncologists\n      make decisions for cancer treatment.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\n      ARM I: Patients and their caregivers (if participating) complete the GA informational\n      intervention and receive recommendations guided by GA results provided by the oncology team\n      to discuss and implement for each age-related issue at baseline.\n\n      ARM II: Patients and their caregivers (if participating) complete the GA at baseline.\n\n      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, 10-14 weeks, and 20-24\n      weeks."
