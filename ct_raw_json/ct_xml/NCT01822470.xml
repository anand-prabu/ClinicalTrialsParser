  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence of small intestinal bacterial
      overgrowth (SIBO) in patients who will be undergoing an enteroscopy as an outpatient
      procedure with symptoms of functional dyspepsia.  In addition, the investigators would like
      to identify the types of bacteria that are present in the small intestines in patients with
      SIBO and compare two different diagnostic tools:  microbiologic culture and DNA sequencing
      of bacteria.

    <description>Prevalence of potential predictors of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth will be compared between subjects with and without a diagnosis of gram negative small intestinal bacterial overgrowth .  Definitions of functional dyspepsia, established and potential predictors of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth , and diagnosis of gram negative small intestinal bacterial overgrowth are defined in the protocol.</description>
