  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomised comparison of recanalisation of chronic occluded coronary arteries
      with implantation of Sirolimus eluting stents and medical therapy. Myocardial function and
      scar-size are determinated by using magnetic resonance imaging. The study hypothesis is the
      superiority of medical therapy over revascularisation.

    <textblock>
      In the REVASC-study recovery of left ventricular function after recanalization of chronic
      total coronary occlusions (CTO) and implantation of sirolimus-eluting stents will be
      examined and compared to medical treatment. Extent of the scar, viable myocardium in the
      infarct zone and regional left ventricular function will be assessed by cardiac magnetic
      resonance. Patients with regional systolic left ventricular dysfunction of any degree in the
      supply territory of the CTO vessel will be randomized to either recanalization of the
      occluded coronary artery or to conservative therapy. It is of interest whether CTO patients
      will have an improvement in left ventricular function after late coronary reopening,
      regarding the high technical demands and costs of CTO recanalization.
