          -  Have systemic signs and symptoms of inflammation as manifested by the presence of two
             or more of the following symptoms:  rash, fever, musculoskeletal pain, headache,
             fatigue or weakness

          -  Have a Diary Score of ≥0.5 (CANDLE Diary) or ≥1.0 (JDM Diary) assessed over 2 weeks
             prior to entry, if available.  Otherwise, participants can complete the diary after

             for enrollment into the study

             the investigator, did not respond or are no longer responding to therapy. If the
             participant has been diagnosed with CANDLE or Nakajo-Nishimura Syndrome (NNS) or an
             equivalent syndrome, the need for previous biologic therapy is not required

          -  Require treatment with oral corticosteroids (≥0.15 milligram per kilogram [mg/kg] of
             prednisone or its equivalent) for control of systemic signs and symptoms of their
             autoinflammatory disease for at least 2 weeks prior to study entry

          -  Have had previous documented elevations in acute-phase reactants (for example, high
             sensitivity C-Reactive protein [hsCRP]) considered to be the result of the
             autoinflammatory disease

          -  Have the ability to provide informed consent or have legal representative who is
             willing and able to provide written informed consent, provided that assent is
             obtained from participants at an age-appropriate level

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have received an immunosuppressive biologic agent/monoclonal antibody within 4
             half-lives prior to entry, for example, anakinra (4 half-lives=18 hours); etanercept
             (4 half-lives=18 days); infliximab; adalimumab (4 half-lives=36 days); use of
             intravenous immune globulin (IVIg) is permitted

             period regardless of age) who are sexually active and who do not agree to use 2 forms
             of highly effective methods of birth control or remain abstinent during the study and
             for at least 28 days following the last dose of investigational product

          -  Are sexually active males who do not agree to use 2 forms of highly effective birth
             control with female partners of childbearing potential or remain abstinent during the
             study and for at least 28 days following the last dose of investigational product

          -  Have had symptomatic herpes zoster or herpes simplex infection within 12 weeks prior
             to entry or during the screening period

          -  Have a history of disseminated/complicated herpes zoster (for example,
             multidermatomal involvement, ophthalmic zoster, central nervous system [CNS]
             involvement, postherpetic neuralgia)

          -  Have evidence of active infection, at the time of entry or during the screening
             period

             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

          -  Have documented high titer autoantibodies suggestive clinically of autoimmune
             diseases other than severe JDM

          -  Have been exposed to a live vaccine within 12 weeks prior to entry or are expected to
             need/receive a live vaccine (including herpes zoster vaccination) during the course
             of the study Note:  Investigators should review the vaccination status of the
             participants and follow the local guidelines for vaccination with nonlive vaccines
             intended to prevent infectious disease prior to entering participants into the study

             receive appropriate and documented prophylaxis for TB

          -  Have a serious and/or unstable illness that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             poses an unacceptable risk for the participant's participation in the study

          -  Have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on the most recent
             available serum creatinine of &lt;40 milliliters per minute (mL/min)

             years Note:  Participants with resolved cervical dysplasia, or no more than  3
             successfully treated basal-cell carcinoma of the skin, may participate in this study

             trial involving an investigational product or non-approved use of a drug or device
             (other than the investigational product used in this study), or concurrently enrolled
