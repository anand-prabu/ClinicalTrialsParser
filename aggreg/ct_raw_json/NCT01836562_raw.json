Autism is a physical\n      condition linked to abnormal biology and chemistry in the brain. The exact causes of these\n      abnormalities remain unknown,Symptoms-Children with autism typically have difficulties in:\n      Pretend play, Social interactions, Verbal and non-verbal communication. Some children with\n      autism appear normal before age 1 or 2 and then suddenly \"regress\" and lose language or\n      social skills they had previously gained. This is called the regressive type of autism.\n      People with autism may: Be overly sensitive in sight, hearing, touch, smell, or taste."
