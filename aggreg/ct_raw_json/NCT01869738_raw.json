The MGuard Prime stent wil be compared to other FDA approved bare-metal (BMS)\n      or drug-eluting (DES) coronary stents. The hypotheses are that (1) the MGuard Prime stent\n      will achieve a higher rate of complete ST-segment resolution as seen on the post-procedure\n      ECG as compared to the comparator stent, and will have a similar effect on the rate of\n      all-cause death or recurrent target vessel myocardial infarction at 365 days post-procedure."
