Co-administration of TG-2349 with food resulted in a significant increase in\n      bioavailability, and therefore concomitant food intake with dosing is recommended.\n\n      To further advance the clinical development of TG-2349, a new capsule formulation was\n      developed to replace the current TG-2349 oral solution.  The objectives of this study (study\n      number: TG-2349-02) are to evaluate the PK and relative bioavailability of TG-2349, given as\n      a new capsule formulation and as the original formulation of oral solution, after a single\n      oral dose of 400 mg under fed condition in healthy volunteers, and to evaluate the safety,\n      tolerability, and ethnic differences of the TG-2349 capsule formulation."
