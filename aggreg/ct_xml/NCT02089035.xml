  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The consumption of milk and dairy products is recognised as an essential part of a healthy
      diet as it represents an important source of key micro- and macronutrients. Nevertheless,
      there is still a widespread conviction that the overall high energy density and
      concentration of long-chain saturated fatty acids (SFA) present in dairy have detrimental
      health effects, contributing to the progression of cardiovascular disease, obesity and
      diabetes.

      Supplementation of the bovine diet with a source of MUFA, such as rapeseed oil, has become
      an achievable strategy in order to reduce the amount of SFA present in dairy products.

      The aim of this project is to observe the effects of three types of dairy products (UHT
      milk, cheese and butter) produced from milk derived from cows fed with rapeseed oil, on CVD
      risk biomarkers and plasma total cholesterol levels in adults with a &gt;10% risk of developing
      CVD. The aim is to determine whether an isoenergetic exchange of dairy products will affect
      vascular function and CVD biomarkers.
