Antihypertensive medications used include\n           diuretics. Resistant hypertension may also be diagnosed when clinic blood pressure has\n           reached the target value but quadruple or more of antihypertensives are used.\n\n        -  Diagnosis of controlled hypertension: Patients whose clinic blood pressure equals to\n           140/90mmHg (130/80mmHg for patients with diabetes mellitus or chronic renal disease) or\n           less with the administration of antihypertensives at optimal dose may be diagnosed as\n           controlled hypertension."
