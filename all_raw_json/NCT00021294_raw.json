Compare the safety and efficacy of eflornithine (DFMO) vs placebo as\n      chemoprevention of non-melanoma skin cancer in patients with moderate to heavy actinic\n      keratosis (AK). II. Determine whether this drug reverses AK in these patients. III.\n      Determine whether triamcinolone reduces DFMO-induced skin irritation in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are\n      randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive eflornithine (DFMO) topically\n      and triamcinolone topically to forearms once daily. Arm II: Patients receive DFMO and\n      placebo topically as in arm I. Arm III: Patients receive placebo and triamcinolone topically\n      as in arm I. Arm IV: Patients receive 2 placebos topically as in arm I. Treatment continues\n      for 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 2 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
