      Background: Women are more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety, which have been
      linked to reduced heart rate variability (HRV) and increased cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of an 8-week yoga program on
      HRV and mood in generally healthy women. The investigators hypothesized that there would be
      improvements in HRV and reductions in perceived stress and symptoms of depression and
      anxiety after the yoga intervention.

      Methods: Fifty-two healthy women were randomized to either a yoga group or a control group.
      Participants in the yoga group completed an 8-week yoga program, which comprised a 60-minute
      session, twice a week. Each session consisted of breathing exercises, yoga pose practice,
      and supine meditation/relaxation. Participants' HRV, perceived stress, depressive symptoms,
      and state and trait anxiety were assessed at baseline and week 9.

    <description>Heart rate variability analysis was derived from continuous heart rate recording, at a sampling rate of 1024 Hz, using an electrocardiogram (ECG) system (MP 150, BIOPAC Systems, Goleta, CA, USA). Participants were instructed to avoid exercise one day before the assessment session and abstain from caffeinated food and beverages on the day of assessment. During the assessment, participants were instructed to relax in a supine position with no other tasks or stimulation for 20 minutes while the ECG was recording. The last 10 minutes of the ECG recording was analyzed for HRV. R-R intervals were computed and the HRV power spectrum was obtained via a fast Fourier transformation algorithm using an appropriate software program (HRV Analysis for Windows, version 1.1; Biosignal Imaging Group and Analysis, the University of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland).</description>
