Use of Electrical Stimulation by Capacitive Field was the only addition to the current standard of care of the Emergency Unit of HC-FMRP/USP. These Electrical Stimulation by Capacitive Field devices do not produce heat or cause any sensation in tissue. The equipment will produce an electrical stimulation of low intensity pulsed output (1.5 MHz, 1:4 duty cycles, 30mW). The electrodes consist of two metal plates (20x20cm) separated by an insulating material."

Electrical stimulation for wound healing is a resource\n      that has been increasingly used in routine physical therapists, but has the disadvantage of\n      needing means of wet contact between the electrode and injury. The other resource used for\n      therapeutic healing is conventional electrical stimulation of low intensity for capacitive\n      field, a technique of physical therapy intervention not commercially available in Brazil.\n      This new technology seems to have significant physiological effects in tissue repair and has\n      been used for the treatment of chronic wounds which healed with difficulty. The objective is\n      to analyze the effects of electrical stimulation of low intensity for capacitive field in\n      healing skin burns. Patients from both genders aged over 18 years who have burns, will be\n      evaluated and treated at the Emergency Unit of the Hospital of the Faculty of Medicine of\n      Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, University of S\u00e3o Paulo. The stimulation will be initiated within 24 hours\n      after surgery to perform the graft and will be held daily for 60 minutes during the\n      patient's stay or until complete healing of the skin. The electromagnetic field will be\n      placed on the care of the burned area and / or the donor skin graft, not interfering with\n      departmental procedures. Will be performed photographic record standardized wound by a\n      digital camera, and then quantified by a computer program. Expected to reduce the period of\n      hospitalization and thus lowering the cost of treatment, and the possibility of improving\n      the quality of life of patients."
