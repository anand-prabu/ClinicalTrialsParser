Each participant will then be carefully re-assessed to determine\n      if it is appropriate to undertake a 12-week gluten challenge."

Undertake a therapeutic pilot study comparing mucosal histopathology before\n      and after a gluten challenge, to be preceded by a programmed desensitising micro-challenge\n      using Na as a tolerising agent.\n\n      Specific Aim 2. Assess systemic and mucosal immune responses to gluten micro-challenge, Na\n      infection, and gluten re-challenge throughout the pilot study, to be referenced against\n      hookworm-naive people with treated and untreated celiac disease.\n\n      Specific Aim 3. Utilising blood and tissue from hookworm-naive celiac disease volunteers,\n      undertake in vitro studies focusing on the effects of Na-derived excretory/secretory (ES)\n      products on gluten-stimulated gut mucosal cell apoptosis, cytokine and gene profiles."

All slides will be blinded and scores will be graded by Dr John Croese after which randomly selected counts will be verified by Dr Andrew Clouston. The Marsh score will be scored as Marsh 3A = 1, 3B = 2 and 3C = 3. CD3+IEL per 100 intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) will be counted at 24 randomly selected sites between the villus tip to the base of the crypt in each biopsy to establish a IEL:IEC ratio. The Vh:Cd ratios will be measured independently of the Marsh grading, to be performed on 10 randomly selected well-orientated sites.
