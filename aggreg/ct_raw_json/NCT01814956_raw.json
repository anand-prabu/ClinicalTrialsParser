In comparison, a standard parenteral nutrition with a soybean oil based emulsion will\n      be used. Data obtained in this trial may provide evidence for a beneficial effect of fish\n      oil derived omega-3 fatty acids in parenteral nutrition regarding their influence on acute\n      lung injury."
