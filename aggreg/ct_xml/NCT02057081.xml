  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project addresses the rehabilitation and mental health needs of married combat Veterans
      post-deployed from Iraq or Afghanistan with a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) by
      providing psychoeducation, communication and problem solving skills in a multifamily group
      (MFG) setting. In this group, Veterans and spouses/cohabiting partners learn customized
      therapeutic strategies to help compensate for mTBI deficits and promote Veteran community
      integration, interpersonal and emotion regulation skills, and marital satisfaction. The
      effectiveness of the skills-based MFG will be compared to that of a health education group
      which offers a supportive environment and basic education without skills training through a
      randomized clinical trial. As there is currently no family-based intervention for OEF/OIF
      Veterans with mTBI offered within the VA spectrum of services, this intervention fills a
      crucial gap in healthcare for our newest Veterans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), an injury or concussion associated with brief loss of
      consciousness or altered mental state, has affected as many as 35% of soldiers wounded
      during recent military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Up to 30% of those injured report
      persistent somatic, emotional and cognitive post-concussive symptoms (PCS) which may
      adversely impact family life and community re-integration.  Marital conflict and intimate
      partner violence, reported by 54% of OEF/OIF couples, and co-occurring mental health
      problems may exacerbate cognitive dysfunction and delay rehabilitation. A key contributor to
      marital conflict is a lack of knowledge about the Veteran's condition and the skills needed
      to help him compensate for common deficits in memory and planning which create challenges in
      household management. Despite a growing evidence base for couples treatment for PTSD, there
      is no established family-based treatment for OEF/OIF Veterans with mTBI, creating a critical
      research and services gap. The proposed research aims to fill this gap by evaluating a novel
      form of multi-family group treatment designed to improve community integration (CI) among
      married/cohabiting OEF/OIF Veterans with mTBI by training spouse/partners to aid with
      rehabilitation and employing disability-adapted communication and problem-solving skills to
      reduce marital conflict and improve marital satisfaction. Veterans (N=180) with a positive
      DVBIC screen for mTBI sustained during the OEF/OIF era, confirmed by the VA Identification
      Clinical Interview and a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score   19 will be randomized
      to receive either: 1) Multifamily Group for TBI for Couples (MFG-mTBI-C), a
      psychoeducational, rehabilitation and skills-building intervention consisting of a 2-session
      multifamily educational workshop providing information about TBI and 12 bi-monthly
      multifamily group meetings providing skills training in problem-solving and communication
      related to cognitive/emotional deficits; or 2) 14 bi-monthly multifamily group sessions
      delivering health education without skills training. Both treatments will be preceded by 2-3
      individual couples sessions. Participants will be assessed pre- and post-treatment and 6
      months post-treatment. Data will be analyzed using an intent-to-treat analysis with paired
      comparisons between treatment groups on primary (Veteran CI, caregiver burden) and secondary
      (anger management, use of social supports) outcome variables using mixed effects regression
      models. It is hypothesized that: 1) Veterans treated with MFG-mTBI-C will show improved CI,
      anger management and use of social support, and spouse/partners will show reduced burden
      compared with those treated in the health education group; 2) that improvement in CI will be
      mediated by improvement in marital satisfaction and Veteran anger management and social
      support; 3) that Veterans with more intact cognitive functioning at baseline will show
      greater improvement in CI, anger management, social support and marital satisfaction. If
      efficacious, MFG-mTBI-C has the potential to assist Veterans with mTBI and their partners
      throughout the VA Health Care System.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion criteria-Veterans:

        Eligible Veterans must have a diagnosis of mTBI in accordance with the VA/DOD Clinical
        Practice Guideline for Management of Concussion/Mild Traumatic Brain Injury:

          -  injury or concussion associated with at least one of the following:

               -  brief (&lt; 30 minutes) loss of consciousness

               -  or altered state of consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia for &lt; 24 hours
                  following the injury.

          -  Although referrals will be based on a positive DVBIC screen, the diagnosis must be
             confirmed by Parts A-C of the VA TBI Identification Clinical Interview (Vanderploeg
             et al., 2012).

          -  The TBI must be either blast-related or attributable to another discrete event (e.g.,
             fall, fight, injury) sustained during deployment in the OEF/OIF era.

          -  Post-concussive symptoms (e.g., sleep or memory problems, headache) must not be
             attributable to a subsequent injury or other pre-existing or concurrent neurologic
             disorder:

               -  Veterans with pre-existing or concurrent neurologic conditions (head trauma,
                  seizures, strokes, neurosurgery, other neurologic impairments based on medical
                  record or self-report) will be excluded.

          -  Eligible Veterans must also have a consenting, qualifying spouse/cohabiting partner
             and a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (Nasreddine,2005) score 19.

          -  The 30-item MoCA screens for impairment in specific areas of cognitive functioning
             deemed necessary for participation in a 90-minute, structured group including
             attention and concentration, executive functions, language and conceptual thinking.

          -  We have specified a MoCA cut-off at the lower end of the range for mild cognitive
             dysfunction (19), in order to exclude Veterans with severe memory and/or other
             cognitive deficits, while admitting those with more mild deficits, as these represent
             our target population, i.e. Veterans with a history of mTBI.

        Inclusion criteria-partners: Legally married to or co-residing with Veteran for at least 6
        months, with no plans for divorce or separation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria for Veterans and partners are:

          -  a lifetime diagnosis of a major psychiatric disorder (schizophrenia, schizoaffective
             or bipolar disorder) or active psychosis based on the Structured Clinical Interview
             for DSM-IV-TR (SCID-L) (First et al., 2007).

          -  alcohol or drug abuse or dependence defined by a Short Michigan Alcoholism Screening
             Test (SMAST) (Selzer, 1975) 3, based on the recommended cut-off for TBI survivors
             (Gentilello et al.,1995) or a Drug Abuse Screening Test-10 (DAST-10) (Skinner, 1982)
             3.

          -  &quot;severe&quot; inter-partner violence as defined by the revised 20-item Conflict Tactics
             Scale Short Form (CTS2S) (Straus &amp; Douglas, 2004).

          -  a lifetime history of 'worst point' suicidal ideation (including during the past
             week) at either of the two highest levels of ideation severity (intent or intent with
             plan) assessed by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating scale (C-SSRS): &quot;worst point&quot;
             scoring at these levels of ideation was associated with a fourfold increase in risk
             of a future attempt compared to the risk associated with current, less severe
             ideation (Posner et al., 2007).

          -  medical condition or life event (e.g., ongoing or pending legal action in another
             state) that would compromise participation.

          -  participation of either the caregiver or Veteran in another psychosocial intervention
             trial or couples' treatment six months prior to or during study or follow-up.
             Participation in individual psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are permitted: use of
             and starting/stopping these services will be tracked. Participants will be screened
             for inclusion/exclusion as described above immediately after giving consent.
