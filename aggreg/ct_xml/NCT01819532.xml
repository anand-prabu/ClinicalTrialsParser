  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anemia in preterm neonates is a significant problem encountered frequently in the neonatal
      intensive care unit.  Most preterm neonates born at less than 33 weeks gestation will
      require at least one blood transfusion during their hospital course and many will require
      repeated transfusions.  Blood transfusions, albeit necessary, carry increased risk of viral
      infections and transfusion reactions as well as increase the cost of healthcare.  The
      umbilical cord and placenta harbor up to 40% of blood available during fetal life. The
      current standard of care is immediate umbilical cord clamping. The investigators are
      performing a randomized controlled trial comparing immediate cord clamping to milking the
      umbilical cord prior to clamping in neonate born preterm less than 33 weeks gestation. The
      investigators hypothesize that milking the umbilical cord will demonstrate the same benefits
      as delayed cord clamping, without delaying neonatal resuscitation.
