  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an aerobic training intervention will
      alter markers of immune cell aging, improve exercise capacity and blood pressure and
      decrease psychological distress over 24 weeks in 32 caregivers compared to 32 age-matched
      wait list control caregivers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will prospectively examine whether an aerobic training intervention will
      alter markers of immune cell aging (i.e. increase leukocyte and peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells telomerase activity, telomere length, and mitochondrial function) improve exercise
      capacity and blood pressure, and decrease psychological distress over 24 weeks in 32
      caregivers compared to 32 age-matched wait list control caregivers. Our sample will be
      comprised of caregivers who provide unpaid care for a family member diagnosed with
      Alzheimer's disease or other dementia. Participants in the study will be highly stressed and
      inactive male and female caregivers of family members with Alzheimer's disease or other
      dementia. All eligible participants will complete one week of ecological momentary
      assessments (EMA) to examine whether (1) previously unfit, high-stressed caregivers benefit
      psychologically from becoming active, (2) this benefit is derived through changes in how
      caregivers react to and recover from stressful events, and (3) whether these salubrious
      psychological effects mediate changes in biological outcomes (e.g., cellular aging). Next,
      participants will participate in a one-week run-in period of stretching 30 minutes on 4
      separate days prior to randomization to guarantee that the investigators are randomizing
      well-informed participants that are willing and able to complete the expected exercise.
      Next, participants are randomized into the aerobic exercise or wait list control arm. In the
      24th week of the study, participants complete a second week of the EMAs sub-study, and
      return after week 24 for a final blood draw.

      Research study assessments consist of self-report questionnaires, body composition, physical
      performance and fitness tests, and a fasting blood draw. The follow-up visit, 24 weeks
      later, consists of a repeat of the same morning health visit.
