Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, such as yttrium 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan, can\n      find cancer cells and carry cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.\n      Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some\n      block the ability of cancer to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them\n      or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan with\n      rituximab may kill more cancer cells."

Determine the progression free survival of patients treated with ibritumomab tiuxetan\n      when given as an intravenous infusion.\n\n      II. Determine the overall survival of patients treated with ibritumomab tiuxetan when given\n      as an intravenous infusion.\n\n      III. Establish the toxicity profile of ibritumomab tiuxetan in this patient population.\n\n      IV. Use positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to map the\n      distribution of Y-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan, and calculate the Gy delivered based on the\n      activity found within tumor.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on day 1. Within 7 to 9 days, patients receive\n      rituximab IV and yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV in the absence of disease progression\n      or unacceptable toxicity. Distribution and dose absorbed dose will be assessed on day 11.\n      Quality of life will be assessed at screening, at day 1, 36, 92, and at each follow-up\n      visit.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months for 2 years."
