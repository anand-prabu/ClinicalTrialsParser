The study will also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the program.\n\n      Specific Aims:\n\n        1. Evaluate whether financial incentives for completing ADA recommended tests, exams and\n           vaccinations will improve compliance rates.\n\n        2. Evaluate whether financial incentives for health education and biometric outcomes will\n           improve diabetes patients' self-management.\n\n        3. Evaluate the extent to which financial incentives for healthy behaviors reduce health\n           care utilization."

            "textblock": "Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States (OECD 2013). It is also\n      known that certain populations are at greater risk for diabetes. In Hawaii, diabetes\n      disproportionally affects Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders as they are three times\n      more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. In addition, in 2010 the U.S. Department of\n      Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health reported that Native Hawaiians/Pacific\n      Islanders in Hawaii were 5.7 times as likely as Caucasians living in Hawaii to die from\n      diabetes(Office of Minority Health, 2010).\n\n      In order to address the challenges that chronic diseases impose on individuals and the\n      health care system the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is assessing the\n      impact of incentivizing patients to increase self-care and disease management. Previous\n      studies have demonstrated that monetary incentives have been associated with an improvement\n      in behavioral outcomes, most notably when the incentive is received immediately following\n      the targeted behavior (Volpp, K.G., et.al., 2008; Mitchell, M.S., et.al., 2013). Cahill et\n      al. (2008) showed that economic incentives were tied to smoking cessation and led to a\n      decrease in relapse within a year. Our study seeks to build on these findings and determine\n      whether economic incentives may provide a way to improve diabetes self-management.\n\n      Data:\n\n      Electronic data (Labs, Outcomes) - January 1st, 2013 through June 30, 2016 Electronic data\n      (Claims) - January 1st, 2011 through June 30, 2016"
