Have a history of AIDS-defining opportunistic\n        illness (except for Kaposi's sarcoma involving skin) within 45 days of the screening\n        visit. Treatment for the illness must have been completed at least 30 days prior to\n        screening.\n\n        Are enrolled in another study where the medication may interfere with the control of viral\n        load in this study.\n\n        Have a serious medical condition such as diabetes or heart problems that would make it\n        unsafe to be on this study.\n\n        Have a history of a severe nerve disease of the type that may cause muscle weakness.\n\n        Have had pancreatitis (inflamed pancreas) or hepatitis within 6 months of starting the\n        study.\n\n        Have had radiation treatment or chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to study entry, or think\n        those treatments may be needed during the study period. Local treatment for Kaposi's\n        sarcoma is allowed.\n\n        Have used certain medications, including vaccines, that interfere with the immune system\n        within 4 weeks prior to study entry.\n\n        Have taken an HIV vaccine within 3 months prior to entry.
