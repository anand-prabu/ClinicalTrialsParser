Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor\n      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Biological therapies\n      such as gefitinib may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of\n      non-small cell lung cancer. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.\n      Giving different regimens of combination therapy together with gefitinib and radiation\n      therapy may be an effective treatment for non-small cell lung cancer."

To determine whether ZD1839 at 250 mg orally every day administered concomitantly with\n      paclitaxel, carboplatin, and radiation after induction treatment consisting of paclitaxel,\n      carboplatin, and ZD1839 among patients with inoperable stage III non-small cell lung cancer\n      and CTC performance status 0-1 is tolerable.\n\n      III. To determine the overall response rate, failure-free survival, and survival after\n      treatment with induction chemotherapy with daily ZD1839, concomitant radiotherapy and daily\n      ZD1839, and post-radiotherapy single agent daily ZD1839 among patients with CTC performance\n      status 2 or poor risk performance status 0-1 and inoperable stage III non-small cell lung\n      cancer.\n\n      IV.

Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses.\n      Patients then receive therapy based on their assigned stratum.\n\n      STRATUM I: Patients receive gefitinib orally (PO) daily for 7 weeks.
