The setup was a retrospective two-centre study including patients \u226518 years\n      undergoing primary elective open non-mesh sutured umbilical or epigastric hernia repairs.\n      The survey included questions on suspicion of recurrence, reoperation for recurrence (if yes\n      patients were examined by a consultant in patients home), pain, discomfort, work, and\n      leisure activities. We analysed 295 consecutive patients through a non-validated structured\n      questionnaire."
