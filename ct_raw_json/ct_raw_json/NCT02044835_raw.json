Sixty patients\n      with diagnosed atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and had chronic kidney disease stage 3\n      will be recruited, and will be randomized into two groups in a 1:1 ratio ( FZQZ and placebo\n      Group, 30 respectively). FZQZ Oral liquid or placebo 20 ml every time, three times a day for\n      different groups, meanwhile, all participants in both treatment groups received OMT, 6\n      months therapeutic period. Serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate(eGFR),\n      urine protein, and cardiovascular and renal events (a composite end point of death from\n      cardiovascular or renal causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for\n      congestive heart failure, progressive renal insufficiency, or the need for renal-replacement\n      therapy) will be compared between the Groups as the outcome."
