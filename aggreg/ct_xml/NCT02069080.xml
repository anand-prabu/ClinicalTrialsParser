  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In mouse models and in patients, expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 on various
      cancers has been correlated with aggressive biological behavior, including increased rates
      and certain sites of metastasis, and decreased survival. Plerixafor (Mozobil  ; Genzyme;
      Cambridge, MA) has been identified as a specific inhibitor of CXCR4, and it is currently
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a stem-cell mobilizing agent in combination
      with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and
      multiple myeloma. Our group has recently shown that plerixafor can be labeled with the
      positron-emitting radionuclide copper-64((64)Cu) to form (64)Cu-plerixafor, which can be
      used to visualize CXCR4-positive tumor xenografts in mice using small-animal positron
      emission tomography (PET). Determining CXCR4 expression in tumors using (64)Cu-plerixafor
      and PET/computerized tomography (CT) scanning could be useful in predicting tumor behavior
      and responses to current and experimental therapies, including therapies targeting CXCR4,
      which could lead to more effective    personalized    cancer treatments.

      This study   s primary objective is to evaluate (64)Cu-plerixafor as an imaging agent for
      quantifying CXCR4 expression in subjects (greater than or equal to 18 years of age) with
      cancer; at least 1 detectable solid tumor of greater than or equal to 2 cm in diameter found
      outside of the lymph nodes, bone marrow, liver, gallbladder, kidney, bladder, and brain; and
      preexisting biopsies of the tumors obtained since the first detection of the current
      occurrence/recurrence of disease. The secondary objectives are to correlate
      (64)Cu-plerixafor standardized uptake value in the target lesion with the level of CXCR4
      expression detected via immunohistochemistry and to calculate human dosimetry for
      (64)Cu-plerixafor.

      Preexisting tumor biopsies from less than or equal to 75 subjects recruited from the
      National Cancer Institute and the Georgetown University Hospital will be evaluated for CXCR4
      expression via immunohistochemistry. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will
      continue onto the study. Five subjects with CXCR4-positive tumor biopsies will be
      administered an initial intravenous infusion of (64)Cu-plerixafor (8 +/-0.8 mCi ; 0.48+/-
      0.048 rem; not to exceed 5 microg of (64)Cu -plerixafor) over 2 minutes. They will then
      undergo an initial low-dose transmission CT scan followed by 3 consecutive torso PET scans
      as soon as practical after the infusion, and 2 additional PET/CT scans at 4 hours +/- 1 hour
      and 24 hours +/- 2 hours post-infusion. Human dosimetry will be calculated based on these
      results, and a maximum dose will be used, not to exceed the calculated limit of a total
      effective dose of 5 rem, or the radiation exposure limit for each organ. The remaining
      subjects with CXCR4-positive (n=15) and CXCR4-negative (n=5) tumor biopsies will be
      administered 64Cu-plerixafor at the same, or a newly calculated dose, and will undergo 1
      PET/CT scan between 1 and 4 hours post-infusion, depending on the dosimetry results. All
      subjects will undergo one comprehensive final study visit between study days 19 and 23
      (11-17 days after injection with (64)Cu -plerixafor). Additionally, blood will be collected
      2 more times between study days 13-16 and study days 26-30 to measure blood cell counts.
