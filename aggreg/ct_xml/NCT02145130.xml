      The purpose of this study is the evaluation of the safety of autologous tissue-engineered
      dermal substitutes &quot;denovoDerm&quot; (first arm) and dermo-epidermal skin substitutes
      &quot;denovoSkin&quot; (second arm) transplanted onto the wound bed in children and adolescents.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Deep partial or full thickness skin defect of at least 9 cm2 requiring surgical wound
             coverage due to:

               1. Acute cases: burn injury, soft tissue injury, skin necrosis after purpura
                  fulminans

               2. Reconstructive cases (elective surgery): scar formation after burn injuries,
                  congenital giant nevus, skin tumours

          -  Informed consent by patients/parents or other legal representatives

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Infected wounds or positive general microbiological swabs taken from the nose for
             multi-resistant germs

          -  Patients tested positive for HBV, HCV, syphilis or HIV

          -  Patients with known underlying or concomitant medical conditions that may interfere
             with normal wound healing (e.g. immune deficiency, systemic skin diseases, any kind
             of congenital defect of metabolism including diabetes)

          -  Coagulation disorders as defined by INR outside its normal value, PTT &gt;ULN and
             fibrinogen &lt;LLN and / or at the Investigator's discretion

          -  Previous enrolment of the patient into the current study

          -  Participation of the patient in another study within 30 days preceding and during the
             present study

          -  Patients or parents/other legal representatives expected not to comply with the study
             protocol

          -  Suspicion of child abuse

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding females
