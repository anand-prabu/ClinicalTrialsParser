            "textblock": "Usually Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a disease of the elderly patients. However,\n      the diagnosis in young patients become more frequently with poor prognosis. The\n      identification of new prognostic factors permits early determination of the high risk\n      population and provide them the therapeutic intensification. Allogeneic transplantation of\n      hematopoietic stem cells transplantation (AHSCT) allows to long-term remission and in some\n      cases complete and definitive eradication of the disease. After chemotherapy or antibodies,\n      the Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negativity is associated with better disease-free\n      survival. MRD negativity occurs in some patients with the appearance of GVHD, stopping the\n      immunosuppression or after donor lymphocyte injection (DLI). The negativity of MRD in the\n      first year post-transplant is correlated with better progression-free survival or overall\n      survival (Dreger 2010, Farina 2009, Caballero 2005, Algrin, 2011). So, MRD negativity may be\n      an objective after AHSCT. The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate a standardized\n      preemptive immunointervention of post-allograft immunosuppressive therapy modulation and DLI\n      administration according to MRD level. The objective is to obtain MRD negativity at 12\n      months after AHSCT."
