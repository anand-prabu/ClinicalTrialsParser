The included patients represented all patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy by one surgeon during the study period.

A standardized protocol with IFC including\n      concomitant angiography was performed during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Intra-operative\n      time-registration and exposure of predefined anatomical structures were recorded."
