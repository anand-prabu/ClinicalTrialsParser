            "textblock": "Project Summary:  One of the challenges facing pediatric researchers is the need to balance\n      decreasing funding with the time and human resource costs associated with enrolling\n      children.  In order to address this, the Emergency Department (ED) research team developed\n      an innovative model for subject enrollment and consent using highly trained and supervised\n      undergraduate students. From a human resources perspective, utilizing students is more cost\n      effective than the traditional research nurse model.  However, a concern with this method is\n      the adequacy of parental understanding of study information for informed consent. The aim of\n      this project is to determine if the use of students is at least as good as the more costly\n      \"gold standard\" of experienced research nurses. The validation of this innovative student\n      model will enable child health investigators to better meet parent's needs and increase the\n      efficiency of pediatric research.\n\n      The primary objective of this study is to measure parental comprehension of informed consent\n      information using an innovative undergraduate research assistant program compared to consent\n      using the traditional research nurse model. We hypothesize that parental comprehension of\n      the informed consent information process when approached by undergraduate students will be\n      comparable (or not worse) than when consent is obtained by a research nurse."
