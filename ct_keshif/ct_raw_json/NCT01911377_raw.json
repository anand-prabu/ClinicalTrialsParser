It has been noticed to exert some analgesic(pain relieving) effect, and\n      has recently been studied as a treatment for neuropathic pain.\n\n      We want to see if Botox, injected intradermally, will relieve the symptoms of allodynic-type\n      neuropathic pain.\n\n      24 volunteers are to be enrolled, with 16 receiving active treatment, and 8 \"controls\"\n      receiving placebo."
