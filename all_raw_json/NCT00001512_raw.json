The goals of\n      vaccine development in the current study are to develop vaccines: 1) with improved potency\n      and 2) which are more effective at inducing cell-mediated immune responses.  The selection\n      of GM-CSF as the immunological \"adjuvant\" is a direct extension of our laboratory studies in\n      small animal models demonstrating that GM-CSF can enhance the potency of the prototype\n      Id-KLH vaccine by augmenting almost exclusively the cellular arm of the immune response.\n\n      The objectives of this study are: 1) to evaluate cellular and humoral immune responses\n      against the unique idiotype of the patient's lymphoma and 2) to evaluate the ability of the\n      Id vaccine to clear the bone marrow of malignant cells detectable by pathologic examination\n      or molecular examination (polymerase chain reaction amplification of the rearranged bcl-2\n      oncogene).\n\n      The goal of this study is to treat previously untreated patients with follicular lymphomas\n      to complete remission or minimal residual disease with ProMACE chemotherapy.  Three to six\n      months after completion of chemotherapy, in an effort to reduce the relapse rate (by\n      eradicating microscopic disease resistant to chemotherapy), patients will receive an\n      autologous Id vaccine administered in combination with GM-CSF.  Id-KLH (0.5 mg) is\n      administered subcutaneously.  GM-CSF is administered subcutaneously locally with the vaccine\n      on the day of vaccination and for the three consecutive days following vaccination as close\n      to the initial vaccination site as possible at one of two doses (patients are randomized to\n      either a high or low dose, 500 or 100 micrograms/m2).\n\n      We plan to accrue 42 patients.  Twenty-nine patients have been enrolled.  Sixteen patients\n      have entered and/or completed the vaccination phase.  Patients have demonstrated significant\n      lymphoproliferative responses specific for autologous idiotype of a magnitude which is\n      significantly greater than previously observed."
