  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult medical/surgical inpatient hospital care is more difficult and more expensive when
      complicated by alcohol dependency (AD), especially for patients who develop alcohol
      withdrawal syndrome (AWS).  AWS can be mild, moderate or severe.  The Severity of Ethanol
      Withdrawal Scale (SEWS) is tool used to assess severity and is the current standard of care
      for both monitoring and treating AWS at Denver Health.  Moderate/severe AWS (i.e., SEWS ≥ 7)
      has important clinical implications and requires pharmacological treatment.  At present,
      there are no safe and effective options for preventing AWS in at-risk inpatients.  Baclofen
      is a GABA-B receptor agonist that has been used in the alleviation of spasticity in patients
      with multiple sclerosis since the 1970s.  Baclofen has shown promise in the management of
      alcohol dependency in preclinical and clinical studies.  We propose to examine baclofen in
      the prevention/amelioration of AWS in adult medical inpatients. The investigators
      hypothesize that Baclofen, as compared to placebo, will significantly reduce the number of
      adult inpatients with AD who will develop moderate/severe AWS (SEWS ≥ 7) when assessed at 72
      hours after enrollment. Further the investigators hypothesize that Baclofen, as compared to
      placebo, will significantly reduce the need for symptom-triggered benzodiazepine
      administration during the 72 hours of hospitalization. These hypotheses will be tested in
      adult inpatients who are determined to be at risk for alcohol withdrawal and are
      subsequently placed on the SEWS monitoring and treatment protocol. These patients will be
      randomized to baclofen 10mg three times daily vs placebo.

    <description>The difference in the probability of progression to moderate or severe AWS within 72 hours of enrollment between those who receive baclofen and those who receive placebo will be assessed using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution.  The null hypothesis of no difference will be tested using the continuity-corrected z-statistic at the one-sided α = 0.05 level of significance.  The Newcombe hybrid score confidence limits for the difference will also be reported.</description>

    <description>The difference in the mean SEWS scores at 24, 48, and 72 hours after enrollment between those who receive baclofen and those who receive placebo will be assessed using a repeated-measures longitudinal model.  Contrasts between the groups will be constructed for each of the 24-hour time points as well as for the overall 72-hour period.</description>
