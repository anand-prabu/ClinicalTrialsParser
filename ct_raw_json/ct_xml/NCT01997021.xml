  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing physical activity in older adults has important implications for treating obesity
      related metabolic conditions, however the interaction of aging- and obesity-related declines
      in physical function may make adding structured exercise particularly challenging for this
      group.  Given these challenges, an alternative prescription to traditional structured
      exercise, may be short bouts of intermittent walking scattered throughout the day - this may
      be an effective strategy to increase physical activity, reduce sedentary behavior, and
      improve glycemic control in overweight/obese older adults. The purpose of this project is to
      determine how interrupting sedentary time with short bouts of moderate intensity walking
      affects important metabolic outcomes in older, overweight adults.  It would also be of
      interest to compare the effects of short, frequent interruptions in sedentary behavior to a
      traditional exercise prescription (continuous 30 min walking bout) on metabolic outcomes
      (e.g., glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and 24 h fat oxidation).  Thus, the overall
      aims of the proposed research are to  1) Determine the effect of performing short bouts of
      moderate-intensity intermittent walking (IW) on glucose and insulin metabolism compared to
      uninterrupted sitting (US) in older overweight and obese adults.  2) To compare the effects
      of interrupting sedentary time (IW) vs. a traditional exercise prescription (continuous 30 m
      walk (CW)) on metabolism.

      The investigators hypothesize that interrupting sedentary time with intermittent walking
      will improve glucose and insulin metabolism compared to uninterrupted sitting and it will be
      as effective at improving metabolism as a single continuous 30 min walk.
