Compare the efficacy of low dose versus high dose prophylactic cranial\n      irradiation in preventing brain metastases in patients with small cell carcinoma of the\n      lung. II. Determine the neuropsychiatric status of these patients before and after\n      treatment.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. The right or left hemisphere of each\n      patient's brain are randomized to one of two treatment arms. All patients receive whole\n      brain radiotherapy 5 days a week over 2.5 weeks for a total of 12 fractions. Arm I: Patients\n      receive radiotherapy to the left cerebral hemisphere daily for 6 days immediately following\n      completion of whole brain radiotherapy. Arm II: Patients receive radiotherapy to the right\n      cerebral hemisphere daily for 6 days immediately following completion of whole brain\n      radiotherapy. Patients with extensive disease may also receive thoracic radiotherapy, if not\n      administered previously. Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and then every\n      6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 16-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-4\n      years."
