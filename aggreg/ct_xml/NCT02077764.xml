      Objective:

        -  To assess the relationship between coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) and graft
           function, and to evaluate non-invasive methods for CAV diagnosis.

        -  To assess left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) function in the acute phase
           and serially during the first year after transplantation.

        -  To evaluate the impact of acute and repetitive rejection on the longitudinal myocardial
           function Hypothesis

             1. Timing of development and degree of CAV can be measured non-invasively combining
                myocardial longitudinal deformation (by advanced echocardiography) and coronary
                flow velocity reserve (CFVR) (by echocardiography and PET). This combination of
                methods can detect CAV before it is angiographically visual and gives
                supplementary information of the impact on myocardial graft function.

             2. Longitudinal deformation, 3D echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
                (CMRI) and PET can be used for RV and LV myocardial function assessment and
                represent more valid markers of the function than standard echocardiography in
                heart transplant (HTX) patients.

             3. Myocardial longitudinal deformation is a better marker of acute rejections than
                conventional ejection fraction (EF).

      Importance of the GRAFT study Diagnosing CAV in the early phases by non-invasive methods can
      improve the treatment and reduce the use of CAG. The study will provide better tools for
      balancing the immunosuppressive treatment, which could lower the incidence of treatment
      related cancer and impaired renal function.

      By serial examinations we will obtain new important knowledge of the physiology of the graft
      and the influence of rejections and CAV development during the first year. We seek
      prognostic markers for these complications. Hopefully the treatment of acute graft failure
      and prevention of complications is thereby improved. If rejections can be diagnosed by
      non-invasive methods, many biopsies can be spared, complications avoided and life quality
      improved.

      Background The most frequent heart related death causes after HTX are CAV, acute graft
      failure and rejection.

      CAV is characterized by diffuse concentric intima thickening involving both epicardial
      vessels and the coronary microvascular system. In our clinical approach HTX-patients are
      followed with annual CAG and standard echocardiography with estimation of LV systolic
      function by EF. Standard echocardiography has not proven benefit in the diagnosis of CAV.
      CAG often misses CAV in early phases.

      In various cardiac diseases it is well known that ischemia and fibrosis often affect the
      endocardial longitudinal oriented layers. Longitudinal deformation by advanced
      echocardiography has shown to be better markers for systolic function in HTX patients
      compared to standard EF. Longitudinal LV systolic function is dependent of endocardial
      perfusion. CFVR represents the capacity of the coronary circulation to dilate due to
      metabolic demands and has been shown to correlate with longitudinal deformation in
      myocardial infarction. CFVR measurements in HTX patients with advanced echocardiography and
      PET scan have shown a significant correlation to CAV.

      RV failure is an early, potentially fatal, complication to HTX. The function and change over
      time of RV have not been fully studied using modern echocardiographic techniques or
      assessment by CMRI.

      Acute rejection is an inflammatory response often diagnosed by routine biopsies (gold
      standard). These are expensive, time consuming and inconvenient for the patient. The role of
      conventional echocardiography has not yet found a significant role in the diagnostics of
      acute rejections and furthermore how repeated rejections influence on graft function is not
      well described.

      Study 1 A cross sectional study consisting of 50 stabile HTX patients. These will be
      selected with 25 patients with no or light CAV and 25 patients with moderate or severe CAV.

      Severity of CAV will be evaluated by:

        -  CAG

        -  CFVR measurement by advanced echocardiography and PET.

      Graft function will be evaluated by:

        -  Advanced echocardiography at rest end during bicycle exercise.

        -  CMRI including assessment of LV and RV EF, strain and mass.

        -  During rest and bicycle exercise echocardiography simultaneously right heart
           catheterization are performed for hemodynamic measurement

      Study 2 A prospective cohort study with 20-25 newly transplanted patients over a period of
      12 months.

      LV and RV function will be measured by:

        -  Advanced echocardiography

        -  CFVR measurement (echocardiography and PET)

        -  CMRI for LV and RV EF, strain and mass

        -  Right heart catheterization

      Study 3 Prospective examination of correlation between graft function, CAV and rejection.
      Information of former episodes of acute rejection is collected retrospective. Study
      objectives are all living HTX patients (approx. 200) in the period of 2011-2013.

      Objective

        1. To assess the relationship between myocardial perfusion, coronary anatomy and
           longitudinal myocardial function in heart transplanted (HTX) patients with and without
           coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV).

        2. Evaluation of systolic and diastolic capacity during exercise in HTX patients with and
           without CAV.

        3. Evaluation of non-invasive methods for CAV diagnosis.

        4. To assess left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) function in the acute phase
           and during follow-up (5 times) the first year after transplantation and furthermore to
           compare advanced echocardiographic evaluation of graft function with cardiac magnetic
           resonance imaging (CMRI), right heart catheterization, and positron emission tomography
           (PET).

        5. Finally, to evaluate the impact of acute and repetitive rejection on myocardial graft
           function measured by standard 2D echocardiography and advanced echocardiography with
           analysis of longitudinal myocardial function.

      Hypothesis

        1. Timing of development and degree of CAV can be measured non-invasively combining
           myocardial longitudinal deformation measurement by advanced echocardiography and
           coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) by echocardiography and PET. This combination of
           methods can detect CAV before it is angiographic visual and gives supplementary
           information of the impact on myocardial graft function. This setup might be more
           appropriate in evaluation of the myocardial graft function and CAV than standard
           echocardiography and coronary angiography (CAG). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) can
           detect CAV in early phases and gives supplementary characterization of the plaque.

        2. Modern non-invasive methods (longitudinal deformation, 3D echocardiography, CMRI and
           PET) can be used in RV and LV myocardial function assessment and represents more valid
           markers of the function than standard echocardiography in HTX patients.

        3. During exercise patients with CAV will show impaired longitudinal myocardial
           deformation and restrictive filling with significant increasing LV and RV filling
           pressures.

        4. Myocardial longitudinal deformation is a better marker of acute rejections than
           conventional ejection fraction (EF). After an episode of severe acute rejection the
           graft function will improve, but instances of repetitive rejections will lead to
           impaired longitudinal systolic function with preserved LV EF.

      Importance of the GRAFT study By combining examinations from the Department of Cardiology
      and the Department of Nuclear Medicine, unique advanced diagnostic methods are developed.
      This study might improve the prognosis and quality of life for many HTX patients worldwide
      and strengthen the transplantation research on a national basis.

      Diagnosing CAV in the early phases by non-invasive methods can improve the treatment and
      reduce the use of CAG. New methods for balancing the immunosuppressive treatment and lower
      the incidence of treatment related cancer and impaired renal function might be explored, to
      the benefit of a large number of patients worldwide.

      By serial examinations we will obtain new knowledge of the physiology of the graft and the
      influence of rejections and CAV development during the first year. We seek prognostic
      markers for these complications. Hopefully the treatment of acute graft failure and
      prevention of complications is thereby improved. If rejections can be diagnosed by
      non-invasive methods, many biopsies can be spared, complications avoided and life quality
      improved.

      Background The Department of Cardiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby, now has 20
      years of experience with HTX. Mean survival after HTX at our center is 15.6 years (1).
      Complications remain frequent and serious. In the first postoperative year the main causes
      of death are graft failure, rejections and infection. At long term follow up main causes of
      death are CAV and malignancies (2).

      CAV is characterized by diffuse concentric intima thickening involving both epicardial
      vessels and the coronary microvascular system. After 10 years more than 50% of patients
      shows angiographic signs of CAV (2,3).

      In our clinical approach HTX-patients are followed with annual CAG and standard
      echocardiography with estimation of LV systolic function by EF. EF is often within normal
      range even though CAV lesions are evident by CAG (3), suggesting that LV EF is an
      inappropriate parameter for detecting impaired myocardial function in CAV. Symptoms of graft
      dysfunction first present themself with severe CAV. Studies have shown that CAG often misses
      CAV in early phases (3,4). OCT is a novel intravascular imaging modality with excellent
      spatial resolution. It has been used in a few small cross sectional studies with HTX
      patients and seems like a promising tool for detecting CAV and gives supplementary
      characterization of the plaque (5,6).

      In various cardiac diseases it is well known that ischemia and fibrosis often affect the
      endocardial longitudinal oriented layers leading to abnormal systolic function of both LV
      and RV. Longitudinal deformation by tissue Doppler and strain analysis has shown to be
      better markers for systolic function in HTX patients compared to standard measurements such
      as LV EF (7). Longitudinal LV systolic function is dependent of endocardial perfusion. CFVR
      represents the capacity of the coronary circulation to dilate, due to increased myocardial
      metabolic demands and is expressed by the difference between the hyperaemic and resting
      flow. CFVR has been shown to correlate with the degree of decreased longitudinal deformation
      in myocardial infarction (8). CFVR measurements in HTX patients with color Doppler
      echocardiography and PET scan have shown a significant correlation to CAV (4,9,10).

      RV failure is an early, potentially fatal, complication to HTX. Standard echocardiographic
      measurement does not seem to reflect the overall RV systolic performance and clinical status
      of the patient. Prior studies have found impaired RV function after HTX (11-13), but most
      studies of RV function were not performed with simultaneous right heart catheterization or
      assessment of RV EF by CMRI (golden standard). Overall the function and change over time of
      RV have not been fully studied using modern echocardiographic techniques or assessment by
      CMRI.

      Acute rejection is an inflammatory response most frequently in the first 6 months after HTX.
      Two thirds experience rejection episodes within first year (14,15). To prevent rejections
      patients are treated with immunosuppressive therapy. This has several side effects including
      nephrotoxicity, infection and cancer risk. The balance between avoiding rejections and
      minimizing side effects is challenging.

      Rejections are often asymptomatic and associated with poor outcome, including development of
      CAV. Patients are followed with routine biopsies (gold standard), but these are expensive,
      time consuming and inconvenient for the patient. The role of conventional echocardiography
      has not yet found a significant role in the diagnostics of acute rejections (14-16) and
      furthermore how repeated rejections influence on graft function is not well described.

      Study objective, design and methods

      Study 1 Design: A cross sectional study consisting of 50 stabile HTX patients. These will be
      selected with 25 patients with no or light CAV and 25 patients with moderate or severe CAV.
      25 matched controls.

      Methods:

      Severity of CAV will be evaluated by:

        -  CAG supplied with OCT.

        -  CFVR measurement by echocardiography with adenosine induced hyperemia.

        -  CFVR measurement with H215O-PET.

      Graft function will be evaluated by:

        -  2D and 3D echocardiography (including longitudinal deformation and tissue Doppler)

        -  Diastolic (and systolic) stress test: Bicycle exercise with simultaneously
           echocardiography and right heart catheterization.

      Blood samples are taken for analysis of myocardial fibrosis markers, CRP, TNT and NT-proBNP.

      Study 2 Design: A prospective cohort study with 20 newly transplanted patients over a period
      of 12 months.

      Methods: LV and RV function shall be measured by:

        -  2D and 3D echocardiography (including longitudinal deformation, tissue Doppler, CFVR,
           LV and RV EF),

        -  CMRI for LV and RV EF, strain and mass

        -  Right heart catheterization

        -  H215O-PET at baseline and after 3 month in the assessment of RV function

        -  Coronary angiography after 3 and 12 month will be supplied with OCT for early signs of
           CAV development.

      Biopsies are performed according to routine protocol after transplantation. Blood samples
      for analysis of myocardial fibrosis markers, CRP, TNT and NT-proBNP.

      Study 3 Design: Prospective examination of correlation between graft function, CAV and
      rejection. Information of former episodes of acute rejection is collected retrospective.
      Study objectives are all living HTX patients (approx. 200) in the period of 2011-2013.

      Methods: Advanced echocardiography (including longitudinal deformation and tissue Doppler),
      biopsies (rejection evaluation) and CAG (CAV evaluation).

      Feasibility All methods mentioned in the section above have been carefully considered. The
      GRAFT study was initiated at 1st of September 2013. Study 3 has been completed, at we are
      about to submit the first manuscript from this part of the studies. 10/50 patients and 10/25
      controls in study 1 has been examined. 4/20 patients in study 2 are enrolled and examined.

      The PhD student Tor Skibsted Clemmensen has been trained in performing echocardiography (he
      has performed approx. 2000 examinations). MD, PhD, Brian Løgstrup has great experience with
      performing CFVR measurement.

      The department is European center of excellence for OCT with an international leading
      position in clinical and scientific use of OCT.  All needed analysis methods are established
      in the department.

      The department has bought a special couch making it possible to perform echocardiography
      during bicycle exercise and a special probe for 3D echocardiography including program for
      further data analysis. Mobile equipment for haemodynamic measurement by right hearth
      catheterization is available.

      Measurement of CFVR by echocardiography has been performed in many studies with a success
      rate of 90-100% (4,8,10). Adenosine is &quot;drug of choice&quot; to measure coronary flow velocity
      because it is a pure and strong microvascular dilator.

      The PET-center and CMRI-center participate with high priority. The capacity required in
      present studies is available.

      Publication Plan:

      Positive as well as negative result from study 1-3 will be published. We aim at publishing
      study 1-3 in peer review international, scientific journals. Study 3 is expected to be
      published in 2014 and study 1 and 2 in 2016. MD, PhD student Tor Skibsted Clemmensen will
      draft the manuscripts and be 1st author hereof.

      Ethical considerations Adenosine, used for CFVR measurement and PET, often causes mild
      facial flushing, chest discomfort and dyspnoea. After suspended infusion symptoms last less
      than one minute since half time is below 10 seconds.

      Right heart catheterisation is part of the standard protocol after HTX. Only patients in
      study 1 might be subjected to more catheterisations than normally. Complications are rare
      with experienced operators.

      The radiation dose of H215O-PET is 2-2,5 mSv, approximately the same as one year background
      radiation. Patients in study 1 will be subjected to one examination, patients in study 2 two
      examinations.

      No additional CAG are made in the studies. OCT examination is considered very safe with a
      risk of complication &lt;0,5%.

      The investigators are convinced that the possible risks are outweighed by the expected
      benefits from this study and no study-related examinations will be conducted until informed
      consent form has been signed.

      Regional Scientific Ethical Committee of Central Denmark has approve the studies.
