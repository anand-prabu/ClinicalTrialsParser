In order to organize the strategic actions that will be developed for\n      the prevention of MSDs, it is essential to analyze in advance the peculiar situations of the\n      different sectors of a workplace. The objectives of this study were to determine the\n      prevalence of musculoskeletal complaints among workers in a medium-sized industry by\n      comparing its sectors and to investigate the influence of occupational and non-occupational\n      factors in the increase of complaints."
