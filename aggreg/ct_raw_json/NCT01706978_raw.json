            "textblock": "This Clinical Trial is being conducted to study two adjunctive treatments for rotator cuff\n      repair; soft tissue and bone trephination.  \"Trephination\" is a procedure that involves\n      making small perforations either in the torn tendon near its edge, or in the bone that the\n      tendon is repaired to.  The rotator cuff is repaired by sewing the tendon down to the bone\n      in the shoulder. Trephination is a new technique that is used in addition to the standard\n      method of repairing the rotator cuff tendon.\n\n      This study will help to determine whether this technique improves the speed of healing, the\n      strength and the re-tear rate of the repair.   You are being asked to take part in this\n      study because you have a tear of the rotator cuff that requires surgical treatment.  A total\n      of 90 participants will participate in this study."

Major medical illness (life expectancy less then 1 year or unacceptably high\n             operative risk)\n\n         12. Unable to speak or read English/French\n\n         13.
