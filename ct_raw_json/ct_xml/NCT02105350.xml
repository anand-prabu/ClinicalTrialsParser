  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study (an early study to check the safety of a new drug or drug
      combination) to find the safest and most tolerated dose of the combination of oxaliplatin
      with gemcitabine and MEK 162 in patients with biliary cancer (including gallbladder cancers
      and cancers associated with the bile ducts leading from the gallbladder and to and from the
      liver) that is not curable by surgery and/or has spread beyond the biliary tree (place where
      cancer started). Everyone will receive the same standard doses of oxaliplatin and
      gemcitabine but may receive different doses of MEK 162.

      MEK 162 is a new drug which plays an important role in the regulation of cell growth and has
      been shown to shrink tumours in patients with biliary cancer and other types of human
      cancers.  This type of drug has also been shown to shrink tumours when given in combination
      with cisplatin and gemcitabine in research studies done in animals and in some patients with
      biliary cancer.
