PI3K inhibitor\n      BKM120 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell\n      growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways.\n      Some block the ability of cancer to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill\n      them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving PI3K inhibitor BKM120 with rituximab\n      may be an effective treatment for B-cell lymphoma."
