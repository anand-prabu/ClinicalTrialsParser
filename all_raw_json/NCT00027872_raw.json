To determine the complete response rate of R115777 (tipifarnib) in previously untreated\n      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in (a) elderly patients (age >= 75) and (b) patients (age >=\n      65) with AML preceded by myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), using a chronic dosing schedule.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To determine progression-free and overall survival in patients with previously untreated\n      AML treated with R115777, using a chronic dosing schedule.\n\n      II. To determine the duration of response in patients with previously untreated AML treated\n      with R115777, using a chronic dosing schedule.\n\n      III. To determine the effect of R115777 on the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein\n      kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha\n      (PI3K) in leukemic cells.\n\n      IV. To determine the effect of R115777 on processing of the farnesylated protein HDJ-2.\n\n      V. To determine the toxicities of R115777 when given in a chronic dosing schedule.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.\n\n      Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21. Patients with a complete or\n      partial response, hematologic improvement, or stable disease continue treatment every 29-63\n      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with a\n      complete response after the second course of therapy receive 2 additional courses of\n      therapy.\n\n      Patients are followed for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 125 patients will be accrued for this study within 11-17\n      months."
