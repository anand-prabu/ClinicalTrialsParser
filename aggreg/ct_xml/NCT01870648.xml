  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine if the administration of a single dose of oral
      ondansetron (an anti-vomiting medication), compared to placebo, results in a reduction in
      intravenous (IV) rehydration therapy in children presenting for emergency department care
      with some dehydration, vomiting and diarrhea in Pakistan.

      SOME Dehydration is defined as 2 or more of the following signs and symptoms:

        -  Restlessness, irritability

        -  Sunken Eyes

        -  Drinks eagerly, thirsty

        -  Skin pinch goes back slowly

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastroenteritis remains one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in children
      &lt;5 years of age worldwide. A critical factor in the reduction in mortality over the past 30
      years has been the introduction of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) for the treatment of
      dehydration.

      However, its use has stagnated in many low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) where many
      children lack access to alternatives such as intravenous (IV) rehydration. When such
      children have fluid losses that cannot be replaced orally due to intractable vomiting, death
      is common. Finding a safe, non-invasive, and effective strategy to reduce vomiting in
      children would substantially decrease the need for IV rehydration and hence morbidity and
      mortality in LMICs. Although antiemetic agents are included in the WHO list of Essential
      Medicines, their use in children with gastroenteritis is not endorsed by the World Health
      Organization (WHO). Concerns include a lack of evidence that antiemetic agents can improve
      outcomes and that they are associated with dangerous side effects. However, in high-income
      settings, studies on ondansetron, an antiemetic agent, have demonstrated that it can reduce
      vomiting, IV rehydration, and hospitalization. Recent reviews by prominent organizations
      (e.g. International child Health Review Collaboration; the Committee on the Selection and
      Use of Essential Medicines) have indicated an interest in ondansetron use in children with
      gastroenteritis, and they have concluded that further evidence is required. This trial aims
      to determine  if the administration of a single dose of oral ondansetron results in improved
      outcomes in children brought for emergency department care with vomiting and diarrhea in
      Pakistan.

      Two trials will be conducted under the umbrella of one study. The proposed trials will be
      identical with the exception of the severity of dehydration at enrollment (either &quot;some&quot; or
      none &quot;well&quot;).

      This study will have immediate impact on patient management. Based on the results, it will
      be discovered if oral ondansetron plays a role in reducing the need for intravenous
      rehydration in children with gastroenteritis in Pakistan. As ondansetron is now available in
      generic formulations, and is relatively inexpensive, it is anticipated that if this study is
      positive, ondansetron will be considered for inclusion in the WHO - gastroenteritis care
      package. This could ultimately lead to a decrease in the need for intravenous rehydration in
      children in countries such as Pakistan. Moreover, these findings will lead to a subsequent
      study evaluating its potential benefit in outreach communities where treatments such as
      intravenous rehydration are unavailable.

    <description>IV rehydration is defined as the IV administration of ≥20 ml/kg over ≤60 minutes an isotonic fluid for the purpose of rehydration within 72 hours of randomization. This will enable us to exclude children who undergo IV insertion for the purpose of medication administration. IV rehydration is a powerful marker of treatment failure, a decrease in which is likely to impact practice and influence decision makers since it is drastically more expensive that ORT,it is painful and is associated with a greater risk of adverse events.</description>
