For subject safety, the preceding subject must have\n      completed therapy and be 28 days from their last infusion before the next subject can be\n      treated.. Subjects will be treated with IV administration of 1 to 3e8/m2 RNA CAR T cells\n      three times weekly (M-W-F) for three weeks.\n\n      Main eligibility criteria: Subjects with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA)\n      who have chemotherapy-refractory disease. Inclusion criteria include patients older than 18\n      years of age diagnosed with metastatic PDA with ECOG 0-1 performance status and 3 month\n      expected survival. Exclusion criteria include a pericardial effusion, active autoimmune\n      disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy, active anti-coagulation therapy, known HIV or\n      HTLV I/II positivity, prior treatment with murine monoclonal antibodies or history of\n      allergy to murine proteins."

Patients must\n             also have adequate venous access for subsequent modified CAR T cell administration\n             which can be done through a central venous access (e.g. port for systemic\n             chemotherapy)\n\n          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to provide written informed consent.\n\n          -  Short-term therapy for acute conditions not specifically related to pancreatic cancer\n             is allowed if such therapy does not include immune modulating agents.\n\n          -  Male and Female subjects agree to use approved contraceptive methods (e.g. birth\n             control pills, barrier device, intrauterine device, abstinence) during the study and\n             for 3 months following the last dose of the study cell infusion.\n\n          -  Subject must understand and sign the study-specific informed consent.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Participated in any other trial in which receipt of an investigational study drug\n             occurred within 28 days (42 days for non-murine monoclonal antibodies) prior to entry\n             into the study.\n\n          -  Received any anticancer medication in the 2 weeks (i.e. 14 days) prior to receiving\n             their first dose of study treatment and no other concurrent chemotherapy or\n             immunotherapy (e.g. monoclonal antibodies)\n\n          -  Active invasive cancer other than pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Patients with active\n             non-invasive cancers (such as non-melanoma skin cancer, superficial cervical and\n             bladder and prostate cancer with PSA level less than 1.0) are not excluded.\n\n          -  Known HIV, HCV, and HBV positive\n\n          -  Active autoimmune disease (including but not limited to: systemic lupus\n             erythromatosis, Sjogrens syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, multiple\n             sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, etc.) requiring immunosuppressive therapy\n             within the past 4 weeks, with exception of thyroid replacement.\n\n          -  Patients with ongoing or active infection.\n\n          -  Planned concurrent treatment with systemic high dose corticosteroids.\n\n          -  Prior gene therapy or therapy with murine monoclonal antibodies or products of murine\n             origin.\n\n          -  Concurrent treatment with any anticancer agent.\n\n          -  History of allergy to murine proteins\n\n          -  History of allergy or hypersensitivity to study product excipients (human serum\n             albumin, DMSO, and Dextran 40)\n\n          -  Any clinically significant pericardial effusion; CHF (NY Heart Association Grade\n             II-IV) or cardiovascular condition that would preclude assessment of mesothelin\n             induced pericarditis.\n\n          -  Subjects on active anti-coagulation therapy.\n\n          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because autologous transduced T cells may\n             have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an\n             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants, secondary to\n             treatment of the mother with autologous transduced T cells, breastfeeding should be\n             discontinued if the mother is treated.\n\n          -  Feasibility assessment demonstrates less than 20% transfection of target lymphocytes\n             or insufficient expansion of modified CAR T cells to complete 9 infusions."
