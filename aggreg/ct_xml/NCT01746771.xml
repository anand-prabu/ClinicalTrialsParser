      [Phase I] The main objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      determine the Recommended Dose (RD) of HM781-36B(Poziotinib)combined with Paclitaxel and
      Trastuzumab

      [Phase II] The main objective of this study is to evaluate anticancer activity through
      determination of response rate of HM781-36B(Poziotinib)combined with Paclitaxel and
      Trastuzumab in patients with HER-2 positive advanced gastric cancer

      Besides the main objectives, there are other objectives as follows:

      [Phase I]

        1. To assess the pharmacokinetic profile of HM781-36B(Poziotinib) combined with Paclitaxel
           and Trastuzumab

        2. To evaluate anticancer activity of HM781-36B(Poziotinib) combined with Paclitaxel and
           Trastuzumab in patients with HER-2 positive advanced gastric cancer

        3. To evaluate PFS(Progression-Free Survival), TTP (Time To Tumor Progression), and DOR
           (Duration of Overall Response)

      [Phase II]

        1. To assess the safety, tolerability of HM781-36B(Poziotinib) combined with Paclitaxel
           and Trastuzumab

        2. To evaluate tumor response through determination of disease control rate ,
           PFS(Progression-Free Survival), TTP (Time To Tumor Progression), and DOR (Duration of
           Overall Response)
