  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although diabetes has been controlled since insulin became available, it is still considered
      incurable and poses serious threats to human health. Reports have suggested that the
      hyperglycemic condition of patients with diabetes mellitus may be greatly alleviated or even
      reversed if it could be controlled at an early stage of diabetes. Thus, early detection and
      diagnosis of diabetes and prediabetes are become increasingly important in the treatment and
      prevention of diabetes. Diabetes mellitus is currently diagnosed by recurrent or persistent
      hyperglycemia. In an effort to identify novel biomarkers for diabetes, research has shown
      that neither plasma glucose nor glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels are unable to be used in
      the early detection of diabetes. In this work, the investigators have found 8 biomarker
      candidates by developing a standard-free, label-free MS-based proteomics method based on
      standard protein (human serum albumin, the highest abundance protein in human plasma) model
      in vitro. Then, the investigators wanted to verify these biomarker candidates by clinical
      plasma samples to see if there is significant quantitative difference between normal people
      and diabetes patients.

      The procedure of clinical study was:

        1. to get plasma samples from hospital;

        2. digestion of plasma protein-mixture by trypsin;

        3. run mass spectrometry and monitor the amount of target HSA-peptides.
