The disease caused by high\n      intra ocular pressure (IOP) and characterized by damage to the optic nerve and gradual loss\n      of visual field. Intra ocular pressure change during the day. To evaluate the efficiency of\n      the therapy it is common to measure the intra ocular pressure at different times of the day.\n      Most ophthalmologists admit the patient for one day at which intra ocular pressure is\n      measured at different times. This method does not mimic the patient daily routine and may\n      not reflect the true diurnal fluctuations.\n\n      For this reason some ophthalmologists measure the intra ocular pressure at different times\n      and at different days. It is not known if both methods give similar diurnal curves."

Each\n      patient will undergo intraocular pressure examination at 8:00, 12:00 and 16:00.\n\n      In the first day intra ocular pressure will be measured at 8:00, 12:00 and 16:00, same day\n      measurements. The day after intra ocular pressure will be measured at 8:00, two days after\n      at 12:00 and three days after at 16:00. One month later the patient will undergo another\n      serious of intra ocular pressure measurements.\n\n      In the first day intra ocular pressure will be measured at 8:00, 12:00 and 16:00, same day\n      measurements. The day after intra ocular pressure will be measured at 8:00, two days after\n      at 12:00 and three days after at 16:00.\n\n      The relationship between the two diurnal curves will be analyzed."
