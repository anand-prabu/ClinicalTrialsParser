Differentially expressed\n      genes are evaluated for protein expression by standard immunohistochemistry and/or Western\n      blot analysis, and gene expression is further quantified by semi-quantitative polymerase\n      chain reaction.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 80-100 patients (20-25 with metastatic disease and 60-75\n      with non-metastatic disease) will be accrued for this study within 4-5 years."
