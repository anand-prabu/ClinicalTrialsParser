The proposed study\n      may provide useful information about optimal models for integrating behavioral and\n      pharmacological therapies for the clinical management of insomnia.\n\n      Participants are randomly assigned to CBT or CBT plus medication.  After the 6-week acute\n      treatment phase, participants enter into a 6-month extended treatment phase. Of those\n      treated with CBT alone initially, responders are randomized to extended CBT or no treatment.\n       Of those receiving the combined CBT plus medication approach initially, responders are\n      randomized to an extended treatment consisting of either CBT plus medication (used on an as\n      needed schedule) or CBT alone (plus medication tapering). Outcome is evaluated across\n      measures of sleep, clinical ratings, and several indices of daytime functioning.  The\n      measures are administered at baseline, at the end of the acute and extended treatment\n      phases, and at 6, 12, and 24-month follow-up."
