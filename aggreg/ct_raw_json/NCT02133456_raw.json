Some 160 thousands doses have\n      been sold to subjects aged 3 years and older in this area. We review and summarize\n      spontaneously reported adverse events from safety surveillance.\n\n      Adverse events were collected through the Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI)\n      Surveillance System. Beijing CDC and local prefectural CDC must organize an expert panel to\n      investigate adverse events and assess causality, using criteria based on Chinese Standard\n      Procedures for Vaccination. The panels consist of physicians, epidemiologists, pharmacists,\n      and other relevant experts. In general, expert panels investigate deaths, life-threatening\n      illnesses, and permanent disabilities, and immunization-program managers or vaccination\n      providers investigate common, minor adverse events. Adverse events are classified into one\n      of five categories: vaccine reactions (common and minor to rare and more serious), program\n      errors, coincidental illnesses, psychogenic reactions, and unclassifiable events.\n\n      At the time of vaccination, vaccinees were instructed to report any adverse event to\n      physicians or vaccination providers. The following adverse events were required to be\n      reported: adverse events that were fatal or that resulted in disability and clusters of\n      events (i.e., notably high numbers of similar adverse events related to a certain vaccine) ;\n      anaphylaxis or other allergic reactions occurring within 24 hours after vaccination; fever\n      (axillary temperature, >37.5\u00b0C), angioedema, or a local injection-site reaction (diameter,\n      >2.5 cm) occurring within 5 days after vaccination; purpura, an Arthus reaction, febrile\n      convulsion, seizure, or polyneuritis occurring within 15 days after vaccination; and the\n      Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome occurring within 3 months after vaccination. Other reactions that\n      were common and minor (e.g., mild pain and fatigue) were not required to be reported."
