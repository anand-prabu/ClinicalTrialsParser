Oblimersen may increase the effectiveness of dexamethasone by\n      making cancer cells more sensitive to the drug. It is not yet known if dexamethasone is more\n      effective with or without oblimersen in treating multiple myeloma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of dexamethasone with or\n      without oblimersen in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma."

Patients are stratified\n      according to response to prior therapy (relapsed vs refractory), prior autologous stem cell\n      transplantation (yes vs no), and number of prior therapy regimens (1-2 vs 3-6). Patients are\n      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      Arm I\n\n        -  Induction: Patients receive oblimersen (G3139) IV continuously on days 1-7 and 15-21\n           and oral dexamethasone daily on days 4-7, 11-14, and 18-21.\n\n        -  Maintenance: One week after completion of induction therapy, patients with stable or\n           responsive disease receive G3139 IV continuously on days 1-7 and oral dexamethasone\n           daily on days 4-7. Courses repeat every 3 weeks for a maximum of 1 year in the absence\n           of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Arm II\n\n        -  Induction: Patients receive oral dexamethasone daily for 4 days on weeks 1-3.\n\n        -  Maintenance: One week after completion of induction therapy, patients with stable or\n           responsive disease receive oral dexamethasone daily for 4 days. Courses repeat every 3\n           weeks for a maximum of 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n           toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients (100 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
