The secondary aim is to explore\n      potential ultrasound parameters which could be used as surrogate markers for pulmonary\n      function in the management of children with acute asthma.\n\n      Hypothesis:  Ultrasound measurements of internal jugular vein collapse of children can be\n      reliably measured.  Children experiencing an asthma exacerbation will have significantly\n      different measurements than of the same age who are healthy.  In addition, ultrasound\n      measurements of the lung and vasculature will correlate with pulmonary function testing and\n      asthma clinical scoring.\n\n      Intervention:  For patients in the normal respiratory physiology (NRP) group, medications\n      and past medical history will be recorded, along with documentation that the patient has not\n      had any recent respiratory symptoms or fever.   For the acute asthmatics (AA) group, history\n      of present illness, underlying asthma severity, asthma-related treatment including\n      admission/discharge from ED, medications, and past medical history will be recorded.\n\n      Spirometry readings will be collected on all patients.  In addition, a clinical asthma score\n      will be assigned using the Modified Woods pulmonary index scoring system.\n\n      Using bedside ultrasonography with the Sonosite Titan ultrasound machine, each measurement\n      will be taken with the subject lying in bed with the head of the bed elevated at 45 degrees\n      with the subject's head in the neutral position.  Initially, measurements of the internal\n      jugular vein at maximal inhalation and exhalation will be recorded, and the difference\n      between the two will be calculated."

The 40 subjects enrolled into the acute exacerbation group will\n        have a previous physician diagnosis of asthma per parent report and an acute asthma\n        exacerbation requiring corticosteroids per ED attending physician or fellow.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        Children in the normal respiratory function group will be excluded from participation if\n        they have: a baseline chronic lung disorder (including asthma), current respiratory\n        illness, fever, Emergency Services Index (ESI) triage category of less than or equal to 3\n        (high acuity), chronic cough, dyspnea with exercise, wheezing, or a history of smoking by\n        self and/or parent report.\n\n        Children in the acute exacerbation group will be excluded from enrollment if they have a\n        history of baseline chronic lung disease, not including asthma.  In addition, a\n        co-existing acute pulmonary process (e.g. lobar pneumonia), and impending respiratory\n        failure will exclude from participation.  Those who are unable to perform spirometry\n        measurements per spirometry measuring protocol (see Appendix: Figure 1) will be excluded\n        from participation.\n\n        Subjects will be excluded from either of the groups if they had prior cardiac/pulmonary\n        disease or surgeries (other than asthma for the acute exacerbation group), significant\n        musculoskeletal abnormalities (such as scoliosis) that might compromise baseline pulmonary\n        function testing, a history of smoking tobacco or marijuana, and prematurity (birth at\n        less than 37 weeks gestation.  In addition, those with an allergy to ultrasound gel will\n        be excluded from participation."
