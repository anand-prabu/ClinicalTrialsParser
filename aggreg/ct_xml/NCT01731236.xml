      The principal goal for the study is to examine the role gut flora plays in modulating
      metabolism of dietary carnitine in humans. We hypothesize that levels of carnitine and its
      metabolites, trimethylamine (TMA), trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), and other gut flora, can
      be detected in human plasma and urine, and changes in response to dietary intake of red
      meats (Koeth et al, 2010, unpublished data). We also hypothesize that metabolism of
      carnitine may differ between men and women, and between those with low versus high
      cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease) and metabolic
      syndrome (insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, obesity, hypertension). We further hypothesize
      that specific metabolites of carnitine are produced in a fashion dependent upon the action
      of intestinal microflora (gut flora), and can be reduced by transient suppression or
      modulation of gut flora via short-term broad spectrum antibiotic therapy, or by
      reconstitution of microflora composition via probiotic therapy, in healthy subjects.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to establish the methodology and pursue further
      understanding of the human metabolism of dietary carnitine and factors that may influence
      carnitine metabolism in humans. Findings of these pilot observations are important in
      providing proof-of-concept, and in determining the best ways to identify these potentially
      vulnerable subjects for future intervention studies.

      This is a prospective, randomized, 3-Arm study of 4-week duration per subject.
