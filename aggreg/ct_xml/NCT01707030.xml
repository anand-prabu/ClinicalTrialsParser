  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many people who are infected with Hepatitis C misuse alcohol, which is even more dangerous
      for them than it is for a non-infected person.  In this VA study, such individuals will be
      screened and given feedback on their drinking using an Internet-based program which has been
      shown to reduce drinking in other populations.  The research team will evaluate whether the
      program helps veterans drink less over time and thereby improve their health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As many as 80% of Veterans with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) engage in harmful drinking. This
      is a major health challenge given that even light and moderate alcohol consumption can
      worsen the course and consequences of HCV and can be a barrier to receiving antiviral
      therapy. In response, the VA Uniform Mental Health Services Package has made it a priority
      that HCV and other ambulatory clinics provide evidence-based mental health services to all
      Veterans engaging in harmful drinking within two week (but preferably the same day as the
      clinic visit). Our CREATE partners, the VA Office of Mental Health Services, VA Operations
      (10N), and the VA Office of Public Health, are strongly committed to achieving this standard
      throughout the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). However, the cost and organizational
      challenges to meeting this mandate in HCV clinics are enormous, but may be surmountable
      through the use of self-directed technology that minimizes demands on scarce staff time.

      The primary objective of this study is to implement and evaluate a web-based brief alcohol
      intervention (BAI) for treating Veterans with HCV and seeking care at two VA HCV clinics -
      Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System (VAPAHCS) and San Francisco Veterans Affairs
      Medical Center (SFVAMC). This study will have three aims: First (Aim 1), we plan to assess
      patient, provider, and system factors that may impact the initial adoption of this
      intervention in two VA HCV clinics. These data will result in the development of a protocol
      for the initial implementation of the web-based BAI at our two study sites. A secondary aim
      will involve obtaining patient and provider feedback on an existing web-based BAI (see
      www.bmi-aft.org, VA Intranet Only) to help inform its redesign for use with this population.
      Second (Aim 2), we will implement and examine the effectiveness of a web-based BAI in two
      HCV clinics to reduce alcohol consumption in Veterans with HCV at three- and six-months
      post-treatment. Third (Aim 3), we will conduct a budget impact analysis to estimate the
      short-term costs (1-3 years) of adoption and diffusion of the web-based BAI and the
      trajectory of health care spending for study participants.

      This mixed-methods study will utilize qualitative and quantitative methods to achieve its
      three primary aims. To address aim 1, qualitative interviews will be used to collect data
      that will inform the initial implementation and re-versioning of a web-based BAI for use in
      two HCV clinics located at the Palo Alto and San Francisco. To address aim 2, we will use a
      randomized, hybrid (type 1) design with patient level clinical outcome data and formative
      evaluation data collected to examine the effectiveness of the web-based BAI.

      &quot;Hybrid&quot; designs also integrate formative evaluation into experimental designs to identify
      factors that impact the effectiveness of implementation efforts. Formative evaluation (e.g.,
      site visits, clinic observation, and interviews with staff and patients) will be used to
      improve the adoption of the web-based BAI at both sites and to provide evidence-based
      guidance to our CREATE operational partners for nationwide implementation. To address aim 3,
      we will conduct a budget impact analysis to estimate the short-term costs (1-3 years) of
      adoption and diffusion of the web-based BAI and the trajectory of health care spending for
      study participants. We plan to collect several types of utilization data, including
      outpatient, inpatient, and pharmacy utilization, and calculate total dollars
