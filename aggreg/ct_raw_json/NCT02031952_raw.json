While many patients suffered the recurrence without the\n      evidence of portal or hepatic vascular invasion or multiple loci, it lead to reconsider the\n      value of preventive resection of regional lymph node for those patients. Recently, more and\n      more studies had found the incidence of lymph node metastasis was higher in autopsy specimen\n      than those in operable patients.\n\n      This project is a prospective randomized controlled trial, planning to compare hepatectomy\n      with hepatectomy combined lymphadenectomy regarding of the safety and efficacy in HCC\n      patients, to reach a further understanding of the role of lymphadenectomy."
