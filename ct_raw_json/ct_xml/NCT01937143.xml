  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunization injections are the most common recurring painful medical procedure undertaken
      in childhood. Numerous evidence-based and feasible interventions are available to mitigate
      immunization pain, however, there is low uptake of these interventions in clinical practice,
      revealing a knowledge-to-care gap between what is known about pain and pain management. This
      is a 4-year single-centre, randomized, parallel 3-group add-on trial that will enrol 3042
      mothers hospitalized following the birth of an infant at Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) in
      Toronto. The trial will evaluate and compare the impact of two levels of intensity of
      maternal education about pain management during infant immunizations ('low': pamphlet vs.
      'high': pamphlet + video) compared to placebo control after the birth of an infant on
      maternal behaviour during future infant immunizations at up to 6 months of age (i.e., use of
      analgesic interventions), maternal knowledge and attitudes about pain and pain management up
      to 6 months after birth. In addition, this trial will compare a pamphlet given to the low
      and high intensity groups after 12 months compared to placebo control on maternal behaviour
      during future infant immunizations at up to 18 months of age, maternal knowledge, attitudes
      about pain and pain management, immunization compliance and incidence of needle fear in
      children.
