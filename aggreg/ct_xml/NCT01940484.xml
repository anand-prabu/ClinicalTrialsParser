  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study will evaluate the efficacy and use of Mircera (methoxy polyethylene
      glycol-epoetin beta) in patients with Stage V chronic kidney disease on haemodialysis
      receiving an erythropoietin prior to study entry. Attending physicians should have made the
      decision of placing the patient on Mircera in advance and not related to the study. The
      therapy will be administered by the attendant treating physician according to specifications
      in the package insert guidelines and to the routine of the site. Eligible patients will be
      followed for 6 months.
