One of the effects of the drug lenalidomide is to\n      alter the immune system and thereby increase immune response. It also has some effect\n      against cancer cells; therefore, in theory, it may reduce or prevent the growth of cancer\n      cells.\n\n      In this study, one-half of the subjects will be chosen at random to receive the study drug\n      and the other half will take a placebo pill (a sugar pill that looks the same as the real\n      medication).  This is a double blind study where neither the subjects nor the investigators\n      know whether the patient receives the study drugs or placebo pills. The effects of the\n      active drug lenalidomide will be compared to the effects of the placebo. The results from\n      this study will be also be compared with a similar but separate study to be done on\n      individuals without known disease.\n\n      This study expects to enroll 64 subjects and will be carried out at the Boston VA Healthcare\n      System and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute."
