Stable and responding patients receive a second\n      course beginning approximately 2 months after initiation of the first course. Responding\n      patients may continue therapy every 2 months provided toxicity is limited.\n\n      Patients whose diseased kidney comprises the bulk of the tumor burden at entry undergo\n      nephrectomy.\n\n      Patients are followed for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14 patients will be accrued for this study."
