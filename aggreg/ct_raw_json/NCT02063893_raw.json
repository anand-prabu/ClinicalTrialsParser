In this study, the investigators examined the vaccination effects produced\n      by CSC-enriched populations from histologically distinctmurine tumors after their\n      inoculation into different syngeneic immunocompetent hosts. Enriched CSCs were immunogenic\n      and more effective as an antigen source than unselected tumor cells in inducing protective\n      antitumor immunity.Immune sera from CSC-vaccinated hosts contained high levels of IgG which\n      bound to CSCs, resulting in CSC lysis in the presence of complement.CTLs generated from\n      peripheral blood mononuclear cells or splenocytes harvested from CSC-vaccinated hosts were\n      capable of killing CSCs in vitro. Mechanistic investigations established that CSC-primed\n      antibodies and T cells were capable of selective targeting CSCs and conferring antitumor\n      immunity."
