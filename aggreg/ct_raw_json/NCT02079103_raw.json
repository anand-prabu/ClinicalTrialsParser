High intensity training of challenging tasks with many repetitions are\n      key factors for regaining motor function after stroke. Novel virtual reality (VR)\n      rehabilitation systems provide the potential to increase intensity and offer challenging and\n      motivating tasks. The efficacy of VR systems has not been demonstrated yet in sufficiently\n      powered studies.\n\n      Methods: In this study 120 patients in 5 participating Norwegian, Danish and Belgian\n      rehabilitation institutions will be randomized to either a group receiving VR training in\n      addition to conventional arm training or a group receiving dose-matched and therapist\n      attention-matched conventional arm-training. During a period of 4 weeks the patients will be\n      offered additional 4-5 training sessions weekly of 45-60 minutes duration by a\n      physiotherapist or an occupational therapist. Arm motor function, dexterity and independence\n      in daily life activities will be evaluated at baseline, post and 3 months follow-up\n      assessments with the Action Research Arm Test, Box and Blocks Test and the Functional\n      Independence Measure. Patient satisfaction and therapist satisfaction with the\n      implementation of a new technology based rehabilitation system will also be assessed with\n      questionnaires and interviews.\n\n      Objective: The objective of the VIRTUES trial is to study the effectiveness and acceptance\n      of a novel VR training approach. The study will provide evidence-based knowledge of new\n      virtual reality based treatment strategies to clinicians, patients and health economists."
