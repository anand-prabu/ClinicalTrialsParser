Baseline and one year follow-up surveys\n      will be obtained by in person home interview. Participants are randomized within clinic to\n      intervention or comparison group. The intervention consist of two motivational interviewing\n      sessions, one in person in the home, and one telephone follow-up. The study hypothesis is\n      that a higher proportion of participants in the motivational interviewing arm will obtain a\n      screening mammogram within the study period than those in the comparison arm."

The overall purpose of the study is to develop and evaluate a\n      culturally-appropriate intervention aimed at increasing screening mammography rates in a\n      clinic-based sample of predominantly Mexican American women in Western Washington.\n\n      The recruitment goal of the Fortaleza Latina study is approximately 500 Latina women aged\n      40-74 who have had a clinic visit within the past 5 years, but no recent mammogram, from the\n      four selected Community Health Center clinics.  After providing informed consent and\n      completing a baseline assessment, eligible women are randomly assigned to intervention or\n      comparison group, within clinic. The  individual-level intervention implements motivational\n      interviewing (MI) in two participant encounters. MI is a direct counseling style, led by a\n      promotora (lay health advisor), that elicits behavior change by helping participants explore\n      and resolve ambivalence.\n\n      Of the 2194 women contacted by field interviewers, a total of 710 surveys have been\n      completed; of these, 542 were eligible and have been randomized and enrolled into the\n      Fortaleza Latina study (279 intervention, 263 usual care)."
