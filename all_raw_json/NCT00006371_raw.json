II. Compare the\n      incidence of grades 3-4 toxicities of these regimens in these patients. III.

Patients\n      undergo medical adrenalectomy using hydrocortisone combined with aminoglutethimide OR\n      ketoconazole. Oral hydrocortisone is administered twice daily. Oral aminoglutethimide is\n      administered twice daily for 1 week and then 4 times daily during subsequent weeks. Oral\n      ketoconazole is administered three times daily.
