    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of blisibimod as measured by
      a composite responder index in subjects who, despite corticosteroid use, continue to have
      autoantibody positive, clinically-active Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) as defined by
      SELENA SLEDAI score ≥10.
