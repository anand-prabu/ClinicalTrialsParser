Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly\n      to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying two different methods of radiation and\n      their side effects and comparing how well they work in treating endometrial and cervical\n      cancer after surgery."

Patients are stratified according to type of cancer\n      (endometrial vs cervical), chemotherapy (none vs 5 courses of weekly cisplatin at 40 mg/m\u00b2),\n      and radiation dose (45 Gy vs 50.4 Gy). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo standard (3-dimensional) radiation therapy 5 days a week for up\n           to 5-6 weeks.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) 5 days a week for\n           up to 5-6 weeks.\n\n      Some patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment continues weekly for 5\n      weeks, concurrently with radiation therapy, in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or\n      disease progression.\n\n      Tissue and blood samples may be collected for biomarker and correlative analysis.\n\n      Quality of life may be assessed by questionnaires (including the Expanded Prostate Cancer\n      Index Composite [EPIC], the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General [FACT-G, Version\n      4], the EQ-5D, and the Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events - Patient-Reported Outcome\n      [PRO-CTCAE]) instruments at baseline and periodically during and after study therapy.\n\n      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 6 months for the first 2\n      years and then annually for 5 years."
