Patients are admitted two times for overnight\n      assessment.\n\n      Admission 1:  Patients receive cosyntropin IV.  Blood is drawn at 30 and 60 minutes after IV\n      infusion. Patients receive oral metyrapone before sleep.  A sham sleep study is conducted\n      through the night and patients' blood is drawn in the morning.\n\n      Admission 2:  At least 2 weeks after admission 1, patients return for an overnight\n      admission.  Starting in the evening, blood is drawn every 15 minutes for 12 hours.  A sleep\n      study is conducted through the night."
