The investigators hypothesize that mothers will\n      show higher levels of infant-directed feeding practices and lower levels of mother-directed\n      feeding practices when using opaque, weighted bottles compared to when using standard, clear\n      bottles. The investigators also hypothesize that infants will consume less breast milk or\n      formula when fed from opaque, weighted bottles compared to when fed from standard, clear\n      bottles."
