            "textblock": "This groupwide pilot study examines the toxicity profile of the Busulfan-Melphalan (BuMel)\n      myeloablative preparative regimen in children and young adults with newly diagnosed\n      high-risk neuroblastoma. The primary objective of the proposed study will be to examine the\n      toxicity profile of this regimen in the context of COG therapy, with specific focus on the\n      incidence and severity of pulmonary and hepatic toxicity. The Induction regimen will be 5\n      cycles of Induction. Consolidation therapy will consist of 4 doses of busulfan IV given once\n      daily followed by a single dose of melphalan with a rest day prior to and following the\n      melphalan dose. After recovery from Consolidation radiation therapy, patients will be\n      encouraged to participate in clinical trials of ch14.18 immunotherapy (ie, ANBL0032 or\n      other).\n\n      Additional examinations will include pharmacokinetic measurements of busulfan and melphalan\n      that will be collected and correlated with toxicity and survival. We will examine the\n      ability to perform Curie scoring in real time, within 21 days of scan acquisition. This will\n      be the first prospective use of Curie scoring in a cooperative group setting. This study\n      will examine our ability to perform ALK gene testing prospectively, within 4 to 6 weeks of\n      sample acquisition, by a centralized lab. Aberrations of the ALK gene in neuroblastoma\n      tumors have been reported by multiple investigators, with potential therapeutic\n      implications. Potential targeted inhibitors of ALK aberrations are now available, and may\n      impact future clinical trial designs. In addition, molecular profiling of MYCN non-amplified\n      tumors with a 14-gene signature panel will be performed. This study will test our ability to\n      obtain tumor samples prospectively and identify molecular profiles within 6-8 weeks of\n      sample acquisition which may also impact future clinical trial design."
