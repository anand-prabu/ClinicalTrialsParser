  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) has recently been introduced as promising alternative to
      laparoscopic Heller myotomy for patients with idiopathic achalasia. Several technical
      modifications have been proposed but have not yet been tested in randomized trials.

      Objective: To evaluate efficacy and safety of water-jet assisted POEM (WJ) versus the
      conventional technique (C).

      Interventions: Patients with achalasia diagnosed by symptoms, endoscopy and barium swallow
      eligible for POEM were randomized to either the use of  Erbe Hybrid knife (WJ group)  or the
      conventional technique using injection and triangle tip knife interchangeably (C group).

      Main outcome measurements: Procedure time in both groups; secondary outcomes were clinical
      efficacy and safety (bleeding complications, pneumothorax or pleural effusion requiring
      intervention)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  With an Eckardt symptom score ≥ 4

          -  The diagnosis of achalasia was made on the basis of the absence of peristalsis and on
             impaired relaxation of the LES on established methods (barium swallow, manometry,
             esophagogastroduodenoscopy)

          -  Informed patient consent was obtained

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe cardiopulmonary disease or other serious disease leading to unacceptable
             surgical risk

          -  Pseudoachalasia

          -  Megaesophagus (diameter of &gt; 7 cm)
