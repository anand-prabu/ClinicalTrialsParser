  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the capacity of a 6-week treatment with
      neuromuscular electrical stimulation to improve walking in individuals whose mobility has
      been compromised by multiple sclerosis.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two study arms.  Those in one arm will
      receive a treatment with narrow stimulus pulses (0.4 ms) and those in the other arm will
      receive wide stimulus pulses (1 ms).  The electrical stimulation will be delivered with a
      Vectra Genisys System.
