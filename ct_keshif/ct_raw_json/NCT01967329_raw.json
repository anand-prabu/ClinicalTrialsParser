This research program uses a\n      community-driven, participatory approach to investigate H. pylori infection in northern\n      Aboriginal communities, with goals of characterizing the associated burden of disease and\n      exchanging knowledge with community members and decision makers to identify effective\n      solutions for reducing associated health risks. The treatment component involves a series of\n      community-specific trials designed with community input and varying on the specific\n      treatment regimens and number of treatment arms among other study details. For the\n      participating communities, these treatment trials aim to:\n\n        1. Estimate the effectiveness of alternate H. pylori treatment regimens to identify\n           optimal regimens for the local setting\n\n        2. Identify factors external to the treatment regimen that influence short- and long-term\n           treatment success"
