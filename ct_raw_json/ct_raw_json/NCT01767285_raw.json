There will be 60 subjects total, randomized in a 1:1 ratio,\n      for 30 in each group. All participants will follow-up at the same postpartum clinic 6 weeks\n      after delivery. They will then be contacted at 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum and asked to\n      complete a brief survey. The investigators hypothesize that continuation rates of Implanon\n      will be higher in the immediate postpartum placement arm than in the delayed placement arm."
