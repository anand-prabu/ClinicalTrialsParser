Left untreated it may lead to deep coma.  The cause is not\n      fully understood but is though to be related to the inability of a damaged liver to filter\n      out toxins such as ammonia in the blood, which then accumulate within the brain and result\n      in altered function and swelling within certain brain cells,astrocytes. These patients also\n      suffer from muscle loss, which is associated with a poor outcome. L-ornithine\n      L-aspartate(LOLA) is a licensed drug in Germany and has been shown to promote ammonia\n      elimination from the body in the form of urea. Some experimental studies have suggested that\n      LOLA also potentially attenuates muscle loss by incorporating ammonia into muscle in the\n      form of glutamine.  The aim of this study is to determine cognitive and nutritional effects\n      of 12 weeks of LOLA administration and its effect on brain muscle structure and function in\n      patients with cirrhosis."
