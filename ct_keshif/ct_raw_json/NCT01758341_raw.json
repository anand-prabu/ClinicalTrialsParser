RFA procedures\n      performed in Austria so far will be analyzed with regard to feasibility and safety of the\n      technique. Therefore, the following parameters will be assessed: (among others) technical\n      failures during the RFA procedure, complications during the RFA procedure, hospital stay,\n      adverse events during hospital stay and until first clinical control after discharge (an\n      expected average of 4 weeks after RFA procedure), 30-day and 90-day mortality. The results\n      of this study should help to better understand important aspects of biliary RFA which may\n      positively influence future applications of this method."

            "textblock": "Introduction\n\n      Biliary obstruction is the most relevant life limiting factor in patients suffering from\n      primary or secondary bile duct malignancies. Underlying tumors, such as extrahepatic\n      cholangiocarcinoma (CCa) of Klatskin type, pancreatic adenocarcinoma or metastases of\n      colorectal cancer, are often diagnosed at an advanced stage when presenting with biliary\n      obstruction. This mostly restricts treatment strategies to palliative management. Within\n      this setting the prevention of biliary complications like jaundice, cholangitis or\n      cholangiosepsis is one of the therapeutic key factors to extend survival and maintain\n      quality of life [De Groen, Skipworth]. Endoscopic stenting of the biliary tract is an easy\n      and safe approach to restore biliary drainage [Smith]. Self-expanding metal stents are\n      preferred to plastic stents because of the lower risk of stent occlusion [Kaassis,\n      Soderlund]. In addition to stenting endoscopic therapies that directly affect the local\n      tumor mass, have been developed within the past years. First of all, photodynamic therapy\n      using different photosensitizers has shown promising results for the reduction of tumor size\n      and maintenance of biliary drainage [Ortner, Zoepf]. However, the patient management for\n      this treatment involving peri-interventional photosensitivity remains cumbersome.\n\n      Recently, an endoscopically applicable radiofrequency catheter for the biliary tract, the so\n      called HabibTM EndoHBP catheter, was introduced into the market. It uses bipolar electrical\n      energy for tissue coagulation and can be applied without any special patient preparation in\n      the context of an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) examination. RFA is\n      well known from transcutaneous applications, where it already proved to be effective as a\n      treatment option for hepatocellular carcinoma or intrahepatic CCa [Minami]. The new HabibTM\n      EndoHBP catheter was already evaluated ex vivo [Itoi] and showed promising results\n      concerning safety and prevention of stent occlusion in the context of one small\n      retrospective clinical study [Steel].\n\n      Primary objective\n\n      Feasibility and safety of endoscopic radiofrequency ablation with the HabibTM EndoHBP\n      catheter for the treatment of malignant biliary obstruction\n\n      Study Design\n\n      Retrospective analysis of prospectively gained clinical data\n\n      Primary endpoint\n\n      Technical failures during the RFA procedure\n\n      Secondary endpoints\n\n        1.
