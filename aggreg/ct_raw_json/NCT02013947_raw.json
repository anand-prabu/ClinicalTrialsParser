There are several definitions for the\n      metabolic syndrome. The AHA/NHLBI (American Heart association/National Heart Lung Blood\n      Institution)and IDF (International Diabetes Federation)2009 criteria are frequently used to\n      comparing data from studies. Prevention or reduction of obesity and lifestyle modification\n      with physical activity is the main therapeutic goal in patients with metabolic syndrome.\n      Recent studies have shown that exercise in moderate altitude or in moderate hypoxia improved\n      glycemic parameters. The influence of training in moderate altitude on circulating\n      metabolites and hormones in terms of substrate utilization is unclear. The adiponectin seems\n      to play an important role in the homeostasis of adipose tissue and in the pathogenesis of\n      the metabolic syndrome and physical activity seems to have a positive effect on adiponectin\n      concentrations. In this study with randomized controlled pretest-posttest-design we want to\n      investigate the effects of physical activity in moderate hypoxia on biomarkers of metabolic\n      syndrome."
