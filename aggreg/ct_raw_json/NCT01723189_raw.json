The tests will be performed in the supine position\n      and then repeated in a sitting position. Data from such monitoring will be used for analysis\n      of the harmonic components of the cardiac rate (RR interval) and the variability of blood\n      pressure and respiratory rate, through the method of auto regressive analysis.\n\n      For the study of central chemoreceptors, investigator will use the steady-state hypercapnic\n      test, which measures the ventilatory response to hypercapnia at a constant level of Oxygen\n      partial pressure (PaO2). The ventilatory response to hypercapnia is calculated by the method\n      of linear regression and is represented by the angular coefficient of the straight line that\n      describes the variation of ventilation for each variation of alveolar carbon dioxide partial\n      pressure (PCO2).\n\n      For the study of peripheral chemoreceptors will be used the single-breath or transient\n      hypercapnia test. The patient makes a single deep breath of a gas mixture containing 85% O2\n      and 15% CO2 and then resume normal breathing. It is expected, therefore, a period of 3\n      seconds, required because the gases contained in the mixture may come from the pulmonary\n      circulation to the peripheral circulation, at the level of peripheral chemoreceptors. The\n      ventilation is recorded within the next 20-30 seconds, because in this time interval is\n      evaluated only the sensitivity of the peripheral chemoreceptors, being the latency of\n      response of the central chemoreceptors greater than 1 minute."
