    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies how well optical coherence tomography works in staging patients
      with upper-tract urothelial carcinomas. Staging describes the severity of a person's cancer
      based on the size and/or extent (reach) of the original (primary) tumor and whether or not
      cancer has spread in the body. It also helps the doctor plan the appropriate treatment.
      Optical coherence tomography is a procedure that uses infrared light waves to give
      three-dimensional pictures of structures inside tissues and organs. The pictures are made by
      a computer linked to the light source. Optical coherence tomography may be effective in
      staging patients with upper-tract urothelial carcinomas.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the feasibility and imaging ability of optical coherence tomography (OCT) to
      stage upper-tract urothelial carcinomas (UTUC).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo optical coherence tomography over 10-15 minutes.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3 months.
