Millions of plastic and reconstructive surgeries are performed\n      annually to repair soft tissue defects due to trauma, tumor resection and congenital\n      defects. Surgical options for lipoatrophy, the lipodystrophy type characterized by\n      subcutaneous adipose tissue atrophy, include: Transfer of autologous fat, Dermis - fat\n      graft, Skin flaps and Commercially available fillers.\n\n      Currently, the most commonly filler agent used for the lipodystrophy treatment is\n      polymethylmethacrylate, considered permanent and with a history of short- and medium-term\n      adverse effects. Biocompatible and temporary filler agents such as hyaluronic acid,\n      polylactic acid and collagen have been used for over 25 years for cosmetic purposes and in\n      lipoatrophies. More recently, the use of autologous fibroblasts proved to be efficient\n      solving acne scars and enabling dermis regeneration. Studies in mice showed that the\n      combination of pre - adipocytes with a biomaterial is much more effective in tissue\n      reconstitution than the injection of adipose tissue only, providing volume and also\n      stimulating cell proliferation and differentiation with increased production of\n      extracellular matrix.\n\n      This project aims a phase I clinical trial of a filler agent, composed of mesenchymal stem\n      cells derived from autologous adipose tissue associated with hyaluronic acid."
