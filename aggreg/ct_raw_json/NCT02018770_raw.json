It will be  made a  randomized, placebo-controlled and\n      double-blind clinical trial. Individuals participate with myogenic temporomandibular\n      disorder, being allocated into 4 groups randomly and stratified by the method of sealed\n      envelopes. The results will be evaluated using: RDC/TMD, digital caliper, electromyography,\n      and visual analog scale and algometry. The protocols will be used in a single session and\n      will be evaluated in four different moments. The variables that will be investigated are\n      pain, muscle activity and joint mobility. The analyses of the data will be performed by\n      adopting a significance level of 5%."
