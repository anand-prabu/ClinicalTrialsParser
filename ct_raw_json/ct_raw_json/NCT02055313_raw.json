Pancreatic malignancy, advanced lung cancer;\n      advanced stomach cancer and advanced esophageal cancer have been chosen as the specific\n      terminal disease, based on its extremely high mortality rate. These specific situations can\n      apply to a strict definition set by Gotay: \"An exceptional survivor is a cancer patient who\n      is alive when the probability of doing so was less than 25% of living for five or more years\n      , for a given type and stage.\" [48] These types of cancers are associated with a 5 year\n      survival of less than 15% and even with the latest technology and advances in cancer care;\n      there is a very slight improvement in survival of these patients.\n\n      The study will be divided into three stages:\n\n        1. Identifying  the patients Clalit HMO will be approached to obtain ethical committee's\n           approval to the study and access to the HMO registry. Clalit HMO is the largest HMO in\n           Israel with over 4 million members (out of a total population of 7.5 million). After\n           securing this approval, patients will be identified through the HMO registry. We will\n           try to identify patients with a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer advanced lung cancer,\n           advanced stomach cancer and advanced esophageal cancer that are still alive from\n           2001-2008.\n\n           Each patient's physician will be contacted to verify that the diagnosis is correct. The\n           physician will be asked to contact the patient and obtain his or her consent to\n           participate in the study.  Consenting patients will be sent a letter signed by their\n           primary physician that describes the study and indicates that someone will be calling\n           them to invite them to participate in the study. The letter will clarify that\n           participation is completely voluntary and declining to participate will not affect them\n           in any way.\n\n        2. Approaching the patients Patients consenting to participate in the study will be\n           contacted by our qualitative researcher (SG) which will interview them following a\n           qualitative study protocol\n\n        3. Analysis of findings and preparation of summary report."

This study is using an exploratory, qualitative approach consisting of in-depth, semi-structured interviews. This approach has been widely used in health care to better understand the patient experience.  Descriptive analysis of sociodemographic, disease-related, and treatment-related factors were conducted to characterize the sample and to verify that sampling criteria were met. The study endpoint is aimed at reaching saturation of recurring themes that were extracted in the interviews.",
