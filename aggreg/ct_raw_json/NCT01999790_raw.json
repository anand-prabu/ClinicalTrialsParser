            "textblock": "Grave's ophthalmopathy is the most common cause of orbital disease in adults. The clinical\n      presentation may vary between sub clinic symptoms to severe ones. The eyelid retraction is\n      one of the most important signs of Grave's ophthalmopathy and can lead to cosmetic and\n      functional problems.\n\n      The eyelid retraction can be found in the inflammatory stage and in the chronic disease,\n      when it is stable. It can be described when the upper lid is contouring the superior limbus\n      or positioned above that. This condition can lead to dry eye symptoms, exposure keratitis\n      and cosmetic issues.  The treatment can may be surgical or medical.\n\n      The medical treatment are usually based on controlling thyroid function and in the use of\n      steroids, both are not specific for the lid retraction, but for the inflammation that is\n      common in the disease.\n\n      In the longstanding disease, surgery is the most efficient treatment. There are several\n      described techniques, they are based on the concept of weakening the muscles that act on lid\n      elevation (levator and Muller Muscle).\n\n      Basically the techniques can be divided in two groups: the first with an anterior approach\n      (with skin scar in the lid sulcus) and the second using a posterior approach (through the\n      conjunctiva).\n\n      In the literature there is no consensus in deciding the best technique, regarding cosmetic\n      results, incidence of complications, hypo or hypercorrection.\n\n      In this trial we propose to compare two distinct techniques that are already in clinical\n      use. The blepharotomy uses a cutaneous approach and the other a conjunctival approach.\n\n      The patients will be divided in two randomized groups and surgical expected outcomes,\n      cosmetics outcomes and complications occurrence will be compared."
