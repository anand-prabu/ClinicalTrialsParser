Participants are adults HIV+SGD+ who will be randomized\n      1:1 to receive BK Virus antiviral (ciprofloxacin) or placebo for 28 days.  Salivary\n      function/protein secretion will be correlated with BK polyomavirus titers.  We expect that\n      patients with HIV+SGD+ will have elevated oral BK polyomavirus viral loads and will benefit\n      from Ciprofloxacin."
