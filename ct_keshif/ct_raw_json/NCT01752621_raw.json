            "textblock": "Background: Acromegaly is a rare disease caused by GH hypersecretion from a pituitary\n      adenoma.  The annual incidence is estimated to be 3-5/million with a prevalence of 100 -\n      150/million. The incidence rate is however uncertain since no nationwide surveys exist. If\n      left untreated or poorly controlled the condition is associated with progressive morbidity\n      and an excess mortality. The primary treatment is surgery, which however only provides a\n      cure rate of \u2248 50 -60% due to the size of the tumour. The second line treatment today is\n      medical treatment with slow release formulations of somatostatin analogs (SA) and, more\n      recently, a specific GH antagonist. It is well known that surgical cure may normalize\n      mortality but similar data are not available for patients receiving medical treatment.\n\n      Accurate data on incidence rates and outcome of treatment are of obvious importance in order\n      to provide optimal and evidence-based treatment for the disease. This is particularly\n      relevant in light of the availability of new and effective treatment modalities such as the\n      GH antagonist, the proper place of which in the treatment algorithm still remains\n      controversial.\n\n      Denmark holds a unique position in terms of epidemiological studies due to the existence of\n      well organized databases which include all its inhabitants. A recognised problem with\n      epidemiological surveys from specialised centres is whether the figures are representative\n      for the general population. A nationwide Danish study will profit from the fact that every\n      Danish citizen holds a unique ID number that makes it easy to retrieve and combine pertinent\n      data regarding health, disease and death from different registries. The investigators have\n      previously used this for a landmark survey of another rare endocrine disease, i.e. Cushing's\n      syndrome. This publication has been cited more than 100 times.\n\n      Aim: To assess the incidence rate, morbidity and mortality of acromegaly in Denmark with a\n      specific attention to a comparison between the outcome of surgery alone vs. medical\n      treatment."
