The question that arise what exercises are best suited to and most effective for\n      (pre-)frail elderly individuals. Such populations are advised first to enter a \"skilling up\n      program\" before more traditional forms of training exercises are implemented.\n\n      Goals in the skilling up phase: improvement in neuromuscular control, postural control and\n      strengthening of large muscle groups of the lower extremity.\n\n      The aim of the study in the skilling up phase:\n\n      Study the effect on physical performance Study the effects on muscle strength. Study the\n      effects on cognition. The participants will be recruited in Canton Bern - Swizerland and\n      will be randomly allocated to an intervention group or sham group."
