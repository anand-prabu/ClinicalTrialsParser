Determine the response rate, time to progression and overall survival of\n      patients with recurrent non-small cell lung cancer when treated with nitrocamptothecin. II.\n      Assess the toxicities and pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin daily on days 1-5. Treatment continues\n      weekly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed\n      for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-55 patients will be accrued for this study."
