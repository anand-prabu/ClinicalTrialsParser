Previous pelvic irradiation in case of a local\n      recurrence is not excluded from the trial. The treatment protocol aims on a preoperatively\n      improved tumor regression allowing less aggressive surgery in primary locally advanced\n      rectal cancer and a higher rate of curative resections in heavily pretreated locally\n      recurrent rectal cancers.\n\n      Primary endpoint of the trial is the feasibility rate of a multimodal regimen consisting of\n      radiochemotherapy and hyperthermia. Secondary endpoints are local control, survival rates,\n      and toxicity. It is planned to include a total number of 59 patients over a period of 2.5\n      years."
