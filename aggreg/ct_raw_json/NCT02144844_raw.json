A similar time frame was used for the TAU group. Paired T-tests were used to determine\n      mean change in EPDS scores (primary analysis) and BDI-II scores (secondary analysis) within\n      each of the CBI and TAU groups at T2 and T3. A T-test measured differences in EPDS and\n      BDI-II scores for the same time periods.\n\n        -  The sample size was based on the PI's pilot intervention study. Using a conservative\n           estimate of 500 eligible women from both sites per year at a 42% depression risk rate\n           (moderate and high), and a 46% enrollment rate, it will be possible to accrue 97\n           subjects per year at risk for APD (moderate and high risk) or 193 subjects over the\n           first 24 months of the study. Using the recruitment, retention, and eligibility\n           patterns from the previous study, a total study sample of 124 subjects, 62 in the\n           IP-CBI group and 62 in the TAU control group, allows for a 20% (24) drop-out rate and\n           achieve the goal of 50 women in the IP-CBI and 50 women in the TAU control group.\n\n        -  We planned to determine if there were significant differences in EPDS baseline scores\n           in the CBI and TAU groups for the full sample and for the CBI and TAU groups stratified\n           by high or low-moderate risk for antepartum depression."
