      The purpose of this study is to show that we can effectively deliver health information and
      education, online, via computer regarding cholesterol. This computer program is called the
      Interactive Cholesterol Advisory Tool (ICAT).

      Participants will be recruited and categorized based on screening labs into 1 of 2 groups:
      Low or moderate risk of developing cardiovascular disease within 10 years based on risk
      factors. The low risk group will be advised to take the blood test results furnished by the
      study to their primary care doctor to discuss managing cholesterol. The moderate risk group
      will see the study physician for 4 visits about high cholesterol. Both groups complete a
      total of 4 blood draws over 9 months. Both groups will be randomized at consent into 2
      groups: 1 who uses the Interactive Cholesterol Advisory Tool (ICAT) and 1 that does not use
      the ICAT.  Because recruitment goals for the low risk group were met, a third group was
      created: low risk who both the study physician for 4 visits about high cholesterol and use
      the ICAT.
