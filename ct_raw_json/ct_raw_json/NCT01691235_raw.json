The purpose of this study is to see if the\n      SIMpill automated pill dispensing device can help subjects take their medications at the\n      times the doctor has instructed them to take it.\n\n      The SIMpill device is an automated pill dispensing device that records a time stamp each\n      time the device is opened and a dose of medication is taken. Physicians can download this\n      data and generate a precise account of when you have taken your medication. In addition, if\n      a dose is missed, the SIMpill device can be set to automatically notify you by text message\n      if a dose is overdue. The Simpill device is a new way to keep track of when you take your\n      HCV medications and will also help remind you when you forget to take a dose. In addition,\n      this information will help your doctors understand how taking medication on time effects the\n      success of the therapy."

This includes medication dosages,\n           follow-up, and monitoring. The only exception will be the mode of medication\n           dispensing.\n\n        -  Patients will be asked to bring their Simpill devices to their regularly scheduled\n           clinic visits at which time medication adherence information will be downloaded by\n           study personnel.  Each visit will be a regularly scheduled standard of care visit and\n           no additional clinic visits will be needed for the patient in the Simpill study arm.\n\n        -  In the event that any patient demonstrated viral breakthrough during therapy, those\n           patients will be offered an additional blood draw to screen for viral resistance.  This\n           will be important to understand if patients using the Simpill device have better\n           adherence to the medication regiment which results in lower incidence of viral\n           resistance.\n\n        -  Patients in the study arm will receive a text messages each time a dose of medication\n           is missed. This message will only go to the telephone number specified by the patient\n           and will not go to members of the study team.  Patients who do not have text messaging\n           capability will not be eligible for this study.\n\n        -  The initial study will be a pilot study designed to obtain preliminary data regarding\n           the feasibility of this device. This study is powered to detect differences in viral\n           kinetics over the first 4 weeks.\n\n        -  In the event that Vertex receives FDA approval for BID dosage of telaprevir prior to\n           funding and initiation of the study, the most currently approved dosing (BID) will be\n           used instead of q8 hours."
