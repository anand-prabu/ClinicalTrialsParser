When genetic analyses are performed,\n      samples will have been coded and identifying  information  linking patient/subject to the\n      sample will be destroyed.   Any genetic information  obtained will have no established\n      clinical value and will not be provided to the subject/patient or their health care\n      provider.\n\n      Patients included will be those 18 years or older and who have been identified by the\n      investigator to have a condition of interest for exploratory studies related to the\n      patient's illness or other feature that offers the possibility of creating information  that\n      leads to scientifically useful and important  studies.  Patients will be excluded if\n      obtaining the sample would be over and above usual clinical care, would result in excessive\n      blood loss, or the individual is unable to provide informed consent.\n\n      The expected outcome is to provide the investigator the opportunity  to obtain tissues of\n      interest for laboratory evaluation with the goal of either better understanding a disease or\n      to design a scientific study to better understand or treat a disease."
