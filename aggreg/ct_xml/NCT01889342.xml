  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Comorbidity is normal in clinical practice. Metacognitive Therapy (MCT) is a transdiagnostic
      model and could therefore be well suited when it comes to treating patients with high rates
      of comorbidity. So far, no studies have examined MCT in comparison with the best documented
      and evidence based treatment, cognitive behavioral treatment(CBT), in a randomized
      controlled trial consisting of mixed anxiety disorder sample with high degree of
      comorbidity.

      The main aim of this study is to 1) Evaluate the effectiveness of metacognitive therapy in a
      sample of mixed anxiety disorders as compared to a group receiving existing evidence-based
      single diagnosis CBT- treatment protocols 2) Investigate patterns and mechanisms of change
      in the two treatments.
