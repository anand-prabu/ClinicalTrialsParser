It also helps stop the\n      patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells\n      from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem\n      cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the effectiveness of donor peripheral blood stem\n      cell transplant in treating patients with hematologic cancer."

Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood\n      stem cell transplantation on day 0.\n\n      Patients are followed every 1-2 weeks for 6 months and at 9, 12, 24, and 36 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 62 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years."
