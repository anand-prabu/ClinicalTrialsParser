Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Epoetin alfa may stimulate red blood cell production and prevent or treat anemia in\n      patients who are undergoing radiation therapy and chemotherapy. It is not yet known if\n      chemotherapy combined with radiation therapy is more effective with or without epoetin alfa\n      in treating non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of chemotherapy combined\n      with radiation therapy with or without epoetin alfa in treating patients who have stage IIIA\n      or stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer."

Patients are stratified according to\n      Karnofsky performance status (90-100% vs 60-80%), weight loss (no more than 5% vs 6-10%),\n      and baseline hemoglobin (women 11.0-12.4 g/dL and men 11.0-13.4 g/dL vs women 12.5-15.0 g/dL\n      and men 13.5-15.0 g/dL). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Beginning 7-10 days before the start of chemoradiotherapy, patients receive\n           epoetin alfa subcutaneously once weekly for 8 weeks. Patients receive paclitaxel IV\n           over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes once weekly for 7 weeks. Patients\n           undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 7 weeks for a total of 33 treatments. Treatment\n           continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel, carboplatin, and radiotherapy as in arm I. Quality\n           of life is assessed at baseline, at completion of chemoradiotherapy, every 3 months for\n           1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 3 years.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6\n      months for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 202-232 patients (101-116 per treatment arm) will be accrued\n      for this study within 1.7-2 years."
