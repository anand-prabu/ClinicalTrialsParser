  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The data regarding the effects of aesthetic body contouring is insufficient. Poor results
      may related to preoperative psychological distress. Studies regarding eating disorder
      symptoms are lacking. Therefore studies using standardized and validated are needed. We
      decided to prospectively study quality of life, psychological distress, and eating disorder
      symptoms in body contouring (abdominoplasty or liposuction) patient populations. Used
      questionnaires are 15D quality of life, Raitasalo's modification of the Beck Inventory, and
      the Eating Disorder Inventory. We hypothesize that aesthetic body contouring plastic surgery
      has notable quality of life effects.
