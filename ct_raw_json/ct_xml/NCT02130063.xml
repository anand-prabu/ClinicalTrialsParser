      The purpose of the trial is to evaluate and compare the effect of iron isomaltoside 1000 to
      iron sucrose in its ability to increase haemoglobin (Hb) in subjects with IDA when oral iron
      preparations are ineffective or cannot be used or where there is a clinical need to deliver
      iron rapidly.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IDA is highly prevalent in subjects with gastrointestinal diseases and cancer, menstruating
      or pregnant women, and subjects who have undergone bariatric procedure. IDA can have a
      substantial medical and quality of life (QoL) burden on the subjects and the treatment of
      these subjects includes controlling the bleeding and replenishing lost iron. Oral iron
      administration is often used in the clinical practice at many clinics; however, oral iron
      may not be tolerated by all subjects. Hence, there is a need for an alternative iron
      treatment in subjects, who do not tolerate oral iron.

      This study is planned to compare the efficacy and safety of iron isomaltoside 1000 with
      another parenteral iron preparation (iron sucrose) in subjects with IDA and who are
      intolerant or unresponsive to oral iron therapy or who need iron rapidly.
