An antibody is a protein produced by the body's immune system when it\n      detects a foreign substance, called an antigen. The mechanism of an antibody is to attack an\n      antigen. In antibody mediated rejection, antibodies will attack the transplanted heart,\n      causing injury to the heart. The purpose of this investigation is to determine if a study\n      drug, called Eculizumab (Soliris), prevents antibody-mediated rejection in patients with\n      high antibody production and prolongs long-term cardiac transplant survival."

            "textblock": "The growing proportion of sensitized cardiac recipients presents an additional challenge to\n      the transplant practitioner attempting to minimize the occurrence of antibody mediated\n      rejection (AMR). Patients pre-exposed or \"sensitized\" to antigen exposing events (i.e.:\n      blood transfusions, multiple pregnancies, prior organ transplantations, ventricular support\n      devices) are more likely to both possess preformed and develop de-novo antibodies.\n      Sensitized patients with panel reactive antibodies > 25% are at risk for increased mortality\n      after heart transplantation.\n\n      A central component of antibody-mediated cell injury is complement activation. The\n      inhibition of terminal complement activation may be the missing link to decreasing possibly\n      both complement-mediated AMR and cellular rejection (CR) by inhibiting both the inflammatory\n      effects of both circulating antibodies and cytokine induced cell death.\n\n      Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to complement protein C5 with\n      high affinity, thereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a and C5b and preventing the generation\n      of the terminal complement complex C5b-9. By this mechanism, Eculizumab (Soliris\u00ae) inhibits\n      terminal complement mediated intravascular hemolysis in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria\n      patients.\n\n      This study is a non-randomized, open-label, investigator-initiated safety and efficacy trial\n      investigating the de-novo use of Eculizumab alongside conventional therapy to prevent\n      antibody mediated rejection. The duration of the study will include an open enrollment\n      period and at least 12 months of follow-up (post-transplant). The trial will enroll a total\n      of 10 \"sensitized\" patients with a panel reactive antibody score greater than 70%, who are\n      not previously or currently enrolled in another ongoing trial. The use of Eculizumab will be\n      un-blinded to all study and research practitioner participants. A historical cohort of 10\n      additional patients will also be utilized for comparison."
