      This open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and
      safety of subcutaneously administered RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in patients with
      systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Patients will receive RoActemra/Actemra
      subcutaneously weekly or every 10 days for 52 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ages 1 year up to and including 17 years at screening

          -  Diagnosis of sJIA according to the ILAR classification (Petty et al. 2004)

          -  History of inadequate clinical response (in the opinion of the treating physician) to
             NSAIDs and corticosteroids

          -  If a patient has received previous treatment with any biologic agents other than TCZ
             (tocilizumab), these must have been discontinued according to the timelines defined
             by protocol prior to the baseline visit

          -  Patients currently receiving TCZ by the IV route of administration and with
             well-controlled disease do not require a period of discontinuation of IV TCZ and
             should have their first dose of SC TCZ administered on the date that their next IV
             TCZ infusion would be due

          -  Concurrent treatment with DMARDs (including MTX), NSAIDs, and oral corticosteroids
             are permitted at the discretion of the investigator

          -  Females of childbearing potential and non-sterile males with female partner of

             protocol

             events (including hypersensitivity)

             despite current treatment with IV TCZ

          -  sJIA that is well controlled by any treatment agent other than TCZ (Juvenile
             Arthritis Disease Activity Score [JADAS]-71 &lt;/= 3.8 with no fever)

          -  Patients who are wheelchair-bound or bedridden

          -  Any other auto-immune, rheumatic disease, or overlapping syndrome other than sJIA

             time of the screening visit

          -  Females who are pregnant, lactating, or intending to become pregnant during study
             conduct

             patient's safety or ability to complete the study

          -  Known HIV infection or other acquired forms of immune compromise or inborn conditions
             characterized by a compromised immune system

             treatment during screening or treatment with IV antibiotics completed within 4 weeks
             of the screening visit or oral antibiotics completed within 2 weeks of the screening
             visit

          -  History of atypical tuberculosis (TB) or active TB requiring treatment within 2 years
             prior to screening visit

          -  Positive TB test at screening unless treated with anti-TB therapy for at least 4
             weeks prior to receiving study drug

          -  History of reactivation or new onset of a systemic infection such as herpes zoster or
             Epstein-Barr virus within 2 months of the screening visit

          -  Hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C antibody positivity or chronic viral or
             autoimmune hepatitis

          -  History of concurrent serious gastrointestinal disorders such as ulcer or
