    <textblock>
      We propose that the systemic administration of lidocaine following the induction of
      cue-induced craving, relative to saline plus cue-induced craving or lidocaine without
      cue-induced craving, will block the reconsolidation of cue memories. This will lead to a
      reduction in cue-induced craving upon repeated testing as well as subsequent cocaine use and
      basal craving.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine dependence is among the most tenacious of the substance use disorders yet remains
      one of the few lacking an effective pharmacological intervention. As other pharmacologic
      approaches have not been fruitful, new targets are required. A novel treatment approach is
      to disrupt the neural processes involved in cue-related memories (memory links between the
      external stimuli associated with drug use and the subjective drug effect). These engrained
      memories, when reactivated by cues, elicit craving and a return to drug use. Each cue
      re-exposure, however, requires the re-remembering (or reconsolidation) of the drug cue. Key
      molecular processes required for memory reconsolidation are NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate)
      receptor activation, the induction of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and increased
      extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity. In rodent models, blocking these
      processes changes the cue-related memory; the cue loses its potency to induce a return to
      drug self-administration. Lidocaine is an FDA approved medication that inhibits activation
      of NMDA receptors and suppresses production of NO and ERK. Lidocaine, like cocaine, is a
      local anesthetic with potent effects as a sodium-channel blocker. Unlike cocaine, lidocaine
      is essentially devoid of activity at monoamine re-uptake transporters and has no rewarding
      or addictive properties. As lidocaine suppresses the molecular processes required for drug
      cue reconsolidation and has relatively specific effects upon the striatal regions necessary
      for drug cue reconsolidation, lidocaine may offer a novel approach for interfering with
      memory reconsolidation. Two other Na+ channel blockers have also decrease craving and/or
      substance use in substance-dependent subjects. We propose that the systemic administration
      of lidocaine following the induction of cue-induced craving, relative to saline plus
      cue-induced craving or lidocaine without cue-induced craving, will block the reconsolidation
      of cue memories. This will lead to a reduction in cue-induced craving upon repeated testing
      as well as subsequent cocaine use and basal craving. If our hypotheses are proven correct,
      these findings will 1) support a role for lidocaine in cocaine addiction treatment, 2)
      demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of attenuating cue-induced memories, and 3) guide
      the development of a larger study with lidocaine.
