Based on these a\n      predictive model will be learned that can estimate the probability at various stages of the\n      process that the patient waits too long. Visual management will be developed that can\n      visualize the predicted waiting time.\n\n      Process interventions aimed at reducing waiting times will be tested prospectively."
