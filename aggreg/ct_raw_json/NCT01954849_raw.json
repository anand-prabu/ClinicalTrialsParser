They will be assessed for a gingivitis score, gum bleeding score, plaque score,\n      their periodontal health  and for precarious areas 14 days throughout a 28 day treatment and\n      for a 28 day post treatment period. Additionally plaque and salvia samples will be analyzed\n      for changes in microbial pathogens or inflammatory cytokines."
