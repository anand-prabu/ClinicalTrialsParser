This was achieved without\n           adversely affecting clinical outcome in the population studied.\n\n        -  The aim of this secondary analysis performed on a subgroup of 20 patients from the\n           original study was to determine whether there are any differences in the postoperative\n           immunologic response, as expressed by the production of inflammatory mediators, between\n           a restrictive approach to red cell transfusion and a more liberal strategy."
