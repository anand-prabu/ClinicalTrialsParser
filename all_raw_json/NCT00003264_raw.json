Evaluate the response rate and toxicity of weekly cisplatin and gemcitabine\n      in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who\n      have received either no prior chemotherapy or no more than one prior chemotherapy regimen\n      for advanced disease.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy status: chemotherapy naive\n      (no prior chemotherapy, or prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy at least 6 months\n      prior to recurrence, or prior biologic agents only) vs chemotherapy exposed (one prior\n      chemotherapy regimen directed at recurrent or newly diagnosed metastatic disease and/or\n      prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy less than 6 months prior to recurrence). Patients\n      receive gemcitabine as a 30 minute infusion weekly for 3 weeks followed by one week of rest.\n      Cisplatin is administered as a 30-60 minute infusion immediately preceding gemcitabine.\n      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2-6 courses, depending on response. Patients with\n      previously untreated metastatic disease may have treatment interrupted to receive radiation\n      therapy to locoregional disease sites. Patients may continue treatment beyond 6 courses at\n      the discretion of the physician. Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue approximately 36 patients."
