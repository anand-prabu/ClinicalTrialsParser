Patients with stable or responding disease may receive an additional course of\n      vaccinations.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of recombinant vaccinia-TRICOM vaccine\n      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose\n      preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at each vaccine administration, and at study\n      completion.\n\n      Patients are followed at 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-18 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-12\n      months."
