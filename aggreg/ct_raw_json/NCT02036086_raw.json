During Screening: They will undergo protocol assessments within 28 days of\n      randomization or unless otherwise indicated as per protocol. Physical exam will be done\n      within 7 days of study treatment initiation. Core biopsy will be done within 14 days of\n      study entry. During treatment, they will take vemurafenib 960 mg by mouth twice a day for 2\n      months & then be assessed for respectability. They then undergo surgical resection\n      (lymphadenectomy) & resume taking vemurafenib after recovery from surgery. They will undergo\n      adjuvant radiation therapy if appropriate, then continue vemurafenib for another 10 months,\n      for total of 12 months or until disease recurrence, death, unacceptable toxicity, or\n      withdrawal of consent.  If a patient receives 2 months of neoadjuvant vemurafenib then they\n      will receive 10 months post surgery.  Or, if they receive 4 months then 8 months will be\n      post surgery for a total of 12 months.  They will be assessed every 28 days while on drug\n      therapy.  After Treatment, they are followed for disease recurrence/survival every 4 months\n      for the 1st year post treatment, then they are seen every 6 months to year 5 or as\n      clinically indicated.  Imaging scans will be performed every 6 months for first 3 years and\n      yearly to 5 years or as clinically indicated.  Dermatological exams are scheduled before\n      drug therapy, before surgery and then as clinically indicated during follow-up.  Head and\n      neck exams take place every 26 weeks on treatment until 26 weeks after treatment to assess\n      for Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC). Suspicious SCC lesions will be biopsied.  Anal and pelvic\n      exams take place on treatment Cycle 6 Day 1 and at end of treatment."
