      In the proposed study, the investigators will assess the brain's dopamine response to UVR
      light in individuals who use tanning beds both frequently and infrequently.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      UV radiation has recently been classified as a known human carcinogen by the US Department
      of Health and Human Services. Nevertheless, the voluntary exposure to sunlight continues
      unabated despite progressively increasing rates of ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced
      illness and death, particularly skin cancer. An increasingly common form of UVR
      administration is through the use of indoor tanning salons. Almost 30 million Americans,
      including 20% of 18-39 year olds, visit indoor tanning salons each year. Frequent and
      excessive tanning, despite a growing understanding by those who tan of the morbidity and
      mortality associated with tanning, suggests that UVR may impart rewarding effects beyond the
      assumed cosmetic benefits. Recent studies, in fact, have shown that up to 40% of both
      frequent beach and salon tanners exhibit signs and symptoms consistent with an addictive
      disorder, including an inability to decrease their tanning frequencies, compulsive tanning,
      and/or continued tanning despite adverse consequences. As the mesostriatal dopaminergic
      pathway plays a key role in reward and addiction, the investigators propose to extend this
      novel finding by directly assessing the mesostriatal dopaminergic reward pathway in
      compulsive and infrequent tanners. This pathway plays a key role in the experience and
      integration of reward and alterations in this system have been observed in addicted
      populations. Specifically, 1) striatal dopamine is released in response to rewarding
      substances and experiences, 2) striatal dopamine2/3 receptor densities are lower in cocaine,
      alcohol, opioid, and nicotine dependent, as well as obese, subjects, and 3) reward-induced
      striatal dopamine efflux has been shown to be decreased in addicted, relative to
      non-addicted, subjects.
