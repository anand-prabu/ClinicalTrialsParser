GSK744 is the oral formulation of GSK1265744, GSK744\n      LA is the long acting injectable formulation of GSK1265744 and TMC278 LA is the long acting\n      injectable formulation of TMC278.\n\n      The study will consist of three parts: an Induction Period, Maintenance Period and Extension\n      Period.  There is also a Long-Term Follow Up Period for subjects who withdraw from the study\n      and have received at least one dose of GSK744 LA and / or TMC278 LA. In the Induction\n      Period, eligible subjects will receive a combination of an oral regimen of 30 mg of GSK744\n      and 600/300 mg of ABC/3TC, once daily for 20 weeks. In the Maintenance Period, eligible\n      subjects will be randomized 2:2:1 at Day 1 to receive an IM regimen of GSK744 LA 400 mg +\n      TMC278 LA 600 mg every 4 weeks for 96 weeks (Q4W), an IM regimen of GSK744 LA 600 mg +\n      TMC278 LA 900 mg every 8 weeks for 96 weeks (Q8W), or to continue on the oral Induction\n      Period regimen of GSK744 30 mg + ABC/3TC once daily for 96 weeks (or 104 weeks if continuing\n      on to the Extension Period). The Extension Period will allow for a collection of longer term\n      efficacy and safety and tolerability data from subjects receiving GSK744 LA and TMC278 LA.\n\n      The study will involve sufficient subjects at screening in order to ensure a total of\n      approximately 265 subjects at the beginning of the Induction Period and approximately 225\n      subjects randomized into the Maintenance Period."
