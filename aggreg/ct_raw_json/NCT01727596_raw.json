Factors including sex, age, body mass index\n      (BMI), Q angle, lateral patella displacement (LPD), lateral patellofemoral angle (LPA) and\n      pre-taping pain score were measured. One well-trained therapist applied adhesive tape to\n      each patient by McConnell approach. Before and after taping, patients completed a visual\n      analog pain scale (VAS) after performing a step-down from an 8-inch platform. Paired-t test\n      was used for the difference of the VAS score measured before and after taping. Patients with\n      improvement of more than 1 point in VAS score after taping were considered responsible, and\n      others were non-responsible. The results were analyzed by logistic regression."
