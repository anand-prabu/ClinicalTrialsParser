            "textblock": "The investigators are investigating two ways of treating pain after hip surgery. One way is\n      though a thin tube (called a catheter), and it is placed into the back so that pain-numbing\n      drugs can reach the nerves near the backbone. This is called an \"epidural\" catheter. Another\n      way is to place the catheter close to the hip, where the surgery is done, so that the\n      pain-numbing drugs can reach some of the nerves more locally. This is called a \"fascia\n      iliaca compartment\" catheter.\n\n      The investigators do not know which way is best to treat pain, or has fewer side effects, or\n      allows a patient to leave hospital faster. Usually, patients would receive only one type of\n      catheter for pain relief. To do this comparison, the investigators would place both catheter\n      types, so that patients help us tell which one works better."
