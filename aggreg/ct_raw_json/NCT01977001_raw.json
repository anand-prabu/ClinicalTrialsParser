Effectiveness of\n      MigraineBoxTM will be studied in primary headaches in the emergency department.  The user\n      simply reclines his/her head and neck into this device that has contours that support the\n      head and neck.  Luke warm water is filled into the MigraineBoxTM before use and then a\n      frozen insert is placed inside. This will gradually cool the water surrounding the patient's\n      head and theoretically provide headache relief."
