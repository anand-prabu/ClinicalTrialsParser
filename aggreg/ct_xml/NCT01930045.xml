  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of single doses of a magnesium/aluminum antacid (MAALOX)
      before or after administration of raltegravir on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir in
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants. The study will consist of Part 1
      (Periods 1, 2, and 3) and Part 2 (Periods 4 and 5). Each study period will have a duration
      of ≥2 days, and the study will pause for evaluation of Part 1 pharmacokinetics results
      before continuing to Part 2. The same participants will participate in Parts 1 and 2. The
      primary hypothesis being tested (in Part 1) is that raltegravir plasma concentration 12
      hours after administration (C 12 hrs) will not differ significantly from raltegravir C 12
      hrs when antacid is administered 4 hours before or 4 hours after raltegravir.
