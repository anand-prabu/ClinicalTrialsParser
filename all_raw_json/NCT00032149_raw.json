Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.\n      Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the number of immune cells found\n      in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover from the\n      side effects of chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining filgrastim with\n      combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have HIV-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."

Patients also receive prednisolone daily on weeks\n      1-4 and then every other day on weeks 5-16. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF)\n      subcutaneously on days 6-12. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 8 courses (16 weeks)\n      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete\n      response (CR) or partial response (PR) receive 4 courses beyond CR or PR.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 5 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
