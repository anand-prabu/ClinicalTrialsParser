  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of patients with clinical symptoms of Ménière's disease using
      injection of diluted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent into the ear to
      evaluate inner ear structures.

      The goal is to reproduce imaging findings described by non-United States (US) institutions,
      improve on image quality with decreased scan time and evaluate the dynamics of the contrast
      movement into the inner ear structures.

      Participants will be scheduled for study sessions on 2 consecutive days to include consent,
      baseline audiometric evaluation, intra-tympanic contrast administration, serial MR imaging,
      and follow-up audiometry evaluation in the injected ear.

      Participants over 59 years old or who have medical conditions will have a blood test to
      check kidney function to ensure they can safely receive the contrast.

    <description>Magnevist (gadopentetate dimeglumine, Bayer Health Care) will be diluted eightfold with sterile saline (1:7 v/v) in a 1 ml syringe and injected intra-tympanically with a 23-25g needle up to 0.4 ml or less if contrast reflux is noted under direct visualization. Anesthesia with topical phenol is available for this procedure.</description>
