Traditional tDCS has recently been modified to deliver\n      current to more specific locations in the brain. This new delivery method is called\n      high-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS). It is not known whether traditional tDCS (more diffuse\n      current delivery) or HD-tDCS (more focal current delivery) will be the better approach for\n      enhancing treatment outcomes. To answer this question, computerized speech-language\n      treatment will be administered during the application of the different forms of brain\n      stimulation."
