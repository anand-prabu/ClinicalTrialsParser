    <textblock>
      The purpose of this enhanced surveillance study (&quot;ESS&quot;) is to collect information regarding
      chronic adverse events that are possibly related to the ExAblateÂ® System (&quot;ExAblate&quot;) that
      are received by InSightec (&quot;InSightec&quot;) following PMA approval.  This study will examine
      adverse events reported in patients undergoing the device procedure for the first two years
      of commercial experience.  Other relevant data may be collected as well.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This proposed Registry will be performed in full compliance with all HIPAA rules and their
      implementations at potential participating sites.  All patients planned to undergo the
      ExAblate procedure in a commercial setting after PMA approval will be offered a consent so
      they can be included in the ESS.  Non-consenting patients will not be included in the ESS.
      However, information regarding the total number of subjects treated at each participating
      site with the device will also be collected.

      InSightec will set up a (password protected) EDC database for the sites to enter the
      information of participating subjects treated with the ExAblate device from all U.S. sites
      using the ExAblate procedure for the bone metastases indication.  This will occur for a
      total duration of 2 years following device approval.  It should be noted that any adverse
      event that meets the Medical Device Report (&quot;MDR&quot;) definition will be reported as an MDR as
      well.

      There will be no control group.  Reporting to FDA will occur at six-month intervals for the
      first two-years after PMA approval.
