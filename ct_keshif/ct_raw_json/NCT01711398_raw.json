The Bayesian methodology allows updating information as the trial progresses\n      and stopping the trial as soon as the information obtained is deemed to be sufficient.\n      Preclinical toxicokinetic studies of N6L and IPP-204106N in dogs and the first phase I\n      clinical trial with N6L will be used to inform the prior distribution in the present study.\n\n      The decisional part, according to the results of the phase I portion of the study, will\n      define the optimal dose recommended for the phase IIa portion of the study.\n\n      The phase IIa portion of the study will confirm the optimal dose, and is designed to\n      evaluate the safety and the preliminary efficacy of IPP-204106N in an expanded patient\n      population treated at the recommended dose of IPP-204106N."
