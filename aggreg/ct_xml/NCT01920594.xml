  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that GSK1278863 will reduce neurologic, renal, and/or
      cardiac ischemia in patients undergoing elective descending thoracic aorta/thoracoabdominal
      aortic aneurysm (DTA/TAAA) repair, a population known to be at high risk for ischemic events
      from their underlying pathology and the surgical complexity required to address their
      disease.  Approximately 160 subjects will be stratified according to intervention type
      (surgical or endovascular repair, with the latter limited to 50% of the total study
      population) and randomized in a 1:1 fashion to treatment with GSK1278863 (300 milligrams
      [loading dose] followed by 100 milligrams [mg]/day x 4 days) or placebo starting prior to
      planned repair, through postoperative day 3. The duration of participation in this study is
      expected to be approximately 4 to 8 weeks from screening to follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Adults &gt;= 18 years of age who require the following types of descending thoracic
             aorta or thoracoabdominal aorta repair for atherosclerotic aneurysm or chronic
             dissection (de novo Type B or residual Type B [following Type A repair]) via open
             surgery or endovascular stenting (TEVAR) as per their treating surgeon

          -  Open surgery:

        Extent I TAAA (+/-distal arch) if it extends to or beyond renal ostia. Extent II TAAA
        (+/-distal arch). Extent III TAAA (defined as proximal extent or anastamosis superior to
        inferior pulmonary vein).

        Extent IV TAAA only with a prior TEVAR or if it is a redo procedure (in this setting a
        &quot;redo&quot; is a prior abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) open or endovascular aortic repair
        (EVAR), with either proximal suture line disruption or mesenteric segment aneurysm
        recurrence requiring redo Extent IV reconstruction).

        DTA repair with one of the following: Safi extent C coverage. Subclavian to diaphragm
        disease extent. &gt;75% of total DTA length.

        -TEVAR with one of the following: Full DTA coverage with previous abdominal EVAR or open
        AAA. Full DTA coverage including Zone 2 to celiac (i.e., distal arch plus full coverage
        DTA).

        Full DTA coverage with celiac artery coverage with or without left subclavian artery
        coverage (Zone 2 or Zone 3 proximal landing), or full DTA (either Zone 2 or Zone 3) with
        extension distal to celiac with visceral debranching (e.g., the abdominal hybrid Extent 2
        TAAA).

        Note: Zone 2 is defined as between the left carotid through coverage of the left
        subclavian artery and Zone 3 is defined as the first 3cm distal to the left subclavian
        (e.g., between left subclavian and ligamentum [isthmus]).

          -  Completed any staging or bypass procedure that precedes the aortic repair at least 48
             hours prior to the repair.

          -  Expect placement of a lumbar CSF catheter during the procedure with plans to maintain
             it for at least 48 hours per the treating physician.

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

        Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal
        ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea
        [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
        &gt; 40 milli international unit /mililiter (mL) and estradiol &lt; 40 picogram/mL (&lt;147
        picomoles/Liter) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose
        menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods if
        they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to
        allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of
        HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw;
        this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their
        post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a
        contraceptive method.

        Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods from screening
        until completion of the Follow-up Visit.

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one
             of the contraception methods. This criterion must be followed from the time of
             Screening until the completion of the Follow-up Visit.

             proliferative retinopathy or age related macular degeneration) within 3 months of
             randomization.

          -  The subject is currently receiving dialysis.

        apply to subjects with predominately paced rhythms) Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine
        aminotransferase &gt;=2xupper limit of normal (ULN); alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin

             average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks for males or &gt;7 drinks for females. One drink is
             equivalent to 12 g of alcohol: 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer, 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine
             or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of 80 proof distilled spirits.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).
