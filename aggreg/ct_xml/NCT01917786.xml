  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various medications used in anesthesia have been implicated in the prolongation of QT
      interval. Recently, there has been an increase in the use of dexmedetomidine in patients
      presenting for surgeries given its beneficial sedative, anxiolytic, and analgesic
      properties. It has several desirable properties including minimal respiratory side effects
      as well as the ability to decrease intraoperative and postoperative analgesic requirements.
      In many of the patients who present for routine surgical procedures, dexmedetomidine is a
      common component of their anesthetic care. This is a study to assess the effects of
      dexmedetomidine on the QT interval in children presenting for surgery.
