In\n      our study we plan to check a large number of immunological parameters to broaden the scope\n      of knowledge of evaluating individuals for immune health across multiple sub fields of\n      medicine and for advancing a basic understanding of immune cell signaling.\n\n      The study will involve 70 participants between ages 18-45 of both sexes. Persons enrolled to\n      the study will have been diagnosed with allergic rhinitis caused by dust mite or persons who\n      developed a systemic reaction following bee sting who are candidates to be treated by\n      immunization.\n\n      After verification of diagnosis of allergic condition and decision to start immunizations,\n      blood samples will be drawn from participants before immunization weekly for 24 weeks. Blood\n      samples will be analyzed in order to identify immune cell subset differences that change in\n      response to allergy immunotherapy. Comparisons will be made of baseline and\n      stimulation-induced status of protein phosphorylation individuals over the time-series\n      course in which they receive allergy immunotherapy to pinpoint molecular mechanisms\n      underlying desensitization. Evaluations will be made of cellular mechanisms of allergy\n      immunotherapy by comparing over time and between groups, through serum cytokine profiling\n      and blood gene expression of individuals undergoing allergy immunotherapy shots."
