  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with sickle cell disease many have a number of systemic complications, including
      liver problems.  Some of these liver problems lead to liver fibrosis/cirrhosis, secondary to
      chronic blood transfusions.  The purpose of this study is to investigate FibroScan readings
      in patients with sickle cell disease and iron overload secondary to blood transfusions, and
      to correlate the FibroScan results with MRI R2*.  The primary hypothesis is that the results
      of FibroScan will correlate with the results of the abdominal MRI R2*.

    <textblock>
      Liver biopsy is the gold standard to examine the liver for iron deposits and histology.
      However, liver biopsy is invasive and involves a risk of bleeding and pain.  Biopsy may also
      miss significant pathology if the small biopsy specimen is taken from an uninvolved part of
      the liver.  Non-invasive techniques such as MRI are now used to evaluate the liver iron
      content.  MRI can visualize the whole liver and measure liver iron content.  MRI, however,
      will not detect liver scarring.

      Liver transient elastography (FibroScan) is a non-invasive tool for assessing liver fibrosis
      or scarring by measuring liver stiffness (LSM).  Compared with liver biopsy, FibroScan
      provides immediate results and is a painless, short (3 mins), simple procedure to perform.
      In some studies FibroScan reports have correlated well with liver biopsy results of fibrosis
      and cirrhosis, and with MRI T2*, ferritin and liver function tests.

      This purpose of this study is to investigate the role of FibroScan in individuals with
      sickle cell anemia and iron overload or who have a diagnosis of liver disease, and to
      compare FibroScan readings with magnetic resonance imaging.

    <description>Liver transient elastography (FibroScan) uses a probe consisting of an ultrasound transducer located at the end of a vibrating piston.  The piston produces a vibration of low amplitude and frequency, which generate a shear wave that passes through the skin and liver tissue.  The ultrasound then detects the propagation of the shear wave through the liver (at a depth of 25 - 65 mm below the skin surface) by measuring its velocity.  The shear wave velocity is directly related to the tissue stiffness, with a higher velocity equating to higher tissue stiffness, corresponding to increasing severity of fibrosis.</description>

    <description>Patients will have blood tests done to evaluate liver function and general health, then have FibroScan and MRI R2* abdomen.  A blinded (no access to laboratory parameters or available data) radiologist will interpret the abdominal MRI R2*.  The technician obtaining the FibroScan will be blinded (no access to laboratory parameters or available data).  Please note that scan results should not be affected by technician's knowledge of the subject's history because liver stiffness and iron content are values reported by the FibroScan machine or are derived from pre-established formulas (R2*).</description>
