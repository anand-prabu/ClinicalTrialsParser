            "textblock": "Background: Sexual and reproductive health (SRH) is a global public health priority.\n      Providing efficacious SRH technologies that have the greatest likelihood of use will have\n      the greatest impact on women's health. Critical to use is \"acceptability.\" However, current\n      conceptualizations of adherence and acceptability fail to fully articulate and account for\n      patterns of use and non-use. This research hypothesizes that a new model of use, Effective\n      Use, is required. If correct, and if developers utilize an Effective Use model, a shift from\n      the current \"acceptability = adherence\" paradigm would offer new insights in the development\n      of SRH technologies that will result in increased use and improved SRH outcomes. If the\n      model can be fully realized, women will have the best reproductive health technologies\n      science can provide. The impact on global public health would be far-reaching, affecting\n      reproductive health in women and men: decreasing STI incidence, minimizing unplanned\n      pregnancies, and decreasing morbidity and mortality due to a range of other reproductive\n      health conditions.\n\n      Conditions: There will be 2 experimental conditions: sexual lubricant use and contraceptive\n      use. Each participant will use 3 different SRH products for 3 months each. The sexual\n      lubricant use condition will include gel, film, and capsule. The contraceptive use condition\n      will include gel, intravaginal ring, and oral contraceptive pill. The order in which\n      participants experience each delivery method will be randomized.\n\n      Methodology and Data Collection: Volunteers (N~20-30) will first be screened for the study\n      using a brief questionnaire.  Those who are interested in contraception and are eligible\n      based on their responses to the prescreen will then complete a clinical screening visit\n      (contraceptive arm only) and pregnancy test. Those who are interested in lubricants and are\n      eligible based on their responses to the prescreen, and those who are eligible after\n      clinical screening (contraception arm), will complete a survey that asks questions about\n      demographics and sexual and reproductive history.\n\n      During the course of the study, participants will evaluate three study products\n      (contraceptives OR sexual lubricants). Each product will be used for three consecutive\n      months. Participants will be randomly assigned to the order in which they will try the three\n      products. They will be given (lubricants), or prescribed (contraceptives) a three month\n      supply of the product at the beginning of each use period. Participants will be required to\n      complete a brief phone survey (<5 minutes) every day, beginning the day after they start\n      their first product evaluation period and continuing until they complete their final study\n      visit (approximately 9 months). The phone survey includes a short set of questions about\n      sexual behavior and product use during the time since the last phone survey (about 24\n      hours). About once a month, each participant will be required to complete a web survey about\n      their experience with the study product.\n\n      Every three months, participants will meet with research staff and, if necessary, the study\n      clinician. All participants will be tested for pregnancy, and will be given, or prescribed,\n      the next study product. Participants will also complete an individual in-depth interview\n      with study staff about their experiences in the study. Participants will repeat these steps\n      for the final (third) study product. After a participant has tried all three products, she\n      will meet with a clinician (contraceptive arm only) to follow up clinically about her\n      contraception options post-study participation. All participants complete a final survey\n      that will ask about their experiences with all three study products, and about what kinds of\n      products, if any, they might be interested in using in the future.  Participants will also\n      complete a final in-depth interview."
