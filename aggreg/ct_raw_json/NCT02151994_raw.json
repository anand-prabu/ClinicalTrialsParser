If the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) had not been reached after completing\n      the 8 originally planned sequential groups, additional groups could be included to a maximum\n      of 12 sequential groups in total. Although the MTD was not reached, it was deemed sufficient\n      by the Sponsor to include only 1 additional group. The FE part consisted of 12 healthy young\n      male subjects each receiving a single dose of BIA 5 1058 in either the fed or fasted state\n      in an open-label, two-way crossover design. Each treatment was separated by at least 7 days.\n      The MAD part consisted of 5 groups of 8 young healthy male subjects each receiving an oral\n      dose of BIA 5 1058 or placebo (6 verum and 2 placebo) once-daily (QD) for 10 days. If the\n      MTD had not been reached after completing the 4 sequential groups originally planned,\n      additional groups could be included to a maximum of 8 sequential groups in total.
