            "textblock": "Adolescents and young adults who are living with cancer are not benefiting from the same\n      age-appropriate physical and psychosocial care, as are children and older adults. As a\n      result, their unique needs often go unmet or unaddressed. Studies have demonstrated that a\n      lack of age-appropriate care may be responsible for a deceased quality of life. Studies have\n      also shown that physical activity is able to reduce many of the negative side-effects linked\n      to cancer and its treatment (e.g., nausea, vomiting, fatigue). A light form of physical\n      activity that is both safe and manageable for cancer patients is yoga. The purpose of this\n      study is to examine the achievability and safety of a light 7-week home/hospice-based Hatha\n      yoga program (available on DVD) in the adolescent and young adult non-curative cancer\n      population. This study will also examine the ability of yoga to reduce cancer related side\n      effects."
