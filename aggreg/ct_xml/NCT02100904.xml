      The ULTRA Registry is a nationwide observational arm of the ULTRA trial. Data from the ULTRA
      Registry will be used to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of laparoscopic RF
      ablation.

      The ULTRA Registry will recruit women age 21 or older who plan to undergo or have undergone
      laparoscopic RF ablation within the United States. Participants will be recruited through
      study materials distributed at clinical offices across the country where gynecologists are
      performing laparoscopic RF ablation. Study participants will consent to participate in a 3
      year prospective study conducted by UCSF but the laparoscopic RF ablation surgery will be
      performed by the study participants' own gynecologist. We will evaluate changes in
      fibroid-related symptoms from pre-treatment values to 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months after
      RFA. We will determine long-term efficacy of RFA by evaluating the rate of re-treatment for
      symptomatic fibroids after the RFA procedure. Participants will be asked for permission to
      review their medical records to assess surgical and pregnancy outcomes. The gynecologists
      performing the laparoscopic RF ablation surgery will be asked to consent to complete a brief
      study questionnaire with information on demographics, work history, professional training,
      and practice setting.

      UC San Francisco will have oversight of all scientific and administrative aspects of the
      study. All study data will be stored securely in a HIPAA compliant, secure database
      monitored by the UC San Francisco Coordinating Center.
