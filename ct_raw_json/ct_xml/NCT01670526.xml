  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Difficulties with intellectual functioning, particularly memory functions, are common and
      source of long-term disability after Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). However, there is very
      little information about pharmacologic (i.e., medication) treatments targeting these
      deficits.  There are growing data showing brain abnormalities in acetylcholine, the chemical
      system that manages memory, in TBI. These findings provide the rationale for the use of
      cholinesterase inhibitors, medications that modulate this system, in TBI patients.  As the
      prevalence of TBI among Veterans of recent military conflicts increases, becoming a
      &quot;signature injury&quot; of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, it is of utmost importance to the
      Veterans Health Administration to collect scientific data on the efficacy of pharmacological
      treatments for intellectual difficulties in TBI patients.  This study will evaluate the
      effects of the cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine transdermal patch in Veterans with TBI
      and posttraumatic memory problems. Results will provide much needed data that will help
      treat Veterans with TBI.

    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents one of the most significant health risks related to
      military duty; rapidly becoming the &quot;signature injury&quot; of the Iraq and Afghanistan
      conflicts. TBI patients often experience multiple cognitive problems, with disturbances in
      memory, attention, and executive functions among the most common. Disturbances in memory as
      well as attention are particularly problematic, as disruption of these relatively basic
      cognitive functions may exacerbate or cause additional disturbances in executive function,
      communication and other more complex cognitive domains.  These cognitive deficits,
      especially when memory is affected, significantly impact day-to-day functioning and are the
      source of lingering disability and distress to the affected individuals. However, despite
      advances made in TBI care, treatment of cognitive deficits in TBI lag behind, forcing
      clinicians to provide treatment without the guidance of evidence-based scientific data. This
      proposal aims to begin the process of providing clinicians with evidence-based guidelines
      for pharmacological management of Veterans with TBI suffering from persistent cognitive
      deficits following their injuries. This aim will be accomplished by conducting a clinical
      trial in Veterans suffering from moderate to severe posttraumatic memory impairment
      following TBI. Specifically, this proposal will evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      rivastigmine transdermal patch, an intermediate-acting cholinesterase inhibitor, in this
      population.

      We hypothesize that rivastigmine transdermal patch will be more effective than, and equally
      safe as, placebo in the treatment of moderate to severe posttraumatic memory impairment in
      Veterans with TBI when tested in a randomized, multi-site, parallel design,
      placebo-controlled trial, at a 12-week endpoint. The exploratory hypothesis states that
      compared to placebo, rivastigmine patch will be more effective and equally safe in the
      treatment of patients who will continue in a randomized, placebo-controlled phase for a
      total of 26 weeks.  To test these hypotheses we will evaluate the effect and the safety of
      rivastigmine 9.5 mg/24 hours (10cm2) transdermal patch in 256 Veterans who meet or exceed
      the criteria for closed, non-penetrating, mild TBI and who present at baseline with moderate
      to severe memory impairment. Memory impairment will be defined as a Total Recall index
      (Trials 1-3) of the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) that is at least 25% lower
      than the intelligence-adjusted expected score, as assessed by the WAIS-IV Information and
      Vocabulary subtests. The study consists of a screening period, one-week single-blind,
      placebo run-in phase, and a 12-week double-blind acute treatment phase (Phase I). Subjects
      will be randomized 1:1 to rivastigmine transdermal patch 9.5mg/24 hours (10cm2) or matching
      placebo. During Phase I, there will be an initial 4-week titration period followed by an
      8-week continuation phase. Following the 12-week acute treatment phase, randomized patients
      will continue in the double-blind phase (Phase II) for additional 14 weeks or until study
      treatment period ends. Efficacy will be determined by comparing the proportion of patients
      in each treatment group who are classified as responders at week 12. Secondary measure of
      functional capacity  assessing the impact of memory improvement on real-world functioning,
      other measures of  cognitive domains affected in TBI, namely attention, working and episodic
      memory and executive functions, as well as measures of mood and quality of life will be
      examined.  Study findings will contribute to the body of evidence needed to establish
      standards of care for Veterans with posttraumatic memory impairment and other cognitive
      deficits.
