            "textblock": "Prostate cancer is the most common solid tumor in American males and the most common\n      malignancy among men in Western industrialized countries.  Widespread testing for early\n      detection of prostate cancer utilizing digital rectal examination and prostate specific\n      antigen (PSA) has led to a significant clinical conundrum.  Differentiating organ confined\n      indolent disease from aggressive cancer has been imperfect.  Nonetheless, increased\n      detection has led to increased radical prostatectomies.  A prevailing goal of the\n      contemporary, ardent research seeks to discover a molecular biomarker for prognostication.\n\n      Given the limitations of the current knowledge of the molecular pathology of prostate\n      cancer, there are several viewpoints regarding the process of tumorigenesis.  However, a\n      generally accepted hypothetical model describes normal prostatic epithelium progressing to a\n      pre-malignant or low-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN).  Then, after further\n      genetic alterations, a succession of histologically apparent adenocarcinoma--first confined,\n      then metastatic, and finally refractory to hormone treatment ensues.  Current molecular\n      research has shown already complex genetics alterations at the high-grade prostatic\n      intraepithelial neoplasia stage.  Thus, invasive disease represents amplification or further\n      aberration of precursor events.  The seminal event or events have not been recognized and\n      the undiscovered tumor suppressor gene or proto-oncogene may be a principal tumor marker.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to identify specific, shared, consistent, chromosomal\n      rearrangements found in metaphase preparations for short-term cultures of pathologically\n      identified and scored primary prostate tumors.  These, tumor specimens will be obtained from\n      patients enrolled in protocol (97-C-0147) by the NCI.  Fresh tumor, taken from bi-valved\n      specimens with one half undergoing tissue pathology, will be immediately placed in growth\n      media and transferred as a coded specimen as a sample from patients selected and enrolled in\n      protocol (97-C-0147).  Informed consent will be obtained by participating investigators in\n      the NCI protocol.  The outcome measurement will be the characterization, or failure of\n      characterization, of specific, shared consistent, chromosomal rearrangements.  Current\n      molecular cytogenetics technologies, primarily utilizing chromosomal microdissection, will\n      be employed toward this goal.  Ultimately, this research may help to focus further molecular\n      studies towards the ultimate goal of finding a unique, cancer specific alteration."
