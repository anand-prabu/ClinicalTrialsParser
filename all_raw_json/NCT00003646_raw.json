Demonstrate an objective clinical response (partial or complete) with a\n      median duration of at least 4 months in 15% of patients with stage III or IV melanoma\n      treated with Allovectin-7. Allovectin-7 is a direct gene transfer immunotherapeutic agent.\n\n      II.  Determine the benefits, risks, and side effects of Allovectin-7 in this patient\n      population.\n\n      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive an intratumoral injection of\n      Allovectin-7 once weekly for 6 weeks.  At week 9, a complete disease status assessment is\n      performed. Patients with stable or responding disease may receive additional courses of 6\n      injections.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:\n\n      A total of 70 patients will be accrued for this study."
