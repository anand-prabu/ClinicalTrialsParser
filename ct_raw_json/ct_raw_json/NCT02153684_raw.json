The Physiology\n      platform will support the other CRRN platforms (biology, imaging, population health,\n      knowledge transfer) by providing a comprehensive characterization of the nature and extent\n      of physiological impairment of respiratory function in smokers at risk for airways disease\n      and in those with early or mild airway obstruction. The planned studies of the physiology\n      group (core sites located at Queen's University, University of British Columbia and McGill\n      University) will initially focus on smoking-related lung injury in those at risk for COPD\n      and in those meeting spirometric criteria for mild airway obstruction, with or without\n      respiratory symptoms. The primary aim of this initial study is to identify and validate\n      sensitive test(s) of peripheral airway dysfunction that may qualify as physiological\n      biomarkers for use in future CRRN studies."
