            "textblock": "Permanent pacemakers are a common treatment for slow heart beats. In the UK 300,000 people\n      have a pacemaker, and each year another 36,000 receive them. All of these patients are\n      usually seen yearly to have their device checked. However, pacemaker technology is now very\n      reliable, batteries last well over 5 years, and many patients require their pacemaker only\n      occasionally as a back-up. Each visit costs around \u00a3200 such that pacemaker follow-up cost\n      the NHS around \u00a350million per year. Most visits involve checking the battery and the leads\n      which, in the absence of symptoms might be unnecessary.\n\n      Pacemaker patients are at risk of developing other problems including heart failure which\n      puts them at higher risk of hospitalisation and death. For those under follow-up, no\n      mechanism exists to identify whether they might have heart failure, and for those receiving\n      new implants, it is unclear which will go on to develop heart failure. Also, whether optimal\n      heart failure treatment with a multidisciplinary team reduces the chances that they will be\n      hospitalised is also unproven.\n\n      Our study therefore has three main aims: 1) based on pacing indications and patient factors,\n      to identify which patients are likely to develop complications and therefore which patients\n      could be seen less frequently; 2) to validate and refine a simple risk score to help\n      identify which patients in pacing clinic should undergo screening for heart failure; and 3)\n      to establish whether such screening and subsequent optimisation of those with heart failure\n      is clinically and cost-effective for reducing hospitalisation and death."

            "textblock": "Permanent pacemaker implantation is a safe, life-prolonging and cost-effective treatment for\n      bradycardia. An estimated 300,000 people in the UK have a pacemaker and there are 36,000 new\n      implants per year. Complications from pacemaker implantation occur in 5-15% of patients,\n      mostly in the first six weeks. After six months new problems are very rare. Clinic follow-up\n      of patients with a PPM usually occurs at six weeks, three months and then annually to\n      monitor battery performance. Reprogramming is rarely required, and batteries reliably last\n      at least five years. The tariff for pacemaker follow-up is \u00a3200 costing the National Health\n      Service (NHS) \u00a350 million per year.\n\n      The commonest and most under-recognised long-term complication of pacemaker implantation is\n      pacemaker-related chronic heart failure (CHF) due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction,\n      seen in up to 50% of patients. Published data examining the incidence and associations of\n      pacemaker-related cardiac dysfunction consist of retrospective cross-sectional analyses or\n      data taken from other studies rather than a-priori planned analyses. Our unique pilot data\n      in almost 500 patients show that cardiac dysfunction is present in 40% of all pacemaker\n      patients and confirm previous suggestions that it is more common in patients with an\n      underlying predisposition, for example cardiovascular co-morbidities (including diabetes\n      mellitus), with high rates of pacing and atrial fibrillation. Our data also demonstrate that\n      patients with cardiac dysfunction and a pacemaker are not usually taking optimal medical\n      therapy for their heart failure and suffer a 13% annual combined heart failure\n      hospitalisation or death rate (compared to 6% in pacemaker patients without cardiac\n      dysfunction, and ~8% in patients with CHF attending the Leeds Integrated Heart Failure\n      Service). However, since patients with pacemakers were often excluded from the large studies\n      of medical (and device) therapy of CHF, it is unclear whether optimisation of medical (and\n      pacemaker) therapy in patients with pacemaker-related cardiac dysfunction can reduce\n      mortality and hospitalisation. Pilot data from our clinic in 25 patients with a pacemaker\n      and CHF, show that optimised medical therapy can lead to similar improvements in cardiac\n      function as in CHF patients without a pacemaker.\n\n      The present project therefore includes three distinct, but closely related, work packages\n      which will answer three questions;\n\n        1. in patients receiving their first pacemaker, which clinical and pacing variables\n           predict short, medium and long-term complications and is it therefore feasible, safe\n           and cost-effective to individualise follow-up intervals;\n\n        2. can we confirm and validate our previous observation that a model consisting of simple\n           clinical and pacing variables identifies pacemaker patients at higher risk for cardiac\n           dysfunction during a pacemaker-follow-up appointment and;\n\n        3. does applying our risk model with subsequent optimisation of medication and pacemaker\n           programming within a multidisciplinary heart failure service in those with heart\n           failure lead to cost effective and clinically relevant reductions in mortality and\n           hospitalisation?"
