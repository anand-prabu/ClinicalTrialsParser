  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to develop imaging based methods to accurately determine  the
      energy absorbed (absorbed dose) by tumor tissue and bone marrow after radioimmunotherapy
      with I-131 tositumomab . The administration of the radioactive, iodine-131 labeled,
      monoclonal antibody I-131 tositumomab, (also known as Bexxar) is part of the patient's
      clinical treatment protocol. For the absorbed dose measurement, investigators at the
      University of Michigan are evaluating a new Nuclear Medicine SPECT/CT imaging system .  This
      new camera combines a CT imaging system in addition to a Nuclear Medicine SPECT scanner.  CT
      scans allow the doctors to see a high quality picture of your internal organs.  The Nuclear
      Medicine SPECT scanner allows the doctors to see the uptake of the radioactive I-131
      including the tumor sites. The improved imaging using the SPECT/CT enables more accurate
      calculation of the energy absorbed by tumor tissue and bone marrow.  Using the results from
      these calculations and clinical follow up data, the researchers will investigate the
      relationship between the absorbed dose to the tumor and the patient's tumor response as well
      as the relationship between the absorbed dose to the bone marrow and the bone marrow
      toxicity. These relationships can potentially be used in the future by doctors to help
      determine how much radioactive I-131 to administer to each patient to get optimal results.
