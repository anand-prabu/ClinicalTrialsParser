  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscular dystrophies are caused by mutations in more than 30 genes, some of them remaining
      to be identified. Phenotypically, it is known that one specific mutation can affect the
      expression of several other proteins, causing difficulty in diagnosis. Correct genotyping is
      essential for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment, and relies on a complexed analysis of
      muscle tissues for phenotype profiles. Our research aims to understand how different gene
      mutations affect expression of other genes via muscle biopsy samples and establishment of
      phenotypic profiles for correct diagnosis of individual patients.  Establishment of such
      information will be critical for understanding the progression of different muscular
      dystrophies and to devise new experimental therapies.  The research will also provide vital
      clues for finding new genes involved in the disease process. Muscle samples may also be used
      to establish cell cultures for testing drugs and new therapies relevant to the treatment of
      the muscular dystrophies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  subjects with or without muscular dystrophy who will be undergoing a diagnostic or
             therapeutic procedure that involves the removal of a sample of skeletal muscle
             tissue.

          -  subjects with or without muscular dystrophy who have had a previous skeletal muscle
             biopsy performed and where a portion of the muscle sample remains in medical storage
             are also eligible for this study.
