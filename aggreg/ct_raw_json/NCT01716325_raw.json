One\n      group of patients will visit conventional live workshops for weight loss and the other group\n      will use ICT. At the initial examination by the doctor all survey participants will have\n      measured blood pressure, body mass, waist circumference, percentage of body fat, percentage\n      of skeletal muscle, resting metabolic rate, estimated risk of developing cardiovascular\n      disease and will be directed to laboratory examination (blood lipids and cholesterol, blood\n      sugar). Both groups will go through 16 workshops for weight loss. Each week they will\n      monitor their body mass, waist circumference, physical activity (type, duration, intensity)\n      and food intake (type, quantity). After six months all survey participants will be examined\n      again. We will compare effectiveness of ICT weight loss group with conventional weight loss\n      group."
