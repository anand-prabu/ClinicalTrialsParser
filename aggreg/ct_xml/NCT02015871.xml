  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is an open-label, multi-centre, single arm extension for the 000006 trial in
      Chinese patients with prostate cancer. Eligible patients will receive monthly (28-day
      intervals) maintenance doses of 80 mg (20 mg/mL) degarelix administered by subcutaneous
      (s.c.) injection for a period of 2 years from first visit in this extension trial. Patients,
      who received goserelin treatment in the main trial, will get a degarelix starting dose (240
      mg; 40 mg/mL) at the first visit and continue on degarelix treatment. The purpose of this
      2-year extension trial is to collect long-term safety and tolerability data for the
      one-month dosing regimen.
