Data from obstetrics and orthopedic surgery literature have\n      shown a decreased risk of wound separation and complications when the skin is closed with\n      suture as compared to staples. Skin closure with either staples or suture is considered\n      standard of care. Traditionally, most wounds have been closed with staples given their ease\n      of use and quick application. In this randomized study the investigators plan to evaluate\n      and compare the complication rate associated with both standard closures."
