In the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, patients receive a second 12-week course\n      beginning at week 16.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-9\n      months."
