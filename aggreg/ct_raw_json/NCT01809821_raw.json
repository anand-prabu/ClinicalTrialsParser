Previous studies have\n      reported that poor quality sleep is associated with an increased risk of hypertension,\n      stroke and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Hypertension is the most common and important risk\n      factor for CVD, and even modest reductions in blood pressure result in significant\n      reductions in stroke and myocardial infarction. In this randomised trial, the investigators\n      aim to evaluate whether a simple, multi-component, online sleep intervention reduces blood\n      pressure in patients with essential hypertension."
