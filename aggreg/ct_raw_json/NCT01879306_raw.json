Previous clinical studies demonstrate that the Abraxane/Bevacizumab combination\n      offers clinical benefit (measured as progression free survival).  Patients in this study\n      will be randomized to either ipilimumab or Abraxane/Bevacizumab as first line therapy for\n      their melanoma.  At the time of tumor progression, patients will have the opportunity to\n      cross over to the other treatment if eligible."

To assess whether the combination nab-paclitaxel (paclitaxel albumin-stabilized\n      nanoparticle formulation) and bevacizumab (AB) prolongs progression-free status relative to\n      ipilimumab as a 1st line treatment in patients with unresectable stage IV melanoma.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To estimate the hazard of death among those randomized to AB then ipilimumab relative to\n      those randomized to ipilimumab then AB as first line treatment in patients with unresectable\n      stage IV melanoma.\n\n      II. To assess whether tumor response rate (as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in\n      Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria 1.1) differs with respect to 1st treatment course.\n\n      III. To estimate whether the tumor response rate differs with respect to 2nd treatment\n      course for those who progressed during their first treatment course.\n\n      IV. To further examine the safety profile of each of these regimens.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To examine the pharmacokinetics of nab-paclitaxel when combined with bevacizumab therapy.\n\n      II.

Patients experiencing progressive disease may cross-over to Arm B within 2-4\n      weeks.\n\n      ARM B: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21\n      days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n      Patients experiencing progressive disease may cross-over to Arm A within 2-4 weeks.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 5 years."
