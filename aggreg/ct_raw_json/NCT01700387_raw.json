This pilot study\n      will examine the degree to which subjects are able to tolerate and are satisfied with a\n      migraine preventive medication in addition to onabotulinumtoxinA over an extended period of\n      time and the effect of the subjects' quality of life compared with onabotulinumtoxinA as a\n      single therapy.  It will also assess short and long term effects of these two treatments on\n      cognition.  Cognitive performance will be measured by the Mental Efficiency Workload Test\n      (MEWT), a repeated measures handheld neuropsychological test battery that measures mental\n      efficiency via 4 sub-tests (Simple Reaction Time, Running Memory, Continuous Performance\n      Task, Matching to Sample, and Mathematical Processing) to demonstrate short and long term\n      changes in mental status compared to their baseline.  The Controlled Oral Word Association\n      Test (COWAT) will be used to test verbal fluency and screen for anomic aphasia, a known side\n      effect of several migraine prophylactic medications including topiramate.\n\n      Visit 1 - Screening / Baseline Following Informed Consent a medical, headache, and\n      medication history will be collected and a physical and neurological exam performed on all\n      subjects.  A urine pregnancy test will be collected from any subject of child-bearing\n      potential.  Vital signs and ECG (at the discretion of the investigator) will be completed.\n      The Mental Efficiency Workload Test (MEWT) will be administered 3 times to establish a\n      cognitive efficiency baseline. The COWAT will be completed. Subjects will be instructed\n      regarding completion of the online 1-month Baseline Period Migraine Diary and be instructed\n      to treat headaches during the 1-month Baseline Period with their usual acute migraine\n      medication in their usual manner.\n\n      Visit 2 - Randomization / Injection Following the 1-month Baseline Period, any change in\n      medical or medication history since the previous visit will be collected and a pregnancy\n      test collected if appropriate.  Vital signs will be recorded.  Subjects continuing to meet\n      eligibility criteria will be instructed to complete the online Treatment Period Migraine\n      Diary daily.
