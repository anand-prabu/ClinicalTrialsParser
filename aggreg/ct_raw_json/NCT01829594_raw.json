The second and third was general and specific information related to the participants' situation. The fourth part included aspects of continuity and safety. The PT also paid home visits and made an assessment regarding physical function and balance. The intervention consisted of multidimensional prevention of falls and/or consequences of falls, and supporting and motivating the participant to increased physical activity.
