            "textblock": "Background of the study: The sentinel procedure (SN) for surgically treated cervical cancer\n      is promising. Unfortunately, efficient and direct intra-operative SN localisation, without\n      an extensive retroperitoneal exploration, remains a challenge even with combined use of\n      patent blue dye en 99mTc. The draining lymph nodes are positioned around the retroperitoneal\n      pelvic vasculature, in close relation to the ureters and nerves innervating bladder, rectum\n      and sexual functionality (inferior hypogastric plexus, genitofemoral nerve, etc), which\n      makes exploration hazardous and time consuming. Furthermore, complete retroperitoneal\n      exploration often necessitates dissection of lymph vessels (to find the SN) which would have\n      been spared in a selective SN excision. The use of technetium-99m(99mTc) enables\n      preoperative SN mapping with SPECT(-CT) to localise SN and partly alleviate this issue. Some\n      clinics perform preoperative SPECT(-CT), despite its disadvantages of prolonged hospital\n      admission, radiation exposure, limited spatial resolution (SPECT) and the limited soft\n      tissue differentiation in the female pelvis (CT). The investigators postulate that Magnetic\n      Resonance (MR) Lymphangiography is a better technique for preoperative SN mapping in\n      cervical cancer. It allows for integration with regular work-up pelvic MRI and could make\n      SPECT-CT unnecessary.\n\n      Objective of the study: To study the concordance of sentinel node localization between\n      preoperative MR Lymphangiography and SPECT-CT SN mapping and the intra-operative sentinel\n      node procedure (patent blue and 99mTc) for low stage cervical cancer.\n\n      Study design: Prospective, feasibility type diagnostic study with the experimental test (MR\n      Lymphangiography) added to standard clinical care (SPECT-CT, intra-operative SN procedure).\n\n      Methods: 40 subjects targeted. Via a vaginal speculum exam 1ml of MR contrastmedium will be\n      intracervically injected peripheral of the cervical tumor at 3, 6, 9 and 12 o'clock (suspine\n      position). On a wide bore digital 1.5T MRI multiplanar T1w imaging is performed, followed by\n      a blinded review (experienced radiologist) for bilateral SN localization with a standardized\n      anatomical system. Standard procedure with a preoperative 220 MBq 99mTc SPECT-CT, a blinded\n      nuclear medicine specialist will localize the SN. Standard peri-operative care; under\n      general anesthesia 1ml injection of patent blue V in each of the four quadrants. Open or\n      (robot-assisted) laparoscopy performed for visual localization of the blue SN's.\n      Introduction of a gamma-probe and localization 'hot and blue' SN. For both methods\n      anatomical locations of the SN are registered. Excision SN for freeze sectioning and\n      histological review. Statistical analysis with intrapatient testing for concordance of\n      SPECT-CT and MR Lympangiography based SN localization against the reference standard: the\n      intra-operative sentinel node procedure (Patent blue and 99mTc)."
