Preliminary data gathered from HIV+ individuals that smoke cigarettes\n      strongly support the hypothesis that the combination of HIV infection and smoking creates\n      increased stress in the lower respiratory tract. To examine the underlying factors that\n      contribute to the accelerated development of emphysema in this cohort, samples from the\n      lower respiratory tract will be provided by HIV+ and HIV- subjects. The samples collected\n      will serve as biomarkers for assessing the onset of emphysema."
