Patients receive autologous lymphoma-derived idiotype vaccine plus keyhole\n      limpet hemocyanin subcutaneously (SC) on day 1. Sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC is administered on\n      days 1-4. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 4 doses, followed 12 weeks later by the fifth\n      and final dose.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study."
