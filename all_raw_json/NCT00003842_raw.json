II.\n      Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine preliminarily any\n      efficacy of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study. Patients undergo a stereotactic\n      biopsy under MR/CT guidance. Catheters are then placed into the tumor under stereotactic\n      guidance. The catheter is filled with IL-4(38-37)-PE38KDEL immunotoxin (IL-4 toxin), with\n      infusion beginning 24 hours after catheter insertion. The IL-4 toxin is infused over 4 days.\n      The catheter is removed 45 minutes after the infusion is completed and a MR scan is\n      performed. Cohorts of 3 patients each receive escalating doses of IL-4 toxin until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding the dose\n      at which 2 of 3 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 4\n      weeks for 16 weeks, then every 8 weeks for up to 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study."
