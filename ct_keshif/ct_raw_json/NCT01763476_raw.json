To date only a small number\n      of these patients could be helped through medication or surgery. In fact within the first\n      year following diagnosis of a critical limb ischemia 25% of patients lose their leg and 90%\n      have to undergo a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) or bypass surgery. Using PTA\n      for treatment of long infrapopliteal artery lesions, stenosis reoccurs in 70% to 80% of\n      cases 3 months after index procedure. Even the use of drug-eluting balloons leads only to\n      1-year primary patency rates up to 30%.\n\n      The primary objective of this study is to compare the performance of atherectomy followed by\n      a drug-coated balloon angioplasty over drug-coated balloon angioplasty alone in long de-novo\n      infrapopliteal lesions in a prospective, single-center, randomized clinical trial."
