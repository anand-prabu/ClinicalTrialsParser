Ten young men and ten elderly men will\n      underwent an isokinetic eccentric exercise session, which will be repeated after three\n      weeks. Muscle function indices and redox biomarkers will be assessed in urine, plasma or\n      erythrocytes pre exercise, immediately post exercise, 2 and 4 days post exercise."
