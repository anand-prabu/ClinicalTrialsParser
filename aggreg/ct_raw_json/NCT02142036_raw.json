Metastatic tumor harboring actionable targets or signaling pathways\n      may respond to inhibitory agents directed against specific aberrations irrespective of tumor\n      origin. In the MetAction study, patients will receive therapy based on molecular aberrations\n      in the metastatic lesions, actionable target identification (ATI), rather than on\n      histological tumor type.\n\n      The ATI rate in an unselected metastatic patient population is uncertain, and response rates\n      associated with single-agent ATI based targeted therapy have hardly been reported. In this\n      perspective, The MetAction study is essentially a feasibility study aiming to tailor\n      metastatic cancer therapy based on genomic profiles."

Thus, in the interest of the patient in question and the society in\n      general, it is important to give the right drug to the right patient and to the presumably\n      right time in the disease course.\n\n      Hitherto, most of the drugs in question are given in the palliative setting, i.e. to\n      patients with disseminated metastatic disease. The metastatic lesion may be very different\n      from the primary tumor, and hence, it is rational to analyze the tumor to be treated, the\n      metastatic lesion(s), for the presence of molecular aberrations, rather than basing\n      treatment decisions on molecular features known to be present in a particular tumor type or\n      in the primary tumor."
