Non-maltreated infants and their mothers are studied as a comparison\n      group.\n\n      Twelve-month-old infants and their mothers are assigned randomly (like tossing a coin) to\n      receive 1 of 3 types of intervention for 12 months: 1) Services normally available in the\n      community when a family is reported for child maltreatment (Child Protective Services, CPS);\n      2) CPS involvement plus weekly PHV; 3) CPS involvement plus weekly IPP.  Intervention will\n      be provided until the infant's second birthday. All mother-infant pairs (including\n      comparison non-maltreated infants and their mothers) will be assessed when the infant is 12,\n      18, 24, 36, and 48 months old.  Assessments will look at the effectiveness of the\n      intervention in preventing child maltreatment, improving parenting, and reducing future\n      abuse. The study will last for 3 years.\n\n      Eligibility includes a mother and her 12-month-old child that has been abused by her (the\n      mother) or the father. (Non-maltreated infants and their mothers also will be enrolled.)"

Non-maltreated infants and their mothers serve as a\n      comparison.\n\n      Maltreated infants and their mothers are randomly assigned to 1 of 3 types of intervention\n      for 12 months: 1) Services routinely available in the community when a family is reported\n      for child maltreatment (Child Protective Services, CPS); 2) CPS involvement plus weekly PHV;\n      3) CPS involvement plus weekly IPP.  Intervention is provided until the infant's second\n      birthday.  All mother-infant dyads (including comparison non-maltreated infants and their\n      mothers) participate in baseline assessments at the infant's age of 12 months.  Subsequent\n      assessments occur at 18, 24, 36, and 48 months of age.  Assessments measure three major\n      areas:  1) family-ecological variables; 2) maternal functioning and parenting; and 3) child\n      functioning and stage-salient issues.  CPS records are monitored annually across all groups\n      to determine whether any reports of maltreatment have been filed."
