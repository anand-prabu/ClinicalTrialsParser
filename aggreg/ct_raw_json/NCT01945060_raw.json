The algorithms are intended to\n      maintain your blood glucose level within a certain range. This is called Control-to-Range.\n      The algorithms are intended to maintain your blood glucose level within a certain range. The\n      algorithms run on a portable AP platform on an Android smart phone, called the Diabetes\n      Assistant (DiAs) Medical Platform.\n\n      In this study, researchers hypothesize that the heart rate informed Control To Range (hrCTR)\n      will limit the risk for hypo and hyperglycemia during and immediately after exercise in\n      adolescents 12 - 17 years of age and assess if the hrCTR will improve additional measures of\n      overall short term glycemic control in this population.\n\n      This trial will be performed at both Virginia Commonwealth University and the University of\n      Virginia. IRB approvals have been obtained at both institutions."
