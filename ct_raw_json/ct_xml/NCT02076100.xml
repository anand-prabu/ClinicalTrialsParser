  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-part study of MK-8408 for participants with hepatitis C infection.  Successive
      participants will be enrolled as dose levels are evaluated to find the maximum safe and well
      tolerated dose of MK-8408. Part I will be for participants with hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      genotype 3 (GT3) and will run first: Part II will be for participants with HCV genotype 1a
      (GT1a), and Part III will be for participants with HCV genotype 2b (GT2b). Parts II and III
      may run concurrently. The primary study hypothesis is that a safe and tolerable dose of
      MK-8408 that reduces viral load will be found to support further clinical investigation.
