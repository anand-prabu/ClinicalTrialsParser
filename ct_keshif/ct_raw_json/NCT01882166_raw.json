An important factor of success in treatment of infertility\n      is a short \"time to pregnancy\" with impact on both economical aspects for the society and\n      medical and psychological aspects for the couple. During treatment, success relies on 1)\n      optimal stimulation of growth and maturation of multiple follicles by administration of\n      exogenous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and 2) selection of the fertilized egg /\n      embryo with the highest potential of implantation to be transferred to the mother. In the\n      present project stimulation of egg production by human urine derived FSH (Fostimon\u00ae) and\n      recombinant FSH (Puregon\u00ae) will be compared. To this end early embryo development and\n      kinetics after fertilization will be evaluated. The system to be used is time-lapse\n      recording of embryo morphology during the first days of embryo development by means of an\n      embryoscope. Aim of this study is to investigate if Puregon and urinary Fostimon have\n      different effect on embryo quality. The hypothesis of the study is that stimulation of egg\n      production by these two types of follicle stimulating hormone does not have the same effect\n      on early embryo quality."
