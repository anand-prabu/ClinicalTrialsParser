    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety of a new biologic drug, RBX2660 (microbiota suspension) as
      a treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), which is the
      primary symptom of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection.  All eligible subjects will
      receive RBX2660.

    <textblock>
      This is the first study of a microbiota suspension derived from intestinal microbes.  The
      primary assessments for this open label, multi-center study are (i) occurrence of
      product-related adverse events and (ii) resolution of CDAD at 56 days after administration
      of RBX2660. Subjects will also be assessed for time to CDAD recurrence, quality of life
      changes, and number of hospitalizations and length of stay for recurrent CDAD.  Study visits
      will be at 7, 30, and 60 days after RBX2660 administration with additional follow-up at 3
      and 6 months post treatment. Patients who have had at least two recurrences of CDAD after a
      primary episode and have completed at least two rounds of standard-of-care oral antibiotic
      therapy or have had at least two episodes of severe CDAD resulting in hospitalization may be
      eligible for the study.
