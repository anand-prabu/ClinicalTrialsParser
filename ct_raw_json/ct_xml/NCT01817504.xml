  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is early and systematic transplantectomy under a well-conducted
      immunosuppression is associated with a decreased risk of anti-HLA immunization against a
      conservative attitude including a gradual reduction of immunosuppression, with or without a
      transplantectomy performed for cause  (clinical event).

      Observation or Investigation Method Used :

      The study is :

        -  multicenter

        -  prospective

        -  open

        -  randomized: patients are divided into two parallel groups:

             -  study group:  transplantectomy within six weeks after return to dialysis,
                antiproliferatives stop at the start of dialysis, Maintenance
                anticalcineurin-based-immunosuppression without dose reduction up to two weeks
                after transplantectomy. Abrupt discontinuation of anticalcineurin two weeks after
                transplantectomy. Corticosteroids: 5mg per day until one month after
                transplantectomy then stop within one month.

             -  control group: Nosystematic transplantectomy. Antiproliferatives stop at the start
                of dialysis.Anticalcineurins  half dose for 3 months, ¼ dose for 3 months and then
                stop. Corticosteroids:5 mg per day for 6 months, and then tapered and stop within
                3 months.

      In the case of transplantectomy for cause in the control group, immunosuppression will be
      continued at the maintenance dose during the current surgical procedure, and withdrawn two
      weeks later,similary to systematic transplantectomy.
