  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dysphagia is extremely common.  The importance of providing adequate nutritional support to
      persons with dysphagia is the cornerstone to exceptional care.  Diet modification with
      thickening agents is an essential aspect of this nutritional support.  The purpose of this
      investigation is to compare the efficacy of a starch based (Thickenup or TU) to a gel based
      thickening agent (Thickenup Advance or TUA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Swallowing problems (dysphagia) are encountered frequently in primary practice and in the
      hospital setting.  The list of possible causes is large, ranging from strokes and
      neurological disease to complications of cancer treatment, acid reflux, and surgery.  Many
      patients have a reduced ability to feel food and fluid (reduced sensation) within the throat
      (pharynx) and this leads to an inability to manipulate food and fluids in the correct
      manner.  This can produce a variety of swallowing problems such as choking on foods and
      fluids, regurgitation, aspiration, weight loss, malnutrition and poor quality of life.

      Treatment of dysphagia is largely directed at rehabilitation of muscle power and education
      about safe swallowing techniques or positioning that limits food and fluid from entering the
      airway. One of the most widely accepted treatments of dysphagia is to alter the texture of
      food. Most patients with dysphagia will have more difficulty swallowing thin liquids. By
      adding a thickener to the liquid, a food bolus becomes more cohesive, and is less likely to
      become aspirated. Various types of thickening products are available over-the-counter
      without a prescription. These thickening products are bland and currently have no flavor.
      The investigators hypothesize that alterations in food taste (sweet, salty, etcâ€¦), viscosity
      will improve swallowing efficiency. The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the
      effects of food taste, texture on swallowing efficiency. The goal is to develop safer,
      better tasting food products and improve the quality of life in patients with disabling
      swallowing disorders.

The patients are then studied in the anterior/posterior view with one 1-cc, one 3-cc, and one 20-cc bolus of thin liquid barium 1-4. At the end of the protocol patients are routinely administered products with either starch or gel based thickener to evaluate the swallowing safety of the thickened agent. The protocol includes a 3-minute limitation on total fluoroscopy time to ensure clinician and patient safety.</description>
