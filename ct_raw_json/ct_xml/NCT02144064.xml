      Objective To determine maternal and fetal outcomes in women with APS managed with aspirin or
      unfractionated heparin (UFH) plus aspirin during pregnancy.

      Design: prospective clinical controlled study. Setting: high-risk pregnancy unit- Benha
      university hospital. Methods: Pregnant women with recurrent miscarriage attending high-risk
      pregnancy unit. 140 selected patients with previous recurrent miscarriage are divided into 2
      groups: group A (n = 70)  receive low-dose aspirin (81 mg once daily orally) plus heparin
      (5000 IU) every 12 h with the ﬁrst positive pregnancy test while group B (n = 70)  receive
      no thing .

      Main outcome measures: Maternal outcomes included thromboembolic and haemorrhagic
      complications and pregnancy-induced hypertension .Prematurity, intrauterine growth
      restriction and neonatal death were considered as maternal and fetal complications

      This prospective comparative, controlled clinical study is conducted at Department of
      Obstetrics and Gynecology, Benha University Hospital, and a private center, from June 2012 .
      After approval of the study protocol by the Local Ethical Committee and obtaining written
      fully informed patients' consents. All patients are interviewed about their medical,
      personal, family, obstetrical and thrombosis history. All patients included in study
      complain of  three or more unexplained consecutive spontaneous abortions.

      All patients (n=140)  are in good general health without previous history of Diabetes
      Mellitus or thyroid dysfunction or cardiac disease. Patients with Thrombocytopenia
      (&lt;100000/ml), bleeding tendencies, ectopic pregnancy, past history of vascular thrombosis
      ,uterine anomalies and multiple gestation are excluded from the study.

      complete  blood  picture, urine routine examination, blood sugar, blood grouping, Bleeding
      Time, Clotting Time, Prothrombin Time, Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time, Hepatitis B
      Surface Ag, Hepatitis C Virus screening are offered to all patients and findings noted as
      soon as they conceived. All patients are given routine Folic Acid, Iron and Calcium
      supplementation orally daily during antenatal period (whether conceived spontaneously or
      with treatment

      140 selected patients with previous recurrent miscarriage are divided into 2 groups:Group A
      (n = 70) are put on Inj. UFH (Cal-heparin) 5000 U subcutaneous twice daily plus Aspirin 81
      mg/day (Juspirin)  with the ﬁrst positive pregnancy test, Inj. UFH is given either into
      anterior abdominal wall or anterior aspect of thigh subcutaneously. While group B (n = 70)
      receive no thing
