Patients receive\n           rituximab IV again on day 7 followed by IDEC-Y2B8 IV over 10 minutes.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of IDEC-Y2B8 until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 3 of 6 patients experience\n      dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n        -  Phase II: Once the MTD is determined, 58 additional patients are treated at that dose\n           level as in phase I.\n\n      Patients are followed at 6 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and\n      then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 78 patients (20 for phase I and 58 for phase II) will be\n      accrued for this study within 2 years."
