Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) has been recognized as an alternative\n      for CRC screening in average risk subjects, but less information is available on its\n      performance in FDRs.\n\n      Aims: To prospectively assess the accuracy of CTC as a screening tool in FDRs using\n      colonoscopy (OC) with segmental unblinding as reference standard.\n\n      Methods: Consecutive patients admitted with CRC diagnosis (index case, IC) were\n      prospectively evaluated. Following the systematic identification of ICs with inherited\n      predispositions to CRC, ICs who agreed to contact their FDRs \u226540 years old were included.\n      Available FDRs were invited to undergo non-cathartic CTC, with OC the following day.\n      Sensitivity/specificity/PPV/NPV of CTC was assessed for detecting subjects with any lesion\n      \u22656 mm, \u226510 mm, and for advanced neoplasia \u22656 mm."
