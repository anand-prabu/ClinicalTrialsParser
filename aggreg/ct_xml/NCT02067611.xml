    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double blind (with dose), placebo controlled,
      parallel group, proof of concept, and dose range finding study to evaluate the efficacy,
      safety, and PK of X0002 spray in adult subjects with clinically symptomatic mild to moderate
      OA of the knee.

      Objectives of the study:

        1. To evaluate the efficacy of X0002 spray compared to placebo for relief of knee pain in
           subjects with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee;

        2. To assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of X0002 when administered as a
           topical spray.

      This is a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double blind (with dose), placebo controlled,
      parallel group, proof of concept, and dose range finding study to evaluate the efficacy,
      safety, and PK of X0002 spray in adult subjects with clinically symptomatic mild to moderate
      OA of the knee.

      After a screening period of up to 3 weeks and radiographic evaluation of the target knee
      joint space, 225 subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1
      ratio with a 2:1 ratio of active:placebo within each treatment group in a 1:1:1 ratio with a
      2:1 ratio of active:placebo within each treatment group (i.e., 2 subjects to active
      treatment and 1 subject to placebo):

      Group A: 8.75 mg X0002/knee (2 sprays/knee, one spray to the medial surface and one spray to
      the lateral surface of the knee), twice daily (BID, approximately every 12 hours; n=50) or
      placebo (2 sprays/knee), BID (approximately every 12 hours; n=25) for a total of 4 sprays
      per knee per day; Group B: 17.5 mg X0002/knee (4 sprays/knee, one spray to the medial
      surface and one spray to the lateral surface of the knee, and one spray to front and one
      spray to the back of the knee), BID (approximately every 12 hours; n=50) or placebo (4
      sprays/knee), BID (approximately every 12 hours; n=25) for a total of 8 sprays per knee per
      day; Group C: 35 mg X0002/knee (8 sprays/knee, each spray is to be applied to a different
      non-overlapping area around the knee, and the areas are to be uniformly distributed around
      the knee), BID (approximately every 12 hours; n=50) or placebo (8 sprays/knee), BID
      (approximately every 12 hours; n=25) for a total of 16 sprays per knee per day.

      Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed at at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment.

    <description>The Primary Efficacy Endpoint is change from Baseline in the WOMAC (VAS) pain subscale score for the target knee at 4 weeks of treatment, and will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Treatment will be included as a fixed class effect and WOMAC Baseline pain subscale score as covariates. The primary comparisons of interest will be the difference between active Group A (8.75 mg X0002/knee) and combined placebo, active Group B (17.5 mg X0002/knee) and combined placebo, and active Group C (35 mg X0002/knee) and combined placebo.
Safety analyses will be conducted on the SAS. Safety parameters will be listed and summarized using standard descriptive statistics, as appropriate. No formal statistical analyses are planned.</description>

          -  A subject who has OA of the knee with a Kellgren Lawrence Grade ≥3 as determined by
             the Investigator or a local radiologist at Screening

          -  A subject who has a history of total or partial knee replacement, arthroplasty, or
             other knee surgery on either knee

          -  A subject who has had significant injury, as judged by the Investigator, involving
             the target knee within the 6 months before Screening.

          -  A subject who has skin lesions or wounds on or near the knees to be treated at
             Screening or on Day 1 prior to the first administration of study medication

          -  A subject who has used opiates or corticosteroids within 30 days before Screening or
             who requires treatment with chronic opiates or corticosteroids

          -  A subject who has had intra articular injections of corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid,
             or viscosupplements (eg, Synvisc®) to a knee to be treated within the 3 months before
             Screening.

          -  A subject who has a history of significant hypersensitivity, intolerance, or allergy
             to ibuprofen, any NSAIDs, aspirin, or acetaminophen

          -  A subject who has had an active peptic ulceration in the 12 months prior to Screening
             or a history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding within 5 years of Screening

          -  A subject who has used an anticoagulant (except aspirin up to 325 mg/day for cardiac
             prophylaxis) in the month prior to Screening

          -  A subject who has positive results on fecal occult blood testing at Screening or on
             Day 1 prior to the first administration of study medication

          -  A subject who has a history of chronic inflammatory disease (such as rheumatoid
             arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gouty arthritis), fibromyalgia, conditions that may
             affect the target joint (eg, osteonecrosis, chondrocalcinosis), or asthma.
