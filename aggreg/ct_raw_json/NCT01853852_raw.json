This study, MGM115806,\n      will be the first administration of GR181413A/AT1001 to Japanese subjects to investigate the\n      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single oral doses in healthy Japanese adult\n      subjects. Approximately 12 subjects will receive three treatments of 50, 150 and 450 mg\n      GR181413A/AT1001 under fasted conditions plus placebo in a dose ascending crossover design.\n      Serial pharmacokinetic samples will be collected and safety assessments will be performed\n      following each dose. The pharmacokinetics and dose proportionality of GR181413A/AT1001 after\n      single oral doses of GR181413A/AT1001 at the dose levels of 50, 150 and 450 mg under fasted\n      conditions will be assessed."

A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters\n             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if\n             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to\n             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.\n\n          2. Male or female between 20 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the\n             informed consent.\n\n          3.
