  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevention in School (PS) is a modified School-Wide Positive Behavior Support  Program at
      the universal prevention level, developed by Swedish researchers for the school years 4 -9.
      By defining and teaching school rules to all teachers and students, and by consistently
      acknowledging students when meeting behavioural expectations, the program aims to reduce
      problem behaviours in school areas and to improve the classroom learning climate. Against
      this background, the purpose of this study is to examine whether PS is more effective than
      schools' ordinary practices in meeting these goals.
