  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to investigate whether intake of approximately 200 ml of sugary
      fluid 2 hours before the scheduled gastroscopy of the abdomen can reduce the discomfort of
      fasting period for patients without reducing the quality of the study.

      Current standard for fasting and fluid intake before gastroscopy is completely fasting 6
      hours before the study. Studies in patients in general anesthesia has been found that it
      does not increase the risk of aspiration of stomach content during the operation by allowing
      the patient to drink up to 2 hours prior to anesthesia induction. There are no studies that
      have examined the quality gastroscopy using this fasting procedure. Some studies show that
      intake of sugary liquids do not have significant effect on gastric emptying.

      There are not deemed to be ethical problems with this study, as it seeks to show that a more
      lenient standard procedure in endoscopy is as safe as the established. The study is
      considered safe.
