  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that SPS is more effective than placebo control (alternative hypothesis)
      in lowering i-STAT potassium levels in subjects with i-STAT potassium levels between 5.0 -
      6.5 mmol/l versus no difference between SPS and placebo control (null hypothesis).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 46 subjects with mild to moderate hyperkalemia (i-STAT potassium levels between
      5.0-6.5 mmol/l, inclusive) will be randomized 1:1 in a double-blind fashion to receive
      placebo or SPS (15g), administered tid with meals for 48 hours. Subjects will come back to
      the clinic on Study Day 9 for an End of Study (EOS) visit.

      Blood potassium levels will be evaluated by both i-STAT and the Local Laboratory prior to
      the first dose on Study Days 1 and 2, 1, 2, and 4 hours after the first dose on Study Day 1,
      1 and 4 hours after the first dose on Study Day 2 and prior to breakfast on Study Day 3,
      after 48 hours of treatment.

      Subjects who have i-STAT potassium levels &gt; 6.5 mmol/l on Study Day 1 at the 4 hour post
      Dose 1 time point will be withdrawn from the study and will receive standard of care. If the
      i-STAT potassium value is between 6.1 and 6.5 mmol/l at the 4-hour post Dose 1 draw,
      subjects will be kept in the clinic for another 90 minutes post Dose 2 and another blood
      draw will be taken and an ECG will be performed. If the i-STAT potassium level is ≥ 6.2
      mmol/l at this time point, the subject will be discontinued from the study and standard of
      care will be instituted. If the i-STAT potassium level is &lt; 6.2 mmol/l, and the ECG does not
      show any of the ECG withdrawal criteria (see below), the subject will continue in the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provision of written informed consent.

          -  Over 18 years of age.

          -  Mean i-STAT potassium values between 5.0 - 6.5 mmol/l inclusive, at screening (Study
             Day 0).

          -  Previous participation in Clinical ZS-002 or ZS-003 protocol(s). However, subjects
             cannot be enrolled in this study until at least 30 days have elapsed from their last
             dose in study ZS-003.

          -  Ability to have repeated blood draws or effective venous catheterization.

             contraception (at least one barrier method) and have a negative pregnancy test at
             screening.
