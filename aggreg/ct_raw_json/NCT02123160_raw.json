It is the only treatment for\n      preschool aged children and caregivers that seeks to affect changes at both behavioral and\n      schematic/ cognitive levels. The investigators aim to assess the feasibility and\n      acceptability of providing CPP as a dyadic preventive intervention for children who are\n      displaying signs of emotional and behavioral difficulties in the context of maternal\n      depression.\n\n      Investigators will compare the effectiveness of CPP to that of usual care (usual care\n      defined as: referral to therapists in the community and within Columbia University Medical\n      Center for psychoeducation, counseling/ therapy for maternal depressive symptoms, and child\n      behavioral/ emotional difficulties) in improving maternal depressive symptoms and child\n      emotional and behavioral problems. The investigators will recruit mothers who report being\n      mildly to moderately depressed and their preschoolers (aged 3-5 years) who they are\n      concerned are exhibiting emotional and/or behavioral problems.\n\n      Mother-child patient dyads will be screened via telephone to assess study eligibility. If\n      eligible mothers and their children will complete an in-person pre-treatment assessment.\n      After the Time 1 (pre-treatment) assessment, mother-child patient dyads will be randomly\n      assigned to  one of two treatment conditions - 1. six months of weekly CPP intervention\n      sessions OR 2. control condition in which mothers and their children will be referred for\n      usual treatment in the community. Random assignment will be done based on a pre-determined\n      schedule (a random number generator will be used to create a schedule for patient treatment\n      assignment). Following randomization mother-child patient dyads will complete the following\n      assessments: Time 2 (after 12 sessions or an average of three months), Time 3 (after 24\n      sessions or an average of six months), and Time 4 (six months after 24 treatment sessions or\n      an average of one year after Time 1). All assessments will be conducted by a licensed\n      clinician in conjunction with a research assistant.\n\n      Mothers (30 in each group) will be recruited through the Women's Program and pediatric\n      practices affiliated with Columbia University Medical Center, including the Columbia Center\n      of the New York Presbyterian Hospital, as well as its satellite center, the Allen Pavilion,\n      and the Children's Hospital of New York.
