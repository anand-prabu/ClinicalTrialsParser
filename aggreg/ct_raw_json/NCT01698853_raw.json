However,whether the arterial oxygenation status from different parts of the body\n      are the same in the condition of retrograde perfusion have not been studied.\n\n      The present study is aimed to determine if there is difference in the arterial oxygenation\n      between peripheral arterial and aortic root during the period of retrograde perfusion.In\n      addition, the impact of artificial ventilation on the difference of arterial oxygenation\n      will also be investigated."
