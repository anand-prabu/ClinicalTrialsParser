By blocking the \"bad\" proteins, the tumor-fighting genes may\n      be able to work better."

If you miss or vomit your dose of ruxolitinib, do not make up the\n      dose.\n\n      Beginning with Cycle 4, on Days 1-5 (+/-6 days) , you will receive azacytidine either under\n      the skin or through a needle in your vein.\n\n      Your dose of ruxolitinib and/or azacytidine may be raised, lowered, and/or delayed if the\n      doctor thinks it is in your best interest.\n\n      You will be given a drug diary and asked to write down what time you take the study drugs.\n      Bring in any unused study drugs and bottles to each study visit.\n\n      Each cycle is 28 days.\n\n      B. For patients with myelodysplastic syndrome:\n\n      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take ruxolitinib 2\n      times every day by mouth. If you miss or vomit your dose of ruxolitinib, do not make up the\n      dose.\n\n      Beginning with Cycle 1, on Days 1-5 (+/-6 days) , you will receive azacytidine either under\n      the skin or through a needle in your vein.\n\n      Your dose of ruxolitinib and/or azacytidine may be raised, lowered, and/or delayed if the\n      doctor thinks it is in your best interest.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      Each study visit may be performed at +/- 7 days than the day stated.\n\n      On Day 1 of Cycles  1-7, Day 1 of Cycle 9, and Day 1 of Cycle 12 and Day 1 of Cycle 13\n\n        -  You will be asked if you have had any side effects.\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.\n\n        -  Your spleen and liver will be measured.\n\n        -  You will complete 2 questionnaires about how you are feeling.\n\n      On Day 1 of Cycles 1-6 and then every 3 cycles, your complete medical history will be\n      recorded.\n\n      A. Patients with myelofibrosis or myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm will\n      have blood draws once a week during Cycles 1, 2, 4, and 5, every 2 weeks during Cycles 3 and\n      6, and then 1 time each month after that. Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for\n      routine tests.\n\n      After Cycles 6 and 12, you will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the\n      disease. Routine blood draws and  bone marrow biopsies may be done more or less often if the\n      doctor thinks it is in your best interest.\n\n      B. Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome will have blood draws twice a week during Cycles\n      1, 2, 4 and 5; every week during Cycles 3 and 6; and every 2 weeks after that. Blood (about\n      2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. After Cycles 3, 6, 9, and 12, you will\n      have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the disease. Routine blood draws and\n      bone marrow biopsies may be done more or less often  if the doctor thinks it is in your best\n      interest.\n\n      Research Blood Tests:\n\n      Extra blood  will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing and pharmacodynamic (PD). PK\n      testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points. PD testing\n      measures how the level of study drug in your body may affect the disease.\n\n      Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for PK testing:\n\n        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 1, before you receive the study drug, and then 1, 2, and 5 hours\n           later\n\n        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 6, before you receive the study drug, and then 1, 2, and 5 hours\n           later\n\n        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 12 (or at the end of study if you go off study early), before you\n           receive the study drug, and then 1, 2, and 5 hours later\n\n      Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for PD testing:\n\n        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 1, before you receive the study drug and then 2 hours later\n\n        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 3, before you receive the study drug\n\n        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 6, before you receive the study drug and then 2 hours later\n\n        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 9, before you receive the study drug\n\n        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 12 (or at the end of study if you go off study early), before you\n           receive the study drug and then 2 hours later\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You can take up to 15 cycles of ruxolitinib and 12 cycles of azacytidine. After 15 cycles of\n      ruxolitinib, if your doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you may continue taking it\n      off study. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if\n      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.\n\n      You will be called about 30 days after you go off study and asked if you have had any side\n      effects and/or any new treatment(s).\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Ruxolitinib is FDA approved and commercially available to\n      treat myelofibrosis. Azacytidine is FDA approved and commercially available for\n      myelodysplastic  syndrome. The combination of ruxolitinib and azacytidine to treat\n      myelofibrosis and myelodysplastic  syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm and myelodysplastic\n      syndrome is investigational.\n\n      Up to105 participants will be enrolled in this study.  All will take part at MD Anderson."
