      Evaluate subjects in an prospective randomized controlled trial in which subjects will be
      administered scientifically validated questionnaires to determine the effect of the
      education and case management by Respiratory Therapists (RTs) on improvements in: health
      outcomes and quality of life as primary endpoints

      Utilize:  Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ)

      The secondary endpoints will be:  Rate of exacerbation's, Health care utilization (emergency

      Evaluate subjects in an prospective randomized controlled trial in which subjects will be
      screened and administered scientifically validated questionnaires at study entry and during
      the observation period at specified intervals to determine the effect of the education and
      case management by Respiratory Therapists (RTs) on improvements in health outcomes and
      quality of life as primary endpoints, utilizing the Chronic Respiratory Disease
      Questionnaire (CRQ). The secondary endpoints will be rate of exacerbation's and health care
