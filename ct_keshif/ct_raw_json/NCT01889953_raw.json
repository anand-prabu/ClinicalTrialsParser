Patients who\n      undergo PTBD usually require multiple procedures for stent exchange/upsize. Our initial\n      study will be a prospective multicenter feasibility study that will include patients with\n      inoperable distal biliary obstruction who have failed ERCP. If feasibility is demonstrated,\n      our goal will be to compare EGBD and PTBD in a randomized multicenter international trial\n      with a crossover design."
