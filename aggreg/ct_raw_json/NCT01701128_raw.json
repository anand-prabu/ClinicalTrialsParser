The rationale for a study of this type stems from\n      the hypothesis that treadmill training may act as an external \"pacemaker\" and enhance some\n      properties of gait. There is a need for larger scale randomized controlled trials comparing\n      the effects of treadmill training to control groups that receive similar amounts of\n      attention. To date, no study has combined TT and muscle strengthening, likely the optimal\n      form of therapy. A kinesiologist supervises the training, 3 times per week, for a total of\n      72 one-hour exercise sessions. It is hypothesized that at the end of 6 months, treadmill\n      training will considerably improve walking parameters and the well being of people with PD."
