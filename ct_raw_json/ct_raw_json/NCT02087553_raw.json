Patient families will be approached prior to or when consent for transfusion is obtained. A member of the clinical team that is not a study member will approach the family and ascertain whether the family is amenable to learning about study participation from a study member. Study subjects that are enrolled but don't actually receive a transfusion, therefore not qualifying for the study, are still considered enrolled in the study but counted as screen failures."

Red blood cells can be refrigerator stored for up to 42\n      days by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. Furthermore, it is known that red\n      blood cells stored for longer durations are damaged upon storage resulting in poor red cell\n      survival upon transfusion. The investigators' hypothesis is that the storage-damaged red\n      cells are responsible for some of the adverse effects of transfusion. In this observational\n      study, the investigators will measure various laboratory parameters both before and after\n      transfusion in a pediatric intensive care unit to determine at what duration of storage is\n      there laboratory evidence of refrigerator storage-damage."

            "textblock": "Transfusions of red blood cells (RBCs) stored for longer durations are associated with\n      adverse effects in hospitalized patients. During storage, RBCs undergo cumulative changes\n      that reduce their survival in vivo, and have been associated with impairment in oxygen\n      transport and adverse outcomes. Transfusion of older RBCs results in increased\n      non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) levels in healthy adults, and elevated NTBI levels have\n      been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Transfusion\n      of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) has also been associated with up-regulation of in\ufb02ammatory\n      cytokines. Pediatric patients are exposed to PRBC transfusions; however, this patient\n      population has not been previously studied for these outcomes. According to current practice\n      guidelines, PRBCs are stored in the Blood Bank up to 42 days prior to transfusion. In this\n      study, consenting pediatric ICU patients will have a blood sample collected prior to every\n      PRBC transfusion and again 2-6 hours post-transfusion to determine iron parameters,\n      in\ufb02ammatory marker concentrations, and growth of microbial pathogens in vitro. We\n      hypothesize that increasing storage time of PRBCs transfused will be associated with\n      increasing NTBI, pro-in\ufb02ammatory cytokine concentrations, and enhanced microbial growth in\n      vitro in pediatric patients."
