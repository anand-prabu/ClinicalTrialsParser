HRM criteria for the\n      objective definition of tLESRs in GERD patients have to be established, as it has been done\n      in healthy patients Subjects will undergo impedance / manometry recording with solid-state\n      catheter systems, during a 30-min fasting and a 2-hour postprandial periods."
