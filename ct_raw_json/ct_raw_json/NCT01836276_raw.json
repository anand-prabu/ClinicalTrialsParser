These methods included nicotine gum, nicotine patch and\n      buproprion SR. This study will be evaluating varenicline in both AA and White smokers. There\n      has not been a study conducted yet to prospectively research AA-White differences in smoking\n      cessation and also to examine potential causal pathways explaining AA-White differences in\n      quitting."
