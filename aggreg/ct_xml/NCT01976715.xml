      Background:

      - The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
      Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs treat HIV infection. They generally decrease
      the amount of HIV virus in the blood (called viral load) to very low levels. This happens
      only if the drugs still fight HIV and if taken every day exactly as prescribed. When not
      taken as directed, or if the ART drugs are not strong enough, the virus can become
      resistant    to them, and the ART will not work to control the virus. Researchers want to
      know how to control HIV in people who can   t lower their viral load with their current ART
      drugs.

      Objective:

      -&lt; TAB&gt; To better control HIV in people who can   t get a lower viral load even with ART
      drugs and to learn more about why the HIV is not under control.

      Eligibility:

        -  People at least 14 years old and with HIV.

        -  People who have been on at least two combinations of ART drugs (including current ART).

        -  People whose last two viral loads were greater than 1,000 copies/mL.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.

        -  Participants will then have a baseline visit. They will have another physical exam,
           blood tests, plus answer questions about what they know about HIV and ART, and how they
           take their ART.

        -  Participants will arrange to stay in the NIH hospital for 7   8 days.

        -  They will take their medications as usual. At the time to take the ART drugs, they will
           have to ask a nurse to bring them. If they forget, the nurse will bring them.

        -  Participants will meet with a doctor, pharmacist, social worker and nurse to discuss
           ways to help participants remember to take their drugs.

        -  Participants will have blood drawn about every other day.

        -  Researchers will study the test results. Some participants will be put on different ART
           drugs. If that happens, participants will have another NIH hospital stay for 7-8 days.

        -  Participants will have 4 follow-up visits over 12 weeks, then every 3 months for 2
           years or more.

    <textblock>
      Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically improved survival in individuals
      with human immunodeficiency virus type1 (HIV-1) infection. Despite recent development of
      more potent regimens with fewer toxicities and lower pill burden, there remains a
      subpopulation of subjects who fail to achieve and maintain viral suppression while on
      treatment. Factors known to contribute to virologic failure include suboptimal adherence,
      drug resistance, suboptimal regimen potency, sequential introduction of single drugs to a
      failing regimen, and reduced ART exposure due to impaired drug absorption or pharmacokinetic
      drug-drug interactions.

      This is a natural history protocol with intensive observation intended to characterize and
      manage HIV-infected subjects who have documented virologic failure on their current regimen
      and who have experienced virologic failure on at least 1 prior ART regimen. We anticipate
      that, for a large proportion of the subjects enrolled in this protocol, nonadherence, with
      or without drug resistance, is the most common reason for the virologic failure. Another
      objective for the study is to assess the impact of a 7-day, inpatient, selfguided directly
      observed therapy (DOT) on HIV RNA kinetics, when subjects will receive their pre-enrollment
      ART regimens. During the DOT period, subjects will request their antiretroviral drugs at a
      pre-arranged time reflecting their home medication schedule. Failure to do so will be
      recorded and the medications will then be provided by the nursing staff. Adherence and
      psychosocial assessments will also be performed. Plasma concentrations from at least one of
      the antiretroviral drugs in the regimen will be measured on the first and last day of DOT to
      determine if suboptimal drug plasma concentration was a contributing factor to virologic
      failure.

      Within approximately 2 weeks, but no later than 4 weeks, after DOT (post-DOT phase), the
      research team will review the results from the HIV-1 viral load kinetics, current and
      cumulative genotypic and/or phenotypic resistance tests, ART history and responses, and
      other identified factors that could have contributed to the treatment failure (such as
      concomitant medications, history of antiretroviral AEs, and psychosocial barriers). The team
      will then design a new, individualized treatment plan for each subject. Subjects will either
      continue on their pre-enrollment ART regimen, or they will receive a new, individually
      tailored regimen. Only FDA-approved therapeutic agents will be offered on this protocol.
      Subjects may be co-enrolled in an experimental protocol for optimal management of HIV
      disease, if one is available and eligibility criteria are met. New regimens will be
      monitored during a second 7-day, inpatient, self-guided DOT. Subjects will be followed after
      the DOT at week 2 (plus/minus 3 working days), 4 (plus/minus 3 working days), 8 (plus/minus
      7 days), and 12 (plus/minus 7 days), and then every 3 months (plus/minus 2 weeks) for up to
      2 years, with the option of extending participation longer if necessary. The same treatment
      plan may be repeated if a subject fails to respond to a new regimen.

      In a select group of subjects who fail to achieve viral suppression, advanced HIV-1 variant
      analysis may be used to attempt to identify the presence of minority drug resistant
      variants. This analysis will be used as supplemental information to construct new  regimens
      for this group of subjects. Samples of plasma, serum, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      will be stored for further evaluation of virologic evolution and other factors that may be
      contributing to treatment failure in this population.
