Screening and surveillance colonoscopies were performed by\n      four academic and two community gastroenterologists. All diminutive polyps (defined as \u22645\n      mm) were endoscopically imaged and histology predictions (adenoma vs. non-adenomatous polyp)\n      were made using high-definition white light (HDWL) with/without narrow band imaging (NBI) at\n      the discretion of the endoscopist. Diagnostic performance and accordance of recommended\n      surveillance intervals from endoscopic imaging were compared to histopathological review of\n      the polyps."
