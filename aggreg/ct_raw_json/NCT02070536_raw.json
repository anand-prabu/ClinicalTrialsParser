            "textblock": "BACKGROUND :\n\n      ARDS is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Only few\n      pharmacological treatments are available, with limited evidence of efficacy.\n\n      The development of efficient preventive stategies is limited by the investigators inability\n      to predict which patients are likely to develop ARDS. The Lung Injury predicition Score\n      (LIPS) has been developed to identify patients at high risk for ARDS, but its predictive\n      value remains limited.\n\n      The receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE) is now identified as a marker of\n      alveolar type I cell injury. RAGE is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that acts as\n      a multiligand receptor which is involved in propagating inflammatory responses. Plasma\n      levels of sRAGE are correlated with clinical and radiologic severity in ARDS patients.\n\n      The investigators main objective is to assess the predictive values of plasma sRAGE and\n      esRAGE levels, as well as their evolution over the first 24 hours after admission, for the\n      onset of ARDS in high risk patients.\n\n      The secondary objectives are to :\n\n        -  to evaluate the predictive value of RAGE polymorphisms (_429 T/C, _374 T/A, 2184 A/G,\n           Gly82Ser) for the onset of ARDS\n\n        -  to evaluate the predictive value of maximal plasma levels of RAGE soluble forms for the\n           onset of ARDS\n\n        -  to test the relationship between RAGE polymorphisms and plasma sRAGE and esRAGE levels\n\n        -  to test whether serial sRAGE measurements would improve the discrimination of the LIP\n           Score or not\n\n        -  to evaluate the prognostic value of plasma levels of RAGE soluble forms for : duration\n           of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the ICU and 30-day mortality.\n\n      DESIGN  NARRATIVE :\n\n      The purpose of this prospective observational study is to test the values of RAGE\n      polymorphism and soluble forms plasma levels for ARDS prediction in high risk ICU patients"
