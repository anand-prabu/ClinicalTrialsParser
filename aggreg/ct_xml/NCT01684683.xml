  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Theophylline was well recommended in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) and asthma. However, there is no supporting evidence for their efficacy in the
      treatment of bronchiectasis. Our hypothesis is that theophylline will play a role in
      bronchiectasis. Our purpose is to examine the efficacy and safety of 24 weeks treatment with
      theophylline in subjects with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the reasons of lack of sufficient clinical trial evidences, there are no standard
      therapy recommendations for bronchiectasis. Currently the treatments for bronchiectasis are
      mostly based on experience gained from the treatment of COPD and cystic fibrosis(CF). The
      aims of treatment for bronchiectasis are to improve the health-related quality of life, to
      slow down the decrease of lung function, to reduce the exacerbation frequence and the
      mortality. The mechanism of treatment are including: treating the underlying disease;
      improving drainage of sputum; anti-infection; anti-inflammation; treating airway
      obstruction. A review written by Peter J. Barnes describes that as a bronchodilator in COPD,
      theophylline may relax human airways smooth muscle, have an anti-inflammation rols, and have
      an additional effect on mucociliary clearance. Besides, theophylline can improve the
      activity of histone deacetylase, which will reverse the resistant of corticosteroids. We
      hypothesis that theophylline will have the same effect in subjects with NCF-bronchiectasis
      as in subjects with COPD. Our trial may give an evidence of using theophylline in treatment
      of bronchiectasis.
