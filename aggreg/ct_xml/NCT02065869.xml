  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate pediatric patients with malignant or non-malignant blood cell
      disorders who are having a blood stem cell transplant depleted of T cell receptor (TCR) alfa
      and beta cells that comes from a partially matched family donor.  The study will assess
      whether immune cells, called T cells, from the family donor, that are specially grown in the
      laboratory and given back to the patient along with the stem cell transplant can help the
      immune system recover faster after transplant. As a safety measure these T cells have been
      programmed with a self-destruct switch so that they can be destroyed if they start to react
      against tissues (Graft versus host disease).

      This is a Phase 1/2 study evaluating the safety and feasibility of BPX-501 T cells infused
      after partially mismatched, related, TCR alpha beta T cell depleted hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HSCT) in pediatric patients. The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine
      whether BPX-501 infusion can enhance immune reconstitution and retain the graft versus
      leukemia (GVL) effect, with the potential for reducing the severity and duration of severe
      acute GvHD.  The trial will evaluate the treatment of GvHD by the infusion of dimerizer drug
      (AP1903) in those subjects who present with Grade III-IV acute GVHD, as well as those
      subjects with Grade II gut/liver GvHD or with Grade I/II GvHD (skin only) who progress or do
      not respond within 7 days to standard of care treatment.
