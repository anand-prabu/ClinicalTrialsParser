  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence to suggest that patients make different end-of-life decisions if they
      understand the risks, benefits and alternatives of CPR and mechanical ventilation.  This
      study will examine whether evidence-based informed consent impacts patients choices and
      healthcare outcomes compared to routine care.

    <description>Patients will be randomized to receive the intervention or routine care. The intervention is a scripted discussion (see addendum) AND a 3 minute video produced at Harvard for similar studies that depicts CPR and mechanical ventilation that will be delivered by study staff in the first 24 hours of admission. The video showing CPR and MV is open to the public and has been used in several similar published informed consent studies: http://www.acpdecisions.org/videos/generic-cpr/</description>
