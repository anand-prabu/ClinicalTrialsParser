However, many health care settings lack access to professional\n      interpreters, and even in locations with good access, logistical factors and perceived\n      barriers have limited their widespread use. Remote methods of professional interpretation,\n      including telephone and video, hold great promise for expanding access, but only limited\n      data exist on the relative impacts of these modalities on patient care and provider uptake.\n      Comparing how these modalities impact multiple aspects of health care quality, including\n      family comprehension, provider communication, and consistency of provider interpreter use\n      will inform dissemination of strategies for delivery of safe, efficient, and equitable care\n      to LEP families.\n\n      Aim 1: To determine whether randomly assigned remote interpreter modality (telephone versus\n      video) impacts parent-reported quality of communication and interpretation, diagnosis\n      comprehension, and length of stay (LOS) among LEP Spanish-speaking families seen in a\n      pediatric Emergency Department (ED).\n\n      Hypothesis 1: Parent-reported quality of communication and interpretation and parent\n      diagnosis comprehension will be higher among families assigned to video interpretation\n      compared to telephone interpretation.\n\n      Hypothesis 2: LOS will not differ between families assigned to video and telephone\n      interpretation.\n\n      Aim 2: To determine whether assigned interpreter modality is associated with provider\n      decision to communicate without professional interpretation.\n\n      Hypothesis 3: Parent-reported provider communication without professional interpretation\n      (e.g. using the patient or a family member to interpret for some part of the visit) will be\n      lower for families assigned to video interpretation compared to telephone interpretation."
