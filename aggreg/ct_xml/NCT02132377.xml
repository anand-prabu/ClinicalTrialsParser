  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of a cooking oil blend of dietary fats rich
      in medium chain triglycerides on energy expenditure and food intake in overweight and obese
      adolescents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the thermic effect of food following consumption of a dietary fat blend
      rich in medium chain triglycerides to corn oil in overweight and obese adolescents.  Thermic
      effect of food will be assessed over up to 6 hours following consumption of a breakfast that
      contains 20 g of the test fat.  Participants will be asked to rate their levels of appetite
      and satiety during the postprandial period and provide information on their prospective food
      intake.  Blood samples will be taken over a 3-hour period to assess appetite-regulating
      hormones and metabolites.

    <description>Measurement of thermic effect of food over 6 hours after a meal rich in test oil and control oil. The thermic effect of food is the difference between post-prandial energy expenditure and basal energy expenditure. We will assess the difference in thermic effect of food over a 6-hour period between the test oil and the control oil.</description>
