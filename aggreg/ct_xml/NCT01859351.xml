  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of escalating doses of the novel PI3K
      inhibitor WX-037 and to explore its effectiveness in combination with WX-554 which targets
      mitogen activated protein kinase (MEK1 and MEK2). Preclinical evidence indicates that these
      two novel compounds could provide targeted inhibition of both pathways to block tumour
      growth.

          -  Clinical significant, unresolved toxicity from previous anti-cancer therapy

          -  Patients who previously received a MEK inhibitor (for combination part only)

          -  Presence of active gastrointestinal disease or other condition that will interfere
             significantly with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs

          -  Known medical history of retinal vein occlusion, intraocular pressure greater than 21
             mm Hg or patient considered at risk of retinal vein thrombosis (combination part
