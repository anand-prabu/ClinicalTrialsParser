Active patients on the waiting list for single pancreas transplantation will be investigated while on the waiting list and subsequently 8 weeks and 1 year after transplantation if they have a functioning pancreas graft. A control group of healthy volunteers (non-diabetic, non-transplanted), frequency-matched for age and gender with regards to the pancreas transplanted patients, will be investigated once."

            "textblock": "Patients accepted for the waiting list for single pancreas transplantation suffer from\n      severe glucose instability with hyperglycemia due to diabetes type 1, but do not have\n      significant diabetes-related complications. Pancreas transplantation restores normoglycemia\n      in diabetes type 1 patients with unstable control of glycemia. Both hypo- and hyperglycemic\n      events are abolished, and 70-80 % of the patients obtain satisfactory HbA1c levels (HbA1c\n      5.0-6.0 %) without the need of exogenous insulin. Endothelial dysfunction is considered as\n      an early and potentially reversible stage in the atherosclerotic process. The endothelium is\n      involved in homeostasis, leucocyte adhesion and vasomotor activity. Reduced\n      endothelium-dependent vasodilation is associated with increments in cardiovascular risk\n      factors, and endothelial dysfunction is a predictor for future cardiovascular disease. It\n      has also been hypothesized that endothelial dysfunction may be involved in the impaired\n      glycemic control by reducing the availability of glucose in peripheral muscles.Establishing\n      normoglycemia by pancreas transplantation alone in previously diabetic type 1 patients has\n      recently been shown to improve left ventricular ejection fraction, assessed by Doppler\n      echocardiographic examination. In diabetic patients receiving a new pancreas it is possible\n      to assess the effect of changing blood glucose excursions on cardiovascular risk factors,\n      including endothelial function, without the use of antidiabetic drugs (exclude pleiotropic\n      effects).\n\n      The primary objective of the present study is to assess if endothelial function (assessed by\n      flow-mediated dilatation of arteria brachialis) is improved when hyperglycemia is reversed\n      by single pancreas transplantation in patients with type 1 diabetes.\n\n      Secondary objectives are to investigate the changes in the following parameters by reversal\n      of hyperglycemia by pancreas transplantation; Peripheral arterial tonometry, serum/plasma\n      concentrations of endothelial dysfunction markers, blood pressure, lipid and lipoprotein\n      concentrations."
