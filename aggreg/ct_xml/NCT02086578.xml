  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a radiation treatment called &quot;Multi-beam
      Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy&quot;(IMRT) can reduce side effects related to your
      implant. Currently, the standard way of giving radiation is with &quot;3D radiation&quot;, which only
      uses 2-5 beams of radiation. &quot;Multi-beam&quot; IMRT works by using 8-12 small radiation beams to
      give a more &quot;tailored&quot; or &quot;customized&quot; radiation dose to the implant, breast, chest wall and
      lymph nodes. At the same time, multi-beam IMRT may lower the radiation dose to the heart,
      lung and nearby tissues. The goal of the study is to reduce complications after irradiation
      to the implants.

      The study doctors have recently completed a trial using this technique and are now
      specifically looking at its impact on women with implant reconstructions who are undergoing
      post-mastectomy radiation therapy. By delivering a more &quot;customized&quot; dose of radiation to
      the implant, the intent is to reduce side effects of radiation on the implant.

    <description>The treatment would be considered efficacious if the incidence of implant failure is reduced by at least a relative 30% by the end of the study period (24 months post-IMRT for Group 1, and 30 months post-IMRT for Group 2).</description>
