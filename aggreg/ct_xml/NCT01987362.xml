  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TEN-010 is a small molecule, bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) bromodomain
      inhibitor.  This study is designed to characterize the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of TEN-010 in patients who are refractory or
      intolerant to standard/approved therapies.   This first-in-human study of TEN-010 will be
      conducted in two parts:  dose escalation and dose expansion.  For dose escalation (Part A),
      a standard &quot;3+3&quot; design will be used in which successive cohorts of three or more patients
      with advanced solid tumor malignancies will be treated at escalating doses until a maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is identified.  For the dose expansion part of the study (Part B), a
      subset of patients with advanced solid malignancies will be treated with TEN-010 at the MTD
      (or the highest dose tested if the MTD is not defined) to further characterize safety and
      biological effect.   In addition, up to 10 patients with nuclear protein in testis (NUT)
      midline carcinoma (NMC) will be permitted to enroll in a substudy of the protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 non-randomized, dose-escalating, open label, multi-center study to be
      conducted in two parts (Part A and Part B).  A maximum of 56 patients aged 18 years or older
      with histologically confirmed advanced solid tumors with progressive disease requiring
      therapy will be enrolled in the study.  It is expected that approximately 36 patients will
      be enrolled in 6 cohorts of up to 6 patients per cohort in Part A of the study and 20
      additional patients will be enrolled in Part B of the study.  Up to 10 patients with NMC may
      be enrolled as part of a substudy within the protocol.
