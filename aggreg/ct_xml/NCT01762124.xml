  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this early feasibility study is to determine how a new transcatheter
      pulmonary valve will move and perform once implanted in the right ventricular outflow tract.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medtronic, Inc. is in the process of developing a novel transcatheter device option for
      patients with congenital heart disease, without right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery
      conduits, called the Native Outflow Tract Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve. Given limitations
      in the animal model to confirm device boundary conditions, this feasibility study is
      proposed to characterize that information as well as evaluate safety, procedural feasibility
      and performance data to be used for future development of the device.
