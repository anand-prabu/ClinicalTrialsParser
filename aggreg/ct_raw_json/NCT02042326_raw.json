This serum level will be maintained throughout the duration of the study in the absence of side effects. In case of intolerance that do not justify the discontinuation of treatment, the dose may be reduced by maintaining a serum level greater than 3 ng/ml.\nThe starting dose will be 2 mg per day, and will be adapted every week for one month.\nThe preferred dosage form is tablet form. To prevent common side effects in early treatment, corticosteroids based prednisolone (SOLUPRED) will be established at a dose of 0.5 mg/ kg/day for the first week of treatment."

Sirolimus is primarily used in transplant\n      patients to prevent organ transplant rejection. Many animal and laboratory studies were\n      carried out and demonstrate in particular the activity of sirolimus on vessels. It is this\n      anti- vascular effect that could help treat arteriovenous malformations."
