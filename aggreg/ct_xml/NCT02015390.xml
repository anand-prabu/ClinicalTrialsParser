  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The United States Department of Defense (DoD) is funding exciting new research at the
      University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and
      Rehabilitation that can be a major improvement in the treatment of extremity trauma
      involving segmental bone loss. These devastating injuries occur frequently in both civilians
      and the military. They typically result from motor vehicle accidents, high-energy fractures,
      gunshot injuries, and blast injuries, but also from the surgical removal of a bone segment
      because of infection or tumor. Despite many modern medical advances in this area, bone
      healing that can adequately replace bone loss and restore pre-injury limb function is
      extremely difficult to achieve. Existing standard treatment procedures are exceedingly
      complicated, require highly specialized equipment and clinical skills, and usually require
      many surgical procedures over many months or years. Despite these effort and costs, major
      complications usually occur with all the standard treatment options, the patient's ability
      to return to an acceptable functional status is typically low, and, therefore, many of these
      patients have their limbs amputated.

      The UTMB Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Rehabilitation will conduct a DoD-funded
      clinical trial to determine and compare the advantages of two new and innovative surgical
      bone defect treatment techniques that can be significantly more effective for wounded
      warriors or civilian patients and with these conditions.  One treatment method, called &quot;the
      Masquelet Technique&quot;, involves two-stage surgery: the first one to create a biomembrane
      around the defect by applying a cement spacer, and then the second one for cement spacer
      removal and defect bone grafting. The other method, developed by UTMB physicians, is &quot;the
      Cage Technique&quot; and it comprises one-stage surgery in which a special hollow, fenestrated,
      titanium cage filled with bone graft is implanted in the defect. Initial clinical experience
      with both of these techniques has been very promising, but to date, there has been no
      prospective clinical study comparing the two new methods of defect treatment. Identifying an
      optimal surgical bone defect reconstructive technique would significantly improve the
      clinical outcomes of patients with these challenging conditions.

    <textblock>
      Background: Segmental long bone defects remain a formidable treatment challenge. All the
      existing standard treatment options have major limitations and often culminate in limb
      amputation or permanent functional deficits. We developed a novel, one-stage alternative
      treatment for segmental bone loss that utilizes the cylindrical titanium mesh cage (CTMC) in
      combination with bone graft, and have established its clinical merits in an initial clinical
      series. Shortly thereafter, Masquelet reported another new defect reconstruction technique
      that involves two-stage approach: first inducing biomembrane formation with a cement spacer,
      and subsequent spacer removal and bone grafting. Both the Masquelet and the CTMC techniques
      are based on the principle of graft containment to render optimal potential for graft to
      heal the defect; however, they differ in primary biological versus biomechanical functions
      provided by the containment. The Masquelet biomembrane containment, being a rich source of
      vascular supply and growth factors, creates an excellent biological milieu for graft, but
      requires an additional surgery and is associated with prolonged protected weight bearing
      until graft consolidation occurs. Conversely, the benefit of the CTMC technique is primarily
      the biomechanical support it provides for graft and the reconstructed extremity, thereby
      permitting immediate functional restoration without mobility or weight bearing restrictions
      during the bone healing process. Although both Masquelet and the CTMC techniques have been
      effective in the treatment of large segmental bone defects, there is no prospective,
      well-controlled study comparing their therapeutic efficacies for specific clinical
      indications.

      Objective: Determining the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the Masquelet (Arm I)
      versus the CTMC technique (Arm II) in combination with reamer-irrigator-aspirator (RIA)
      harvested autograft (Option A) or allograft-demineralized bone matrix (DBM) composite
      (Option II) in the treatment of segmental long bone deficiencies.

      Specific Aims: 1) Establish the effects of the specific patient and bone defect
      characteristics on the treatment outcome; 2) Determine and compare clinical efficacies of
      the reconstruction techniques (Arm I vs Arm II); 3) Establish the merits of using specific
      graft type (Option A vs Option B) within and across each study arms; 3) Develop a
      quantitative predictive model to improve clinical decision making, and 4) Assess and compare
      the cost-effectiveness and resource expenditures incurred by the specific treatment
      selection.

      Study Design: Single-center, multi-site, two-arm, randomized clinical trial. Thirty patients
      with segmental bone deficiency as a result of trauma, gunshot, iatrogenic resection due to
      infection, nonunion, or neoplasm will be enrolled and randomized to receive either the
      Masquelet (Arm I) or the CTMC as definitive defect treatment (Arm II). Bone graft selection
      will include either RIA-harvested autograft (Option A) or allograft croutons-DBM composite
      (Option B). Patients will be followed up to18 months. The data collected will include
      routine patient baseline information, systemic and extremity injury characteristics, bone
      defect characteristics, pre- and post-operative clinical examinations and imaging, validated
      functional outcomes measures, and associated cost expenditure. Descriptive statistics will
      be used to analyze and compare the results specifically related to the rate of defect
      healing and functional recovery. Paired t-test will be used to test the effects of the
      defect reconstruction option on the outcome measures. Analysis of covariance will be used
      for pair-wise comparison between the arms and within/across each bone graft option. Multiple
      models will be used to produce an accurate predictive model which accounts for possible
      morbidities and interactions. Derived from the joint distribution of costs and effects,
      cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be established and compared for the study arms.

      Military Relevance: Many combat injuries involve extremity trauma with segmental bone loss,
      and the extent to which they can be successfully treated impacts the function and quality of
      life of the wounded warrior. The Masquelet and the CTMC been developed as innovative,
      biologically-sound defect reconstructive techniques to address the complexity of therapeutic
      concerns associated with these conditions (ie, immediate restoration of limb
      alignment/stability, early motion, weight bearing). The proposed trial aims to compare the
      efficacy of these techniques to identify the one that can be instantly adopted and applied
      by military surgeons.

    <description>The Masquelet defect reconstruction is a two-stage technique for the treatment of large segmental bone defects that involves the induction of a biomembrane about a poly(methylmethacrylate)(PMMA) cement spacer within the defect and, following cement removal, autogenous bone grafting of the defect while preserving the biomembrane. The typical time interval between the two stages is 6-8 weeks. The biomembrane not only assists in retaining the bone graft, but serves as a rich source of vascular supply and growth factors which constitute an excellent biological milieu for the graft to consolidate and heal the defect.</description>
