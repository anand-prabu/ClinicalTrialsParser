The investigators will\n      investigate factors that have generally been ignored in prior computer-based cognitive\n      remediation programs\u2014those related to social cognition-- and will delineate their\n      relationship to motivation, functional outcome, and the neural substrates of reward\n      anticipation and emotion processing. Current research indicates that, unless the\n      investigators fully understand and harness these factors, the investigators will not achieve\n      meaningful treatment gains for individuals with schizophrenia."
