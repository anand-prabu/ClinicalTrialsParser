    <textblock>
      Pneumococcus is a group of bacteria that can cause pneumonia, meningitis and other diseases.
      These bacteria normally live in the nose of humans and are spread from person to person by
      touching or sneezing. There are vaccines available to protect against infection with these
      bacteria, and pneumococcus is currently the leading vaccine-preventable cause of death in
      young children. In countries where pneumococcal vaccine (PCV) has been introduced, there has
      been a big impact on the amount of disease caused by these bacteria. However, many
      countries, especially developing countries, are yet to introduce PCV as part of their
      routine immunizations. Currently a total of four doses of PCV is recommended, and the main
      barrier to vaccine introduction is cost. This study aims to identify a vaccination schedule
      to make PCV more effective and affordable for Vietnam and other developing countries.

      This study has two distinct purposes: 1) to compare different dosage schedules of PCV and 2)
      to compare different PCV vaccines.

        1. Schedules of Synflorix (PCV10) involving a three, two or one dose PCV primary series
           and two booster options will be compared. Comparisons will be made firstly in terms of
           measures of immunity to the vaccine, and secondly in terms of the effect of vaccination
           on the carriage of bacteria in the nose.

        2. The responses to PCV10 and Prevenar-13 (PCV13) will be compared, in the schedule most
           likely to be considered for global use. Again, comparisons will be made in terms of
           measures of immunity and effect on carriage in the nose.

      Infants aged two months will be randomly assigned to one of six study groups and will
      provide up to four blood samples for analysis of the measures of immunity and five nose
      swabs for analysis of carriage of bacteria. Infants will be followed up 8-9 times until the
      age of 18-21 months.

      The results of this study will be used to facilitate decision making, at global and national
      levels, regarding introduction of PCV.

      Introduction

      The overall purpose of this study is to investigate simplified childhood vaccination
      schedules that are more appropriate for developing country use. This study is specifically
      designed to address two independent questions within a single study:

        1. What is the optimal schedule for provision of EPI vaccines with the incorporation of
           PCV10? Schedules involving a three, two or one dose PCV10 primary series will be
           evaluated, timed around options for simplification of the Expanded Programme of
           Immunization (EPI) schedule for developing countries. A simplified schedule with the
           pneumococcal booster dose brought forward closer to the peak incidence of disease is
           likely both to increase compliance and vaccine effectiveness. A booster at nine months
           of age coincides with the usual time for administration of measles vaccine, whereas a
           booster at six months of age would provide earlier protection and may enable a further
           abbreviated 1+1 pneumococcal vaccination schedule.

        2. How do the responses to PCV vaccination with PCV10 or PCV13 compare? PCV10 and PCV13
           are the two PCVs available through the Advanced Market Commitment (AMC) mechanism, a
           mechanism that provides funds for vaccine introduction into developing countries.
           However, there have been no studies to date directly comparing these two vaccines.
           Directly comparing these two vaccines will provide useful information to countries
           considering introduction of PCV. There are important differences between these
           vaccines. PCV10 includes ten pneumococcal serotypes and PCV13 includes thirteen. PCV10
           uses a non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) Protein D carrier, which may confer
           protection against H. influenzae, and PCV13 uses a CRM197 carrier. It is of interest to
           know whether these vaccines differ either in their immunogenicity or their impact on
           nasopharyngeal (NP) carriage.

      Design

      Infants will be randomized to one of six study arms (A-F). All participants receive the
      standard number of doses of routine EPI vaccines and at least two doses of PCV. Arm A
      receives their routine vaccines according to the current EPI schedule in Vietnam and PCV10
      in a 3+1 schedule at 2, 3, 4 and 9m of age. Arm B also receives their routine vaccines
      according to the current EPI schedule in Vietnam and receives PCV10 in a 3-dose schedule at
      2, 3 and 4m of age, but with no 9m booster (3+0). Arm C receives both their routine vaccines
      and PCV10 in a 2+1 schedule at 2, 4 and 9m of age. Arm D receives their routine vaccines at
      2, 4 and 6m of age and PCV10 in a 1+1 schedule at 2 and 6m of age. Arm E receives both their
      routine vaccines and PCV13 in a 2+1 schedule at 2, 4 and 9m of age. Arm F, the control
      group, receives their routine vaccines according to the current EPI schedule and receives
      two doses of PCV10: the first at 18m of age, along with the routine booster doses of DTP and
      measles, and the second at 20m of age, in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations
      for unvaccinated children aged 12-23 months. Reactogenicity will be assessed following all
      vaccination visits through the use of diary cards.

      Each participant will provide five NP swabs for analysis of the NP carriage outcomes, at 2,
      6, 9, 12 and 18m of age. Participants from arms A-E will provide four blood samples over the
      course of the trial for analysis of vaccine responses, and participants from arm F will
      provide one blood sample at 18m of age. Bld 1 (arms A-E) will be taken four weeks
      post-primary series; Bld 2 will be taken pre-booster (arms A, C, D and E) or at 9m of age
      (subset of arm B); and Bld 3 will be taken four weeks post-booster (arms A, C, D and E) or
      at 10m of age (arm B). An additional blood sample will be taken at: 18m of age for a subset
      of arms A, B, C, D and E; 2m of age for a subset of arm A; 6m of age for a subset of arms B
      and C; 9m of age for a subset of arm D; or 3m of age for a subset of arm E.

      Objectives

        1. What is the optimal schedule for provision of EPI vaccines with the incorporation of
           PCV10? The primary objective is to compare a 2+1 schedule at 2, 4 and 9m of age with a
           3+1 schedule at 2, 3, 4 and 9m of age, with a primary outcome of the immunogenicity of
           PCV10, four weeks post-primary series (Arm C vs. Arm A+B). Secondary objectives are to
           investigate an experimental 1+1 schedule at 2 and 6m of age (Arm D vs. Arm A+B and Arm
           D vs. Arm C), and to assess the impact of a booster dose on carriage (Arm A vs. Arm F
           and Arm A vs. Arm B).

        2. How do the responses to PCV vaccination with PCV10 or PCV13 compare? The primary
           objective is to compare a PCV13 schedule at 2, 4 and 9m of age with a PCV10 schedule at
           2, 3, 4 and 9m of age, with a primary outcome of the immunogenicity of PCV, four weeks
           post-primary series (Arm E vs. Arm A+B). Secondary objectives are to compare a PCV13
           schedule at 2, 4 and 9m of age with a PCV10 schedule at 2, 4 and 9m of age (Arm E vs.
           Arm C), and to compare the responses to a single dose of PCV13 or PCV10 (Arm E vs. Arm
           D).

      Other objectives are: to compare the response to measles vaccination at 9m of age when given
      alone (Arm B), with PCV10 (Arm A), or with Infanrix-hexa (DTP-Hib-HBV-IPV) plus either PCV10
      (Arm C) or PCV13 (Arm E); to examine the decline in pneumococcal antibody levels over time
      (Arm B); to describe the serotype profile of transferred maternal pneumococcal antibodies
      (Arm A); and to describe the early rates of carriage (Arms A-F).

      Sample Size

      The proposed sample size is 1200 with an allocation ratio of 3:3:5:4:5:4, resulting in arm
      sizes of: A=150, B=150, C=250, D=200, E=250, F=200. Sample size calculations were based on
      the primary outcomes for each of the two study questions: the post-primary series
      immunogenicity comparing 1) a two dose (Arm C) and three dose (Arm A+B) PCV10 primary series
      and 2) a two dose PCV13 (Arm E) and three dose PCV10 (Arm A+B) primary series. A
      non-inferiority margin of 10% difference in absolute risk (Arm A+B minus Arm C or Arm E), as
      used by regulatory authorities, is deemed clinically significant. The Farrington-Manning
      (1990) method was used for the sample size/power estimation, assuming one-sided 5% type I
      error. If the alternative hypotheses of non-inferiority are accepted for at least 7 out of
      10 serotypes, overall non-inferiority will be declared. The power for testing individual
      serotype hypotheses was calculated using PASS Software 2002. The power for rejecting the
      overall null hypothesis was estimated by simulation, using a tailor-made simulation program
      written for implementation in Stata with 10,000 replications. A sample size of 1200 results
      in &gt;99% power for rejecting the overall null hypothesis for each of the two study questions,
      allowing for 5% loss to follow-up at four weeks post-primary series.
