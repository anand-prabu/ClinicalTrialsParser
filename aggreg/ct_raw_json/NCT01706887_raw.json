The study address the consequence of a frequent genetic variation\n      leading expected to impact the function of Nedd4 and in turn, the ability of kidneys to\n      excrete salt intake. Our hypothesis is that the genetic variants of Nedd4.2 could constitute\n      a genetic predisposition to (or protection against) salt-sensitive hypertension."
