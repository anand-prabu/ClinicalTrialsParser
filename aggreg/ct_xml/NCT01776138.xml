  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to create a registry of older patients undergoing surgical
      and/or medical treatment for bladder cancer. The registry will record side-effect and
      outcomes related to the treatment using different surveys and biological measures.

      The primary purpose of this protocol is to create a registry of elderly patients with
      high-risk invasive bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy with or without preoperative
      chemotherapy.

      Secondary objectives will include an exploration of the association between functional
      status, surgical complications, and laboratory markers with complications and survival.  In
      addition, exploratory analyses may evaluate the association of expression of the senescence
      marker p16INK4a and the morbidity and mortality associated with treatment.

      Patients will be asked to complete a Geriatric Assessment (GA) and FACT-Bl serially over the
      course of the study in order to evaluate their functional status and quality of life during
      the course of treatment.  Additionally, complications will be tracked in an inpatient and
      outpatient setting using the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) complications
      grading system.
