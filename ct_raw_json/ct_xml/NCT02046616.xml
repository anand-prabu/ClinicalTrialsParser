      This open-label, single-arm study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of
      subcutaneously administered RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in monotherapy or in combination
      with methotrexate (MTX) or other non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)
      in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who are naïve to RoActemra/Actemra. Patients
      will receive RoActemra/Actemra 162 mg subcutaneously weekly for 24 weeks.
