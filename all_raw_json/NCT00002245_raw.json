Treatment duration is 24 weeks, and patients\n      serve as their own controls. The combination therapy is evaluated for safety, tolerability,\n      efficacy, and effects on body composition. The proportion of patients who attain plasma HIV\n      RNA below the lower limit of quantitation of the Roche Amplicor (less than 400 copies/ml)\n      and Ultrasensitive (less than 50 copies/ml) is measured at 24 weeks after starting therapy\n      with APV plus ABC plus 3TC."
