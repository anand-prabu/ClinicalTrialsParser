      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies resistance training and whey protein
      supplementation in increasing lean body mass in patients with prostate cancer receiving
      androgen deprivation therapy. Resistance training and whey protein supplementation may help
      improve quality of life in patients with prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation
      therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine feasibility of conducting a resistance training (RT) and supplementation
      program in this population, determine patient adherence and inter-patient variability, and
      estimate the necessary effect sizes for a larger study.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the effects of a high intensity RT program, with and without whey protein
      supplement (WPS), on lean body mass (LBM). Enhancing LBM will increase muscle strength,
      endurance, and physical function leading to improved quality of life.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the effects of a high intensity RT program with and without WPS on muscle
      strength, endurance, physical function, and quality of life.

      II. To examine changes in lymphocyte glutathione (GSH) and the pharmacodynamics of WPS with
      and without high intensity RT.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 arms. ARM I: Patients receive whole body
      high-intensity RT thrice weekly and whey protein supplementation orally (PO) daily for 12
      weeks.

      ARM II: Patients receive whole body RT as in Arm I.

      ARM III: Patients receive whey protein supplementation as in Arm I.

      ARM IV: Patients receive no intervention for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, patients may receive
      whole body RT as in Arm II.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
