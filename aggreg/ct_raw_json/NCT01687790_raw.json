Using the National Kidney Foundation\n             recommendations, a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) greater than 60 may safely\n             receive intravenous gadolinium-based MRI contrast. Those individuals with a GFR >30\n             and <60 can receive the contrast but at a reduced dose (typically half). Those with a\n             GFR <30 will not receive MRI contrast and will not undergo the exam. Breast MRI must\n             be done with contrast if evaluating for cancer. Several factors can affect the GFR\n             such as age, body size, creatinine, renal status and will be calculated from the\n             blood drawn. GFR is the final determinant and a creatinine greater than 1.6 usually\n             has a GFR that precludes a Breast MRI with contrast. The final determinant will be\n             the GFR."
