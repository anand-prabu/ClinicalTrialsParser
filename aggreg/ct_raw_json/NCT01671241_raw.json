Polyethylene occlusive skin\n      wrapping covering the infant's body up to the neck will reduce postnatal heat loss in very\n      preterm babies and represents the standard of care recommended by the International\n      Guidelines for Neonatal Resuscitation. The use of a polyethylene head cap will also reduce\n      heat loss 9 and its efficacy is comparable to that obtained with the wrap. However, the\n      proportions of hypothermic infants at NICU admission (temperature <34\u00b0C) in the wrapped\n      group (62%) as well as in the infants covered with a polyethylene cap (43%) remain high. The\n      combination of body and head protection with a polyethylene wrap needs to be evaluated\n      further. The investigators conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled trial in very\n      preterm infants to evaluate whether a polyethylene total body wrapping (body plus head)\n      prevents heat loss after delivery better than polyethylene occlusive wrapping."
