            "textblock": "Objective\n\n      Ionotropic glutamate receptors are ligand-gated ion channels responsible for most of the\n      excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). Based on\n      pharmacology, they have been grouped into three subtypes-NMDA, AMPA and kainate. In recent\n      years it has become apparent that the receptors do not function alone, but in the company of\n      auxiliary proteins that regulate their activity [1]. Some of these have been shown to\n      modulate AMPA receptor trafficking, gating and pharmacology and are classified as\n      transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins, or TARPs ( >=-2,  >=-3,  >=-4,  >=-5,\n      >=-7, and  >=-8). Genetic data indicate a possible role of TARPs in schizophrenia,\n      depression, epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and bipolar disorder [1]. In a preclinical\n      collaboration with Eli Lilly, we developed a promising radioligand, 18F-TARP252 to image\n      TARP  >=-8 using positron emission tomography (PET).\n\n      This protocol covers three phases:\n\n        -  Phase 1: kinetic brain imaging to quantify TARP  >=-8 in brain relative to concurrent\n           measurement of the parent radioligand in arterial plasma;\n\n        -  Phase 2: if 18F-TARP252 is successful in Phase 1, we will estimate the\n           radiation-absorbed doses by performing whole body imaging;\n\n        -  Phase 3: test-retest analysis of brain binding relative to concurrent measurement of\n           the parent radioligand in arterial plasma.\n\n      Study Population\n\n      Healthy adult female and male volunteers (n=22, ages 18 - 55) will undergo brain imaging. An\n      additional eight healthy volunteers will undergo whole body dosimetry analysis.\n\n      Design\n\n      For quantification of TARP  >=-8, 22 healthy controls will have brain PET imaging using\n      18F-TARP252 and an arterial line. Some of them will have a test-retest scan. Eight\n      additional subjects will have a whole body PET scan for dosimetry. For dosimetry, no\n      arterial line will be used.\n\n      Outcome Measures\n\n      To assess quantitation of TARP  >=-8 with 18F-TARP252, we will primarily use two outcome\n      measures: the identifiability and time stability of distribution volume calculated with\n      compartmental modeling. In test-retest study, we will calculate the retest variability. We\n      will assess whole-body biodistribution and dosimetry of 18F-TARP252 by calculating doses to\n      organs and effective dose to the body."
