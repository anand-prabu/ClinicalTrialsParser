These conditions initiate an inflammatory response characterized\n      by elevated inflammatory cell infiltrates and proinflammatory cytokines that lead to the\n      development of significant acute and chronic lung injury.\n\n      The study drug, rhCC10, is a recombinant version of natural human CC10 protein. Native CC10\n      is produced primarily by non-ciliated respiratory epithelial cells, called Clara cells and\n      is the most abundant protein in the mucosal fluids in normal healthy lungs.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and\n      anti-inflammatory effects of a single intratracheal (IT) dose of rhCC10 to intubated\n      premature infants receiving positive pressure ventilation for treatment of respiratory\n      distress syndrome (RDS) to prevent long term respiratory complications referred to as\n      bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and, more recently, as chronic respiratory morbidity (CRM;\n      asthma, cough, wheezing, multiple respiratory infections).\n\n      CC10 regulates inflammatory responses and protects the structural integrity of pulmonary\n      tissue while preserving pulmonary mechanical function during various insults (eg. viral\n      infection, bacterial endotoxin, ozone, allergens, hyperoxia). Together these properties\n      suggest that administration of rhCC10 may help to facilitate development of normal airway\n      epithelia and prevent the inflammation that leads to CRM in these infants.\n\n      This study is funded by the FDA Office of Orphan Product Development (OOPD)."

            "textblock": "Recombinant human CC10 protein (rhCC10) is a novel therapeutic agent used to prevent the\n      development of chronic respiratory morbidity (CRM; repeated respiratory infections, asthma,\n      re-hospitalizations) in preterm infants. Native CC10 is a natural anti-inflammatory and\n      immunomodulatory factor produced by Clara Cells in the lung and is the most abundant protein\n      in respiratory mucosa.  Animal data demonstrate that a single intratracheal dose of rhCC10\n      administered shortly after birth reduces lung inflammation (important biomarkers linked to\n      lung injury in preterm infants), promotes normal lung development, preserves lung\n      architecture, improves pulmonary function, suppresses the response to endotoxin and enhances\n      resistance to pulmonary infections. In preterm infants who die or develop lung inflammation\n      and subsequent bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), both the concentration and activity of CC10\n      are significantly reduced indicating that CC10 is essential for preventing lung injury and\n      promoting normal lung development. In a small phase I study, rhCC10 significantly decreased\n      several indices of pulmonary inflammation in the lungs of premature infants who were at risk\n      of developing BPD and associated CRM. The drug appeared to be safe, well-tolerated, and\n      reduce risk of re-hospitalization due to respiratory illness for 9-10 months after a single\n      intratracheal dose at the time of birth (0/11 rhCC10-treated infants vs. 3/6\n      placebo-treated). This supports the protective role of rhCC10 against damage from hyperoxia,\n      mechanical ventilation, inflammation, and infection in the immature lung. A more normal\n      airway epithelium will produce significantly more endogenous CC10, with both factors\n      contributing to enhanced resistance to infections, less asthma, and improved long-term\n      respiratory outcome. We propose to conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate rhCC10 in\n      extremely premature infants (<29 weeks gestation) for the prevention of BPD and CRM. This\n      will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation study in 88 premature\n      infants. A single intratracheal dose of study drug (rhCC10 or placebo) will be administered\n      to preterm infants receiving surfactant and mechanical ventilation for treatment of RDS.\n      Infants will be followed to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and short and long term\n      efficacy of this approach. Safety will be evaluated through serious adverse event (SAE) and\n      adverse event monitoring and by Bayley neurodevelopmental assessments at 18 months corrected\n      gestational age (CGA). Efficacy measurements will include the primary combined endpoint of\n      alive without evidence of CRM at 12 months CGA (defined by parental diaries and pulmonary\n      questionnaires) comparing rhCC10 treated to placebo controls. The availability of a therapy\n      which prevents lung injury, promotes lung development, and prevents serious respiratory\n      infections and asthma in high risk preterm infants would be a highly significant advancement\n      in care."
