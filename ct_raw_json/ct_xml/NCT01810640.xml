  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study's objective is to obtain preliminary data to test the hypotheses that
      percutaneous liver biopsy in brain death donors is safe and provides reliable histological
      information. Furthermore, that information when disseminated fully and widely many hours
      before organ recovery would not only decrease economic costs of wasteful recovery of livers
      that are not ultimately transplanted but also increase transplantation and decrease cold
      ischemia times of recovered livers.

    <description>Safety of bedside liver biopsy will be measured as the presence or absence of a composite outcome of: change in hemoglobin (gm/dL) from baseline of greater than 2, occurence of pneumothorax on right side observed on chest X-ray immediately after biopsy, and/or donor instability leading to expedited organ recover, and/or loss of donor organs attributed to the biopsy</description>

    <description>Using a 16 gauge Jamshidi biopsy needle, without image guidance, 3 passes will be completed to obtain core liver biopsies.  Biopsies will be placed on wet saline and processed via frozen sample in OCT compound in 5 micron slices and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for microscopic evaluation.  Slides will then be digitalized and shared on Donor.net.</description>
