Technical improvements of\n      surgical and anesthesic procedures have led many countries to implement alternative\n      surveillance procedures.  In France, it is mandatory that the persons in charge of\n      anesthetic surveillance (doctors or nurses) should be qualified in anesthesia.\n\n      In this study, the investigators aim to assess the feasibility and safety of a centralised\n      monitoring station outside of the operating rooms, as an alternative to the presence of 1\n      anesthetic nurse in each operating room."
