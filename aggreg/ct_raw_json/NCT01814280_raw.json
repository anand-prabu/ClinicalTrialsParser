            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      Medication reviews performed on admission to hospitals reduce medication errors; however,\n      evidence of effect on morbidity and mortality is currently inconsistent. It is known that\n      patients' risks of experiencing medication errors are dependent on both patient- and drug\n      factors, e.g. age, co-morbidity, number of drugs, risk of side effects.\n\n      Aim and hypothesis:\n\n      The aim of this pilot study is to study acute medical patients' risk of getting a medication\n      error based on an algorithm that takes into account both patient and drug related factors.\n      Secondary, the investigators will explore whether our methods are applicable in a randomised\n      controlled trial. The investigators will also decide the number of patients in a randomised\n      controlled trial based on this pilot study.\n\n      The hypothesis is that an algorithm that has already been developed can stratify patients\n      according to their risk of experiencing a medication error.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      100 acute admitted patients will be risk stratified at admission (>8 hours after). The\n      patients who have highest risks of medication errors will receive a medication review\n      performed by either a clinical pharmacist or a clinical pharmacologist."
