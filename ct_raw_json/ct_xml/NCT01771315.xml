  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of nurse led follow-up following total knee
      arthroplasty in regard to physical function, health related quality of life and
      self-efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to shorter hospitalization the patients early have to be responsible for their own
      rehabilitation. However, the patients experience a variety of health related problems in the
      rehabilitations period following total knee arthroplasty and they have difficulties
      transferring health related information to their home settings. Nurse led follow-up in the
      early rehabilitation period might improve the health status of the patients by improving
      their knowledge and skills to handle health related problems. No studies found has
      investigated the effect of nurse led follow-up in form of telephone call following total
      knee arthroplasty.
