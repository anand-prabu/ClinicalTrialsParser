If determined to be\n      tolerable, Part 2 will proceed as a randomized, double-blind study evaluating ruxolitinib or\n      placebo in combination with regorafenib in subjects with relapsed or refractory metastatic\n      CRC previously treated with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and/or irinotecan based\n      chemotherapy, an anti-VEGF therapy and if KRAS wild type an anti-EGFR therapy.\n\n      Subjects in the safety run-in will receive open-label ruxolitinib and regorafenib; for the\n      randomized, double-blind portion of the study all subjects will receive regorafenib and\n      either ruxolitinib or placebo in a 1:1 blinded manner. Treatment for all subjects will\n      consist of repeating 28-day cycles. Regorafenib will be self-administered for the first 21\n      days of each cycle, and ruxolitinib/placebo will be self-administered during the entire\n      28-day cycle. Treatment cycles will continue as long as the regimen is tolerated, and the\n      subject does not meet the discontinuation criteria. When subjects discontinue regorafenib,\n      ruxolitinib or placebo they will remain in the study and be followed for subsequent\n      treatment regimens which are initiated and survival."
