    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed research is to pilot test an innovative, theoretically-guided
      sexual risk reduction intervention for women with a history of abuse. T intervention builds
      on previous findings suggesting that it is important to address the psychological
      consequences of abuse, as well as the typical antecedents of sexual risk behavior. To inform
      intervention development, women who reported a history of abuse were recruited to
      participate in key informant interviews. Based on interview findings and guided by theory
      and empirical precedent, a novel sexual risk reduction intervention was developed and
      refined. The intervention will be pilot tested with 80 women recruited from a
      publicly-funded clinic who report a history of abuse and current sexual risk behavior. These
      women will complete a computerized survey to assess abuse, adult sexual risk behavior,
      HIV-related information, safer sex motivation, behavioral skills, interpersonal trust,
      guilt, and powerlessness. Behavioral skills will also be assessed through role-plays and
      simulation scenarios. Women will be randomly assigned to the novel intervention or to a
      structurally equivalent intervention focused only on the psychological antecedents of sexual
      risk behavior. Three months after intervention completion, women will return to complete
      computerized interviews and behavioral skills assessments. The long-term goal of this
      research is to develop a feasible and effective sexual risk reduction intervention for women
      who have a history of abuse.
