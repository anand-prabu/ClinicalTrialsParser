  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effects of BG00012 (Dimethyl Fumarate)
      administered over approximately 6 months on immune responses to vaccination with tetanus
      diphtheria toxoids vaccine (Td) [T cell-dependent anamnestic humoral response] and keyhole
      limpet hemocyanian (KLH) [T cell-dependent neoantigen response] in subjects with relapsing
      forms of multiple sclerosis (MS).

      Secondary objectives are:  To evaluate the effects of BG00012 administered over
      approximately 6 months on the immune response to vaccination with Pneumococcal Vaccine
      (Pneumovax 23) [a mostly T cell-independent humoral response];  To evaluate the
      pharmacodynamic effects of BG00012 on lymphocyte subtypes over 1 year of treatment;  To
      evaluate the pharmacodynamic effect of BG00012 immunoglobulin levels over time and To
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of BG00012
