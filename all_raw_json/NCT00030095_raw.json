Patients then receive oral 2ME2 every 12 hours. Treatment continues in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 2ME2 until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at day 30.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
