The FQHC, El\n      Rio Community Health Center pharmacy, and supermarket pharmacy, Fry's Pharmacy, will serve\n      as implementing pharmacy study sites and will implement the ABM for beneficiaries of the ACO\n      who utilize their pharmacies for medication refill services. The ABM involves synchronizing\n      all medications to come due on the same day of the month and the individual receives a\n      pre-appointment phone call from the pharmacy staff to review medications and identify any\n      changes. The ACO will provide medical and claims data on enrolled subjects as well as a\n      control group for the intervention population. The APhA Foundation will aggregate\n      intervention, prescription fill, and economic data from the 3 partners in an effort to\n      evaluate the impact of the ABM on healthcare costs and medication adherence. The APhA\n      Foundation has an a priori intent to publish the project results."
