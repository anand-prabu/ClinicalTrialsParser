The\n      investigators plan to characterize platelet proteome expression after removing high\n      abundance proteins. The investigators will compare the proteome of sick and healthy members\n      of families with inherited platelet disorders, and identify and validate structural\n      proteins, signaling cascades and biomarkers for detection and diagnosis of unknown platelet\n      disorders. The investigators expect to discover new key findings that allow better\n      understanding of human platelet function and allow better diagnosis and treatment of\n      patients with inherited platelet function disorders."
