    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, the investigators will deliver oxliplatin and 5-FU via HAI to breast
      cancer patients with liver-only or liver-predominant metastases who have failed at least one
      line of systemic chemotherapy in metastatic setting. The investigators hypothesize that HAI
      chemotherapy will be able to convert some patients to surgical resection candidates, or/and
      to overcome chemo-resistance of liver metastases to systemic i.v.  chemotherapy for some
      clinically fit, heavily pre-treated patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Performance status ECOG 0-2 and a life expectancy of &gt;3 months.

          2. Patients were required to have measurable disease in the liver, defined as lesions
             measuring &gt;1 cm in largest diameter on spiral-computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI)

          3. Histologically confirmed metastatic advanced solid tumors involving the liver, liver
             replacement less than 70%

          4. No bevacizumab (avastin) use within 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

          5. Absence of portal vein thrombosis

          6. Not a surgical candidate or patients refuge surgery at the time of enrollment

          7. Loss of response to at least 1 line of systemic chemotherapy in metastatic setting

          8. An asymptomatic extra-hepatic disease is allowed, provided that the extent of the
             metastatic disease in the liver represented the bulk of the metastatic disease.

          9. History of liver-directed therapy is eligible at the investigator's discretion.

         10. Adequate renal function with a calculated creatinine clearance greater than 60
             mL/min.

         11. Hepatic function as follows: Total Bilirubin ≤3 mg/dL, AST ≤5 times upper normal
             reference value, or ALT ≤ 5 times upper normal reference value.

         12. Adequate bone marrow function (ANC ≥1500 cells/uL; PLT ≥ 100,000 cells/uL) before
             each therapy.

         13. At least three weeks from previous immunotherapy, chemotherapy or radiotherapy before
             being enrolled in this study.

         14. All females in childbearing age MUST have a negative serum HCG test unless patients
             have prior hysterectomy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical or radiographic evidence of moderate amount of ascites.

          2. History of cirrhosis with Child-Pugh class B or C.

          3. Pregnant or lactating females.

          4. Inability to complete informed consent process and adhere to protocol treatment plan

          5. Patients receiving any other investigational agents.

          6. Patients with bleeding diathesis (clinical bleeding, prothrombin time =/&gt; 1.5 X upper
             institutional normal value, INR =/&gt; 1.5, activated partial thromboplastin time aPTT
             =/&gt; 1.5 X upper institutional normal value), active gastric or duodenal ulcer.

             treated non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or other cancers
             cured by local therapy alone and a DFS ≥5 years.

          9. Concurrent severe illness such as active infection, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit safety and compliance with study requirements.

         10. Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease: myocardial infarction or
             unstable angina within 6 months, New York Heart Association Grade II or greater
             congestive heart failure, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, unstable
