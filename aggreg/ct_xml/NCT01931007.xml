  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to develop regenerative cell therapy for use in patients
      with osteoarthritis (OA). The primary objective of this proposal is to conduct a pilot study
      that assesses the safety and feasibility of using concentrated bone marrow aspirate
      containing MSC to treat patients with painful knee OA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with symptomatic mild to moderate bilateral knee osteoarthritis will be candidates
      for this pilot study. Baseline data includes radiographs, MRI imaging, clinical data on knee
      pain and analysis of synovial fluid inflammatory markers. Bone marrow will be aspirated from
      the patient's iliac crests and the cellular rich portion will be concentrated. Randomly, one
      knee will be injected with the bone marrow concentrate.  The contralateral knee will be
      injected with only sterile saline for placebo. Follow-up analysis of synovial fluid will be
      at one week and 6 months after injection; clinical data will be obtained at 3, 6 and 12
      months and MRI imaging will be performed at 6 months after injection, with repeat
      radiographs at 12 months
