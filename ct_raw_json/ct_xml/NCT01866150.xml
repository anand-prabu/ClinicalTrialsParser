  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This cross-sectional, non-interventional, retrospective chart review will compare the
      efficacy and safety of biologic monotherapy and biologic and methotrexate combination
      therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to prior
      treatment with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate. Data will be
      collected from patients who have been on first-line biologic treatment for at least 6
      months.
