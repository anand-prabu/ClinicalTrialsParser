The study is also being done to see what effects telmisartan has\n      on other signs of disease and inflammation in the body, and to see whether people who have\n      HIV can take telmisartan safely and without side effects that make them want to stop the\n      drug. Telmisartan is FDA-approved for treating high blood pressure and decreasing the chance\n      of heart attacks and strokes in people over the age of 55 years of age who are at high risk\n      for these events."
