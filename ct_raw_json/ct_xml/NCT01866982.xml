  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature babies can be very sick and have bleeding in the brain. Giving babies more blood
      before cutting the umbilical cord by delayed cord clamping or umbilical cord milking has
      been shown to reduce the risk of bleeding in the brain. This may be related to improving
      perfusion to the brain.  However, some studies suggest that delayed cord clamping may not
      increase hemoglobin or blood volume in babies delivered by cesarean section. Milking the
      umbilical cord may give more blood in babies delivered by Cesarean Section may improve
      perfusion and reduce bleeding in the brain.
