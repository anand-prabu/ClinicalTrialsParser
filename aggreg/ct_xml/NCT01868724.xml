    <description>This study is a multi-center study intended to enroll enough subjects to validate biomarkers for acute kidney injury recovery.  Subjects enrolled will be those with known moderate to severe AKI. The study is to determine the outcome of Major Adverse Kidney Event (MAKE) and Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE) during a period of up to 7 days.</description>
