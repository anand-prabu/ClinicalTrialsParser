      This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of melphalan when given
      together with palifermin followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) in
      treating patients with stage II-III multiple myeloma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      melphalan, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Palifermin may help prevent symptoms of mucositis,
      or mouth sores, in patients receiving melphalan followed by a PBSCT

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of melphalan in patients with normal and
      abnormal renal function undergoing autologous stem cell transplants for myeloma when treated
      with palifermin to prevent mucositis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess overall response (compete response [CR], partial response [PR], stable disease
      [SD]) at D+28 and D+100 after autologous transplant when treated with combination of
      palifermin and Melphalan.

      II. To evaluate the efficacy of Palifermin as a cytoprotective agent in reducing incidence
      and duration of Grade 3 and 4 mucositis due to high dose Melphalan.

      III. To assess patient reported outcomes and impact of using palifermin on quality of life
      in the post transplant duration.

      IV. To assess the qualitative and quantitative toxicities associated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of melphalan.

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive high-dose melphalan intravenously (IV) on day -2 and
      palifermin IV on days -5 to -3 and 1-3.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo autologous PBSCT on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 28 and 100, and then
      periodically thereafter.
