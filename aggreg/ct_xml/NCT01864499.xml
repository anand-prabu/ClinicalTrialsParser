  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurosurgery for supratentorial brain tumor is frequently associated with preoperative
      intracranial hypertension. The evaluation of intracranial pressure is available
      noninvasively by measuring the diameter of the optic nerve sheath ultrasound.

      The evaluation of intracranial pressure by measuring the DNO in perioperative is not
      described in the literature. The investigators propose a pilot study to assess intracranial
      pressure perioperative surgery for supratentorial brain tumor. The investigators consider a
      diameter of the optic nerve sheath as normal and predictive of intracranial pressure below
      20 mm Hg when less than 5.7 mm (on the average of two measurements on each eye). DNO the
      normal healthy adult unanesthetized is 5 mm.

      The main objective of the study is to compare the mean change in diameter of the optic nerve
      between the postoperative and D2 between groups of patients undergoing resection of a brain
      tumor and patients undergoing biopsy brain tumor.

      Pilot Study: Prospective, single-center, controlled, non-randomized, the number of patients
      is estimated according to the recruiting capabilities of neurosurgery for this type of
      patient in the institution, A total of 40 patients: 20 patients Tumor Resection, control
      group: 20 patients Biopsy Brain Tumor.
