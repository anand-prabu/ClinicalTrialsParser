  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dyspnea (breathlessness) on exertion is the most prevalent and distressing symptom of heart
      failure (HF).  Nevertheless, the mechanisms of dyspnea in HF remain poorly understood. Thus,
      the general aim of this pilot study is to advance our understanding of the mechanisms of
      activity-related dyspnea in patients with HF. Studies will be performed in patients with
      mild, moderate and severe HF (n=24) as well as in healthy, age- and sex-matched control
      subjects (n=8).  We will test the hypothesis that the increased prevalence and severity of
      activity-related dyspnea in HF reflects the interaction between an exaggerated drive to
      breathe and the inability of the respiratory system to meet this increased demand.  Detailed
      physiological and perceptual responses to bicycle exercise will be examined and compared,
      first, between HF patients and healthy control subjects and, second, across patients with
      varying degrees of HF severity.  The results from this preliminary study will be used to
      help design future studies in this patient population.
