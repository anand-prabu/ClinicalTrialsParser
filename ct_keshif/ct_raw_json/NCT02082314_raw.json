In patients who die\n      from breast, prostate, and lung cancer, autopsy studies have shown that up to 85% have\n      evidence of bone metastases at the time of death (1). These metastases frequently give rise\n      to complications that reduce patients' quality of life. These include: pain, fractures, and\n      decreased mobility, ultimately reducing performance status.\n\n      Radiofrequency ablation therapy with cementoplasty/vertebroplasty for painful bone\n      metastases has been shown to be feasible, efficacious, and safe. However, patient reported\n      outcomes have yet to be determined."
