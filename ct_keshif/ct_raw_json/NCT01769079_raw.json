From a practical\n      standpoint, some advocate the withdrawal of medication in stable patients, while many\n      physicians still hesitate to withdraw the medication by the lack of definitive information\n      about its consequences. In this sense there is a rationale for the attempted removal of\n      nitrate fixed these patients, although evidence to support this action have not been\n      adequately evaluated."
