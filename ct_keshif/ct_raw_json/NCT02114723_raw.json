            "textblock": "The aim of this study is to assess the analgesic efficacy of self-applied Kinesio tape in\n      the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea .\n\n      To evaluate this effect, a total of 128 students from the University Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez , with\n      the following inclusion criteria, participated in this study: history of menstrual pain,\n      aged between 18 and 39 years who have performed a gynecological check in the last 18 months\n      and who have been diagnosed with any kind of primary dysmenorrhea.\n\n      A preliminary survey to identify valid students was made. Thereafter the participants were\n      separated into two different groups (intervention group and placebo group) in order to\n      request the completion of three questionnaires about the characteristics of menstrual pain\n      and other demographic data for the next two menstrual cycles before the intervention. One\n      survey included a graphic scale so the students could mark the start and the end of the\n      symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle.\n\n      After that the principal researcher will interviewed with the participants to show them the\n      correct auto-application of the menstrual bandage and placebo. Each students group will\n      receive a triptych with information and pictures to the correct application of the adhesive\n      strips.\n\n      Finally, during two new menstrual cycles, the participants will answer the same\n      questionnaires to assess symptoms and menstrual pain while being worn adhesive strips (3\n      pieces of Kinesio tape - 20 cm x 5 cm Tape Cure \u00ae-, applied to the abdominal and lower back,\n      in the intervention group; 2 pieces of Cross Tape \u00ae 2.5 cm x 2 cm -, in the hip joint, in\n      the placebo group. Participants may do personal hygiene during the days of the menstrual\n      cycle with their adhesives strips placed on oneself.\n\n      The size sample will be 128 girls. Differences will be contrasted in comparison of means\n      (quantitative improvement, with an ANOVA) to evaluate the intervention. 18 girls were\n      randomly chosen to obtain an estimation of the contrast parameters considered (means and\n      standard variations). With this size sample and a significance of 5%, the investigators will\n      have a power for the total sample for the contrasts of 80%.\n\n      To describe the variables, the investigators will use frequencies (absolute and relative)\n      for the qualitative variables. For the quantitative variables, the investigators will use\n      means plus standard variations.\n\n      To verify the homogeneity of the randomization the investigators will use tests based on the\n      X2 (Pearson or Fisher) and t-test. The same procedure will be used to verify that the\n      participants who quit the study have similar characteristics as those who remain.\n\n      The improvement will be analyzed quantitatively using ANOVA test. Dependent variable: pain\n      after the intervention. Independent variables: pain before the intervention, changes in\n      pharmacological therapy and intervention group. In the event of significant differences in\n      the ANOVA models the investigators will use the Tukey post-hoc test, in order to determine\n      where the differences exist between the two groups.\n\n      Qualitatively, the investigators will assess the improvement by calculating indicators of\n      clinical relevance: relative risk (RR), absolute risk reduction (ARR), relative risk\n      reduction (RRR), and number needed to treat (NNT).\n\n      All the analyses will be made at a significance of 5%. The confidence intervals (CI) will be\n      calculated for the most relevant parameters. The analyses will be done using  IBM SPSS\n      Statistics 19.0."
