      Randomized, Phase 2 Study to Estimate the Effect of Prophylactic Intervention With Naproxen
      or Loratadine On Bone Pain in Breast Cancer Subjects Receiving Chemotherapy and
      Pegfilgrastim
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigational products are naproxen, a non-steroidal antiinflammatory
      drug (NSAID), and loratadine, an anti-histamine. Both agents are being investigated as
      prophylactic medications to reduce the incidence and/or severity of bone pain in breast
      cancer subjects receiving adjuvant or neoadjuvant myelosuppressive chemotherapy and
      pegfilgrastim prophylaxis.
