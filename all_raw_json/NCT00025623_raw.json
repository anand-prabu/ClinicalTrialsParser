Combining more than one drug, and giving them before surgery,\n      may shrink the tumor so that it can be removed during surgery.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by\n      surgery in treating infants who have newly diagnosed neuroblastoma."

Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses.\n\n      Patients without disease progression receive 2 additional courses of VP-CARBO chemotherapy.\n      Patients with metastatic complete response (CR) undergo surgical resection of primary\n      disease.\n\n      Patients with disease progression after 2 or 4 courses of VP-CARBO chemotherapy receive CADO\n      chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5, doxorubicin IV over 6\n      hours on days 4 and 5, and vincristine IV on days 1 and 5. Treatment repeats every 21 days\n      for 2 courses.\n\n      After 2 courses of CADO chemotherapy, patients with metastatic CR undergo surgical resection\n      of primary disease. Patients with residual disease receive 2 additional courses of CADO\n      chemotherapy. Patients with residual disease after 4 courses of CADO chemotherapy are\n      removed from the study. Patients with metastatic CR after additional CADO chemotherapy\n      undergo surgical resection of primary disease.\n\n      Patients are followed within 6 months and then annually for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years."
