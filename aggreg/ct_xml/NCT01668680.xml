    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer patients with metastases (mCRC) at response under expensive chemotherapy
      which may be toxic +/- exhausting are candidates for an effective and more convenient
      maintenance treatment.

      Objectives:

        1. To define the efficacy of maintenance chemotherapy by a low-dose metronomic (LDM)
           regimen, in metastatic CRC patients responding under FOLFIRI + bevacizumab.

        2. To discover predictive factors for response to this LDM regimen.

      Hypothesis:

        1. The re-growth of residual metastases can be slowed by the anti-angiogenic effects of
           LDM chemotherapy.

        2. Serial measurements of angiogenic/ inflammatory factors in the plasma and/or evaluation
           of certain enzymes in the tumor may discover predictive factors of response to LDM
           chemotherapy in metastatic CRC patients.

      At entry to the research protocol the up-till then administered treatment with Intra Venous
      FOLFIRI+BEVACIZUMAB will be stopped.Instead, the research oral treatment will be initiated
      to be taken daily on an ambulatory basis and under once monthly re-evaluation. If and when
      disease progresses the original FOLFIRI+BEVACIZUMAB treatment will be considered for
      re-institution.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologic (or cytologic) proof of colorectal carcinoma (CRC).

          2. Age: between 18 and 80.

          3. Sex: both sexes.

          4. Previous treatment for metastatic disease is limited to FOLFIRI+ bevacizumab.

          5. Prior adjuvant chemotherapy, with a fluoropyrimidine and/or Oxaliplatin, is allowed.

          6. Prior radiotherapy, either as adjuvant treatment or palliation of metastatic sites is
             allowed, provided that there are other non-irradiated foci of disease for evaluation.

          7. Persistent remission, either complete, partial or minimal response (CR, PR or MR) or
             stable disease (SD), one year+/-one month from initiation of first line treatment for
             mCRC.

          8. Asymptomatic patients at break from chemotherapy.

          9. Intact organ function, including complete blood counts (CBC) showing normal values or
             any toxicity limited to grade 1 and blood chemistry (SMA) showing liver and renal
             functions &lt; 1.5 upper normal limit (UNL).

         10. Capability to understand and to sign the informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Concurrent any other cancer (except BCC or squamous cell carcinoma of skin).

          2. Inability to adhere to monthly visits to the oncology unit for evaluation.

          3. Presence of brain metastases.

             NSAIDs, or with therapeutic doses of anticoagulants for any reason.

          6. Evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease (e.g., unstable or uncompensated
             respiratory, cardiac including arrhythmias, hepatic or renal disease), and/or
             existence of active peptic ulcer (clinically and/or by gastroscopy).
