The\n      most famous emulsifier is soya lecithin but milk also naturally contains natural emulsifiers\n      such as polar lipids. Milk polar lipids are rich in sphingomyelin and they may have\n      beneficial effects on lipid metabolism in the context of metabolic diseases of nutritional\n      origin.\n\n      The purpose of this research is to study the variation of sphingomyelin content at the\n      ileum's end after the consumption of different doses of milk polar lipids, and consequences\n      on the intestinal absorption and metabolism of fatty acids and cholesterol.\n\n      The subjects will be taking three different test meals varying by their milk polar lipids\n      content.\n\n      It is a bi-centric study with a centre in LYON (Centre de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine\n      Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes) and CLERMONT-FERRAND (Centre de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine  Auvergne)."
