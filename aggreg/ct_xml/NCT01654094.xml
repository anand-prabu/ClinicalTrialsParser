      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the P6 Low Adherent Study Dressing relative to the
      Standard of Care (SOC, Mafenide Acetate 5% Solution) for the management of skin grafts in
      burn wounds resulting from thermal burn injuries.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have thermal burns from scalds, flame/fire or contact with a hot
             object.

          -  Patients must have a TBSA burn of less than or equal to 50%.

          -  Patients must have two nonadjacent study burn sites (i.e., separated in such a way
             that SOC dressing does not contaminate the study dressing) of comparable size (up to
             approximately 2% TBSA) and severity requiring excision and grafting.

          -  Patients must have undergone excision and autografting on or before post-burn day
             (PBD) 14.

          -  Patients' study burn sites will be treated with skin grafts with a mesh ratio up to
             3:1, at the surgeon's discretion.

          -  Patients expected to be available for assessment of study burn sites at least until
             POD 6 Â±1 day.

          -  Males or females at least 18 years of age but no older than 65 years of age at the
             time of informed consent.

          -  Patient and / or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) voluntarily agrees to
             provide written informed consent and the willingness and ability to comply with all
             aspects of the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with electrical or chemical burns.

          -  Patients with a study burn site excised and &quot;grafted&quot; with Integra.

          -  Patients with study burn sites on the buttocks, scalp, hands, feet, neck or ears.

          -  Patients taking vasopressors or inotropes.

          -  Patients using systemic immunosuppressants (e.g., corticosteroids and anti-neoplastic
             agents, etc.).

          -  Patients with acute renal failure, defined as creatinine clearance (CrCL) &gt;2.5 mg/dL
             or AKIN score greater than or equal to 2 or estimated GFR &lt; 30, if the assessment is
             conducted as part of the patient's routine clinical care.

          -  Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), if the assessment is
             conducted as part of the patient's routine clinical care.

          -  Patients with liver cirrhosis (Childs-Pugh B Class or greater) or who have AST / ALT
             levels greater than or equal to 2 times the upper limit of theinstitution's normal
             range, if the assessment is conducted as part of the patient's routine clinical care.

          -  Patients with a known sensitivity or known intolerance to mafenide acetate
             (Sulfamylon) or to silver.

          -  Patients with any concurrent medical condition, which in the opinion of the
             investigator, may compromise their safety or the objectives of the study.

          -  Patients who are breastfeeding, pregnant or expecting to become pregnant during the
             study..

          -  Patients who have been exposed to an investigational drug or device within 30 days
             prior to Screening or is scheduled to receive another investigational drug or device
             during either the Treatment Phase or Follow-up Evaluation.
