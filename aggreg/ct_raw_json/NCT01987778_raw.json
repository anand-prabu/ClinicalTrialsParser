Vasomotor symptoms like hot flushes and sweating are\n      reported by about 75% of all women around menopause and may impair well-being, mental state,\n      daily activities and night sleep. Vasomotor symptoms are less prevalent in women who\n      participate in regular physical exercise. It is, however, still uncertain if physical\n      exercise reduces vasomotor symptoms.\n\n      The purpose of this randomized controlled study is to establish possible beneficial health\n      effects from 15 weeks of supervised resistance training (RT) on postmenopausal women.\n      End-points include effects from RT in postmenopausal women on\n\n        1. clinical outcomes (number and severity of vasomotor symptoms, Health-Related quality of\n           Life (HRQoL), Body Mass Index (BMI), abdominal height, muscle strength and mass,\n           browning of fat),\n\n        2. diagnostic variables (production of myokines as irisin, immunological markers) and\n\n        3. genetic variables (length of telomeres).\n\n      The control group will be offered resistance training after the intervention period."
