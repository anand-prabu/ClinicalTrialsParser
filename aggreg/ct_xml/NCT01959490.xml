    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well trastuzumab or bevacizumab with combination
      chemotherapy works in treating patients with stage II-III breast cancer. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as trastuzumab and bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways.
      Some block the ability of tumors to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill
      them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      docetaxel, carboplatin, doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Giving trastuzumab or a commercially marketed formulation of bevacizumab
      without modification  with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if genomically derived 'molecular subtypes' predict pathological complete
      response to combination chemotherapy and targeted therapy for early stage breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the ability of trastuzumab response signatures to predict pathological complete
      response (pCR) in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive tumors treated
      with brief exposure to trastuzumab followed by combination chemotherapy.

      II. To assess the value of the transforming growth factor, beta (TGF-B) response signature
      to predict pCR in HER2 negative tumors treated with brief exposure to bevacizumab followed
      by combination chemotherapy.

      III. To determine if comprehensive annotation of genomic alterations (mutations, copy number
      alternations, gene fusions, non-coding ribonucleic acid [RNA] and splice variants) can
      further sub-stratify subtype-based classifiers for prediction of response to targeted
      therapy in early stage breast cancer IV. To assess whether the findings on breast dynamic
      contrast enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) performed after the two-week 'run-in'
      treatment with either single agent trastuzumab or single agent bevacizumab predict
      pathologic response to the treatment regimen.

      V. To determine if circulating RNA expression levels are associated with treatment response.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment cohorts based on HER2 status.

      COHORT I (HER2 positive): Patients receive trastuzumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes,
      docetaxel IV, and carboplatin IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT II (HER2 negative): Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 of
      weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV and cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60
      minutes on day 1 of weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7; and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 of weeks
      9, 11, 13, and 15. Prior to receiving paclitaxel patients will receive the anti-nausea
      medication

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
