      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of the global approach to the pain in
      cystic fibrosis patients with chronic or intermittent pain. The patients will receive in
      addition to an usual pharmacological and psychological management, sophrology sessions at
      home. The results of this study will provide a new strategy of management of the patient's
      pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of cystic fibrosis patients have chronic or intermittent pains. These pains
      have important consequences on the quality of life. Currently, the treatment is essentially
      pharmacological (essentially paracetamol) but it is not enough in presence of of visual
      analogue scale (VAS) &gt;4. In the study, the patients will receive in addition to an usual
      pharmacological and psychological management, sophrology sessions at home. The sophrology is
      a dynamic method of physical and psychical relaxation. This aims are to decrease the pain,
      to decrease the anxiety and to improve the everyday life. This study will provide a new
      global strategy of the management of the patients' pain.
