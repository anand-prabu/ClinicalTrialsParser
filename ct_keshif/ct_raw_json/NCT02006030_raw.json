Subjects on anti-coagulants are to receive only 1 point for their INR status.\n\n         11. Expected survival of at least 3 months.\n\n         12. Age \u2265 18 years.\n\n         13.

Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >1,500/\u00b5L.\n\n         20. Platelets >50,000/\u00b5L.\n\n         21. Serum uric acid \u2264 8 mg/dL (with or without medication control).\n\n         22. Serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 x the upper limit of normal range, or, if serum creatinine\n             >1.5 x the upper limit of normal range, then the creatinine clearance must be \u2265 60\n             mL/min.\n\n         23.
