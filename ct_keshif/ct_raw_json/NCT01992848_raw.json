Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is associated with\n      atherosclerotic plaque burden and cardiovascular mortality. Mechanisms underlying isolated\n      CAC have not been as yet been fully explained. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), known to act as\n      regulators of gene expression, have also emerged as powerful biomarkers in the diagnosis and\n      prognosis of cardiovascular disorders and may be used in the detection of CAC. We aim to\n      investigate the potential for a \"microRNA-signature\" in patients with CAC by performing a\n      prospective, case-controlled study to identify pathways associated with CAC in humans.\n      Previous research has demonstrated an inverse relationship between CAC and bone mineral\n      density (BMD), suggesting that these processes may be linked. In a further substudy we plan\n      to define the relationship between CAC and BMD as well as a number of markers of bone\n      metabolism."
