  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no theoretical or practical reason why non-medical personnel such as nurses could
      not be trained to perform diagnostic colonoscopy with comparable proficiency as medical
      endoscopists.  Nurse endoscopists have been widely accepted in the United Kingdom for the
      past 15 years as a valuable resource to cope with the increasing demand for endoscopic
      service, in particular diagnostic colonoscopy for colorectal screening.  A pilot study
      performed in Hong Kong in 2008 has shown that endoscopy nurses can be trained to perform
      diagnostic endoscopy safely and reliably.  This study aims to demonstrate that properly
      trained nurse endoscopists have a comparable proficiency in performing colonoscopy
      procedures as their medical counterparts.
