However, within few months\n      to few years the majority of levodopa-treated patients notice a decline in the duration of\n      benefit of each dose and develop motor-complications. A major problem is the appearance of\n      fluctuations in mobility, cycles of ON and OFF periods. The administration of rasagiline, a\n      MAO-B inhibitor, can slow the elimination of the endogenous dopamine supplies or the\n      dopamine produced from the exogenous levodopa therapy and may therefore improve ON-OFF\n      fluctuations.\n\n      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of\n      rasagiline compared to placebo in PD patients with motor fluctuations on levodopa therapy."
