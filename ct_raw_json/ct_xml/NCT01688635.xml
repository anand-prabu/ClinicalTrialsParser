    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
      LY2963016 and US-approved Lantus速. The study involves four single injections; two doses of
      LY2963016 and two doses of US-approved Lantus速. The study will have 4 periods. In each
      period, a single injection will be administered before undergoing a euglycemic clamp that
      lasts for 24 hours. There will be at least a 7 day washout between each period. Side effects
      will be documented. Study participation is expected to last up to 14 weeks.
