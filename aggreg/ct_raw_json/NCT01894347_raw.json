Data on pharmacodynamics or - kinetics are transferred\n      from older studies or from other patient populations. For patients with pulmonary\n      colonization or infection due to an MDR pathogen the systemic resorption of the drug is not\n      known, consequently  systemic side effects including kidney or neural damage are not\n      predictable.\n\n      This study focus on patients with inhalative colistin therapy and uses therapeutic drug\n      monitoring to determine the rate of systemic resorption of colistin.  For the evaluation of\n      neurotoxicity function of peripheral nerves (neve conduction velocity) and of the eighth\n      cranial nerve is monitored.  Nephrotoxicity is estimated by creatinine level (-clearance)\n      and the RIFLE criteria."
