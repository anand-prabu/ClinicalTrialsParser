If eligible patients\n      will undergo the prostate artery embolization procedure in the Interventional Radiology\n      department.  An angiogram of the prostate arteries will be done.  Small beads called\n      Embospheres will be injected into the prostate artery to slow blood flow to the prostate in\n      the hope of providing relief with minimal side effects and complications, for lower urinary\n      tract symptoms caused by BPH.  After the procedure the patient will be followed at 4 weeks,\n      12 weeks, 6 months, 12 months post procedure and then annually for up to 4 years."
