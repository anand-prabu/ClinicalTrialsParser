Improving access to services and care\n      coordination are among the primary goals of PACTs; however, there remain many unanswered\n      questions about how best to use the limited time of PACT team members, such as nurse care\n      managers, to accomplish this. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a nurse-led\n      telephone support program for Veterans who have been treated recently in the emergency\n      department (ED) and are at high risk for repeat visits. The program's goals are to reduce\n      the need for future ED use and improve satisfaction among Veterans by providing information\n      and support related to the ED visit, enhancing chronic disease management and educating\n      Veterans and family members about PACT and other VA and community services.  If proven\n      effective, this program could improve health and healthcare for a large, vulnerable group of\n      Veterans and be cost saving for VHA."

            "textblock": "Anticipated Impacts on Veteran's Healthcare More than 1 million Veterans receive care in\n      Emergency Departments (EDs) in VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) annually. ED visits that do not\n      result in hospital admission, commonly referred to as treat and release visits, account for\n      80% of all VAMC ED encounters. Nearly 1 in 5 Veterans treated and released from a VAMC ED\n      receive additional unscheduled care in the ED or hospital within 30 days, a rate that is\n      higher than non-VA settings. A large number of Veterans and the VA system would benefit from\n      the development of interventions that reduce subsequent ED use in this vulnerable\n      population.\n\n      Project Background Failing to address unmet needs and difficulty navigating the health\n      system are two primary forces driving repeat ED use.  Unmet needs after an ED visit range\n      from poorly controlled chronic diseases to incomplete understanding of new medications or\n      follow-up instructions. Perceived barriers to access to primary care and other services are\n      also cited as factors that lead Veterans back to the ED for ambulatory care. In a nationally\n      representative sample of 15,263 Veterans with repeat ED visits, we found that 71.7% did not\n      see another VA outpatient provider between their original and return trip to the ED,\n      Improving access to services and care coordination are among the primary goals of the\n      Veterans' Health Administration's (VHA) ongoing reorganization of primary care.  Patient\n      Aligned Care Teams (PACTs) are being created in VAMCs across the country; however, there has\n      been little focus on the interface between PACT and the ED.  A key role for nurses within\n      PACT will be telephone management of high risk populations, and Veterans treated and\n      released from the ED represent one such high-risk group. However, no studies have examined\n      both the Veteran and system-level impact of using nurse care managers to support Veterans\n      after an ED visit.\n\n      Project Objectives\n\n      The overall goal of this study is to examine the impact of a primary care-based nurse\n      telephone support program for Veterans treated and released from the ED who are at high risk\n      for repeat visits. We will test the following hypotheses:\n\n      H1: Veterans who participate in a primary care-based nurse telephone support program after\n      an ED visit will have fewer ED visits in the subsequent 30 days compared to usual care;\n\n      H2: Veterans who participate in a primary care- based nurse telephone support program after\n      an ED visit will have higher satisfaction compared to usual care;\n\n      H3: Veterans who participate in a primary care-based nurse telephone support program will\n      have lower VA costs for ED and hospital care in the 180 days following an ED visit, compared\n      to usual care.\n\n      Project Methods The proposed study is a two group randomized, controlled trial to evaluate a\n      structured nurse telephone support program for Veterans treated and released from the ED who\n      are at high risk for repeat visits.  After informed consent is obtained, Veterans will be\n      randomized to nurse telephone support [DISPO ED] or usual care.  DISPO ED will consist of 2\n      calls from a study nurse (simulating the role of a PACT RN Care Manager) within 7 days of\n      the index ED visit, with an option for a 3rd call within 14 days. The primary outcome is a\n      dichotomous outcome defined as any ED use within 30 days or not. Secondary outcomes are\n      patient satisfaction with VA health care at 30 and 180 days, and total VA costs within 180\n      days."
