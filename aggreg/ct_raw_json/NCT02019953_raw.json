Diagnosis of an underlying medical illness that might be considered by the\n             principal investigator to potentially impair one's safety or ability to complete the\n             study protocol (example could possibly include uncontrolled asthma), and/or\n\n             6. Current use of a prescription regimen that might be considered by the principal\n             investigator to potentially impair one's safety or ability to complete the study\n             protocol (examples could possibly include use of sedatives or other drugs that could\n             affect a participant's ability to participate in any of the study arms).\n\n             7.
