      Primary Objectives:

      Study Part 1: To determine the recommended dose for the aflibercept, oxaliplatin and
      capecitabine (XELOX) combination to be used in the Part 2 of the study.

      Study Part 2: To assess the percentage of patients without progression of the disease at 6
      months after the start of maintenance therapy with aflibercept single-agent, following the
      first-line induction therapy with XELOX and aflibercept combination in patients with
      previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer.

      Secondary Objective:

      Study Part 2: Include the evaluation of progression free survival, overall survival,
      response to treatment,  the overall safety (during induction and maintenance therapy) and
      the assessment of aflibercept pharmacodynamics and biomarkers parameters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The duration of the study for each patient includes a period for screening of up to 3 weeks,
      study drug administrations every 3 weeks up to disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or
      patient's refusal of further study treatment, followed by a minimum of 30-day follow-up
      after the last study treatment administration.

      After study treatment discontinuation each patient will be followed-up until death,
      patient's refusal or end of study (whichever comes first).

      This trial is being conducted in Europe, where the INN designation for the study molecule is
      &quot;aflibercept&quot; and this term is therefore used throughout the synopsis. In the US, the US
      proper name is &quot;ziv-aflibercept&quot;.
