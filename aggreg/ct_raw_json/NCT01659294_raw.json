Primary and secondary data, including A1C, fasting glucose, lipid profile,\n      eGFR, blood pressure, BMI, self-report measures, adherence to annual eye exam/vaccination,\n      emergency visits and hospital stays will be collected at baseline, 3-months (only for NCM\n      group), and 6 months.\n\n      Study Population Number of Patients The literature suggests the probability of meeting\n      targets on all three outcomes is about 10% in the control group and about 22% in the\n      treatment group. In order to detect this increase in probability of success in all three\n      groups with an 80% power and a 5% significance level, we require 146 patients per group.\n      Since the analysis will include a factor for recruitment location as well as some other\n      baseline covariates, we will recruit an additional 9 patients per group to cover lost power\n      due to these nuisance parameters in the model. In total we will recruit 310 patients split\n      equally between treatment and control."
