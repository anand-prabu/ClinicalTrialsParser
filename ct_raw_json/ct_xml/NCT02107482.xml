    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test the effect of a localized narrow band ultraviolet
      (NB-UVB) phototherapy compared to visible light that does not produce UVB on the clearance
      of psoriasis plaques and resolution of itching.  Localized NB-UVB (Levia®) phototherapy
      device is cleared by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults 18 years or older with bilateral psoriasis plaques, in  general good health as
             determined by the Principal Investigator by medical history and physical exam.

          -  Able to understand consent procedure

          -  Able to comply with protocol activities

          -  Must have baseline symmetric target lesions with baseline Target Lesion Score (TLS)
             of 6 or higher (scale of 0-12), i.e., moderate in intensity for each target.

        Target Lesion Scoring: Thickness, scaling and erythema of  the plaques are rated each on a
        scale of 0-4.  The three scores are summed.  The minimum score is 0; the maximum  is 12.
        Scores of 6 or greater are considered moderate to severe.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients less than 18 years old

          -  Patients not able to understand consent procedure

          -  Patients unable to comply with protocol activities

          -  Non-English speakers: the study assessments/questionnaires/evaluations are not
             scientifically validated in languages other than English

          -  Baseline target lesions scores of less than 6

          -  Patients with a photosensitive disorder or on a medication which has been
             demonstrated in these patients to cause photosensitivity

          -  Patients receiving concomitant phototherapy to test sites

          -  Patient receiving topical medication to test sites  within 2 weeks of study
             initiation

          -  Patient receiving Methotrexate, Acitretin, Cyclosporine, or other oral medications
             for psoriasis within 4 weeks of study initiation

          -  Patients receiving Etanercept (Enbrel®) within the past 2 months of study initiation

          -  Patients receiving Infliximab (Remicade®), Ustekinumab (Stelara®), Golimumab
             (Simponi®) Adalimumab (Humira®) or Alefacept (Amevive®) within the past 3 months
             prior to study initiation

          -  Receipt of an investigation agent within the past 4 weeks (or within 5 half lives)
             prior to study ignition

          -  Systemic corticosteroid therapy within the past month

          -  Concurrent use of prohibited medications
