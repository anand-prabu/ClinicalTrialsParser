The development of ventricular arrhythmias related to hypokalemia can lead to\n      sudden cardiac death. Thus, potassium replacement therapy is the cornerstone therapy for\n      hypokalemia.Though intravenous potassium replacement (IVPR) in hypokalemia is the preferred\n      route in most intensive care settings, it is associated with known safety risks.\n      Inappropriately administered, IVPR can lead to arrhythmias, cardiac arrest and death 1, 7,\n      8. Given these risks, IVPR is considered a \"high-alert medication\" by Institute of Safe\n      Medication practice.\n\n      Enteral potassium replacement (EPR), with its superior safety profile  may be a better\n      alternative to IVPR. A retrospective review showed that the efficacy of EPR was comparable\n      to IVPR in pediatric patients after congenital heart disease.\n\n      The investigators seek to explore this comparison between EPR and IVPR in a randomized\n      prospective trial"
