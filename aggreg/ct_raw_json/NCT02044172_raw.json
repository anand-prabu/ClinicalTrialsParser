Sometimes the tumor\n      may not need treatment until it progresses. In this case, active surveillance may be\n      sufficient. It is not yet known which treatment regimen is more effective for localized\n      prostate cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying active monitoring to see how well it\n      works compared with radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy in treating patients with\n      localized prostate cancer."

Patients are stratified by age (50-55 vs 56-59 vs\n      60-65 vs 66-69 years), Gleason score (6, 7, 8-10), and average result of recruitment and\n      first biopsy prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests (< 6 vs 6-9.9 vs \u2265 10 ng/mL). Patients\n      are randomized or select a treatment to be followed up in a cohort study."
