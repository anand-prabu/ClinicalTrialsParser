  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether a twelve-week intervention with one ounce (28 g) per day of
      walnuts improves endothelial function measured non-invasively using finger probe
      (EndoPat-2000) in people with coronary heart disease or type 2 diabetes.

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Reactive hyperemia index (RHI), which in part reflects vasodilator function of the small blood vessel at the fingertips is an indirect measure of endothelial function. Change in RHI between baseline and 12 weeks post intervention will be measured in each group using EndoPat2000 device. We will compare RHI change between walnut group and usual diet group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in blood levels of hormones produced by fat cells between baseline and 12 weeks (end of intervention)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Specifically, we will measure changes in blood levels of following hormones: retinol binding protein 4, fatty acid binding protein 4, total adiponectin, and leptin before and after 12 weeks of walnut consumption/consumption of usual diet.</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Change in heart rate variability will be measured in each group before and after 12 weeks.</description>
