The goal of this project involves the evaluation and potential\n      validation of five novel prognostic tests for myelodysplasia (MDS) and/or acute myeloid\n      leukemia (AML), as well as an analysis of health economic and socio-ethical implications\n      related to the potential introduction of these tests into the clinical setting.  The\n      over-arching goal is to improve the outcomes of patients with MDS and AML. The primary\n      hypothesis is that one or more of the laboratory tests being evaluated in conjunction with\n      this study, either alone or in combination with other laboratory tests (either established\n      or under investigation in this project), will have statistically significant prognostic\n      value either alone or in combination with established clinical risk factors.\n\n      The clinical study will involve the enrollment of 200 adults with AML and 200 adults with\n      MDS over a 2.5 year period.  Participants will be followed on study for two years.  Bone\n      marrow and blood specimens will be collected at diagnosis and at other time points as\n      required for the development of the five laboratory tests.\n\n      Participants will be assigned to treatment according to local institutional practice and\n      will be followed for up to 2 years.  Health economic and quality of life questionnaires will\n      be administered at key time points.  Data will be collected regarding participant\n      characteristics, diagnosis, disease features, treatment and clinical outcome."

The researchers think these tests might be useful in\n      predicting how well a person will respond to treatment.\n\n      The novel laboratory tests being evaluated as part of this study are still in the early\n      phases of development and cannot be used for clinical decision making.
