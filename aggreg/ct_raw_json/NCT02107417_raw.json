            "textblock": "Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) results from damage or dysfunction of the\n      peripheral nerves and is one of the most common side effects of antineoplastic chemotherapy\n      when neurotoxic drugs are used. Pain and paresthesia symptoms are prevalent, causing chronic\n      discomfort and loss of functional abilities whilst also interfering negatively with quality\n      of life and the patient's autonomy. In a pilot study of patients with CIPN, there was\n      evidence that Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) improved the painful\n      symptoms of patients with CIPN.  This study aims to investigate the effects of TENS in\n      reducing the symptoms of pain and numbness and improve the daily lives of cancer patients\n      who have CIPN.\n\n      1. Primary Objectives Evaluate the effects of TENS in the reduction of symptoms related to\n      peripheral neuropathy due to chemotherapy treatment of a high and moderate neurotoxic\n      potential in cancer patients.\n\n      Secondary Objectives:\n\n        -  Evaluate the therapeutic response of TENS with frequency variation (FV) in symptoms of\n           paresthesia\n\n        -  Evaluate the therapeutic response of TENS with frequency variation (FV) in activities\n           of the daily lives of patients\n\n        -  Evaluate the therapeutic response of TENS with frequency variation (FV) in symptoms of\n           neuropathic pain.\n\n        -  Evaluate the factors associated with better treatment response in paresthesia, in pain\n           and activities of daily living.\n\n      Eligibility criteria: The participants of the research will include patients with any cancer\n      diagnosis who are being subjected to chemotherapy in either adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy,\n      containing in its protocol at least one chemotherapeutic drug of moderate and high\n      neurotoxic potential.\n\n      The participants of the research will receive TENS within the following parameters:  VF mode\n      TENS with a variable frequency between 7 Hz and 65 Hz. It has   a pulse width of 200 \u00b5s,\n      this is the highest tolerable intensity while still remaining comfortable for the patient.\n      It has an application time of 60 minutes with the highest tolerable intensity, while still\n      remaining comfortable for the patient. The treatment will be given on the same day as the\n      chemotherapy, and will be given from home within 3 cycles. The participants will be divided\n      into 2 groups: Experimental Group (EG) who will be administering the active TENS and the\n      Control Group (CG) who will be administering the placebo TENS. The evaluation of the effects\n      will be measured through the following instruments: Classification of neuropathy by the\n      CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) version 4.02 2009, scale of\n      functionality ECOG, the Questionnaire of Neurotoxicity Induced by Antineoplastics (QNIA) for\n      the evaluation of the symptoms of CIPN, and the Analogue Visual Scale (AVS) to assess the\n      symptoms of pain and paresthesia. The error \u03b1 is estimated at 5%."
