(Phase I) II. To assess the 4 month\n      progression free survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To assess the tolerability of this regimen. (Phase II) II. To assess the response rate,\n      progression-free survival, and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.\n      (Phase II)\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To assess the time course of viral gene expression and virus elimination and\n      biodistribution of virally infected cells at various time points after infection with MV-NIS\n      versus MSC delivered MV-NIS using single-photon emission computed tomography\n      (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) imaging. (Phase II) II. To assess viremia, viral\n      replication, and measles virus shedding/persistence following intraperitoneal\n      administration. (Phase II) III. To assess humoral and cellular immune response to the\n      injected virus. (Phase II) IV. To assess in a preliminary fashion the development of\n      antitumor immune response. (Phase II)\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by phase II study.\n\n      Patients receive oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter\n      intraperitoneally (IP) over 30 minutes on day 1 of course 1 and MV-NIS infected mesenchymal\n      stem cells IP over 30 minutes of subsequent courses.
