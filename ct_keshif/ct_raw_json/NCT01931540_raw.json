            "textblock": "The prevalence of obesity in the developed world has increased markedly over the last 20\n      years. Considering the prevalence of obese and overweight adult subjects, and the fact that\n      pregnancy itself induces a state of insulin resistance and inflammation, maternal obesity\n      may be the most common health risk for the developing fetus. It is well established that\n      what we eat has a major impact on our health. However, there is growing evidence to suggest\n      that diet during pregnancy and lactation may be particularly important as not only does it\n      influence the health of the mother, it may have a permanent effect on the health of her\n      children and even her grandchildren. The concept that environmental factors, such as\n      nutrition during early development, influence both our health span and lifespan has been\n      termed the developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis.\n\n      The objective of the study are:\n\n        -  to compare subjects with frailty (condition developed with ageing) with controls and\n           characterize the unhealthy aged condition with the measurements described below\n\n        -  to examine if signs of frailty can be reversed by lifestyle induced modifications\n           (exercise training programme) of its primary components (IR, sarcopenia, psychological\n           profile) in offspring of overweight/obese vs lean mothers.\n\n      The study consists of 40 frail old subjects, age \u2265 65 sub-grouped in 20 offspring of\n      overweight and obese mothers during pregnancy, and 20 offspring of lean mothers and 15 non\n      frail controls. These subjects will be studied with positron emission tomography (PET),\n      computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) and ultra\n      sounds (US). In addition functional MRI (fMRI) will be performed. Subjects will be\n      physically examined and anthropometric data will be measured along with blood sampling.\n      Adipose tissue biopsies will be taken.\n\n      Subjects will undergo characterization of biohumoral markers, a 75 g oral glucose tolerance\n      test, imaging biomarkers (PET/CT, US, fMRI-MRS), genetic biomarkers (DNA and telomere\n      damage) and inflammatory biomarkers (macrophage infiltration) before and after the 4-month\n      lifestyle intervention period (physical exercise). By PET/CT it will be measured\n      tissue-specific IR in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, liver, intestine, myocardium and\n      targeted brain regions. MRS will be used to measure organ steatosis in the skeletal muscle\n      and liver, MRI will be used to measure fat masses in the visceral and subcutaneous abdominal\n      areas, and skeletal muscle masses in the legs, and fMRI will be performed to assess\n      activation in brain regions regulating cognition and appetite/energy control. US will be\n      used to assess cardiovascular markers (IMT, strain and function). Absolute and body weight\n      normalized values as well as fat/muscle mass ratios will indicate the diagnosis of\n      sarcopenic obesity. Frailty related osteopenia will be measured via CT. CT will be used to\n      measure fat masses around the heart and calcium score."
