A 40 ml blood sample will be\n      obtained as described below. Blood tests timing is detailed at the end in the flow chart.\n\n      Each Patient will provide 40ml of blood for the following blood tests\n\n        1.

Serum Samples will be stored for future testing.\n\n      PAT score:\n\n      Peripheral arterial tonometry signals will be obtained using the EndoPAT 2000 device (Itamar\n      Medical Inc., Caesarea, Israel), which has been validated and used previously to assess\n      peripheral arterial tone in other populations. 14-17 Briefly, EndoPAT bio-sensors are placed\n      on the index fingers of both arms. EndoPAT quantifies the endothelium-mediated changes in\n      vascular tone, elicited by a 5-minute occlusion of the brachial artery (using a standard\n      blood pressure cuff). When the cuff is released, the surge of blood flow causes an\n      endothelium-dependent Flow Mediated Dilatation (FMD). The dilatation, manifested as reactive\n      hyperemia, is captured by EndoPAT as an increase in the PAT Signal amplitude. A\n      post-occlusion to pre-occlusion ratio is calculated by the EndoPAT software, providing the\n      EndoPAT index. In addition, the EndoPAT system will measure heart rate variability."
