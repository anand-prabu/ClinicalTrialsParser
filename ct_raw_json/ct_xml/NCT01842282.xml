  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves the use of a research drug, Amlexanox, for the treatment of type 2
      diabetes, insulin resistance, obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
      Amlexanox is taken orally in a pill three times a day. The investigators plan to continue
      therapy for a period of 12 weeks followed by a follow-up 4 weeks after therapy ends. The
      investigators will evaluate the changes in metabolic parameters (e.g. blood cholesterol,
      liver function, insulin resistance) and body composition characteristics (e.g. the pattern
      of fat distribution in the body). Seven eligible subjects in this study will also be
      evaluated for a change in liver disease by a liver biopsy.
