Concomitant use of CYP3A4 strong inducers and strong inhibitors. (See Appendix 7).\n\n         29. Corrected QTc interval > 500 msec. If QTc interval is > 500 msec, then 2 additional\n             ECGs should be obtained over a brief period of time (e.g., within 15-20 minutes) to\n             confirm the abnormality.  The average QTc interval will be determined from the 3 ECG\n             tracings by manual evaluation and will be used to determine if the subject will be\n             excluded from the study.  The same method of QTc determination must be used\n             throughout the subject's participation in the trial.\n\n         30.
