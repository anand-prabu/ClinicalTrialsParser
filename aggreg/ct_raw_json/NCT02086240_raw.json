            "textblock": "The Translocator Protein (TSPO) is a protein which reaches very high levels when there is\n      inflammation in the brain.\n\n      Recently, radioligands have been developed which attach to the TSPO (a radioligand is a drug\n      which has been tagged with radioactivity). Using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging,\n      the radioligand can be detected following injection into a patient. However, it is difficult\n      to accurately measure the amount of TSPO using PET at the moment. This is because the brain\n      does not have a \"reference region\" for TSPO (ie an area in the brain with no TSPO at all).\n      \"Reference regions\" are very useful to help work out how much of a PET signal represents\n      \"specific binding\" (of the radioligand to the target of interest), and how much represents\n      \"non specific binding\" (of the radioligand to many other structures which are not of\n      interest). In the absence of a reference region, non specific binding can be estimated by\n      giving a drug which binds to the TSPO.\n\n      The drug prevents the radioligand binding the TSPO and (in a manner of speaking) \"creates\" a\n      temporary reference region so non specific binding can be measured. To do this, we will use\n      XBD173 (Emapunil is an anxiolytic drug which acts as a selective agonist at the peripheral\n      benzodiazepine receptor) to bind TSPO and block binding of the PET ligand ([11C]PBR28), a\n      TSPO ligand from the phenoxyarlyacetamide class.\n\n      Most TSPO PET studies (and in one of our previous studies approved by West London REC)\n      quantify the signal using a ratio of specific binding in the brain to radioactivity in the\n      blood. This requires arterial line insertion which is burdensome for subjects, and increases\n      variability. In this study we aim to determine the ratio of specific binding in the brain to\n      nonspecific binding in the brain by using the temporary reference region. For more accuracy\n      the participants will repeat the scanning procedure so determine test-retest variability of\n      the amount of TSPO."

The aim of this study,\n      therefore, is to develop a method to allow accurate quantification of TSPO expression in the\n      brain of healthy subjects.

Each subject will undergo:\n\n        1. Screening visit, to take blood and determine the TSPO subtype of the subject.\n\n        2. Study day 1: the subject will undergo two PET/CT scans and an MRI scan of the brain.\n           This will involve insertion of an arterial line. In between the two PET scans, the\n           subject will be given an oral dose of XBD173 (up to 90mg).\n\n        3. Study day 2: Repeat of the procedures of Study day 1. Only one MRI scan will be done\n           during one of the two study visits. Recruitment Subjects will be recruited from posters\n           (including e-posters on electronic notice boards and emails), announcements in\n           lectures, and word of mouth around Imperial College campuses Healthy volunteers between\n           1870 will be included. Women of child bearing potential will undergo a urinary\n           pregnancy test prior to scanning to ensure they are not pregnant."
