  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of the study is to determine the excess urinary fluoride and its time
      course after administration of an application of Premier Enamel Pro Varnish to the teeth of
      12-15 month old infants.  From these data the investigators can estimate the bioavailable
      (more precisely the equivalent) dose of sodium fluoride and the peak serum fluoride
      concentration that will allow an estimate of the margin of safety of the procedure.

    <textblock>
      Fluoride varnish painted on the teeth is the standard method dentists use to prevent tooth
      decay (cavities) in preschool children in the United States. Fluoride varnish is not FDA
      approved specifically for prevention of cavities, but dentists may legally use it for this
      purpose.  We want to study how much fluoride appears in the urine after the painting
      procedure to improve our knowledge of how the varnish works and its safety. The fluoride
      varnish is being used for research purposes for this study by permission of FDA (IND
      #110869).

      Premier Dental Product Company's Enamel Pro Varnish will be used.  Up to six children aged
      12-15 months will be enrolled in this study.  The participants will have two study visits,
      Arm 1 (fluoride varnish topical application) and Arm 2 (control, no intervention).  For both
      Arms of the study, 5 hours of urine collection will occur.
