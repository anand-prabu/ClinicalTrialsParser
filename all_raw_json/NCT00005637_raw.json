Courses repeat every 8 weeks for up\n      to 1 year in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of temozolomide until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years."
