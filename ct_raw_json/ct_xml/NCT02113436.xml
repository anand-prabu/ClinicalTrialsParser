      This study is a multicenter, stratified, randomized, active control, double-blinded,
      parallel-group comparative study with an open-label extension period. The study is designed
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FP/ SLM HFA MDI 50/25 microgram (mcg) one or two
      inhalation twice daily (BID) for 8 weeks in comparison with FP HFA MDI 50 mcg one or two
      inhalation BID, in 6-month to 4-year-old Japanese patients with bronchial asthma. The study
      is also designed to evaluate the safety of long-term treatment of FP/ SLM HFA MDI 50/25 mcg
      one or two BID for 16 weeks.

      The subjects meeting the eligibility criteria will enter the run-in period of 2 weeks and
      receive FP 50 mcg 1 or 2 inhalation bid (FP 100 or 200 mcg/day), before randomization. The
      subjects under 2 years of age at Visit 1 will receive only 1 inhalation bid during the
      run-in period. The subjects who meet the eligibility criteria for randomization will be
      stratified according to their age (&lt;2 or &gt;=2 year-old) at Visit 1 and randomized to one of
      the two treatment groups.

      The total duration of participation in the study will be 10 weeks for a comparison period
      completion and 27 weeks for a completion.

             in JPGL2012 as a reference. There are 3 or more episodes of marked expiratory
             wheezing, regardless of the presence of respiratory tract infection. It is also
             needed to confirm that there is asymptomatic period for about a week between each
             episode. In addition to this finding, if there is at least one of following findings,

             parents; Diseased child is diagnosed with atopic dermatitis by a physician (including
             past history); Specific IgE antibody for inhalation antigen is detected in diseased
             child; High serum IgE level in diseased child or his/her family (serum IgE level
             should be determined by considering age); Eosinophils and creola bodies found in
             sputum (examine nasal discharge eosinophilia and peripheral blood eosinophilia);
             Expiratory wheezing occurs when there is no airway infection; Expiratory wheezing and
             labored respiration or oxygen saturation are improved after beta-2 stimulant
             inhalation.

             aminophylline dose intravenous(d.i.v) or continuous isoproterenol inhalation in the
             12 months prior to Visit 1. Or a well-documented regular treatment with ICS (FP
             200-400 mcg daily or equivalent) continuous use in the 12 months prior to Visit 1;
             The patient has not received systemic glucocorticosteroids, aminophylline d.i.v. or
             continuous isoproterenol inhalation within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1.

             received medication within 2 weeks prior to Visit 1.

          -  A patient who is diagnosed upper and lower respiratory tract infection at Visit 1. Or
             a patient who has or is suspected to have deep-seated mycosis or infection to which
             no effective antibacterial agent is available. Or a patient who is suspected to have
             respiratory syncytial (RS) virus infection and cannot be identified to be negative
             for RS virus antigen.

          -  A patient who has respiratory disorder other than bronchial asthma, and the
             investigator judges the respiratory disorder affect the assessment of efficacy in
             this study.

             significant immunosuppressive agents due to risk of hepatitis B reactivation.

          -  A patient who has malformation/foreign particle lodged in an airway. Or subjects who

             corrected for heart rate (QTc) should be based on averaged QTc values of triplicate
             electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained over a brief recording period. As for the patients
             who don't has evaluable ECG data at Visit 1, if the patient has known prolonged
             QTc&gt;=450 msec (any correction is valid), the patient will be excluded.

             run-in period (excluding the day of Visit 2). Completion of symptom scores (daytime
             and night-time) on 5 or more days out of the last 7 consecutive days during the
             run-in period is required.

          -  A patient who has received systemic steroids during run-in period.

          -  A patient who has suffered from or is suspected to have upper and lower respiratory
             tract infection that may affect the assessment of the efficacy during the run-in
             period. Or a patient who has or is suspected to have deep-seated mycosis or infection
             to which no effective antibacterial agent is available during the run-in period. Or a
             patient who is suspected to have RS virus infection and cannot be identified to be
             negative for RS virus antigen during run-in period.

          -  A patient who has no evaluable ECG data during the run-in period. As for the patients
             who has evaluable ECG data during the run-in period, QTc(F) &gt;=450 msec. The QTc
             should be based on averaged QTc values of triplicate electrocardiograms (ECGs)
             obtained over a brief recording period.

          -  A patient who has not been able to appropriately record patient diary or inhale FP
             appropriately during the run-in period, in the opinion of the investigator.
