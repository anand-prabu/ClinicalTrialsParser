Interestingly, other studies have indicated that upper\n      airway muscle training may be useful in treating OSAS, but these studies used techniques\n      that were not scientifically designed{Puhan, 2006 8195 /id} or used a technique (electrical\n      stimulation) that was not well tolerated.{Lequeux, 2005 7514 /id}"

Overnight\n      sleep studies will be performed pre- and post-study. Primary outcome measurements include\n      the pre- and post-study Apnea/Hypopnea index (AHI) and daytime hypersomnolence symptom\n      scores. Each subject's total study time is approximately a 3-4 month period which includes\n      screening visit, pre and post study overnight polysomnography, and therapy sessions of 3-4 a\n      week for three months."
