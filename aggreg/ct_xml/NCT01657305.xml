  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this phase III clinical trial is to show safety and efficacy of
      Oleogel-S10 in the acceleration of Split-Thickness Skin Graft Donor Sites.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oleogel-S10 has shown efficacy and was well tolerated in previous clinical trials in
      patients with skin lesions. Especially the results in a previous study with split-thickness
      skin graft donor site suggest that Oleogel-S10 should be efficacious and safe in the
      treatment of superficial wounds.

      The present phase III clinical trial again in grade split-thickness skin graft donor sites
      is initiated in order to demonstrate the measure of wound healing progress applying
      objective methods, i.e., the time to healing and the grade of epithelialization of the
      wound.

      In this study, split-thickness skin graft donor sites are separated into two wound halves.
      Randomly assigned, one wound half receives Oleogel-S10 ointment, the other wound half
      standard of care treatment.

      Wound healing progress is documented by photos which are assessed by expert reviewers
      blinded to the treatment of the wound halves.
