  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postmenopausal subjects with an intact uterus who meet the study entry criteria will be
      randomized to one of five treatment arms (four active and one placebo) and followed for 12
      months. During the Screening period all subjects will be provided with a diary to
      self-assess the frequency and severity of their vasomotor symptoms. Subjects experiencing a
      minimum daily frequency of ≥7 (or ≥50 per week) moderate to severe hot flushes will
      participate in a VMS Substudy during the first 12 weeks of treatment. The Substudy subjects
      will be stratified by treatment arm within the sites, and only Substudy subjects have the
      possibility of being randomized to placebo.  Subjects who qualify for the study except for
      experiencing a minimum daily frequency of ≥7 (or ≥50 per week) moderate to severe hot
      flushes will be stratified within sites to one of the four active treatment arms and
      followed for 12 months, but will not participate in the VMS Substudy. (However, VMS
      information will be collected from all subjects during the first 12 weeks of treatment.) All
      Study Subjects: Postmenopausal women with an intact uterus who seek relief from hot flushes
      and meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria are eligible for 12 months of study
      treatment.

      VMS Substudy Subjects: A subset of All Study Subjects who have ≥7 per day or ≥50 per week
      moderate to severe hot flushes (as determined during Screening) are eligible for the 12-week
      VMS Substudy and for a total of 12 months of study treatment.

      Clinical evaluations will be performed at the following time points:

        -  Screening Period (Week: - 6) (up to -42 Days)

        -  Visit 1 Randomization (Week 0) (Day 1)

        -  Visit 2 Interim (Week 4)

        -  Visit 3 Interim (Week 8)

        -  Visit 4 Interim (Week 12)

        -  Visit 5 Interim (Month 6)

        -  Visit 6 Interim (Month 9)

        -  Visit 7 End of Treatment (Month 12)

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be a female between the ages of 40 and 65 years (at the time of randomization) who is
             willing to participate in the study, as documented by signing the informed consent
             form.

          2. Be a postmenopausal woman with an intact uterus and a Screening serum estradiol level
             of ≤50 pg/mL. Postmenopausal is defined herein as:

               1. ≥ 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea, or

               2. at least 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with a Screening serum FSH level of
                  &gt;40 mIU/ml, or

               3. ≥ 6 weeks postsurgical bilateral oophorectomy.

          3. Be seeking treatment or relief for vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause.

          4. To participate in the VMS Substudy, a subject must also report ≥7 moderate to severe
             hot flushes per day, or ≥50 per week, at the baseline assessment during Screening
             (subjects whose hot flushes are less frequent may still participate as non-Substudy
             subjects.

             Note: A minimum of 14 consecutive days of complete hot flush diary data are required
             during the baseline assessment at Screening, and these consecutive days must occur
             within the last 14 days prior to the Randomization visit (not counting the
             Randomization visit day itself). The most recent 7 consecutive days of data prior to
             randomization (Day -7 to Day -1) will be used to determine the baseline number of
             mild, moderate and severe hot flushes for each subject.

          5. Have a Body Mass Index (BMI) less than or equal to 34 kg/mP2P. (BMI values should be
             rounded to the nearest integer [e.g., 34.4 rounds down to 34, while 26.5 rounds up to
             27]).

          6. Be willing to abstain from using products (other than study medication) that contain
             estrogen, progestin, or progesterone throughout study participation.

          7. Be judged by the principal or sub-investigator physician as being in otherwise
             generally good health based on a medical evaluation performed during the Screening
             period prior to the initial dose of study medication. The medical evaluation findings
             must include:

               1. a normal or non-clinically significant physical examination, including vital
                  signs (sitting blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature).
                  Acceptable sitting systolic blood pressure is ≤140 mmHg and diastolic blood
                  pressure ≤90 mmHg at Screening. A subject may be taking up to two
                  antihypertensive medications.

               2. a normal or non-clinically significant pelvic examination.

               3. a mammogram that shows no sign of significant disease (can be performed within
                  previous 6 months prior to initial dose of study medication). Subjects must have
                  a BI-RADS 1 or 2 to enroll in the study. An incomplete mammogram result, i.e.
                  BI-RADS 0, is not acceptable. The site must obtain a copy of the official report
                  for the subject's study file, and it must be verified that the mammogram itself
                  is available if needed for additional assessment.

               4. a normal or non-clinically significant clinical breast examination. An
                  acceptable breast examination is defined as no masses or other findings
                  identified that are suspicious of malignancy.

               5. a normal Screening Papanicolaou (&quot;Pap&quot;) smear. (Subjects with findings of
                  atypical glandular cells [AGC], AGUS, ASCUS with high risk HPV type upon reflex
                  testing, LSIL, ASC-H, HSIL, dysplastic cells, or malignant cells must be
                  excluded from randomization.)

               6. an acceptable result from an evaluable Screening endometrial biopsy. The
                  endometrial biopsy reports by the two central pathologists at Screening must
                  each specify one of the following: proliferative endometrium; weakly
                  proliferative endometrium; disordered proliferative pattern; secretory
                  endometrium; endometrial tissue other (including benign, inactive or atrophic
                  fragments of endometrial epithelium, glands, stroma, etc); endometrial tissue
                  insufficient for diagnosis; no endometrium identified; or no tissue identified.
                  However, at least one pathologist must identify sufficient tissue to evaluate
                  the biopsy. Additionally, the endometrial biopsy reports by the two central
                  pathologists of Other Findings at Screening must each specify one of the
                  following: endometrial polyp not present; benign endometrial polyp; or polyp
                  other. (See Exclusion criterion #27)

               7. a normal or non-clinically significant 12-lead ECG.

              22. Have used, within 28 days prior to Screening, or plan to use during the study,
