Among the many types of disabilities associated\n      with MS, chronic pain is very frequent, especially neuropathic pain. This type of pain is\n      often treatment resistant. Moreover, abnormal intra-cortical excitability has been described\n      in MS patients.\n\n      On the other hand, repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) has shown an\n      analgesic effect in various chronic pain conditions (fibromyalgia, post-stroke, peripheral\n      neuropathic pain). Three groups have shown that analgesia was correlated to defective\n      intra-cortical excitability restoration.\n\n      The goal of this study is to compare the analgesic effects of two types of primary Motor\n      cortex (M1) rTMS, namely 10Hz and prolonged continuous Theta-Burst Stimulation (pcTBS), with\n      sham stimulation.\n\n      Patients will benefit from 1 daily session per day for 5 consecutive days and from a total\n      follow up of 4 weeks. Pain will be assessed each day and several other signs and symptoms\n      will be repeatedly assessed."
