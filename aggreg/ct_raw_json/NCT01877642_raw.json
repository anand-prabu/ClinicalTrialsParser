Other pharmacodynamic safety measures\n      will include effects on blood pressure, heart rate, sedation and psychomotor measures of\n      attention, information processing speed, reaction time, and coordination.\n\n      Initially, 4 subjects will receive lorazepam 1 mg IM + ADASUVE 10 mg open label to validate\n      the dose regimen. After the safety data are reviewed and the dose regimen confirmed, 18\n      non-obese, healthy male or female volunteers between the ages of 18 and 50 will be enrolled\n      in this double-blinded, double-dummy, randomized, 3-period cross-over drug interaction\n      study."
