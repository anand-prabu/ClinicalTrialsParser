Patients\n      achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for an additional 8 months after\n      reaching CR.\n\n      Tumors are measured every 1-3 months during the first 2 years, every 3-4 months during the\n      third and fourth years, every 4-6 months during the fifth year, and yearly thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
