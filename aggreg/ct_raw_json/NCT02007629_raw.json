            "textblock": "BAY63-2521 Riociguat leads to the relaxation of muscle cells localized in organs and blood\n      vessels which also affects cells of the lung blood vessels. Furthermore there is some basis\n      to believe that Riociguat also may inhibit an abnormal reorganization of smaller lung blood\n      vessels. In patients with pulmonary hypertension it was confirmed that the compound is able\n      to reduce the pulmonary blood pressure which has a positive impact on the heart function\n      without unacceptable side effects. In this study Riociguat will be given orally for 24\n      weeks. The dose of the study drug will be increased over 8 weeks and then followed by a\n      Maintenance Phase of 16 weeks. Targeted for this study are pulmonary hypertension patients\n      treated with Phosphodiesterase Type-5 Inhibitors (eg Sildenafil, Tadalafil) but without\n      sufficient clinical response to therapy as assessed by the treating physician. Based on the\n      promising results from previous clinical trials an improvement of the exercise capacity, the\n      heart function and the quality of life may be expected.\n\n      In case Riociguat does not have a market approval or is not reimbursed by the insurance once\n      the individual treatment phase is completed drug can be made available for another max 18\n      months under study conditions."
