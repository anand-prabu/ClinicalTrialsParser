  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a pilot study. In this pilot study we are testing the safety of a
      procedure. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the Albumin bound paclitaxel (Abraxane) is still
      being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it. It also means
      that the FDA has not approved Abraxane injection for your type of medical condition.
      Treatment of pancreatic cysts often requires follow-up imaging studies and surgical
      resection of the cysts. As part of standard medical care, you will be undergoing a
      diagnostic endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) in order to
      evaluate type of the cyst. During the EUS and just after the cyst fluid aspiration, you will
      undergo the injection of the drug into the cyst cavity if your cyst is thought to be
      cancerous or precancerous. Cyst fluid will be analyzed for further diagnosis.

      You will be asked to undergo some screening tests or procedures to find out if you can be in
      the research study. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular
      cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not take part in the research
      study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures recently, they may or may not have
      to be repeated. Screening tests include the following: medical history, performance status,
      assessment of pancreatic cyst by CT, MRI or EUS, blood tests and a pregnancy test.

      If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will
      begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria you will not be able
      to participate in this research study.

      As part of your medical care you will be undergoing an endoscopic procedure EUS-FNA
      (Endoscopic Ultrasound Fine Needle Aspiration) in order to evaluate and evacuate the cyst
      fluid. During the EUS-FNA and just after the cyst fluid aspiration, albumin bound paclitaxel
      will be injected into the cyst cavity.

      The study procedure (injection of drug into cyst cavity) takes place over 5 minutes during
      the EUS-FNA. 2 days after the procedure you will receive a phone call from the research
      coordinator to check on how you are feeling. 3 months after study procedure participants
      will undergo a follow up CT to see what happened to the cyst. You will continue to have
      routine follow up for your medical problems.

    <description>The primary endpoint of the study will be the determination of the safety of injection of albumin-bound paclitaxel. Safety of the procedure will be measured by the frequency of pancreatitis. Laboratory testing will be performed 2 days after procedure</description>

    <measure>Determine feasibility of EUS guided injection of albumin-bound paclitaxel into pancreatic cysts</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The feasibility of the procedure will be measured by the ease of injection of albumin-bound paclitaxel into the cyst cavity across the gastro-duodenal wall. On a subjective scale, the endoscopist will note the ease of the procedure on a scale of 0-5, with 5 being very easy and 0 is not possible. Any score less than 2 will be considered unacceptable and failure of the study.
Total procedure time will be recorded. If the cyst injection and lavage take more than 10 minutes, we will consider this a failure.</description>
