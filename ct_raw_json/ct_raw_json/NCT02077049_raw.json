Secondly the\n      study explores to which extend balance and mobility performances vary according to the mode\n      of self-training.\n\n      The primary study hypothesis is that elderly people practice longer and more frequently with\n      serious games than with a conventional exercise booklet. The secondary hypothesis is that\n      patients experience a significant higher improvement in their balance capacity by using\n      serious games compared to patients performing conventional exercises."

            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      The Swiss population, and in Europe in general, is getting older. Due to this evolving\n      demographic trend, the need to develop specific healthcare services for this age group is\n      becoming crucial. From the international literature, evidence-based findings have\n      demonstrated that physical abilities of elderly people can be increased, and institutional\n      placement and mortality can be reduced through specific inpatient rehabilitation programs\n      (Bachmann, Finger et al. 2010).\n\n      Adults 65 years and older should carry out aerobic physical activities for at least 150\n      minutes of moderate intensity or for 75 minutes of high intensity in a week. Besides it is\n      strongly recommended that senior adults perform strengthening exercises minimum twice a week\n      and activities promoting balance minimum thrice a week (WHO 2010; NIH 2013).\n\n      In order to increase the training intensity and thus the independence in activities of daily\n      living, older patients admitted in Kliniken Valens are instructed with a customized\n      self-training program, in addition to the usual rehabilitation services. As for\n      therapist-assisted sessions, this self-training program leads to significant improvement of\n      patient's physical performance (Olney, Nymark et al. 2006) and represents therefore a\n      proven, efficient and cost-effective intervention for inpatient settings. However, the\n      compliance of elderly people to execute self-training exercises varies considerably. These\n      programs are often considered as tedious and boring, and so prematurely stopped (Phillips,\n      Schneider et al. 2004). An alternative to increase patient's motivation could be through\n      serious games practice. Kliniken Valens has already experienced promising results with\n      computer-based games such as the Nintendo Wii\u00ae (Schnurr and Oesch 2012).\n\n      Methods:\n\n      In this study participants are categorized in 4 strata according to their Berg Balance Score\n      (BBS) (\u2264 44 or \u226545) and their computer skills. Subsequently they are allocated randomly\n      either in the intervention group or in the control group. In addition to the usual\n      rehabilitation services provided in the clinic, participants of both groups are entitled to\n      2 additional time-slots (2 x 30 min/day) devoted to self-training and this during the 10\n      days of the intervention period. This protocol ensures the same conditions for each\n      participant to perform or not self-training exercises. For safety measures, participants\n      with a low BBS (<45) perform the program in siting, whereas those with a higher BBS (\u226545)\n      practice in standing position (in front of a bench). The time frame of the intervention\n      phase (from t1 to t2) lasts 10 working days and starts after self-training exercises have\n      been instructed. In other words, t1 equates to approximately day 4 after the patient's\n      admission in the clinic and t2 is 10 working days later, i.e. approximately day 16 after\n      admission.\n\n      Intervention group:\n\n      The participants are instructed by experienced physiotherapists on serious games with\n      Kinect\u00ae. Additionally, participants wear the Fit Bit\u00ae (an activity tracker device) and are\n      encouraged to walk and climb stairs instead of using the escalator. Finally participants are\n      asked to write down in a logbook, the frequency and duration of their self-training\n      sessions.\n\n      Control group:\n\n      As in the usual rehabilitation services, experienced physiotherapists arrange a customized\n      self-training program, instruct the exercises and deliver a hand-out. Additionally, patients\n      are encouraged to walk and climb stairs instead of using the escalator. Finally participants\n      are asked to write down in a logbook, the frequency and duration of their self-training\n      sessions.\n\n      Data collection:\n\n      Data on self-training's intensity (primary outcome) are extracted from the logbook at\n      post-intervention (t2) i.e. after the 10 working days of the intervention phase. The Berg\n      Balance Scale and the Falls Efficacy Scale (secondary outcomes) are completed by a blinded\n      researcher at pre- and post-intervention (before t1 and after t2) i.e. approximately at day\n      1-2 after admission and day 16-17 after admission.\n\n      Data analysis:\n\n      Data are analyzed using the statistical software for social sciences (SPSS). The statistical\n      analysis of the two groups is performed following a normal distribution of data, with an\n      unmatched t-test. For non-normal distributions, the Mann-Whitney U test is used."
