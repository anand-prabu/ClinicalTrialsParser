            "textblock": "Primary objective: Test the hypothesis that Paricalcitol, an active form of vitamin D\n      improves  endothelial function in stage 3-4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.\n\n      Secondary analysis: Study the relationship between endothelial function and plasma/serum and\n      genetic biomarkers of bone mineral disorders in CKD (BMD-CKD) and renin\n      angiotensin-aldosteron system (RAS) (angiotensin II and plasma renin activity).\n\n      Background:\n\n      Endothelial function is altered in patients with CKD. Factors responsible for disturbed\n      endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in CKD include reduced bioactivity of the nitric oxide\n      (NO) pathway with decreased endothelial NO synthase (NOS) activity or inhibition via\n      accumulation of endogenous inhibitors.  In patients  with CKD and in those on dialysis\n      serum 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3 levels are associated with FMD. Vitamin D receptors and 1\n      -hydroxylase activity are present in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells and\n      1,25(OH)2D3 stimulates vascular endothelial growth factor and   prostacyclin production by\n      vascular smooth muscle cells. These biological observations may have clinical implications\n      because paricalcitol treatment predicts longer survival in ESRD patients and  very recent\n      data  link vitamin D to  progression to ESRD in patients with stage 3-5 CKD. Furthermore, a\n      previous study by us has shown that the  BMSI polymorphism of the vitamin D receptor  gene\n      is associated with  LVH and LVH progression in ESRD patients.\n\n      Study population: Patients  with stage 3-4 CKD of both sexes in the age range 18-80 years.\n      Patients taking vitamin D supplements, with abnormal liver function tests, symptomatic\n      cardiovascular disease, diabetes  or cancer and those whose medications changed during the\n      study were excluded.\n\n      Design and Methods: The study was a double-blind, randomized, parallel groups trial. After\n      baseline measurements, patients with iPTH level > 65 pg/ml; Ca between 8.4- 10.00 mg/dL and\n      P between 2.9-4.5 were randomized to receive 2 micrograms Paricalcitol capsules (or matching\n      placebo) daily, for 12 weeks. This doses was adjusted based on clinical laboratory\n      parameters and the maximum dose was 2 micrograms daily.\n\n      During the study if a subject experienced over suppression of serum iPTH (defined as a serum\n      iPTH <15 pg/mL), or hypercalcemia (defined as Ca > 11.0 mg/dL), the subject continued to\n      take study drug at reduced dosage 1 mcg any other day and returned in 2 weeks for an\n      unscheduled visit. If the values from the unscheduled visit serum iPTH and/or Ca did not\n      returned to > 15 pg/mL and/or <11.0 mg/dL, respectively, the drug was discontinued.\n\n      Flow mediated vasodilatation was measured according to a validated protocol developed at the\n      coordinating center of a national (Italian)working group of vascular function testing.\n\n      Primary end-point:  Change in Flow Mediated  Dilatation (FMD) induced by Paricalcitol in\n      comparison to Placebo.\n\n      Study power: To detect a 2% difference (standard deviation: \u00b1 3.0%) in the change in FMD\n      between Paracalcitol treated and untreated patients with a power of 80 %, a confidence level\n      using a two-tailed test  of 5% and a potential attrition rate of 15%, at least 44 patients\n      per group were required (88 patients in total).\n\n      Statistical analysis:  Data will be summarized as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (normally\n      distributed data), median and inter-quartile range (non normally distributed data) or as\n      percent frequency, and comparison between groups will be made by independent T-Test,\n      Mann-Whitney Test, or Chi Square test, as appropriate. Within patients comparisons will be\n      done by statistical tests for paired observations. Data analysis of the primary outcome will\n      be performed by comparing the changes in FMD in Paracalcitol treated and untreated patients\n      by using the T-Test for independent observations.  Possible differences in risk factors at\n      baseline not controlled by randomization (i.e. differences due to chance) will be accounted\n      for by using multivariate regression analyses."

After baseline recording (1 min) a standard sphygmomanometer was placed on the right forearm 2 cm below the elbow and the cuff was inflated to 250 mmHg for 5 min. Recordings were performed during the 4 min following cuff deflation to estimate endothelium-dependent FMD. In studies of endothelium-independent vasodilatation recording times were 1 min for the baseline assessment and 5 min for changes in arterial diameter brought about by GTN. An interval of at least 1h was set between the last FMD assessment and GTN administration. All scans were recorded, stored and analyzed off-line. FMD and GTN were computed as the maximal % increase in diameter over baseline by an automatic edge detection system.",
