  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a life-threatening condition marked by rapid decline in kidney
      function  in patients with liver cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure. Vasodilation in the
      gastrointestinal region is largely thought to contribute to the disease.  LJPC-501 is a
      vasoconstrictor that may restore proper circulation and kidney function in patients with
      HRS.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vasoconstrictors are considered a promising approach to treat HRS due to the significant
      vasodilation of the splanchnic circulation that contributes to systemic arterial
      underfilling and leads to functional decline of the kidney in these patients.
      Vasoconstrictors currently in use are associated with reduced organ perfusion and have
      marginal effect on sodium excretion.  The vasoconstrictor angiotensin II has been shown to
      produce significant sodium excretion and urine output in patients with cirrhosis and
      ascites, supporting its potential utility in the treatment of HRS.

    <description>Patients will receive LJPC-501 at titrated doses, with a starting range from 1 to 100 ng/kg/min, by continuous infusion on Days 1 through 5.  In Group 1, drug doses will be titrated to 5, 15, and 25 ng/kg/min, after which doses will be titrated in multiples of 25 ng/kg/min.  In Groups 2-5, drug doses will be titrated by 25 ng/kg/min.  Dose titrations will occur every 2 hours until a MAP of 110 mmHg is reached, maximum urine output is achieved, or a dose of 250 ng/kg/min is achieved.  Dosing will then continue at the maximum dose achieved through Day 5.</description>
