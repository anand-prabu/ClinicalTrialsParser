The investigators have developed a differentiated\n      sequencing assay, Digital Sequencing Technology (DST) that enables detection of rare genomic\n      abnormalities with ultra high-specificity and sensitivity. The investigators assay is able\n      to eliminate the error and distortion created by sample-prep and sequencing processes in\n      standard NGS(next-generation sequencing ) workflows and produce near-perfect representations\n      of all rare variants.\n\n      The investigators have shown that in sequencing a comprehensive cancer panel of 80kbp in\n      0.1% cancer cell line titration samples, standard Illumina SBS(sequencing by synthesis )\n      generates many high-quality false positive variant calls in the range of 0.05-5%, while the\n      investigators assay resulted in highly sensitive and completely error-free variant calls\n      across the entire panel.\n\n      This work indicates the remarkable potential of using the investigators assay in deep\n      analysis of cfDNA, thereby allowing researchers and clinicians to comprehensively and\n      non-invasively monitor the genetic dimension of cancer throughout the body."
