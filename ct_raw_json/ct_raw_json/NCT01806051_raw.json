            "textblock": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare genetic metabolic disease caused by a mutation that codes\n      for an enzyme that converts the essential amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) into tyrosine. An\n      absence or deficiency of this enzyme activity results in a Phe elevation, where higher Phe\n      levels result in neurological damage. Diurnal variations of Phe levels have been observed in\n      PKU patients in a 24-hour period.\n\n      As Kuvan has shown to stabilize Phe levels in PKU patients over time, our hypothesis is that\n      this can be demonstrated within a 24-hour period of observation and indicate therefore that\n      Kuvan may correlate with a lower plasma Phe variability. This study on PKU patients' diurnal\n      variation will also provide  important information as to the current method of blood Phe\n      monitoring in a clinical setting to learn more about the optimal way to measure Phe\n      concentration.\n\n      The study will last about 4 weeks (6 study visits) for the PKU participants and about 1 week\n      (2 study visits) for the control group.\n\n      Participants will be required to follow a recommended diet, complete a dietary log, and\n      undergo several blood draws, including a 24-Hour Blood Assessment in which blood will be\n      obtained 8 times throughout the day."
