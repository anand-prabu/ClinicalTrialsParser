The dose of fructose is escalated in each\n      successive group after tolerability data are evaluated.\n\n      In the second part of the study, patients are randomly assigned (1:1) to fructose or placebo\n      administered intravenously every 6 hours for 72 hours. The dose of fructose is the highest\n      well-tolerated dose determined in Study 1 or the most tolerated dose for the patient.\n      Patients who just completed Study 1 may participate if they are clearly in a separate crisis\n      and continue to meet entry criteria.\n\n      Patients whose symptoms persist for more than 72 hours after fructose or placebo are\n      eligible to receive additional fructose every 6 hours until symptoms subside."
