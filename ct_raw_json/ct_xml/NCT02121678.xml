  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resistance and aerobic exercise has been shown to be effective for maintenance of muscle
      strength in patients with neuromuscular diseases.

      Exercise in CIDP and MMN is sparsely described. The aim of the study is to evaluate changes
      in muscle strength during high intensive resistance training and changes in maximal oxygen
      consumption (VO2-max) during high intensive aerobic training in patients with CIDP or MMN in
      maintenance therapy with subcutaneous immunoglobulin.

      The hypotheses are that muscle strength and VO2-max are significantly increased during the
      training sessions.

    <description>Participants do resistance training of selected muscle groups. Resistance are predefined from 1-repetition max (1-RM) and increased during the 12 weeks of training:
Week 0-4: 70-80 % of 1-RM
Week 5-8: 75-86 % of 1-RM
Week 9-12: 80-92% of 1-RM
Participants trains unilateral, the opposite site serves as reference.
MMN patients train elbow (flexion/extension) and wrist (flexion/extension)
CIDP patients train knee (flexion/extension) and elbow (flexion/extension)</description>

    <description>Participants train on ergometer bicycle 2 times weekly increasing during the first weeks to 3 times weekly. Workload is measured before initiation and VO2-max, heart rate and blood pressure will be measured as well.
Patients train with 60-75 % of VO2-max for 30 minutes per training session. They use heart rate monitor to store data.</description>
