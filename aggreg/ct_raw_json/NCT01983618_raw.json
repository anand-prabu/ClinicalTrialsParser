            "textblock": "Beachchair position is used by many orthopaedic surgeons for shoulder surgery. Most patients\n      undergoing surgery in this position have no complications.  However, reported  cases of\n      postoperative neurological deficits have highlighted the risk of cerebral and spinal cord\n      ischemia. The etiology of such complications remains unclear.  The most plausible\n      explanation for these events would be intraoperative hypotension followed by cerebral\n      hypoperfusion.\n\n      General anesthesia is commonly used for shoulder surgery in conjunction with interscalene\n      brachial plexus blockade. During the block, local anesthetic's spread is frequently observed\n      leading to a block of sympathetic fibres. Since all nerves located in the head and neck area\n      go through the stellate ganglion, its block will cause a sympathetic denervation and a\n      decrease of the peripheral vascular resistance, thus increasing the circulation in cerebral\n      blood vessels. In normal situations, there is a vasoconstriction of the cerebral blood\n      vessels in response to a sympathetic stimulation and a vasodilation if sympathetic fibres\n      are blocked.\n\n      Transcranial Doppler (TCD) is a non-invasive examination that provides a reliable evaluation\n      of intracranial blood flow in real-time. It can help to detect sudden changes in perfusion\n      and identify potential embolic events. Some studies using TCD have shown an increased\n      ipsilateral cerebral blood flow (CBF) secondary to a reduced vascular tone associated with a\n      stellate ganglion block. Others have shown a reduction of contralateral CBF that could\n      theoretically increase the risk of ischemia in the affected area.\n\n      This study will assess the role of interscalene nerve blockade in the protection of cerebral\n      ischemia and preservation of cerebral autoregulation. This study will also aim to identify\n      changes in contralateral CBF.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that:\n\n        1. Interscalene nerve block will increase CBF\n\n        2. Interscalene nerve block will not decrease contralateral CBF\n\n        3. Cerebral autoregulation will be preserved under general anesthesia in conjunction with\n           an interscalene nerve block in this setting."

In case of inadequate results, the patient's participation to the\n      study will be terminated.\n\n      The interscalene nerve block will be performed or simulated according to randomization. In\n      the interscalene nerve block group, the attending anaesthesiologist will assess the success\n      of the block and record the presence or absence of Horner's syndrome. The transcranial\n      Doppler operator will be blinded to these observations.  Following a real or simulated\n      interscalene block, the patient will undergo a second bilateral TCD in supine position\n      before induction of anesthesia.\n\n      The anesthetic technique and monitoring will be standardized.  After the induction of\n      anesthesia, a bilateral TCD will be performed with the patient in supine position.  Another\n      examination will be performed under general anesthesia immediately after and 30 minutes\n      following the installation of the patient in the beachchair position.  A last TCD will be\n      performed after a reduction of end-tidal carbon dioxide at 30 mm Hg.\n\n      For each examination, the arterial blood pressure must be stabilized for at least 5 minutes\n      before the Doppler can be initiated. Arterial blood pressure will be measured during each\n      examination. Type, duration of surgery and beachchair position will be recorded.\n      Vasopressor therapy will be noted.  Body temperature, end-tidal carbon dioxide and minimum\n      alveolar concentration of desflurane will be collected during each examination performed\n      under general anesthesia."
