      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the inter-observer concordance when
      measuring the maximum value of the external antero-posterior diameter of the sub-renal aorta
      (both cross-sectional and longitudinal ultrasound views are measured).  The first measure is
      made by a general practitioner in private practice; second reading are made by an expert in
      vascular medicine.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

      A. To assess the prevalence of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) detected by ultrasound
      measurement of the anterior and posterior longitudinal outer diameter of the sub-renal
      abdominal aorta in a high cardiovascular risk population consulting with general
      practitioners (defined according to recommendations stated by the French Society of Vascular
      Medicine).

      B. To assess the prevalence of Peripheral Obliterative Arteriopathy of the Legs (POAL) by
      measuring the Systolic Pressure Index (SPI) at the toe (ratio of arterial pressure in upper
      limbs versus lower limbs). Measures are made ​​by a general practitioner in the same
      population.

      C. To assess the quality and interpretability of ultrasound recordings and ultrasound
      acquistion failure rate. These second measures are made by an expert in vascular medecine.
      This evaluation with use a 3-level scale:

        1. appropriate image was not obtained or not recognized expert - uninterpretable

        2. poor image quality - interpretable

        3. image of good or very good quality - interpretable

      D. To calculate the impact of risk cofactors such as hypertension , smoking, age and family
      history among patients diagnosed with AAA.

      E. Evaluation of general practitioner training from a qualitative and quantitative point of
      view after 4 h of training organized by Dr. Bobbià .
