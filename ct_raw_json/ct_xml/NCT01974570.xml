  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is an important risk factor of cardiovascular (CVD) and renal diseases.
      Epidemiological studies show that there is a direct relationship between blood pressure and
      CVD, and cardiovascular mortality increases progressively throughout the range of blood
      pressure, including the prehypertensive range.  There is also evidence from cell and animal
      studies that shrimp tissue hydrolysates may have higher ACE inhibitory activity than other
      marine protein hydrolysates.  It is hypothesized that Marealis RPC (refined peptide
      concentrate)will lower systolic blood pressure in subjects with elevated blood pressure.
