While there are many bowel preparations available,\n      most of them remain expensive and require prescription from a health provider.  The\n      investigators believe EZ2go Complete will provide a non-inferior colon cleansing in a more\n      accessible way (over-the-counter).\n\n      To accomplish this goal, the investigators decided to evaluate the proposed EZ2go\n      combination versus currently available over-the-counter bowel preparations.  The\n      investigators believe the EZ2go kit will not be inferior to current FDA approved\n      over-the-counter bowel preparations."
