The LIST was performed on three occasions, at the same time of day, each separated by approximately four weeks. Following each exercise trial, one of three recovery interventions were applied, the order of which were randomly allocated."

A novel technique of neuromuscular electrical\n      stimulation (NMES) via the peroneal nerve has been shown to augment limb blood flow which\n      could enhance recovery following exercise. The present study examined the effects of NMES,\n      compared to graduated compression socks on muscle soreness, strength, and markers of muscle\n      damage and inflammation following intense intermittent exercise."
