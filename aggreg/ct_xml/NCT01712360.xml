    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see how the body is affected when a study drug is applied to
      both feet if the subject has athlete's foot or to both feet and the groin area if the
      subject have both athlete's foot and jock itch. Safety of the drug and how well the drug
      works will also be measured.

      Study population, diagnosis, and main criteria for inclusion:

      Tinea pedis and Tinea cruris (NAFT-500):

      Male or non-pregnant female subjects aged 12 to 17 years, 11 months old of any race with
      Tinea pedis and Tinea cruris infections confirmed by a positive KOH analysis from both the
      feet and bikini area. Both cases (feet and bikini area) must be characterized by clinical
      evidence of a Tinea pedis and Tinea cruris infection. Additional, approximately 4 PK
      evaluable adult subjects with the same condition will serve as a control.

      Tinea pedis (NAFT-600):

      Male or non-pregnant female subjects aged 12 to 17 years, 11 months old of any race with
      Tinea pedis infection confirmed by a positive KOH analysis from both feet. Both feet must be
      characterized by clinical evidence of a Tinea pedis infection. Additional, approximately 4
      PK evaluable adult subjects with the same condition will serve as a control.
