      Background: The study aim was to compare the efficacy of dexmedetomidine versus midazolam
      for sedation during the early postoperative period in children who underwent scoliosis
      surgery.

      Methods: We performed a prospective, randomized trial in an intensive care unit (ICU) in a
      tertiary care center. In this study, 42 patients (American Society of Anesthesiology
      physical status I and II) who underwent scoliosis surgery were divided into 2 groups
      according to sedation protocols: group DEX (n = 22) and group MDZ (n = 20). Children (12-18
      years) requiring mechanical ventilation underwent a continuous infusion of either
      dexmedetomidine (group DEX; starting dose, 0.4 μg•kg-1•h-1) or midazolam (group MDZ;
      starting dose, 0.1 mg•kg-1•h-1) with intermittent fentanyl, as needed. The efficacy of
      sedation was assessed using the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS). Quality of pain
      relief was measured using the Numeric Visual Analog Scale (NVAS). During the arousal
      assessment, delirium was determined in patients in the RASS range of -2 to +1 using the
      Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU). Fentanyl consumption, incidence of
      delirium, NVAS scores, and hemodynamics were recorded postoperatively at 2, 4, 6, and 24 h
      in the ICU.
