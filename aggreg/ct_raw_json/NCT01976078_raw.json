            "textblock": "The death rate in children from the invasive fungal infection called aspergillosis is more\n      than 50%. Voriconazole is the first-line therapy for this infection. In a previous\n      publication the investigators have shown a highly significant relationship between\n      voriconazole plasma concentrations and survival. However, voriconazole dosing is currently\n      poorly established, and plasma drug exposure varies between children by 400% or more, even\n      after intravenous dosing. The objective of this study is to investigate the reasons for this\n      variability in voriconazole pharmacokinetics (PK).In two studies, the investigators will\n      enroll 80 children/adolescents receiving oral or intravenous voriconazole, divided by age\n      under 2 years (n=15), and 2-18 years (n=65).  From each patient the investigators will\n      collect the following: 1) a blood sample for detection of several genetic changes known to\n      affect drug metabolizing enzyme (DME) activity; 2) up to 9 blood samples after a\n      voriconazole dose for measurement of voriconazole (\"PK sampling\"); 3) follow-up samples\n      after each PK sampling visit if necessary to adjust the dose so that voriconazole\n      concentrations in the blood are satisfactory (known as therapeutic drug monitoring or TDM).\n      At the time of the voriconazole dose prior to the PK sampling, we will also give single IV\n      or oral (corresponding to the route of voriconazole administration) low doses of\n      esomeprazole (an antacid), midazolam (a sedative), and ranitidine (an antacid) as a cocktail\n      to test or probe DME activity. All of these medications are used commonly in children\n      already. The investigators will estimate DME activity or phenotype using ratios of probe\n      drug metabolite to parent drug concentrations, while simultaneously quantifying the amount\n      of DME genetic material (mRNA) and protein in white blood cells. The investigators will test\n      associations between DME activity, mRNA, protein, voriconazole PK, age, sex, and degree of\n      illness. The investigators will also use a computer program to integrate all these data to\n      develop a comprehensive model that will predict blood concentrations of voriconazole in\n      children of all ages, as well as assist physicians and pharmacists to dose voriconazole more\n      accurately.The total study duration for each subject will be until after the TDM follow up\n      visit, generally about one week."
