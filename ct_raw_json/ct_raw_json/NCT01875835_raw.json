The\n      effectiveness of DES to reduce restenosis and the need for revascularization compared with\n      bare-metal stents (BMS) has been documented in randomized controlled trials. The\n      first-generation DESs implanted in STEMI have been associated with delayed healing and\n      incomplete strut coverage. Therefore, in patients with implanted DES, longer duration of\n      dual antiplatelet therapy is needed. The second-generation DESs (ZES and EES) have been\n      improved the drug and polymer, which have been proved to improve neointima healing compared\n      with the first generation DESs.\n\n      However, the difference of strut coverage between EES and BMS implanted in STEMI patients is\n      unknown. In this study, we assess the neointimal coverage at 3-month and 12-month follow-up\n      in EES and BMS implanted in patients with STEMI by optical coherence tomography."
