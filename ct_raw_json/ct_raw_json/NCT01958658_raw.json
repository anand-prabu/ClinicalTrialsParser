WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some\n      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work\n      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by\n      stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells.\n      Giving WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 with cisplatin and radiation therapy may be an effective\n      treatment for cervical cancer."

To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and safety profile of MK-1775 (WEE1\n      inhibitor MK-1775) in combination with cisplatin and radiation in patients with cervical\n      cancer (phase I).\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of MK-1775 drugs when administered in combination\n      with cisplatin and radiation (in particular, for the 15 patients treated in an expansion\n      cohort at the RP2D). Pharmacodynamic biomarkers will include: phosphorylated cell division\n      cycle protein 2 homolog (pCDC2), antigen Ki-67 (Ki67), gamma H2A histone family, member X\n      (\u03b3H2AX), phospho-histone (pH3), and cleaved caspase-3 (CC3).\n\n      II. To obtain preliminary information about the progression-free survival of MK-1775 in\n      combination with standard radiation and chemotherapy in women with locally advanced\n      high-risk cervix cancer.\n\n      III. To determine the acute and late toxicity of MK-1775 when administered to patients with\n      cervix cancer in combination with standard radiation and concurrent chemotherapy.\n\n      IV. To correlate the serum pharmacokinetic parameters\u2014maximum concentration (Cmax), time to\n      peak concentration (Tmax), 8-hours concentration (C8), and area under the curve (AUC)\n      (0-8)\u2014with the drug concentration in the tumor tissue (for patients in the expansion\n      cohort).\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775.
