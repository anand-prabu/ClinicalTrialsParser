To ensure that running can be practiced as a safe exercise\n      activity prevention must be considered."

Fortunately, training errors can be avoided\n      as training characteristics (distance, duration, pace) can be controlled by the runner.\n\n      In order to avoiding training errors, especially excessive volume many novice runners follow\n      0-5 kilometres type training programmes. However, limited research has been conducted on the\n      training volume of beginner programs and the risk of running related injuries.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between the running volume the\n      first 4 weeks of a running regime and the risk of running related injuries among novice\n      runners. The relationship between running volume and running related injuries will be\n      investigated in proportion to their body mass index (BMI)."
