  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if rice enriched in iron will help women with
      iron-deficient anemia restore their blood counts more efficiently than the standard rice not
      enriched with iron.

      The study will consist of 1 screening visit and 3 study visits.  The two-week study will be
      scheduled to be between menses.

      You will then be assigned to eat regular rice dishes or rice dishes fortified with iron for
      the two-week period.  The assignment to the rice group will be made randomly (like flipping
      a coin).  Your chance of being in either rice group will be 50:50.  You will be given 14
      frozen rice meals in styrofoam containers to take home.  You will be expected to eat two
      rice dishes per day for the next study week and to bring the empty containers to your next
      study visit.
