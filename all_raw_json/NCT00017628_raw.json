PBSCs are collected over several days.  Patients who do not\n      mobilize sufficient cells undergo bone marrow harvest.  Harvested PBSCs or bone marrow then\n      undergo T-lymphocyte depletion.\n\n      Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -6 and -5 and methylprednisolone IV\n      daily on days -4 to -1.  Patients also undergo total body irradiation twice a day on days -4\n      to -1.  Lymphocyte-depleted PBSCs or bone marrow is reinfused on day 0.  Patients receive\n      G-CSF SC daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts have recovered for 3\n      days.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months and then annually for 5 years."
