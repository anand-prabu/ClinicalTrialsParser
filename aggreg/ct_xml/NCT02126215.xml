      Hypothesis: Patients with blue cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) regional maps during a
      hypercapnic CO2 challenge will be at greater risk of developing post-operative delirium
      (POD) and stroke following abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surgery. The blue CVR map will be
      shown to be predictive of POD and stroke and ultimately represent a diagnostic test for
      patients at risk. These blue CVR maps will enable neurologic risk stratification for
      patients undergoing AAA. A secondary hypothesis is that location and extent of the blue CVR
      maps will strongly indicate risk of neurologic sequelae after operative procedures.
      Background: AAA surgery is associated with a significant risk of postoperative morbidity and
      mortality. POD is a dreaded complication with such anesthesia and surgery. The prevalence of
      delirium after cardiac surgery has been reported to occur in up to 50% of patients. Using a
      definitive diagnostic tool such as the Confusion Assessment Method - Intensive Care Unit
      (CAM-ICU) results in the higher proportion reported. Delirium is a serious complication that
      results in prolonged length of stay, increased health care costs, and higher mortality. As
      much as $6.9 billion of Medicare hospital expenditures can be attributed to delirium. At
      such a cost, better diagnosis and treatment is urgently needed. Pre-emptive diagnosis
      leading to better management of delirium post-operatively is clearly one of the fundamental
      problems confronting modern anesthesia and peri-operative medicine.

      Specific Objectives: The investigators seek to address (a) the identity of patients who have
      the greatest vulnerability to the surgery and (b) investigate the risks and test appropriate
      risk mitigations. Understanding POD is of immense import to help control a hospital's
      surgical and critical care costs. Patients with neurological consequences including POD
      often represent a choke point for optimized critical care utilization. At the very least,
      improved understanding and a diagnostic test to highlight patients at risk of POD would be
      most welcome. Such an advance would permit rational strategies to limit the problem and
      allow better designed therapeutic arcs for patients now known to be at risk. This is
      especially important for patients undergoing complicated AAA surgery and is the focus of
      this pilot project.

      Methods: Informed witnessed consent will be obtained from all participants. Patients will
      have a Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) prior to their MRI studies. This will take 10 - 15
      minutes. Patients will have CVR maps with blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD-MRI) pulse
      sequences done with standard RespirAct (a computer-controlled gas blender) protocols in
      association with anatomic imaging in a 3.0 Tesla magnet. The clinical care team and patient
      will be blinded as to the CVR results. Patients will have standardized anesthesia and per
      usual approaches for their AAA surgery and have standard POD assessment tools (CAM-ICU).
      Storage of anesthesia hemodynamics will be to digital data acquisition systems for later
      collation. End-tidal CO2 will be targeted at 40 mmHg during the surgical procedure and if
      ventilated for any period post-operatively. Standard fast-track protocols and admission to
      the surgical special care unit (SSCU) will be undertaken to facilitate patient management.
      Any patient with obvious POD, post-op delirium or stroke will be managed per usual
      protocols. Prior to discharge a second 3.0T CVR imaging sequence will be done - and
      additional diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) pulse sequencing (a sensitive approach to
      identify low level ischemia). Multiple CVR maps (650 studies) have been done at University
      Health Network in Toronto.

      Significance/Importance: This study has the potential to make an important contribution in
      the understanding of POD for all surgical procedures and specifically a window into the
      problem with AAA. A positive study based on our hypothesis can fundamentally change our
      understanding of cognitive dysfunction after surgery. Large follow-up multicentre trials can
      be constructed based on initial findings from this pilot study if the study bears fruit. At
      the least, further elucidation into POD for AAA is expected with this study.
