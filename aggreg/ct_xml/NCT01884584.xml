  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The surgeon may remove a very small amount of additional tissue compared to what would be
      removed if you were not enrolled in the study.  This tissue may prove to contain tumor or it
      may contain normal tissue. The surgical cavity will be examined by a special laser pen after
      the tumor is removed, and if areas of fluorescence are seen, that may indicate tumor cells
      where the ICG dye collected are still remaining and the surgeon would then remove those.
      After the tumor and the tissue around it are removed and sent to the laboratory, the tissue
      may be examined using that same laser pen to see where the cancer cells are and compare that
      to what the laboratory sees when it looks at the tumor and tissue with a microscope.  It is
      hoped that what the dye shows and what is seen with the microscope will be alike.

    <description>Examine the resected tissue to determine whether ICG is sensitive to tumor detection (i.e., whether ICG accumulates in tumor) and whether ICG is specific for tumor (i.e., whether ICG accumulates in normal tissue).</description>

    <description>Initially a dose of 0.22mg/kg, which has proven successful in identifying tumor tissue in canine experiments. The dose will be based on actual body weight. This dose is approximately 40% of the standard human dose for determining cardiac output. ICG will be administered by intravenous infusion over a 20 second period in a 2-8 hour time window before the time of completion of the surgical procedure.</description>
