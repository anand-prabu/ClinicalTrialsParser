Commonly\n      patients are treated with antibiotics alone, and in particular fluoroquinolones are\n      suggested by the European Urology guidelines. This approach, although recommended, may not\n      be enough. Thus, a multimodal approach to the prolonged antibiotic therapy may be helpful.\n\n      Methods - 210 patients affected by chronic bacterial prostatitis were enrolled in the study.\n      All patients were positive to Meares-Stamey test and symptoms duration was > 3 months. The\n      purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of a long lasting therapy with a\n      fluoroquinolone in association with a nutraceutical supplement (prulifloxacin 600 mg for 21\n      days and an association of Serenoa repens 320 mg, Lactobacillus Sporogens 200 mg, Arbutin\n      100 mg for 30 days). Patients were randomized in two groups (A and B) receiving respectively\n      antibiotic alone and an association of antibiotic plus supplement."

The score is divided by three subscales: pain (score range 0-21), urinary symptoms (score range 0-10) and quality of life (QoL) (score range 0-12). The sum of all single scores is the total score. The reason every item has a different maximum score is because they have a different potential. NIH-CPSI characteristics are: good reliability, validity, and responsiveness to change.
