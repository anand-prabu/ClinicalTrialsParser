  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Pilot study to assess feasibility for combining treatment modalities that should be
      synergistic (radiation and thermal ablation).

      Thermal ablation with Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) are
      standard treatments for focal neoplasms in the liver.

      High volume or scattered locations of tumor burden results in inability to successfully use
      this technology for a large proportion of patients with hepatic neoplasms.

      Methods to enhance treatment volumes could be advantageous in potentially increasing the
      indications for thermal ablation or the number of patients benefitting from local ablation.

      Primary objective:

      To determine the safety of combining 2 standard therapies (thermal ablation and external
      beam radiation therapy) for liver neoplasms up to 10 cm diameter.

      Eligibility:

      Patients greater than 18 years of age with pathologically proven unresectable primary or
      metastatic hepatic neoplasms

      Patients whose extent of hepatic metastases represents approximately less than 60% of total
      liver volume AND whose extrahepatic metastatic disease is determined to be minimal

      ECOG performance status of less than or equal to 2 and a life expectancy of more than 3
      months

      Patients with a history of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or biological therapy for at
      least 4 weeks prior to starting study treatments, and 4 weeks after treatments Patients must
      not have an acute, critical illness

      If clinical or imaging evidence for cirrhosis present, then Bilirubin must be less than 3
      mg/dl and Child-Pugh Classification A, (Class B &amp;  C are excluded)

      Design:

      Patients will undergo external beam radiation as well as thermal ablation according to
      standard operating procedures of the NCI and NIH CC.

      Patients will be monitored using the standard imaging studies when clinically warranted.

      Patients may be treated with a second (or more) thermal ablation procedure ALONE if it is
      deemed beneficial for the patient by the investigator.

      The sample size will be 10 evaluable patients

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients with hepatic-dominant neoplasms where the life limiting component of the disease
        is hepatic neoplasms

        Patients must have unresectable hepatic lesions or must be deemed unable or unadvisable to
        undergo surgical resection

        Have 5 or fewer lesions and with no single lesion greater than 10 cm in maximum diameter

        Patients with extrahepatic neoplasms or an unresected primary lesion will be considered
        eligible if the extrahepatic disease is minimal and stable

        Serum Creatinine less than 2.0 mg/dl unless the measured creatinine clearance is greater
        than 60 ml/min.

        Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to1500/m3 without help of
        Filgastrim, hemoglobin greater than 8 g/dL, and platelet count greater than or equal to
        75,000 m3

        Bilirubin less than 3 mg/dl, and AST and ALT less than 5 X upper limit of normal except in
        the presence of obstructive liver neoplasms where ALT/AST may be up to 10 X the upper
        limit of normal.

        Prothrombin Time (PT) within 2 seconds of the upper limit normal (INR less than 1.8)

        Extent of hepatic neoplasms is approximately less than 60% of total hepatic volume

        Patients must have pathology proof of neoplasm.  If proof of pathology is unavailable,
        histopathological confirmation of liver  neoplasm may not be requisite in the setting of
        clinical or radiological characteristics that are highly suggestive of a neoplastic
        diagnosis, with such designation determined by PI and a medical or surgical  oncologist,
        with the NCI multidisciplinary gastrointestinal tumor board review, in the event of
        absence of such consensus.

        Patients referred for ablation or radiation of liver neoplasm

        ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2

        Life expectancy greater than 3 months

        At least 18 years of age

        Age less than 85 years

        Patients must have had no chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or biologic therapy for their
        malignancy for at least 28 days prior to treatment and must have recovered from all
        clinically significant side effects of therapeutic and diagnostic interventions.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Portal Vein Occlusion or other contraindications to thermal ablation or radiation Prior
        selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with Yttrium-90 or prior radiation to the
        liver

        Prior biliary diversion surgery

        Patients requiring ongoing chronic anticoagulation will not be eligible.

        Standard clinical screening procedures will be performed, and when it is clinically
        low-risk to do so, patients will be taken off of aspirin or NSAIDS for a week prior to
        RFA, as per clinical standard.

        Patients with active bacterial infections with systemic manifestations (malaise, fever,
        leucocytosis) are not eligible until completion of appropriate therapy.

        Any exclusion criteria for radiation or for ablation, such as ataxia telengiectasia,
        active connective tissue disease, or inflammatory bowel disease, or other known conditions
        which predispose to radiation toxicities

        Patients with an acute, critical illness

        Pregnant or nursing mothers will not be eligible
