With the implementation of a Community to\n      Clinic Linkage Program (CCLiP) in the SFGH Pediatrics Clinics, we will routinely address\n      Social Determinants of Health when families present. We will randomize patients to receive\n      either the CCLiP intervention or standard of care. We will evaluate programmatic outcome,\n      health care utilization data and return on investment data. We hypothesize that by\n      addressing the environmental and social factors that contribute to health within the setting\n      of the medical home, we will be able to better connect families to community resources,\n      enable more appropriate use of healthcare resources, improve health status, and enhance\n      patient satisfaction."
