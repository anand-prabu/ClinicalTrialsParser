Any type of angina\n           post procedure measured by means of the Cardio Test, proposed by the ANMCO\n           (Associazione Nazionale Medici Cardiologic Ospedalieri) [21]\n\n           Efficacy parameters: TLR and TVR at 1 year and then yearly up to 5-year follow-up.\n\n           Safety \"patient oriented\" parameters: at 1 year and then yearly up to 5 years all cause\n           mortality, any myocardial infarction, Stent thrombosis based on the ARC classification,\n           up to 5-year follow-up. Data on dual antiplatelet therapy use will also be collected\n           and analyzed.\n\n           PATIENTS\n\n           Patient Population\n\n           Patients enrolled into this registry will be male and female patients derived from the\n           general interventional cardiology population who satisfy the inclusion and exclusion\n           criteria. The Italian National Registry will enroll 1000 patients in approximately 50\n           sites throughout the national terrritory.\n\n           Informed Consent\n\n           The Investigator or designee, who has been trained on the protocol, will explain the\n           nature and scope of the registry and inform the patient of the potential risks and\n           benefits of participation, and document consent to treatment with an Absorb BVS device\n           according to standard hospital practice. For this registry the patient must consent to\n           data collection and follow-up visits. All patients (or legally authorized patients'\n           representatives if applicable) must sign, date and time Medical Ethics Committee (MEC)\n           approved informed consent prior to data collection for this registry. Obtaining the\n           consent, provision of a copy to the patient, along with the date and time must be\n           documented in the patient's medical records. The informed consent form must be signed\n           by the investigator. In addition, the signed informed consent must be kept in the\n           patient's medical records.\n\n           Eligibility Criteria\n\n           General Eligibility Criteria\n\n           Assessment for general eligibility criteria is based on medical records of the site and\n           interview with a candidate patient. Patients must meet at least one of the angiographic\n           inclusion criteria to be considered for the registry. If ANY of the exclusion criteria\n           is met, the patient is excluded from the clinical evaluation and cannot be registered.\n\n           Patient Discontinuation\n\n           Once registered, each patient shall remain in the registry until completion of the\n           required follow-up period; however, a patient's participation is voluntary and the\n           patient has the right to withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of benefit.\n           Conceivable reasons for discontinuation may include but not be limited to the\n           following:\n\n             -  Patient voluntary withdrawal\n\n             -  Patient withdrawal by physician as clinically-indicated\n\n             -  Patient lost-to-follow-up: If the patient misses two consecutive scheduled follow\n                up time points, and attempts at contacting the patient are unsuccessful, then the\n                patient is considered lost to follow-up.\n\n           No additional data is needed and will be recorded from patients once withdrawn from the\n           registry. Patients will not be replaced.\n\n           Registry Completion\n\n           An eCRF registry completion form must be completed when:\n\n             -  the patient is considered lost-to-follow-up per the above definition or\n\n             -  the patient withdraws from the registry or\n\n             -  the investigator withdraws the patient from the registry or\n\n             -  the patient's follow-up is terminated upon registry follow-up completed\n\n           TREATMENT AND SCHEDULE OF EVENTS\n\n           The treatment strategy will be determined by the investigator. It is required that each\n           enrolling investigator review the most recent Absorb BVS IFU and assess the\n           contraindications, warnings and precaution sections with respect to the risks and\n           benefits for treating potential patients.\n\n           Procedure\n\n           During the procedure, patients will receive appropriate anticoagulation and other\n           therapies according to standard hospital practice. The Absorb BVS will be inspected,\n           prepared, and implanted according to the IFU.\n\n           QCA analysis is recommended pre implantation of the ABSORB, for correct sizing. IVUS,\n           VH-IVUS and OCT techniques are encouraged: these imaging tools will be subject of\n           subgroup analysis.\n\n           Post-procedure (In-hospital)\n\n           Post procedure data will be collected as per eCRF\n\n           Follow-up Antiplatelet Medications\n\n           A minimum of 6 months duration of DAPT is recommended. Specific type of DAPT will be\n           recorded as per eCRF.\n\n           Clinical Follow-up\n\n           Clinical follow-up visits by telephone contact or office visits per the following\n           schedule.\n\n             -  30 days: office visit is encouraged\n\n             -  6 months: office visit is encouraged\n\n             -  1 year, and then yearly up to 5 years after the index procedure: office visit is\n                encouraged.\n\n           Angiographic follow up\n\n           The angiographic follow up will be clinically driven. However, patients undergoing\n           angio follow up and IVUS or OCT follow up will be included in subgroup analysis.\n\n           ADJUDICATION OF EVENTS\n\n           In order to minimize bias in assessing MACE outcomes, these events will be adjudicated\n           by an independent Clinical Event Committee, which will also act as Data Safety and\n           Monitoring Board for the study.\n\n           STATISTICAL ANALYSIS\n\n           Statistical Overview\n\n           The data will be reviewed by a Data Safety and Monitoring Board.\n\n           The  Data Safety and Monitoring Board will be also responsible for:\n\n             -  Determining whether information collected are sufficient to address the objectives\n\n             -  Recommending modifications to the statistical analysis plan to address additional\n                research questions based on review of the data\n\n           Analysis Population\n\n           All patients who are successfully registered will be included in the analysis. A limit\n           of one third of the entire population will be set for the group of Multivessel Disease\n           patients treated with ABSORB and a conventional stent (\"hybrid group\").\n\n           Sample Size Calculations and Assumptions\n\n           Being this an observational registry aiming at quantifying effect estimates without\n           direct comparisons to literature benchmarks, we relied on confidence interval profiling\n           for sample size justification, without proceeding with formal power analysis. As the\n           main analysis is a pooled analysis of patients with multivessel disease and/or long\n           lesions, an overall and comprehensive analysis is planned as the primary analytical\n           approach. Accordingly, we computed that a target sample of 1000 patients will enable\n           the computation of reasonably precise 95% confidence intervals. Specifically, assuming\n           a 4.2% MACE rate at 1 year (in keeping with ABSORBD EXTEND data), confidence intervals\n           computed with the adjusted Wald method would be 3.1% to 5.6% for a 1000-patient sample\n           (point estimate 42/1000 [4.2%]).\n\n           Given that the registry aims to reflect real-world patients and practice, no provision\n           to limit or restrict patient enrolment depending on the presence of multivessel disease\n           vs long lesions is envisioned.\n\n           Statistical Analyses\n\n           Continuous endpoints will be summarized by presenting the total number of patients,\n           mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Tabulation of categorical\n           parameters will include counts and percentages. The outcomes will be summarized as both\n           a discrete and a continuous variable using the method described above. Survival\n           analysis will be performed with the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical inference will be\n           based on the computation of 95% confidence intervals using the adjusted Wald method.\n           Additional analyses will involve key subgroups defined according to baseline, lesion,\n           and procedural features, with statistical significance set at the 5% 2-tailed level.\n           Specifically, Student t, Fisher exact, and log-rank tests will be used for such\n           bivariate analyses, whereas multivariable linear regression, logistic regression, and\n           Cox proportional hazard analyses will be used to adjust for confounders. In addition,\n           separate analyses for patients with only multivessel disease, patients with only long\n           lesions, and patients with hybrid revascularization will be performed.\n\n           DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS\n\n           The investigator/institution will permit direct access to source data/documents in\n           order for registry-related monitoring, audits, MEC review, and regulatory inspections\n           to be performed.\n\n           As part of the informed consent, the investigator or designee will obtain permission\n           for registry monitors or regulatory authorities to review, in confidence, any records\n           identifying the patients in this registry.\n\n           QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE\n\n           Protocol and Informed Consent Approval The Principal Investigator at each site must\n           confirm and agree with the content of the protocol prior to participation in this\n           registry. Also, the Principal Investigator will obtain written approval of the\n           protocol, informed consent form, and other registry related documents from the MEC. In\n           addition, the investigator will take actions necessary for ongoing registry approval at\n           their site per established procedures of the MEC.\n\n           The investigator will advise the MEC of the progress of this registry on a regular\n           basis until registry completion as required by the MEC.\n\n           The investigator will submit any amendments to the protocol as well as associated\n           informed consent form changes and obtain written MEC approval prior to implementation\n           as required by the MEC.\n\n           Monitoring\n\n           A monitoring plan will be established. Remote monitoring by the CRO and source\n           documents analysis for events throughout the study period by an independent Event\n           Committee, will be conducted to ensure compliance with the protocol and applicable\n           regulatory requirements.\n\n           DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING\n\n           For the registry duration, the investigator will maintain complete and accurate\n           documentation including but not limited to the following: medical records, registry\n           progress records, laboratory reports, electronic case report forms, signed informed\n           consent forms, device serial numbers for monitoring malfunctions, correspondence with\n           the MEC and registry monitor/Sponsor, SAE reports, and information regarding patient\n           discontinuation or registry completion.\n\n           Source Documentation\n\n             -  Medical history/physical condition of the patient before involvement in the\n                registry sufficient to verify protocol entry criteria\n\n             -  Dated and signed notes on the day of entry into the registry referencing the\n                sponsor, protocol number, patient ID number and a statement that informed consent\n                was obtained\n\n             -  Dated and signed notes from each patient visit\n\n             -  Adverse events reported and their resolution including supporting documents such\n                as discharge summaries, catheterization laboratory reports, ECGs, and lab results\n                including documentation of site awareness of SAEs and of investigator device\n                relationship assessment of AEs.\n\n             -  Notes regarding Dual Anti Platelet Therapy medications taken during the registry\n\n             -  (including start and stop dates)\n\n             -  Patient's condition upon completion of or withdrawal from the registry\n\n             -  Any other data required to substantiate data entered into the CRF\n\n           Electronic Case Report Form Completion\n\n           Primary data collection based on source-documented hospital and /or clinic chart\n           reviews will be performed clearly and accurately by site personnel trained on the\n           protocol and eCRF completion. eCRF data will be collected for all patients that are\n           registered.\n\n           ETHICAL CONSIDERATION\n\n           Medical Ethics Committee Review Medical Ethics Committee (MEC) approval for the\n           protocol and informed consent form /other written information provided to the patient\n           will be obtained by the Principal Investigator at each investigational site prior to\n           participation in this registry.
