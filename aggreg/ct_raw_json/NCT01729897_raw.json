However, the anesthesia risk of painless gastroscopy\n      are usually higher than that of general anesthesia performed in operating room due to the\n      condition, monitoring and equipments as well as the staffing for its implementation. Thus,\n      the finding of a safe and convenient approach for general anesthesia will have a profound\n      impact on a full promotion and implementation of comfortable care.\n\n      Etomidate, with the main advantage of little effect on circulatory and respiratory systems,\n      and the features of rapid onset and metabolism, may be helpful to guarantee the safety of\n      painless diagnosis and treatment, thus appropriate for the procedure with short duration of\n      anesthesia. However, there is controversy regarding whether analgesic should be used in\n      combination, as well as how to given the combined regimen."
