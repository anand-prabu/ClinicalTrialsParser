This ambiguity may be due to complex interaction between many factors, including\n      rehabilitation services.\n\n      In Denmark rehabilitation services partly depend on the residence of the individual with\n      TBI.\n\n      In the current study, return to work and quality of life following severe TBI is\n      investigated using danish register data and a questionnaire.\n\n      The first purpose of the study is to investigate a possible link between centralized\n      rehabilitation and better return to work / quality of life.\n\n      The second purpose is to investigate if the size of the municipality, which was affected by\n      a major structural reform in 2007, is of importance for quality of life and when attempting\n      to return to work after severe TBI.\n\n      The study population will be identified from the Danish Head Trauma Database. The\n      completeness and accuracy of the database will be investigated as the first part of the\n      project."
