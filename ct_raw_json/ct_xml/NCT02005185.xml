  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anesthesia for more than 2h given to children of less than 3 years of age without coexisting
      diseases of the central nervous system or the heart cause long-term impairment of
      recognition memory.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  General anesthesia for 5 minutes or greater between birth and 8 years of age

          -  Use of volatile anesthetic (sevoflurane, isoflurane, halothane or desflurane) with or
             without nitrous oxide for maintenance of anesthesia.

          -  Use of fentanyl or morphine as opioids and midazolam as premedication.

          -  Control subjects must never have been exposed to anesthesia or sedation for any
             procedure.

          -  English and Spanish speaking subjects

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any other agents such as ketamine, meperdinie, barbiturates, etomidate,
             methoxyflurane, chloral hyrate, methodone or lorazepam.

          -  Low birth weight (&lt;25th percentile)

          -  premature birth at &lt;36 weeks

          -  color blindness

          -  history of brain disease including head trauma

          -  presence of congenital heart disease

          -  significant low blood pressure during their surgery (&lt;30% of baseline for &gt;5min)

          -  abnormal temperature (deviation from 36.5 degrees C by &gt;1.5 degree C at any point)

          -  slow heart rate

          -  low blood oxygen saturation (&lt;93% for &gt;5min.)

          -  high arterial carbon dioxide levels (&gt;60mmHg for &gt;5min.)

          -  control subjects are excluded for any exposure to anesthesia or sedation
