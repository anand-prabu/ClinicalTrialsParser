      In subjects with acute SCI: To compare the effects of parenteral zoledronic acid therapy on

        -  preservation of regional and total skeletal mass (DXA)

        -  metabolic bone markers of bone resorption and formation

        -  calcium metabolism

      Hypothesis:  Zoledronic acid will dramatically diminish bone loss in persons with acute SCI,
      as evidenced by serial densitometry determinations (DXA) and plasma and urinary metabolic
      bone markers for resorption.

    <textblock>
      Immobilization is associated with disuse osteoporosis.  Spinal cord injury (SCI) produces a
      syndrome of acute skeletal immobilization with immediate and irreversible unloading of the
      involved skeletal regions resulting in accelerated bone loss.  In addition to rapid bone
      loss, there are also the complications of hypercalciuria, hypercalcemia, nephrolithiasis,
      and renal insufficiency.  In some reports, as much as 50% of regional bone mass has been
      lost within the first year after paralysis.  A depletion of regional bone of such magnitude
      greatly increases the risk of fractures, with associated morbidity and increased cost of
      care.  Often, these fractures occur with minimal or non-obvious trauma and may pass
      undiagnosed for varying lengths of time due to the absence of pain sensation.  The acute
      complications of fracture may include hemorrhage, deep venous thrombosis, and autonomic
      dysreflexia.  Long-term complications include functional deformity, non-union, infection,
      heterotopic calcification, and significantly longer healing time.  The socio-economic
      consequences include a minimum of 1 to 2 weeks of hospitalization and the potential need for
      an increased level of attendant care. This study will address the efficacy of a
      bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid (Reclast: 5 mg; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Inc., East Hanover,
      NJ), in the prevention of the bone loss associated with acute SCI.

      Prevention of regional osteoporosis in persons with SCI would reduce the morbidity
      associated with fractures, a known secondary complication of immobilization.  Thus, the
      quality of life would be improved in terms of employment responsibilities (reduction in days
      absent from employment and income lost) and personal activities (recreational endeavors,
      independence, and ease in which one performs activities of daily living).  Individuals with
      SCI may then engage more securely in activities without fear of fracture, a tremendous
      psychological benefit.

    <description>To assess changes in bone mineral density (BMD), an imaging method known as dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) will be used to obtain BMD of the knee region (distal femur and proximal tibia) by using a customized research software program supplied by the manufacturer.  This measurement will be the primary determinant (dependent measure) of difference among the treatment and control groups, and they will be followed over time at the previously specified time points.</description>
