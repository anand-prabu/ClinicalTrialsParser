The\n      test is currently not reimbursed by the Swiss health insurances.\n\n      The proposed study will investigate to what extent adjuvant treatment recommendations in\n      breast cancer patients with an ER-positive tumor, made by Swiss tumor boards, are based on\n      conventional factors, and whether the recommendations would change, when RS results from the\n      Oncotype DX\u00ae test were available.\n\n      In addition this study approaches the dilemma of adding adjuvant CT to adjuvant endocrine\n      therapy in a systematic fashion. In this study, the St. Gallen consensus 2009 (with a minor\n      update from the 2011 consensus, is used to predefine the patients suitable for endocrine\n      therapy or chemo-endocrine therapy. Once results of this study are available they may help\n      to better integrate Oncotype DX\u00ae with other factors. Currently, it is unclear how the\n      different factors should be integrated into one recommendation.\n\n      This study will provide data on the usefulness of this test for the two patient groups which\n      are suitable for hormone therapy only and for those who are considered for hormone plus\n      chemotherapy."
