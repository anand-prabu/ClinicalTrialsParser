We will do\n      this by using a single dose of body irradiation and two drugs called Fludarabine and\n      Campath-IH.\n\n      The treatment schedule is as follows:\n\n      Day - 6: Total body irradiation Day - 5: Fludarabine and Campath 1H Day - 4: Fludarabine and\n      Campath 1H Day - 3: Fludarabine and Campath 1H Day - 2: Fludarabine and Campath 1H Day - 1:\n      REST Day 0: Stem Cell Transplant (infusion)\n\n      After the drug treatment, participants will be given healthy stem cells from a related donor\n      that partially matches their HLA (immune) type, most likely from a parent or sibling. This\n      is known as the stem cell transplant.\n\n      The healthy stem cells will be put into a blood vein in the same way that transfusions are\n      given. The cells then travel to the right places in the body, where they should grow and\n      make new blood cells that do not sickle."
