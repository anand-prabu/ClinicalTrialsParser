  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the elevation of the head of the bed in
      patients with obstructive sleep apnea can decrease the apnea-hypopnea index. First the
      investigators will do a standard polysomnography and  see if the patients are included
      analysing the criteria like  apnea-hypopnea index equal or more than 5. Within 2 weeks the
      patient will do the second polysomnography but this will be with a elevation of the head of
      the bed (15 cm of elevation of the bed doing a inclination). Then the investigators will
      compare the data of apnea-hypopnea index in the standard polysomnography versus the index
      with the elevation of the head of the bed.

    <textblock>
      There are many researches that demonstrate that  the position of the patient modified the
      apnea-hypopnea index(IAH). In supine position the IAH will increase comparing with lateral
      position during th sleep. However few studies were done with the elevation of the head of
      the bed.

      First the investigators will do a standard polysomnography and  see if the patients are
      included analysing the criteria like  apnea-hypopnea index equal or more than 5. Within 2
      weeks the patient will do the second polysomnography but this will be with a elevation of
      the head of the bed (15 cm of elevation of the bed doing a inclination). Then the
      investigators will compare the data of apnea-hypopnea index in the standard polysomnography
      versus the index with the elevation of the head of the bed.The main outcome will be to
      analyze the apnea hypopnea index comparing standard polysomnography (sPSG) with elevated
      polysomnography (ePSG).

    <description>During the polysomnography there are sensors that detect the airflow by cannula pressure and thermistor. WIth those equipment during the all night the patient will be registered and seen if there is absence of flow (apnea) and/or reduction of flow (hypopnea). The apnea and hypopnea index is done by dividing the number of respiratory events by recording time in hours of sleep (events per hour).</description>
