This study is being\n      done to see if there is a relationship between genetic patterns and the development of\n      Chronic Allograft Nephropathy (CAN).  Medical scientists also hope to learn more about how\n      genetic differences between people determine their response to a drug or a disease by\n      storing a small blood sample in a special \"bank\".  This sample may be tested at some point\n      in the future in an attempt to better understand the factors that may influence rejection,\n      transplantation outcomes and transplant success rates."
