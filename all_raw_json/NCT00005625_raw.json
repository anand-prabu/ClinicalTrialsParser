Further\n      characterize the toxicity profile and the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships of\n      this drug in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive ecteinascidin 743 IV over 24 hours.\n      Treatment continues every 6 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease\n      progression for at least 2-6 courses. Patients with a complete response (CR) receive at\n      least 2 additional courses after documented CR. Patients are followed every 3 months until\n      disease progression. All patients are followed until death after disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-33 patients will be accrued for this study."
