  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that using Cyproheptadine in a placebo-controlled crossover
      trial would help relieve abdominal pain associated with FAP in children, achieving a greater
      response than that observed with placebo. In addition to assessing self-report of pain and
      other symptoms, the investigators also propose to perform experimental somatic pain testing
      to determine if there is evidence of peripherally-maintained central sensitization in
      children with FAP.  The investigators also hypothesize that there will be an increase in
      somatic pain threshold after completion of a Cyproheptadine course compared to baseline
      testing prior to treatment, and compared to placebo.  This would allow children with FAP to
      return to normal function, improve symptoms and overall general well-being

    <description>This will be a randomized blinded placebo controlled cross-over study. Forty children aged 8 to 18 years diagnosed with FAP using the Rome III criteria will be recruited. Pressure Pain testing will be performed before and after crossover between drug and placebo to evaluate for objective differences in pressure pain thresholds</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age between 8 and 18 years-old

          -  Diagnosed with Functional Abdominal Pain using the Rome III Criteria must include
             all* of the following:

               1. Episodic or continuous abdominal pain

               2. Insufficient criteria for other FGIDs

               3. No evidence of an inflammatory, anatomic, metabolic, or neoplastic process that
                  explains the subject's symptoms

                    -  Criteria fulfilled at least once per week for at least 2 months prior to
                       diagnosis

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the patient/guardian before the initiation of
             any study-specific procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &lt; 8 years-old or Age &gt;18 years-old

          -  Child or parent are non-English speakers

          -  Child is using other CNS depressants (cyproheptadine causes drowsiness, and may
             enhance the    adverse/toxic effect of other CNS Depressants e.g. opioids,
             barbiturates, Droperidol, Hydroxyzine, Alcohol)(29)

          -  Child has a history of hypersensitivity to Cyproheptadine products

          -  Child is currently using monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI e.g. Nardil, Marplan,
             Parnate)  (can cause a prolonged or intensified anticholinergic effect)

          -  Child was treated with Cyproheptadine in the past 4 weeks

          -  Child is currently using anticholinergic (can cause an additive anticholinergic
             effect e.g. Pramlintide)

          -  Concomitant SSRI use ( being a serotonin antagonist, may oppose effects)

          -  Concomitant use of Betahistine: Antihistamines may diminish the therapeutic effect of
             Betahistine

          -  Concomitant use of Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors (Central): Anticholinergics may
             diminish the therapeutic effect of Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors (Central) and vice
             versa.

          -  Child has a personal history of glaucoma

          -  Child has asthma (can cause thickening of bronchial secretions) (27,28)

          -  History of liver dysfunction/disease (can cause hepatitis)

          -  History of cardiac disease (not specific to Cyproheptadine, antihistamines have been
             associated with hypotension, palpitations, tachycardia and arrhythmias) (28,29).

          -  Females who are known to be pregnant will also be excluded.  All females who are of
             child bearing age, or are already menstruating will perform a urine pregnancy test
             before enrolling.

          -  Any children who have difficulties swallowing tablets will receive teaching on how to
             swallow tablets. If they are still unable to do so, they will not participate in the
             study.
