  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental and health anxiety are common and potentially distressing problems, for both patients
      and health care providers.  Anxiety has been identified as a barrier to regular dental
      visits and as an important target for enhancement of oral health-related quality of life.
      The goal of this project is to develop a computer-administered dental anxiety management
      program that can easily be implemented in dental health care settings.  Our aim is for this
      management program to: 1) integrate different treatments modalities such as
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational interviewing (MI) into one
      computer-based protocol; 2) facilitate patient adherence to this protocol; 3) lend itself to
      empirical validation; and 4) lend itself to dissemination to other research and treatment
      settings. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted (n=200). Based on the
      subjects responses to the screening questionnaires, consenting dental patients at Temple
      University Kornberg School of Dentistry will be assigned to one of 2 possible groups, (1)
      high dental anxiety and (2) low dental anxiety. The intervention package will be delivered
      to a randomly selected half of participants in group 1 (high anxiety group), whereas the
      remaining participants in this group will be assigned to a delayed treatment control
      condition. The low dental anxiety patients (group 2) will be used as a benchmark against
      which to compare post-treatment (or post-control) outcomes for the high anxiety patients. We
      hope to develop an intervention that can be easily implemented in a broader context without
      the need for highly specialized personnel.

    <description>The Computerized Dental Anxiety Treatment Program consists of treatment modules that are be delivered through a computer. The modules use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to assist the participant in preparing a personal plan for managing his/her dental anxiety.  The program incorporates a range of CBT techniques, including cognitive restructuring, exposure, and motivational interviewing.</description>
