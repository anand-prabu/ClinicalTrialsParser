    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies lymph node dissection and radiation therapy to see
      how well it works compared to radiation therapy alone in treating patients with breast
      cancer previously treated with chemotherapy and surgery. Lymph node dissection may remove
      cancer cells that have spread to nearby lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer.
      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known if
      radiation therapy alone is as effective as lymph node dissection and radiation therapy
      together.

    <textblock>
      All patients will undergo surgery to identify sentinel lymph node(s). If a sentinel lymph
      node is determined to be positive on intra-operative pathology the patient will be
      registered/randomized intra-operatively. Patients who do not have a sentinel lymph node
      identified will not be registered/randomized to the study. Patients whose sentinel lymph is
      found to be negative intra-operatively and have not undergone ALND, but had at least one
      sentinel lymph node found to be positive on final pathology review will be
      registered/randomized post-operatively.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To evaluate whether radiation to the undissected axilla and regional lymph nodes is not
           inferior to axillary lymph node dissection with radiation to the regional lymph nodes
           but not to the dissected axilla in terms of invasive breast cancer recurrence-free
           interval in patients with positive SLN(s) after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate whether radiation to the undissected axilla and regional lymph nodes is not
           inferior to axillary lymph node dissection with radiation to the regional lymph nodes
           but not to the dissected axilla in terms of the incidence of invasive loco-regional
           recurrences in patients with a positive SLN(s) after completion of neoadjuvant
           chemotherapy

        -  To obtain an estimate of the distribution of residual disease burden scores.

        -  To estimate the distribution of overall survival.

      Patients are followed up for 5 years after completion of radiation therapy.

        Pre-Registration Eligibility Criteria:

          -  Patients 18 years of age or older.

          -  Clinical stage T1-3 N1 M0 breast cancer at diagnosis (prior to the start of
             neoadjuvant chemotherapy) by American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging 7th
             edition.

          -  No inflammatory breast cancer.

          -  No other malignancy within 5 years of registration with the exception of basal cell
             or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin treated with local resection only or carcinoma
             in situ of the cervix

          -  All patients must have had an axillary ultrasound with fine needle aspiration (FNA)
             or core needle biopsy of axillary lymph nodes documenting axillary metastasis at the
             time of diagnosis, prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

          -  Patients must have had estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal
             growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status by immunohistochemistry [IHC] or fluorescence
             in situ hybridization [FISH] evaluated on diagnostic core biopsy prior to start of
             neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

          -  Patients must have completed all planned chemotherapy prior to surgery. Sandwich
             chemotherapy is not allowed (i.e. chemotherapy planned to be given after surgery).
             Patients must have completed at least 6 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting
             of an anthracycline and/or taxane-based regimen without evidence of disease
             progression in the breast or the lymph nodes.

          -  Patients with HER-2 positive tumors must have received neoadjuvant trastuzumab or
             other approved anti-HER-2 therapy (either with all or with a portion of the
             neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen). Therapy must be Food and Drug Administration
             (FDA)-approved targeted anti-HER2 therapy, but additional therapies are allowed as
             are non-trastuzumab regimens if administered in the context of an Institutional
             Review Board (IRB)-approved clinical trial.

          -  All patients must have a clinically negative axilla (no palpable lymph nodes or bulky
             adenopathy) on physical examination documented at the completion of neoadjuvant
             chemotherapy.

          -  No neoadjuvant endocrine therapy.

          -  No neoadjuvant radiation therapy.

          -  No sentinel lymph node (SLN) surgery/excisional biopsy for pathological confirmation
             of axillary status prior to or during neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

          -  No prior history of ipsilateral breast cancer (invasive disease or ductal carcinoma
             in situ [DCIS]); lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) and benign breast disease is
             allowed.

          -  No prior ipsilateral axillary surgery, such as excisional biopsy of lymph node(s) or
             treatment of hidradenitis.

          -  No history of prior or concurrent contralateral invasive breast cancer. Benign breast
             disease; LCIS or DCIS of contralateral breast is allowed.

          -  Patients must not be pregnant or nursing. A negative pregnancy test is required prior
             to registration for women of childbearing potential. Note: Peri-menopausal women must
             be amenorrheic for &gt; 12 months to be considered not of childbearing potential.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) (Zubrod) performance status 0-1.

          -  Required Pre-Registration Laboratory Values:

          -  Serum or urine beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (ß-HCG)

          -  Negative in women of child-bearing potential

          -  Intra-Operative Registration/Randomization Criteria:

          -  Breast surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy) and sentinel lymph node surgery must be
             completed within 56 days of the completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

          -  A minimum of 2 or a maximum of 6 sentinel nodes are identified and excised by the
             surgeon. Patients who do not have an identifiable sentinel lymph node will not
             proceed to Registration/Randomization.

          -  At least one sentinel lymph node with a metastasis greater than 0.2 mm in greatest
             dimension identified on intra-operative pathologic assessment. Note: Isolated tumor
             cells (metastases less than or equal to 0.2 mm) will be treated as node negative
             disease (N0i+). Axillary lymph node dissection [ALND] is not to be performed prior to
             Registration/Randomization.

        Post-Operative Registration/Randomization Criteria:

          -  For cases where ALND has not been performed and one of the following is true:

               1. intra-operative evaluation of sentinel lymph node could not be/was not performed
                  and final pathology identified a positive SLN with metastasis greater than 0.2
                  mm on hematoxylin and eosin stain (H &amp; E) OR

               2. sentinel lymph node on intra-operative evaluation considered negative was found
                  to be positive on final pathology (with metastasis greater than 0.2 mm on H &amp;
                  E).

          -  Breast surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy) and sentinel lymph node surgery must be
             completed within 56 days of the completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

          -  At least one lymph node with a metastasis greater than 0.2 mm in greatest dimension
             identified by H&amp;E staining on final pathology (for cases where intra-operative
             evaluation was not performed, or was negative and complete dissection was not
             performed).

          -  Among the minimum of 2 and the maximum of 6 sentinel nodes identified and excised by
             the surgeon, no more than 8 lymph nodes (sentinel and non-sentinel) were found by the
             pathologists to have been actually excised. Note: Isolated tumor cells (metastases
             less than or equal to 0.2 mm) will be treated as node negative disease (N0i+).

          -  For those patients who also undergo contralateral breast surgery, if invasive disease
             is found in the contralateral breast, the patient is not eligible for registration
             /randomization.
