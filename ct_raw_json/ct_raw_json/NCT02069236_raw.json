This research will be conducted in MaeSot Thailand, where G6PD deficiency has\n      a high prevalence. Study participants will be recruited into three groups of 50 volunteers\n      per group: 50 G6PD-deficient individuals, 50 G6PD-normal individuals, and 50\n      G6PD-intermediate individuals. Following a written informed consent, participants will\n      donate about 3 ml of venous blood and about 4 drops of capillary blood (fingerstick). There\n      will be no direct benefit to research participants."
