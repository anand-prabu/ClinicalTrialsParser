Several studies have found out that pharmacological interventions\n      alone were not enough to provide optimal pain management for these patients. The\n      investigators developed a DVD on guided imagery, customized for teenagers, to help them cope\n      better with their pain. The investigators believe that this type of intervention combined\n      with their usual analgesic medication will help them to control their pain and foster\n      rehabilitation."
