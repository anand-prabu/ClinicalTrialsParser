Epstein Barr virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes\n      (EBV CTL) are cultured in vitro.\n\n      Patients receive an infusion of EBV CTL over 10 minutes on day 0. The EBV CTL infusion is\n      preceded by 3 doses of fludarabine. Patients then receive interleukin-2 injections for 12\n      days after the EBV CTL infusion.\n\n      Patients are followed weekly for 1.5 months, twice a month for 1.5 months, and then monthly\n      for 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9 patients will be accrued for this study."
