  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to demonstrate that home use of Threshold Suspend (TS) is not
      associated with glycemic deterioration in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes, as
      measured by change in A1C.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a longitudinal, multi-center trial that aims to observe the Threshold Suspend
      (TS) feature with a sensor-augmented insulin pump in patients 2-15 years with Type 1
      diabetes. The study will measure the change in A1C from baseline over a period of one year
      while subjects are wearing the study pump.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is age 2 to 15 at time of screening

          -  Two separate A1C tests should be documented for each subject within 6 months of
             Screening. The A1C tests should meet the following criteria:

               -  They should have been taken a minimum of 90 days apart while on insulin pump
                  therapy

               -  They should not differ by more than an absolute value of 0.5% (e.g. 7% vs. 7.5%,
                  9% vs. 9.5%)

               -  They should be verifiable via source documentation

               -  They should have been run by the same method/assay which may include Point of
                  Care or local laboratory measurements. For example: Both A1Cs should have been
                  measured by the same model point-of-care (POC) machine or both tests should have
                  been processed in the same lab.

          -  Subject has been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus  and must have been
             diagnosed for at least one year prior to screening

          -  Subject is currently transitioning from pump therapy or SAP to SAP using the study
             pump with TS feature

          -  Subject is willing to perform greater than or equal to 4 finger stick blood glucose
             measurements daily

          -  Subject is willing to perform required sensor calibrations

          -  Subject is willing to wear the system (Pump, glucose sensors, meter) continuously
             throughout the study

          -  Subject is willing to upload data every 21 days from the study pump

          -  Subject must have Internet access and access to a computer system that meets the
             requirements for uploading the pumps. This may include use of family or friend's
             computer system with Internet access.

          -  Subject is able (by insurance or financial means) to cover the initial investment and
             ongoing cost of the study pump and consumables, Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM),
             Blood Glucose (BG) meter and supplies for 1 year.

          -  Subject is using either Humalog or Novolog at time of Screening and plans to use
             either of those insulins throughout the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is actively participating in an investigational study (drug or device)
             wherein he/she is receiving treatment from an investigational study drug or
             investigational study device.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential who have a positive pregnancy test at screening or
             plan to become pregnant during the course of the study

          -  Subject is being treated for hyperthyroidism at time of screening

          -  Subject has an abnormality (&gt;1.8mg/dL) in creatinine at time of screening visit

          -  Subject has an abnormality (out of reference range)  in thyroid-stimulating hormone
             (TSH) at time of screening visit

               -  If TSH is out of range, Free T3 and Free T4 will be tested

               -  Subject may be included with TSH out of range as long as Free T3 and Free T4 are
                  in normal reference range.

          -  Subject has taken any oral, injectable, or IV steroids within 8 weeks from time of
             screening visit, or plans to take any oral, injectable, or IV steroids during the
             course of the study

          -  Subject is currently abusing illicit drugs

          -  Subject is currently abusing prescription drugs

          -  Subject is currently abusing alcohol

          -  Subject is using pramlintide (Symlin) at time of screening

          -  Subject has a sickle cell disease, hemoglobinopathy; or has received red blood cell
             transfusion or erythropoietin within 3 months prior to time of screening

          -  Subject plans to receive red blood cell transfusion or erythropoietin over the course
             of study participation

          -  Subject diagnosed with current eating disorder such as anorexia or bulimia

          -  Subject has been diagnosed with chronic kidney disease that results in chronic anemia

          -  Subject is on dialysis
