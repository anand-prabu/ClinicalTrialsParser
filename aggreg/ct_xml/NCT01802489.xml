  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optic neuritis (ON) is a common event in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and causes significant
      loss of nerve cells in the eye, resulting in poor vision. Optic neuritis also provides a
      sensitive way of testing the effectiveness of drugs that may help protect from loss of nerve
      cells in ON and therefore in MS.

      The investigators have identified through laboratory and early clinical research in humans
      that amiloride (a water tablet already in use) may be a drug that can be of benefit in optic
      neuritis by protecting from loss of nerves cells, ie a neuroprotective drug.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of amiloride as a neuroprotective drug
      in optic neuritis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory condition of the nervous system, is the most common
      cause of disability in people of working age in the western world. In addition to the
      inflammatory episodes in MS, axonal and neuronal damage occurs. It is this axonal loss which
      is thought to be the major pathological substrate for disability in MS.

      Acute inflammatory demyelinating optic neuritis is a common event in multiple sclerosis.
      Following optic neuritis there is axonal loss in the optic nerve and retina, which if severe
      can result in a poor visual recovery. Uniquely amongst central nervous system (CNS)
      structures, the structural and functional changes in the eye during and following optic
      neuritis provide a sensitive way of observing neurodegeneration and testing the
      effectiveness of potential neuroprotective agents. In optic neuritis it has been shown that
      thinning of the retinal nerve fibre layer takes place, and by 6 months this thinning is
      established and has largely stabilised. This represents axonal loss in the anterior visual
      system. The degree of this thinning has been shown to correlate with the amount of vision
      recovered following optic neuritis, the more thinning that occurs, the poorer the outcome.
      The thickness of the retinal nerve fibre layer can be measured by the simple scanning
      techniques of scanning laser polarimetry (GDx) and optical coherence tomography (OCT).

      Axonal loss in MS is likely to be multifactorial, but a key end point is the influx of
      sodium and calcium ions. Recent research suggests that in the inflammatory environment of
      optic neuritis, the acid sensing ion channel may have an important role in this influx of
      sodium and calcium, and therefore in axonal loss in MS. The drug amiloride, already in use
      as a diuretic, is a known blocker of this ion channel. The investigators have identified
      through laboratory and early clinical research in humans that by blockade of the acid
      sensing ion channel, amiloride may be neuroprotective in optic neuritis and MS.

      The investigators primary objective is to assess the neuroprotective efficacy of amiloride
      in optic neuritis through the surrogate measure of retinal nerve fibre layer measurement.
      Secondary objectives are to assess markers of neurodegeneration in ON and the
      neuroprotective effect of amiloride through non-conventional MRI outcomes, to assess if
      amiloride improves functional and visual outcome following optic neuritis, and to confirm
      optic neuritis as a sensitive and efficient model for neuroprotection in a clinical trial
      framework.

      46 Participants will be recruited to receive either amiloride, or an identical placebo
      capsule for 5 months. The primary outcome will be measured at 6 months, with a further
      measure at 12 months.

      Should this trial show a significant benefit from amiloride in optic neuritis, it will be an
      important first step in developing neuroprotective therapies in optic neuritis and MS and
      potentially this could have a significant impact on people with MS and their carers.
