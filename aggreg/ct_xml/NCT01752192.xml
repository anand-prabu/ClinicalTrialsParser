  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The idea behind the Teledi@log consortium is to develop tele-rehabilitation concepts and
      technologies so that all types of heart disease patients, regardless of degree of severity,
      can be offered individual, customized and coordinated tele-rehabilitation across sectors.
      The project is innovative, breaking new ground in relation to existing national and
      international research projects in the area. The Teledi@log consortium sees its major task
      as developing and testing scenarios which can lead to a more coherent rehabilitation for
      heart patients in areas such as patient training, organization across the boundaries of the
      health system and using tele-rehabilitation technology. The Teledi@log consortium seeks to
      develop new tele-rehabilitation concepts which bring the patient closer to the health system
      and thereby promote the heart patient's rehabilitation, giving the patient and their
      families a more active role via new tele-rehabilitation technologies.The hypothesis of the
      study is that heart patients participating in a telerehabilitation program will have a
      higher quality of life compared to heart patients following traditional rehabilitation
      activities.

      The aims of the research project are:

      To assess the heart patients' and family members' needs for rehabilitation in the health
      system

      To assess the need for coordination of the rehabilitation effort in the health system

      To develop tele-rehabilitation concepts and technologies for heart patients, family members
      and health professionals in the health sector

      To promote an early, rapid and effective rehabilitation of heart patients to improve their
      daily life and working life.

      To prevent re-hospitalization of heart patients through a more individualized and
      differentiated rehabilitation effort using tele-rehabilitation technologies.

      To conduct a randomized study of a tele-rehabilitation concept using tele-rehabilitation
      technologies and to assess the clinical, technical, organizational and health-economic
      effects.
