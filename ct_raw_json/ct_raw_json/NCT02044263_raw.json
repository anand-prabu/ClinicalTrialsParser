Still, only a\n      negligible number of patients with insomnia receive this treatment. One potential way of\n      improving the dissemination of CBT-I is by using online adaptations of CBT-I. This is a new\n      method for delivering CBT-I and it is not known how effective online treatment is compared\n      to face-to-face CBT-I. This trial's purpose is to compare face-to-face CBT-I with online\n      CBT-I. Because of the great advantage of online treatment in both availability and cost, the\n      trial is designed as a noninferiority trial.\n\n      Aim: To test if online CBT-I is noninferior in reducing insomnia complaints compared with\n      CBT-I as delivered face-to-face by a therapist."
