  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing Reactive oxygen and nitrogen production occurred simultaneously with decreasing
      serum and intracellular level of antioxidants and enzymes in critical ill patients, which
      result in increasing ventilator dependency and length of stay in intensive care unit and it
      also accelerate organ failures in patients. In this double blind clinical trial, the
      investigators examine effect of alfa-lipoic acid on those patients who admitted to intensive
      care unit that the investigators expect to stay for more than 7 days in this ward and who
      have tube feeding and don't have severe liver and kidney failure, AIDS and hepatitis. After
      randomization of included patients by block randomization the investigators will give
      900mg/day alfa-lipoic acid for ten days to treatment group and identical placebo to control
      group by naso-gastric tube. The purposes of this study are decreasing ventilator dependency
      period, length of stay in ICU, mortality and decelerate of organ failures.
