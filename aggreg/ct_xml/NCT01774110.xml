      A. Specific Aims:

      1. There is one specific aim of this study.  The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of
      early standardized task-specific training (ESTT) in persons with acute stroke.

      B. Hypothesis:

      1. It is our hypothesis that subjects who receive ESTT will walk faster and more
      symmetrically than published reports of gait outcomes in persons with stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is our contention that gait recovery after stroke is impacted by the interventions that
      are acutely utilized during training. There is not a consensus about how to most effectively
      train individuals after stroke. It is clear, however, that most persons are left with
      significant and often debilitating gait dysfunction after stroke so there is an urgent need
      to find more effective therapeutic methods.
