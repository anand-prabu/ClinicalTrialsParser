Previous studies have shown that\n      gastrointestinal hormones might play a role in this phenomenon. However, it has not yet been\n      possible to determine  whether this lack of glucagon suppression postprandially results in\n      an increased endogenous glucose secretion, and thus is a factor in the patients postprandial\n      hyperglycemia.\n\n      We aim to perform oral glucose tolerance tests and isoglycemic intravenous glucose infusions\n      with and without a continuous glucagon infusion in patients with T2DM and healthy control\n      subjects. The glucagon infusion is aiming at copying the inappropriate \"physiological\"\n      glucagon response observed in patients with T2DM."
