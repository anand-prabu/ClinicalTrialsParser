At Weeks 8, 12, 24, and 48, patients are assessed for adherence\n      to study treatment with a questionnaire.  Patients who experience virologic failure are\n      discontinued from the study.  Patients who experience treatment intolerance may have their\n      antiretroviral treatment regimens changed.  After Week 48, patients with documented\n      virologic response are eligible to continue receiving study treatment."
