            "textblock": "The study is a prospective cohort study on patients undergoing elective thoracic surgery in\n      deep hypothermia. The goal is to assess the accuracy of epitympanic temperature compared to\n      a gold standard representing core temperature.\n\n      At the study hospital, Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet, patients undergoing thoracic\n      surgery will already have several routes of temperature monitoring as part of standard\n      procedure. Before cardiopulmonary bypass bladder temperature is normally used as a reference\n      for core temperature. After cardiopulmonary bypass is established, temperature is monitored\n      directly in the circulating blood, hence reflecting core temperature.\n\n      For measuring the epitympanic temperature we will use the Metraux Thermometer (Walpoth,\n      Galdikas et al. 1994). The Metraux Thermometer is widely used in pre-hospital care in Norway\n      and internationally. The ear-sensor will after induction of anaesthesia be inserted\n      according to the manufacturers specifications in the auditory canal and activated. The\n      sensor is two tiny and soft metal wires covered in a plastic wrapping integrated in a soft\n      rubber earplug. The depth of the measuring point is pre-set from the manufacture to be\n      approximately 10 mm from the tympanic membrane. The display will then show the epitympanic\n      temperature in real-time.\n\n      The temperature will be measured in degrees Celsius. The first reading will be noted just\n      after induction of anaesthesia and compared to the bladder temperature. After\n      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is established and therapeutic hypothermia is induced, the\n      values for both epitympanic and blood temperature will be written down every minute. After\n      reaching the target temperature according to the blood temperature, we will continue\n      recording the epitympanic temperature until relative similarity is established. The process\n      will be repeated during re-warming."
