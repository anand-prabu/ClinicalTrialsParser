      The aim of the study is to assess the immunogenicity of SP059 (IMOVAX POLIO®: Inactive
      Poliovirus Vaccine) vaccine against poliovirus and safety after fifth dose.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To investigate the booster vaccine response rate against poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3
           one month following the vaccination dose with SP059 as 2nd booster

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To investigate seroprotection rates (percentage of subjects presenting poliovirus
           neutralizing antibody titers above 1:8 (1/dil.) at pre- and post-booster time points,
           Geometric mean titers (GMT) at pre- and post-booster time points and geometric mean of
           individual titer ratio (GMTR).

        -  To investigate the safety after dosing of SP059 as 2nd booster.

      Participants will receive one dose of SP059 (at Visit 1) as a booster vaccination at an age
      from 4 to 6 years. They will be assessed for immunogenicity at baseline (pre-vaccination)
      and at 4-6 weeks post- vaccination.

      Safety data including serious adverse events (SAEs) after vaccination will be collected
      during the study period.
