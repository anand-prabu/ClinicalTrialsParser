Patients will be randomized to treatment with furosemide and torasemide\n      (randomization 1 : 1). After randomization, furosemide will continue in its current\n      fixed-dose or will be replaced by equipotential dose of torasemide (4:1). The minimal\n      follow-up of patients in the study will be at least six months."

            "textblock": "According to current guidelines, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and\n      beta-adrenolytics are the first-line treatment agents in patients with heart failure. In\n      case of fluid retention, diuretics, as a part of symptomatic treatment, should be\n      administered. In practice, the most common diuretic used in patients with heart failure is\n      loop diuretic - furosemide. What is important, furosemide has no effect on patients'\n      outcomes. Some studies showed unfavourable influence of this drug on\n      rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.\n\n      Alternative loop diuretic, which may be administered in patients with heart failure is\n      torasemide. Its longer elimination half-life time, similar diuretic effects, lower influence\n      on electrolyte disorders and additional pleiotropic effects could make torasemide more\n      beneficial than furosemide.\n\n      Accordingly, only direct comparison of furosemide and torasemide could present similarities\n      and  differences of these two agents.\n\n      The hypothesis of this study is that torasemide may present more favourable effects on some\n      clinical parameters in patients with heart failure, than furosemide (e.g. clinical symptoms,\n      biochemical parameters, activity of rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, side effects)."
