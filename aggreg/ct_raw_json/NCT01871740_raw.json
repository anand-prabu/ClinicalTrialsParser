The investigators' preliminary research demonstrated\n      that blood concentration of Hcy was negatively correlated to estimated glomerular filtration\n      rate (eGFR), a key index of kidney function. However, the question as to whether\n      Hcy-lowering therapy with folic acid can reduce the risk of chronic kidney disease(CKD)\n      remains to be answered.\n\n      This study, exploiting the hypertensive population of CSPPT trial (ClinicalTrials.gov\n      register number: NCT00794885), is intended to compare the effects of  enalapril maleate and\n      folic acid tablets versus  enalapril maleate in preventing renal function decline among the\n      patients with primary hypertension.  The results from this trial may have the potential to\n      transform current clinical and public health findings into practice in the prevention of\n      chronic kidney disease(CKD) in China."
