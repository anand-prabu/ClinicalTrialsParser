Several authors have proposed that\n      the immunosuppressive state surrounding the perioperative period was a key element of cancer\n      cells spread.\n\n      A particular subtype of T lymphocytes, the Natural Killer cells (NKs), is the main actor of\n      the innate immune system. Several factors of the perioperative period can reduce activity of\n      NKs such as stress, pain, opioids and general anaesthetics.\n\n      Lidocaine is a local anaesthetic that has been widely used intravenously for abdominal\n      surgeries. Intravenous lidocaine has been shown to reduce pain scores, morphine consumption,\n      ileus time and length of stay in major colorectal surgeries. It reduced markers of systemic\n      inflammation as well.\n\n      The authors hypothesize that the use of intravenous lidocaine during laparoscopic surgeries\n      for colorectal cancer resection will preserve NKs activity."
