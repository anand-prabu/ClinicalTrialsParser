Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy together\n      with bone marrow transplantation or peripheral stem cell transplantation works in treating\n      patients with relapsed germ cell cancer."

Autologous bone marrow harvest is performed when adequate stem cells\n      cannot be collected.\n\n      Patients then receive course 1 of high-dose chemotherapy beginning on day -7 with paclitaxel\n      IV over 24 hours. On days -6 to -4, patients receive etoposide IV over 2 hours and\n      carboplatin (CBDCA) IV over 30 minutes 3 times daily. Following a 2 or 3 week recovery, a\n      second course of chemotherapy begins on day -7, consisting of paclitaxel IV over 24 hours,\n      then CBDCA and ifosfamide on days -6 to -4.\n\n      Reinfusion of PBSC and marrow begins on day -2 in both course 1 and 2. In addition, G-CSF IV\n      is given twice a day until 3 consecutive postnadir days of granulocytes of at least\n      1000/mm^3 are maintained. On day 0, stem cells with or without bone marrow product are again\n      administered.\n\n      Surgery may be performed after course 2 if indicated.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: The expected accrual rate is 12 patients per year over 2 years."
