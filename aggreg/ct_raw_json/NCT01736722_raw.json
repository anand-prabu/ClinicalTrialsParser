The Visualase system is FDA cleared for soft\n      tissue ablation in a number of surgical specialties including Neurosurgery (see appendix for\n      documentation). Patients with intracranial brain tumors measuring 3 cm or smaller in largest\n      diameter that have failed any conventional therapy (surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery\n      and/or whole brain radiotherapy) are eligible.\n\n      The target tissue containing the tumor will undergo MRI-guided laser induced thermal\n      therapy. MR imaging is used to define the treatment volume as well as plan and verify\n      placement of the applicator. The extent of ablation is quantitatively monitored and\n      displayed during delivery using real-time, MR temperature imaging. MR temperature imaging\n      will also be used to monitor and control the temperature of adjacent tissues. Treatment will\n      be automatically stopped if the MR temperature feedback system reports the temperature in\n      the adjacent tissue has risen above a preset threshold. Treatment can be manually stopped by\n      the neurosurgeon monitoring the treatment in real-time at any point during the procedure by\n      simply turning off the power to the laser from the Visualase\u00ae system console. After laser\n      delivery, MR images can be used to verify the extent of treatment and plan a therapy\n      delivery if necessary."
