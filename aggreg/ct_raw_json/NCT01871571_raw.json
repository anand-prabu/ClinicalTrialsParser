Some\n      block the ability of tumor to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or\n      carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil,\n      leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor\n      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bevacizumab\n      together with fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin may be an effective\n      treatment for rectal cancer."

To assess the rate of tumor regression (pathologic stage lower than clinical stage) after\n      6 cycles of mFOLFOX7 and bevacizumab in the primary rectal cancer.\n\n      II. To assess local recurrence rate over 3 years after 6 cycles of mFOLFOX7 and bevacizumab.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I.
