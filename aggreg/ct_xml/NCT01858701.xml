      The purpose of this study is to compare the amount of coma as measured by aberrometry
      induced by two silicone hydrogel toric lenses in astigmatic participants.

    <description>Ocular coma is a type of optical aberration or a distortion in image formation occurring when a bundle of light rays enters an optical system (eye) that is not parallel to the optic axis. Ocular coma will be measured in micrometers using a Ladarwave aberrometer. A lower number indicates less coma/less image distortion.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Sign informed consent;

          -  Wears toric soft contact lenses;

          -  Can be successfully fit with study lenses within the power ranges available;

          -  Has cylinder of ≥ -0.75 diopter in both eyes;

          -  Has correctable vision of at least 0.1 (logMAR) or better in each eye at distance
             with both study lenses;

          -  Willing and able to wear study lenses on a daily wear basis for at least 5 days a
             week, minimum 8 hours per day, and attend all study visits;

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any ocular condition that would contraindicate contact lens wear;

          -  Use of medications for which contact lens wear could be contraindicated;

          -  Monocular (only one eye with functional vision) or fit with one lens;

          -  History of herpetic keratitis, ocular surgery, or irregular cornea;

          -  Known sensitivity to the diagnostic pharmaceuticals to be used in the study;

          -  Requires presbyopic correction;

          -  Use of rewetting/lubricating eye-drops more than twice a day;

          -  Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.
