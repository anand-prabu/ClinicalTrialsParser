            "textblock": "Regular reading with young children strengthens the parent-child relationship and builds\n      their language, literacy and social emotional skills. Parent knowledge of normal variation\n      of infant crying and of the dangers of shaking a baby as well as their ability to cope with\n      infant irritability are likely factors in their successful adjustment to parenthood and the\n      prevention of this tragic act.\n\n      Purpose: Identify easily implementable interventions for economically disadvantaged mothers\n      in the newborn period which 1) Promote early literacy behaviors and early nurturing\n      parent-child relationships and 2) Increase mother's knowledge of normal crying patterns, the\n      dangers of shaking a baby and her ability to cope with parenting stresses.\n\n      Design/Methods: A convenience sample of 400 low income (insured by Medicaid) new mothers of\n      healthy singleton, full term infants in the level 1 mother/baby unit at Women & Infants'\n      Hospital will be invited to participate in a Randomized Controlled Trial study of\n      educational videos and materials for parents. They will be randomized into one of two\n      intervention groups. 1) The Ready to Learn (RTL) arm will receive a DVD in both Spanish and\n      English and a bilingual booklet (both produced by Parents' action for Children)  addressing\n      the benefits of reading, talking and playing with young children, as well as a new\n      children's board book. 2) The All Babies Cry (ABC) arm will receive a DVD in both, Spanish\n      and English and a bilingual booklet (both produced by VIDA) explaining crying as part of\n      normal infant behavior, highlighting signs of parental distress and providing strategies to\n      sooth parents and their children. We will enroll 100 mothers who speak Spanish primarily at\n      home in each intervention group, as well as 100 mothers who speak primarily English. The RTL\n      mothers will serve as controls for the ABC mothers and vice versa. Before reviewing the\n      materials, mothers will be asked to respond to a baseline interview with socio-demographic\n      information, questions regarding Early Literacy promotion, reading with children and their\n      own reading habits as well as general knowledge on the prevention of shaking a baby and\n      handling their own stress. Follow up phone interviews will be conducted by a bilingual\n      research assistant blind to the intervention status at 2-4 months post-partum and then at\n      5-6 months post-partum containing similar questions. Consenting mothers will receive a bag\n      of diapers at the completion of enrollment interview as an incentive for participating in\n      the study. Data will be entered into Excel and transferred into STATA for analysis.\n      Frequency counts will be generated for demographic, literacy related and parental knowledge\n      and stress variables in the two intervention arms. Chi-Square and T-tests will be used to\n      compare literacy and parental knowledge outcomes for each intervention group at both follow\n      up interviews.\n\n      Hypotheses: 1) Mothers in the RTL branch will recognize the importance of reading to their\n      babies, initiating this activity at earlier ages and reading more often with them. 2)\n      Mothers in the ABC branch will gain an understanding of crying as part of normal infant\n      behavior and build strategies to sooth themselves and their newborns."

We will enroll 100 mothers who speak Spanish primarily at home\n      in each intervention group, as well as 100 mothers who speak primarily English in each arm.\n      The RTL mothers will serve as controls for the ABC mothers and vice versa. Before reviewing\n      the materials, mothers will be asked to respond to a baseline interview with\n      socio-demographic information, questions regarding Early Literacy promotion, reading with\n      children and their own reading habits as well as general knowledge on the prevention of\n      shaking a baby and handling their own stress.

Data will be\n      entered into Excel and transferred into STATA for analysis.\n\n      Sample Size calculation:\n\n      For power analysis, we used categorical (behavioral) outcomes to arrive at conservative\n      estimates of sample sizes with a 0.05 significance level. Effect sizes for differences in\n      proportions are based on Cohen's h statistic (Cohen, 1988), computed for 80% power and\n      Two-tailed significance test at alpha = 0.05 with equal numbers of participants in the\n      intervention and control groups and a Confidence Interval of 95%.\n\n      From a previous study of the All Babies Cry intervention at 17 weeks postpartum 36% of\n      control group answered similar knowledge questions correctly, compared to 45% of those\n      receiving the All Babies Cry Intervention. This resulted in a difference of 6% and SD of 18\n      in the control group and 19 in the intervention group.\n\n      Based on this using Open Epi for sample size calculation we arrived at a group size of 150\n      subjects in each branch of the study. In this study with the All Babies Cry Intervention we\n      had a follow up rate of 77% at 17 weeks. To account for a possible loss to follow up of 25%\n      of subjects we will increase the sample size from 75 to 100 individuals in each group for a\n      total of 200 subjects in each branch of the study.\n\n      Previous studies of Early Literacy interventions in low income families have shown larger\n      differences in similar literacy outcomes to ours. We are therefore basing our calculations\n      on a more conservative data assumption.\n\n      Statistical Analysis:\n\n      Frequency counts will be generated for demographic, literacy related and parental knowledge\n      and stress variables in the two intervention arms. Chi-Square and T-tests will be used to\n      compare literacy and parental knowledge outcomes for each intervention group at baseline and\n      at both follow up interviews."
