  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare three CE-marked daily disposable contact lenses for
      tear film stability as measured by pre-lens non-invasive keratograph break up time (PL
      NIK-BUT). Secondarily, contact lens surface wettability will be assessed. Each participant
      will wear three brands of contact lenses in a randomized, cross-over fashion.

    <description>The pre-lens tear film is the layer of tears located on top of the contact lens (i.e., between the eye lid and the contact lens). The time required for a dry spot to appear on the corneal surface after blinking is referred to as the tear film break-up time. Circular images will be projected onto the contact lens using an Oculus Keratograph 5 and the tear film reflection will be observed. PL NIK-BUT is recorded at the first sign of distortion. A longer tear film break-up time indicates a more stable tear film.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The investigator will grade lens wettability by corneal region using a scale from 0 (fully wettable) to 3 (clearly visible ring distortions in more than 1/3 of ring reflection zone). The total wettability score per eye will be calculated by averaging the grade of each of the 5 corneal regions (central, superior, nasal, inferior, and temporal).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Sign Informed Consent.

          -  Adapted contact lens wearer.

          -  Willing to wear contact lenses up to 12 hours and attend all study visits.

          -  Vision correctable to 0.1 (logMAR) or better in each eye at distance with pre-study
             lenses at Visit 1.

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any ocular infection, inflammation, abnormality, or active disease that would
             contraindicate contact lens wear.

          -  Any use of systemic or ocular medications that would contraindicate contact lens
             wear.

          -  Any ocular finding observed during the Visit 1 examination that would contraindicate
             contact lens wear.

          -  Monocular subjects (only one eye with functional vision) or subjects fit with only
             one lens.

          -  Known pregnancy.

          -  Participation in any clinical study within 30 days of Visit 1.

          -  Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.
