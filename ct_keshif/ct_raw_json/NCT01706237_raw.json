Early speed\n      of visual recovery results indicate that the visual recovery in the first 4 hours after the\n      LASIK procedure show the most variability.  A patient's ability to drive after their LASIK\n      procedure would potentially alleviate a challenge that patients often face in taking\n      additional time off work or simply finding a ride to there LASIK procedure."

Visual recovery and management of immediate post operative visual acuity is\n      important for patient satisfaction."
