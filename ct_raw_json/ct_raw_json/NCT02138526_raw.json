            "textblock": "Pazopanib (Votrient) is registered for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell\n      carcinoma and patients with soft tissue sarcoma who have received prior chemotherapy. It is\n      administered at a fixed oral dose of 800 mg once daily (OD) regardless of size, age and\n      clinical condition.  It is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with an  oral\n      bioavailability of ~21%.  Pazopanib is practically insoluble and highly permeable. When\n      ingested with high fat food the pazopanib exposure (area under the concentration time curve\n      (AUC)) is doubled. Common adverse effects are diarrhea and nausea. This might be caused by\n      the non-absorbed proportion of pazopanib. A reduced dose taken with food could be a possible\n      approach to reduce these side effects. Therefore the investigators initially want to\n      determine the equivalent reduced dose of pazopanib when taken with a continental breakfast.\n      Thereafter the investigators want to investigate whether the intake with food reduces the\n      frequently reported side effects nausea and diarrhea."

Subjects must provide written informed consent prior to performance of study-specific\n             procedures or assessments and must be willing to comply with treatment and follow-up.\n\n             Note: informed consent may be obtained prior to start of the specified screening\n             window.\n\n             Note: procedures conducted as part of the subject's routine clinical management (e.g.\n             blood count) and obtained prior to signing of informed consent may be utilized for\n             screening or baseline purposes provided these procedures are conducted as specified\n             in the protocol.\n\n          2. \u2265 18 year old men and women who use pazopanib\n\n          3.

Poorly controlled hypertension; systolic blood pressure (SBP) \u2265 40 mm Hg or diastolic\n             blood pressure (DBP) \u2265 90 mm Hg.\n\n             Note: initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive medication(s) is permitted prior\n             to study entry.  Following antihypertensive medication initiation or adjustment,\n             blood pressure (BP) must be re-assessed three times at approximately 2-minute\n             intervals. At least 24 hours must have elapsed between anti-hypertensive medication\n             initiation or adjustment and BP measurement. These three values should be averaged to\n             obtain the mean diastolic blood pressure and the mean systolic blood pressure. The\n             mean SBP / DBP ratio must be <140/90 mmHg (OR 150/90 mm Hg, if this criterion is\n             approved by Safety Review Team) in order for a subject to be eligible for the study.\n\n          2.

Major surgery or trauma within 28 days prior to first dose of investigational product\n             and/or presence of any non-healing wound, fracture, or ulcer (procedures such as\n             catheter placement not considered to be major surgery).\n\n          8. Evidence of active bleeding or bleeding diathesis.\n\n          9. Known endobronchial lesions and/or lesions infiltrating major pulmonary vessels that\n             increase the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage.\n\n             Note: Lesions infiltrating major pulmonary vessels (contiguous tumor and vessels) are\n             excluded; however, the presence of a tumor that is touching, but not infiltrating\n             (abutting) the vessel is acceptable (CT with contrast is strongly recommended to\n             evaluate such lesions).\n\n         10.
