The study design consists of two\n      phases: Screening and 12-month Double-Blind treatment phase.  Following the Screening phase,\n      all eligible subjects will be randomized to receive Double-Blind DMAb (60 mg) or Placebo\n      study medication in a 3:1 ratio.  DMAb 60 mg and placebo will be administered as a single\n      subcutaneous (SC) injection at the beginning of the Double-Blind phase and at 6 months\n      following the initial dose.  All subjects will receive daily supplementation of oral\n      elemental calcium (at least 600 mg) and vitamin D (at least 400 IU).  The primary objective\n      is to determine the effects of DMAb compared to placebo with respect to mean percent change\n      in BMD at the lumbar spine, as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), from\n      Baseline to Month 12.  Secondary objectives include the evaluation between the DMAb and\n      placebo treatment groups: change in BMD: at the lumbar spine (Month 6), total hip (Months 6\n      and 12), femoral neck (Months 6 and 12) and trochanter (Months 6 and 12); and serum\n      biomarkers of bone formation and resorption (Months 6 and 12).  Clinical safety of denosumab\n      will also be assessed in this population."
