This protocol uses an\n      adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) to image the normal and diseased\n      retina with individual cellular resolution non-invasively. The primary objective of this\n      study is to obtain and analyze high-resolution images of the retina, in particular by\n      imaging the cone photoreceptor mosaic, the retinal vasculature and other retinal layers. The\n      study design will involve case-control studies, where cases are followed over time. Subjects\n      age 7 and older may be invited to participate. The main research procedure involves retinal\n      imaging with the AOSLO. The primary endpoint is the observation of differences in retinal\n      images between subjects with and without retinal diseases. These changes will be quantified\n      by examining the cell density, size, spacing and regularity of the cone photoreceptor\n      mosaic, as well as examining the differences between other retinal layers."
