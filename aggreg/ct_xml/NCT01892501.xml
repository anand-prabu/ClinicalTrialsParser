    <textblock>
      Impact of screening nodes mediastinal by PET, at different times of the management of cancer
      disease, remain unclear.

      Benefits of combined PET and puncture with echoendoscopy for the diagnosis subsequent
      therapeutic management should be evaluated in these different contexts.

      We would like to demonstrate the clinical utility of this association to replace more
      invasive diagnostic procedures and to assess the impact of the puncture on a possible
      modification of the therapeutic management.

      It is a single center prospective  diagnostic assessment

      Main objective :

      Assess the performance (in terms of sensitivity) of guided punction by echoendoscopy in the
      characterization of hypermetabolic mediastinal lymph nodes in PET, in a context of New
      cancer or cancer recurrence.

      Conduct of the study :

      When a patient has had a PET scan showing a hypermetabolic or mediastinal lymph nodes in the
      lower, middle or posterior, his case is presented in a multidisciplinary meeting (PCR # 1),
      with definition of diagnostic strategy:

      Approved indication is achieve a biopsy surgically to have a histological documentation of
      mediastinal lymph nodes with obvious impact on treatment decisions.

      We distinguish two groups of patients based on the feasibility of the surgical procedure:

        1. Group A biopsy is surgically feasible

        2. Group B: biopsy by surgery can not be performed (against medical contraindications or
           anesthetics) at that moment, definition of therapeutic strategy that was decided in the
           absence of histological documentation:

             -  Surgery outset

             -  Chemotherapy or other oncological treatment

             -  Supports non-oncological if benign disease suspected

             -  No treatment.

      EUS is performed by oesophageal for two patient groups for the two groups of patients
      (within a maximum period of six weeks after the PET scan), under general anesthesia and
      endoscopic control.

      According the pathological findings, the therapeutic strategy is defined in a second PCR
      (PCR # 2), to assess the impact of the puncture:

        -  Surgery outset

        -  Chemotherapy or other oncological treatment

        -  Supports non-oncological when benign pathology documented

        -  No treatment

        -  Selecting another surgical diagnostic procedure (non-contributory income).

      A patient monitoring will be conducted for 12 months. The clinical and radiological data
      carried over the standard of care of the patient will be collected. Achieving a
      thoracoabdominopelvien scanner (TAP) at 1 year to characterize the evolution of the disease
      marks the end of the study for the patient.

      For the patients who have had a negative biopsy, monitoring will involve a scanner TAP 6
      month and 12 month then consultation with the oncologist.

    <description>The primary endpoint is the performance of endoscopic ultrasound-guided puncture after detection of lymph nodes with PET. The performance of EUS guided biopsy will be evaluated in terms of sensitivity. In most cases, only one lymph node is taken and performance analysis will be done by patient and not by injury. The reference technique (gold standard) is followed for 12 months. Sensitivity is the rate of subjects with a diagnosis of malignancy (excluding the results atypical / suspicious or non-contributory) according the results of EUS among all subjects with a neoplastic disease by the gold reference.</description>
