  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At an academic tertiary referral center, patients with pelvic floor dysfunction, scheduled
      for outpatient cystoscopy or urodynamic testing will be asked to participate in the study.
      Patients will be called one day after the examination and will be asked about pain and their
      general state of health.

      The purpose of this study it to investigate pain perception in urogynecologic patients
      during outpatient cystoscopy and compare it with pain perception during outpatient
      urodynamic. The investigators will also investigate the difference between anticipated and
      actual pain perception. The investigators will test the null hypothesis that there is no
      difference in patients´ pain perception between outpatient cystoscopy and urodynamic
      testing. The secondary hypothesis will be that there is no difference between patients´
      anticipated amount of pain and the actually experienced pain during cystoscopy and
      urodynamic testing.

      According to power calculation, a sample size of 52 patients per group will be needed to
      detect a 2 cm difference in pain scores on the VAS - judged as a clinically significant
      difference - with 95% power and a two-sided significance level of 0.05.

      Exclusion criteria are: age ≤ 18 years, insufficient ability to understand German, pregnancy
      and the participation in another clinical study at the same time.
