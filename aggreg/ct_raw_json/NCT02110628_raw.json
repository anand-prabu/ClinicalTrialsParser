Nowadays, in order to improve the quality of\n      life, controversies still exist to the reconstruction methods of total gastrectomy. Although\n      roux-en-y anastomosis is the most common method adopted after total gastrectomy for it is an\n      easily and safety method reconstruction method, but some problems still need us to solve,\n      such as little food reserves, less food intake per meal and fast gastric emptying. These\n      problems significantly affect the patients' quality of life after surgery. Roux-en-Y+Jejunal\n      pouch anastomosis is newly born method can significant increase the volume to improve\n      postoperative quality of life have been proven by some little sample size randomized control\n      trail With the improvement of the gastric cancer surgery, this study proposed by prospective\n      randomized controlled clinical trials aimed to comparing quality of life after traditional\n      Roux-en-Y type and Roux-en-Y+ Jejunal pouch type anastomosis for radical total gastrectomy.\n      Quality of life was evaluated according to the European Organization for Research and\n      Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality Of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 and QLQ-STO22.
