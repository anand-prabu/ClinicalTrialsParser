            "textblock": "Epithelial ovarian cancer (OC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in women, after\n      lung, breast and colon cancer, and it represents the most common cause of death from\n      gynaecological malignancies. The high mortality associated with OC is due to the lack of\n      screening tests that enable an early diagnosis, thus the majority of patients are diagnosed\n      at advanced stages of the disease when the chances of a cure are very limited. In fact, the\n      5-year overall survival (OS) rate for stage III-IV OC does not exceed 20-30% in many series.\n      The standard treatment for advanced OC is maximal cytoreductive  surgery  (or debulking)\n      followed by  the  administration  of  6  cycles  of adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin\n      and paclitaxel.\n\n      In recent years, a number of studies have been carried out with antiangiogenic drugs.\n      Specifically, bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, has been shown to be active\n      both in monotherapy and combination therapy in patients with OC that have received multiple\n      previous lines of chemotherapy.\n\n      One of the objectives is to evaluate whether the addition of neoadjuvant bevacizumab\n      improves the response and whether this affects the evolution of patients."
