If so, characteristics of the immune cells may also unveil the\n      mechanisms behind lack of response to Infliximab.\n\n      Design: a prospective, observational study with three arms. In the treatment group, 40\n      patients with Crohn's disease about to start Infliximab-treatment are recruited. They have\n      blood samples drawn at day 1 before first treatment, after 6 week, and again after 22 weeks\n      of treatment. 12 healthy volunteers and 12 Crohn disease patients with low disease activity\n      and no Infliximab treatment are the control groups. Controls are only investigated once. All\n      treatment and follow-up are according to national guidelines, and data from this study is\n      not used by the clinicians.\n\n      Methods: the number of regulatory T-cells and pro-inflammatory T-cells (Th17 cells) is\n      investigated using flow cytometry. From plasma and serum samples, various proteins\n      (biomarkers), such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and tumour necrosis factor\n      alpha (TNF-alpha), are measured using immunoassays. From frozen immune cells, intracellular\n      signaling pathways (e.g. the TGF-beta pathway) are investigated at a later time point also\n      by flow cytometry. Patient data (demographics and medical history) are extracted from\n      various registries."
