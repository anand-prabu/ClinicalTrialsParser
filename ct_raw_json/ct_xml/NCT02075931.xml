  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have learned that knee replacement patients are not more physically active
      after surgery. This is true even though their pain is less compared to before surgery. This
      low level of physical activity is not healthy. It can increase the chances of weight gain,
      which can create other issues. It can also lessen physical function. Some studies have
      looked at physical activity feedback systems to increase how active people are. Studies have
      investigated face to face patient group meetings for this,too. These systems and meetings
      can increase physical activity. The investigators will study the effects of a physical
      activity monitors with group meetings after knee replacement. The investigators hypothesize
      that physical activity levels and physical function will increase. The investigators goal is
      to help knee replacement patients lead healthier lives and maintain or enhance their
      physical function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 650,000 total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) are performed annually to alleviate pain
      and disability associated with osteoarthritis (OA); a chronic, degenerative condition that
      compromises the quality of life of 37% of adults over age 60. With the aging of the
      population, an estimated 3.5 million TKAs will be performed annually by 2030. Despite
      improvements in pain and self-reported function, physical activity after TKA remains at
      pre-operative, sedentary levels (&lt;5,000 steps/day). Physical activity in TKA confers
      powerful protective effects against common post-surgical sequelae including increased weight
      gain (mean=6.4 kg, 2 years post TKA), decreased functional performance, increased
      risk/progression of co-morbid conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular
      disease), and progression of knee and hip osteoarthritis which may necessitate additional
      joint replacement in the contralateral limb. An intervention aimed at improved
      self-management of physical activity may aid patients in overcoming habitual lifestyle
      patterns of low physical activity secondary to knee pain prior to TKA.

      Recent investigations on the effects of real-time, user-friendly, electronic physical
      activity feedback (PAF) systems and face-to-face (FTF) patient group meetings aimed to
      promote self-management of physical activity suggest that such interventions can
      successfully increase physical activity. Therefore, the investigators propose a randomized,
      controlled trial to assess efficacy and feasibility of a physical activity intervention
      combined with FTF group meetings (PAF+FTF) initiated within one month of patients' discharge
      from outpatient rehabilitation for TKA compared to a control group receiving standard care
      (CON). This type of intervention is surprisingly novel to this patient population and is not
      common practice in rehabilitation following TKA.
