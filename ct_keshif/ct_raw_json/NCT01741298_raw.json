Pts were asked to wear a pedometer and record their food intake for at least the week prior to each session. The first 4 sessions were delivered weekly, followed by 4 sessions delivered biweekly and finally 9 sessions delivered monthly. Each session was approximately 1-2 hrs. At the beginning of each session anthropometric, physical activity and dietary data were collected. Participants were lead in a 5 min deep breathing exercise before the didactic portion of the session began. Sessions targeted a broad range of material related to diet, physical activity, and psychosocial well-being. Participants were given homework assignments to incorporate covered material into their daily lives. Participants randomized to the intervention arm received follow-up assessments at 6 and 12 months post randomization."
