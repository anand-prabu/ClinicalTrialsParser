            "textblock": "Idiopathic Toe Walking (ITW) is a diagnosis normally of exclusion and likely, consequently,\n      is approached in vastly varying ways of intervention, including serial casting, Botox\n      injections and physical therapy. There is some evidence in the literature that children with\n      ITW can somewhat correct their lack of heel-strike gait pattern at least temporarily.\n      Kinesio Taping (KT) method is an intervention that is used in the outpatient physical\n      therapy setting for various conditions such as post-operative edema, muscle facilitation of\n      weakened rotator cuff muscles, and functional corrections in children with torticollis. This\n      pilot study will strive to determine if KT may be effective by providing proprioceptive and\n      neuromuscular re-education through thermal and mechanical fascial impositions, thereby\n      improving passive joint range of motion (ROM) through reduction of passive muscle stiffness\n      and improving ambulation through neuromuscular re-education in children with idiopathic toe\n      walking. We will quantify passive muscle stiffness of the gastrocnemius and opposing\n      anterior tibialis using non-invasive Shear Wave Elastography (SWE). Further we look at the\n      kinematics and kinetics of the child's ankle during the gait cycle to further determine any\n      effect(s) of KT on functional walking outcome measures. The intent is that the results from\n      this study will serve as a platform from which to expound look at the long-term, if any,\n      effects of KT on the muscle property and gait cycle pattern in children with ITW."

Abnormal passive stiffness of these muscles is thought to result in the loss of passive ROM and changes to ambulation. However, direct measurements of passive muscles stiffness in children have not been able to be done, until recently. Therefore, we propose to quantify the passive muscle stiffness of the gastrocnemius muscle and anterior tibialis muscle in children with ITW before and after KT treatment using SWE.",

Changes to these parameters are used to evaluate effect of treatment on ITW.
