This will enable efficient,\n      observational, disease-related data capture across CARRA sites.  The CARRA Registry\n      described in this protocol will form the foundational database and will involve the capture\n      of data including pediatric rheumatic diseases as described in Appendix A.\n\n      The CARRA Registry will support data collection from the use of consensus treatment plans\n      (CTPs), clinical trials, observational disease registries, comparative effectiveness\n      research, and other research on patients with pediatric rheumatic disease.  The CARRA\n      Registry will form the basis for future CARRA studies and the Duke Clinical Research\n      Institute (DCRI) is serving as the CARRA Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for this protocol."
