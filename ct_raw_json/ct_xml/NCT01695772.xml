  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, single arm, multicenter study will evaluate the resection rate in patients
      with colorectal cancer and previously untreated unresectable liver-only metastases after
      adding Avastin (bevacizumab) to 5-FU based doublet chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting.
      Patients will receive standard 5-FU based chemotherapy plus Avastin 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks
      for a maximum of 12 cycles combined pre- and postoperatively unless they experience
      progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult Chinese patients, 18-75 years of age

          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma in colon or rectum with primary lesion
             surgically removed

          -  Previously untreated unresectable liver-only metastases

          -  Liver lesions determined to be unresectable by multidisciplinary team (MDT,
             consisting of experienced hepatic surgeons, medical oncologist and radiologist).
             Guidelines used to determine unresectability includes:

          -  R0 treatment infeasible with resection

          -  cannot spare two adjacent liver segments

          -  retention of liver volume &lt;30%

          -  vascular flow and biliary drainage cannot be preserved

          -  No previous treatment against liver metastases, including chemotherapy, surgery,
             radiotherapy, TACE and target therapy

          -  Adequate hematological, renal and hepatic function

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 3 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The relapse has occurred within 6 months of completion of the adjuvant treatment

          -  Expected impossible to achieve R0 resection and/or gain 30% residual liver volume
             even with responsive neoadjuvant therapy

          -  Patient cannot tolerate the surgery

          -  Other malignancies in the past 5 years, except for curatively treated basal cell
             carcinoma of the skin and/or in situ carcinoma of the cervix

          -  Any extrahepatic metastases and/or recurrence of the primary tumor

          -  Any residual toxicity from previous chemotherapy (except alopecia) of NCI CTC v.4.0
             grade 2

          -  Hypertension crisis or encephalopathy

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular disease

          -  Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy

          -  Current or recent (within 10 days of study drug initiation) use of full dose of
             aspirin, clopidrogel or warfarin

          -  History or evidence of CNS disease (e-g- primary brain tumor, seizures not controlled
             with standard medical therapy, any brain metastases, or history of stroke)
