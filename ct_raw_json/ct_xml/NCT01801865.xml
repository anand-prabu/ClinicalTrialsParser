  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to make medically indicated state of the art/high end
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams available to all infants in the Cincinnati Children's
      Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current practice of transferring infants from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) to
      radiology departments and imaging in adult-sized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners
      is associated with significant safety and image quality issues.  For these reasons, the
      smallest and/or sickest neonates are typically precluded from receiving an MRI exam.  The
      overreaching goal of our research effort is to bring high-performance MRI into the NICU so
      that all neonates can benefit from the same quality of diagnostic imaging as adults.  To
      accomplish this, we have converted a commercial small-bore 1.5 Tesla (T) MRI scanner
      designed for orthopedic use into a neonatal MRI system optimized for whole body imaging of
      neonates. To expand the imaging capabilities of the NICU MRI system, the measurement control
      electronics and operating system software of the FDA cleared imaging OPTIMA platform have
      been augmented with state of the art HDX electronics and software currently used on a
      conventional commercially available adult sized whole body MRI scanner. The clinical safety
      of the integrated HDX/OPTIMA NICU MRI system and its ability to produce diagnostic image
      quality has been shown in 15 pilot patients (CCHMC Protocol 2011-2045).  The present
      protocol builds and expands upon the previous to use the integrated NICU MRI system to
      perform MRI exams in the neonatal population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any infant admitted to the NICU at CCHMC

          -  Have a medical condition for which an MRI exam is indicated, as determined by the
             attending neonatologist

          -  Able to maintain body temperature for at least 90 minutes without the aid of an
             incubator or radiant warmer int he opinion of the attending neonatologist

          -  Parental/LAR permission obtained

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Infants too large to fit in the customized NICU MRI system comfortably (expected to
             be infants heavier than 6 kg)

          -  Standard MRI exclusion criteria as set forth by the CCHMC Division of Radiology
