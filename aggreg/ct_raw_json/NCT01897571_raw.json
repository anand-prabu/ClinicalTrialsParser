Once MTD is established, the effect of food on the bioavailability of E7438 will be evaluated beginning with a single dose on Days -8 and -1, then BID on a continuous basis for a DDI potential as evaluated by the effect of E7438 on the pharmacokinetic of midazolam, a CYP3A4 substrate. Phase 2 will be conducted in two stages and subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 manner to receive either E7439 or standard of care treatment. Subjects with confirmation of disease progression by the investigator and sponsor while receiving standard of care therapy will be eligible to receive optional E7438 treatment and enter into the optional E7438 Crossover Treatment Period of the Extension Phase (Stage 2b)."
