            "textblock": "MPS IIIB is caused by a genetic defect resulting in a lack of the enzyme called NAGLU (or\n      N-acetylglucosaminidase).  Synageva BioPharma Corp is developing SBC-103, a recombinant form\n      of the human NAGLU enzyme, as an enzyme replacement approach for MPS IIIB.  Recent\n      scientific studies have indicated a  possible defect in the barrier between the blood and\n      the brain (the so called 'blood-brain barrier') in mice with MPS IIIB and in patients with\n      MPS IIIA and IIIC.  In order to understand the effects of SBC-103 in patients, using new\n      imaging methods, it will be important to understand if the blood brain barrier is abnormal\n      in MPS IIIB patients. In addition to supporting the development of new therapies, this\n      information may provide new insights that could impact how MPSIIIB patients are treated.\n\n      The results of this study will help Synageva BioPharma Corp design and start further studies\n      with the purpose of developing an effective enzyme therapy to treat MPS IIIB."
