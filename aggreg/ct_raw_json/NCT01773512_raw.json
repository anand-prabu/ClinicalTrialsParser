The second part of the study is\n      prediction of coronary atherosclerosis changes during high-dose lipid-lowering therapy\n      (rosuvastatin 40 mg daily). Coronary artery impairment will be examined by up-to date\n      technology using the fusion of angiography, intravascular ultrasound and virtual histology\n      for 3D coronary artery reconstruction together with information about mechanical properties\n      of arteries like a vessel shear stress. This algorithm for non-invasive assessment of\n      coronary impairment and its changes during will be used for detection of high risk patients\n      (in terms of acute coronary syndrome development) and of patients with low response to\n      statin therapy.   Further target is detailed assessment of atherosclerosis development and\n      its changes during lipid-lowering therapy."
