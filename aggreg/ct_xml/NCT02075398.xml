        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or Female subjects 18 years or older (inclusive)

          -  Subject is able to participate for the duration of the study

          -  Subject is willing to sign an informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject with abnormalities that may prevent proper application of the devices

          -  Physiologic abnormalities that prevent proper application of pulse oximetry sensor

          -  Severe contact allergies that cause a reaction to standard adhesive materials such as
             those fund in medical sensors and electrodes

          -  Subjects with significant arrhythmia, as determined by subject self-report during
             screening and I/E criteria assessment at study start. (Three events of irregularities
             in radial pulse with thirty seconds).
