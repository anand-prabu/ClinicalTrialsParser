            "textblock": "Research over the past several decades have linked the intake of dietary fiber with lower\n      blood cholesterol levels. The distinction between soluble and insoluble fiber fractions\n      emerged shortly after and there is now a general consensus that soluble fiber possesses the\n      capacity to lower cholesterol. Since the discovery of the cholesterol lowering effects of\n      soluble dietary fiber, there has been much debate as to the degree of cholesterol reduction\n      from these fibers. In order to handle the inconsistencies a full and systematic review of\n      the published literature was conducted by Brown et. al (1999). Results from this\n      meta-analysis, concluded that 'increasing soluble fiber can make only a small contribution\n      to lowering cholesterol.'\n\n      Research is constantly progressing and new research findings may not always be consistent\n      with older data. For example, results from new research are now challenging the previously\n      approved health claims for soy foods and fatty acids. This is a major public health concern\n      because if clinical evidence is not reliable, it could lead to harm. Since the publication\n      of the meta-analysis by Brown et. al (1999) over a decade ago, scientists have continued to\n      research the effects of soluble fiber on cholesterol levels with new technology and trial\n      designs, therefore it is crucial to revisit the question of whether soluble fibers are\n      effects at lowering cholesterol. The purpose of the study is to statistically review the\n      full body of literature on soluble fibers and cholesterol levels and determine whether\n      results remain consistent with the previous conclusions Brown et. al.\n\n      A meta-analysis will be performed to assess the link between soluble fibers and serum\n      cholesterol levels. Nutritionists now consider fiber to be an integral part of diet and\n      disease. Results from this meta-analysis help address the question of whether soluble fibers\n      have a role lowering serum cholesterol levels."
