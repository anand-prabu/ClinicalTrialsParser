A skin temperature sensor will be taped to the anterior of one breast and skin temperature will be recorded. The subject will be asked to sit for 15 minutes in the waiting room prior to injection of the Tc-99m sestamibi. Just prior to injection, skin temperature will be recorded again. After completion of the first study the subject will then be given a warm towel robe and a small heating pad to be placed over the chest area. After 30 minutes, skin temperature will be recorded again immediately prior to injection of the second dose of Tc-99m sestamibi. The second MBI study will then be performed."
