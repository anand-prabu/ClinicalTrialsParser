Reactive oxygen species (ROS) likely contribute to this process. Strategies\n      utilizing endogenous skin antioxidants as well as plant-derived or synthetic compounds have\n      been examined.\n\n      Cocoa beans fresh from the tree are exceptionally rich in polyphenols, such as flavanol, and\n      have a higher antioxidant capacity. The present study is designed to investigate the effects\n      of long-term intake of a product rich in cocoa flavanols on facial wrinkles, hydration,\n      elasticity and photosensitivity."
