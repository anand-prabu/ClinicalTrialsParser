  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this multicenter project, we will introduce AWARE (electronic interface) Using a
      cloud-based technology . The goal of this project is to improve compliance with best
      practice through the use of a new acute care interface with built-in tools for error
      prevention, practice surveillance and reporting (ProCCESs AWARE -  Patient Centered
      Cloud-based Electronic System: Ambient Warning and Response Evaluation).The goal of this
      project is to develop and test a novel acute care interface with built-in tools for error
      prevention, practice surveillance, decision support and reporting (ProCCESs AWARE -  Patient
      Centered Cloud-based Electronic System: Ambient Warning and Response Evaluation). In
      preliminary studies, these novel informatics supports built on an advanced understanding of
      cognitive and organizational ergonomics, have significantly decreased the cognitive load of
      bedside providers and reduced medical errors. Using a cloud-based technology, AWARE will be
      uniformly available on either mobile or fixed computing devices and applied in a
      standardized manner in medical and surgical ICUs of five geographically diverse acute care
      hospitals predominantly serving Medicare and Medicaid patients. The impact of ProCCESs AWARE
      on processes of care and outcomes in study ICUs; expected to enroll more than 10,000
      critically ill patients during the study period.
