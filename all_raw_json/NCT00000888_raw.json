It is important to learn how to prevent HIV-positive pregnant women\n      from giving HIV to their babies. RTV and ZDV have been shown to be safe and effective\n      against HIV in adults. The combination of 3 anti-HIV drugs (RTV, 3TC, and ZDV) may help\n      prevent HIV infection from mother to infant but studies are needed to determine whether they\n      are safe and effective during pregnancy."

            "textblock": "Controlled studies of the pharmacokinetics and safety of new drugs are critical to the\n      development of alternative therapies for the prevention of perinatal transmission of HIV-1.\n      The dosing regimen of RTV and ZDV used to treat pregnant women in this study has been shown\n      to be safe and effective against HIV in adults. Little is known about the metabolism and\n      tolerance of these drugs during pregnancy, and Phase I studies are needed to determine\n      dosage, safety, and tolerance. Protease inhibitors in combination with other antiretroviral\n      drugs may help reduce the rate of perinatal transmission of HIV-1.\n\n      Pregnant women start with RTV (increasing gradually over a few days) plus 3TC plus ZDV until\n      active labor. Intrapartum, women receive RTV plus 3TC plus ZDV, then postpartum (after cord\n      clamped until 12 weeks postpartum), RTV plus 3TC plus ZDV. [AS PER AMENDMENT 2/9/99: For\n      maternal dosing, one Combivir tablet (containing 3TC and ZDV) may be administered in place\n      of the individual agents 3TC and ZDV. During the intrapartum period, Combivir is held and\n      the patient follows intrapartum 3TC/ZDV dosing. During the intrapartum period, no RTV is\n      given after the onset of active labor.  During the postpartum period, RTV is begun as soon\n      as oral intake is allowable following delivery. During the postpartum period, Combivir may\n      be resumed. All subjects who prematurely discontinue study treatment should continue to be\n      followed for the duration of the study.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 9/28/99: During the intrapartum\n      period, RTV is given at the start of active labor.] Infants begin 3TC and ZDV as soon as\n      oral intake is tolerated. Infants participate in one of two cohorts. The first four infants\n      delivered (Cohort 1) receive RTV as a single dose between Days 8 and 12. The next six\n      infants delivered (Cohort 2) start RTV at 2-3 days of life. The dosing schedule is based on\n      Cohort 1 drug pharmacokinetics data. [AS PER AMENDMENT 2/9/99: Cohort 1 is expanded to seven\n      mother/infant pairs.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 9/28/99: Cohort 1 is expanded to eight mother/infant\n      pairs.] Both maternal and infant blood is drawn to assess drug pharmacokinetics. Cervical\n      secretions are collected to assess presence of virus. In addition, all placentas are\n      examined by histopathology to determine the role of placenta on preterm delivery in women\n      receiving  combination antiretroviral therapy."
