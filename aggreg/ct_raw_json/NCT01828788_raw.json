It may be\n      responsible for respiratory complications such as bronchial or pulmonary infection, and may\n      also delay the patient's rehabilitation and therefore prolong the duration of in-hospital\n      stay. A previous pilot study performed in our department showed a sensible improvement of\n      analgesia at movement and of rehabilitation with a continuous bilaterosternal infusion of\n      local anaesthesia [Eljezi et al.. Reg Anesth Pain Med 2012; 37:166]. Such strategy shall be\n      tested in a subpopulation of patients at risk for respiratory complication."
