  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In many low-income countries, the use of ultrasound by medical officers and non-physician
      health care staff (e.g., midwives) for antenatal identification of high risk pregnancies is
      a new intervention requiring authoritative investigation. The primary hypothesis to be
      assessed in this study is that antenatal ultrasound screenings performed by medical officers
      and non-physician health care staff will significantly reduce a composite outcome consisting
      of maternal mortality and maternal near miss, stillbirth and neonatal mortality in
      low-resource settings. Underpinning this hypothesis are two assumptions. The first
      assumption is that antenatal detection of complicated pregnancies will lead to appropriate
      referral at the right time for complicated pregnancies to comprehensive emergency obstetric
      and neonatal care (EmONC) facilities. The second assumption is that ultrasound's
      introduction will increase antenatal attendance leading to greater rates of institutional
      delivery. To assess these underlying assumptions beyond the composite end point, this study
      will investigate the health system impact of compact ultrasound. Secondary outcomes include
      antenatal attendance rates, institutional delivery rates at basic EmONC facilities, referral
      rates to comprehensive EmONC facilities, cesarean section rates (both planned and emergent)
      and an assessment of medical officers and non-physician health care provider ultrasound
      competence and training quality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of ultrasound by physician and non-physician health care staff for antenatal
      identification of complicated pregnancies is a potentially effective intervention; however,
      authoritative investigation in many low-resource settings is needed to establish its
      potential impact. The investigators propose to undertake a multi-country, cluster randomized
      trial to assess the impact of antenatal ultrasound screening performed by community
      physician and non-physician health care staff on a composite outcome consisting of maternal
      mortality and near miss maternal mortality, stillbirth and neonatal mortality in
      low-resource settings. Underpinning this objective are several assumptions. The first
      assumption is that ultrasound's introduction will increase antenatal attendance and improved
      outcomes due to the antenatal care alone, and greater rates of institutional delivery. The
      second assumption is that ultrasound use will lead to antenatal detection of complicated
      pregnancies and timely and appropriate referral for complicated pregnancies to comprehensive
      emergency obstetric and neonatal care (EmONC) facilities. Increases in antenatal care
      utilization and referral will result in a decrease in a composite outcome including maternal
      mortality and near miss mortality, stillbirth and neonatal death. Secondary outcomes to be
      evaluated include antenatal attendance rates, institutional delivery rates at basic EmONC
      facilities, referral rates to comprehensive EmONC facilities, cesarean section rates (both
      planned and emergent), an assessment of community physician and non-physician health care
      provider ultrasound training and competence and the cost-effectiveness of ultrasound in
      community health facilities. The investigators will also determine causes for non-compliance
      with recommendations for referral.

      In summary, this trial will evaluate whether training antenatal health care providers to
      perform basic obstetric ultrasonography, and using these trainees to provide routine
      ultrasounds in primary care clinics and to refer appropriately will improve pregnancy
      outcomes in low-resource settings.

      To assess the impact of ultrasound, the investigators propose to utilize an existing
      research infrastructure, the Global Network for Women's and Children's Health Research
      (Global Network), which currently includes 7 sites in 6 countries, India (2), Pakistan,
      Kenya, Zambia, DRC and Guatemala. The investigators of the Global Network have an ongoing
      maternal and newborn health registry to document all pregnancies and their outcomes to 6
      weeks post-delivery in more than 100 communities. Thus, population-based rates of maternal
      mortality and morbidity, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality and morbidity, as well as health
      care utilization, are being obtained. A sub-set of these clusters will be utilized for the
      ultrasound trial.

      RTI International serves as the data coordinating center for the Global Network to help
      facilitate the design and conduct of the trial, manage the trial related data, and provide
      statistical analyses of the trial results. GE Healthcare will provide the ultrasound
      equipment, and will also fund the University of Washington to provide training and technical
      support on the implementation of ultrasound in community settings. Together, the Global
      Network with the support of the University of Washington and GE Healthcare will maximize the
      resources necessary to conduct a definitive trial on the potential impact of ultrasound to
      reduce maternal and newborn mortality and maternal morbidity in low-resource settings.
