The platelets will be from leftovers of\n      samples send to platelets functionality test and found to be normal (the platelets samples\n      will be taken without any identification and be marked only with lab number). The\n      measurement will be done by flow cytometer. Sample will be consider as positive when the\n      signal will be greater than 2 fold of control samples standard deviation. In addition, the\n      presence of antibodies in different times from the birth will be checked in breastfeeding\n      milk and sera of ITP patients. If the milk proteins and lipids will disturb the exam, the\n      immunoglobulins from the milk will be isolated using Ig isolation kit from plasma."
