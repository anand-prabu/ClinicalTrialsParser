  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at which, if any, active stretching procedure is most effective at
      correcting posterior shoulder tightness (PST) in the post-operative population.  Posterior
      shoulder tightness can influence shoulder mobility and function within both a symptomatic
      and an asymptomatic population.  There are previous studies that have examined the
      effectiveness of different active stretching procedures and their ability to correct PST but
      only in the asymptomatic population.  As clinicians it will be helpful to investigate their
      effect within a symptomatic population in order to prescribe appropriate and effective
      stretches within an individual's home exercise program.  The study design is a double
      blinded randomized control trial.  During evaluation a passive measurement of PST and
      internal rotation will be performed.  Another therapist, blinded to the measurements, will
      randomly select which subgroup the individual will be placed in for the first three
      individuals and this sequence will be followed for the remainder of the participants.  At
      this time the therapist will instruct the individual on the corresponding exercise which
      they will perform in front of that therapist.  The individual will perform this exercise one
      more time that day and twice the following day and once again upon follow up prior to having
      internal rotation and PST measured once again. At this point this will be the conclusion of
      that individuals involvement in the study.

      Null Hypothesis1: Stretches are no more effective than no treatment for reducing PST acutely
      in the post-operative shoulder population.

      Hypothesis1: Stretches are more effective than no treatment for reducing PST acutely in the
      post-operative population.

      Null Hypothesis2: There is no significant difference in the reduction of PST between the
      horizontal adduction stretch and the modified sleeper stretch acutely in the post-operative
      shoulder population.

      Hypothesis2:  There is a significant difference in the reduction of PST between the
      horizontal adduction stretch and the modified sleeper stretch acutely in the post-operative
      shoulder population.

    <description>During the initial evaluation and first follow up, PST of the operative shoulder will be measured in sidelying using an inclinometer that is attached to the mid-humerus of the patient's involved upper extremity using a Velcro strap.  An inclinometer is a small device that is used to measure degrees of motion.</description>

    <description>Horizontal Adduction Stretch- Individual standing with their operative scapula against a wall and rotating toward the side to be stretched to stabilize scapula and the operative arm is relaxed.  The opposite hand is placed under the elbow of the involved extremity and assists the operative shoulder into horizontal adduction attempting to bring the hand to the opposite shoulder.
Pendulum -Individual leans over with support from uninvolved extremity placed on an immovable object while involved extremity is relaxed.  The individual than rotates their hips in order to allow the involved extremity to create small circles passively in a clockwise direction.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Modified Sleeper Stretch: Individual in supine with operative shoulder abducted to approximately 45 degrees and elbow at 90 degrees of flexion with neutral rotation of the glenohumeral joint.  The individual then places other hand on the wrist of the involved extremity and passively moves the glenohumeral joint into internal rotation.
Pendulum Exercise: Individual leans over with support from uninvolved extremity placed on an immovable object while involved extremity is relaxed.  The individual than rotates their hips in order to allow the involved extremity to create small circles passively in a clockwise direction.</description>
