Fecal Transplant (FMT), or Intestinal\n      Microbiota Transplantation, (IMT) has been shown to be efficacious when administered after\n      treatment for C. difficile. This study will involve taking biopsies from patients during\n      their FMT/IMT via colonoscopy, and determine if there are differences in the mucosal flora\n      as compared to the stool flora. The investigators hope to discover the critical parts of a\n      healthy microbiota."
