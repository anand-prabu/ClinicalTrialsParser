  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research is to test the efficacy of a patient-controlled
      cognitive-behavioral intervention for pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance during cancer
      treatment, and to evaluate moderators and mediators of intervention effects. The
      intervention uses guided imagery, relaxation exercises, and nature sound recordings,
      self-administered via an MP3 player.  The study will determine (1) if the intervention helps
      to control symptoms during chemotherapy, (2) if personal and clinical characteristics
      influence how well the intervention works, and (3) if the cognitive-behavioral strategies
      reduce markers of stress and inflammation found in blood and saliva.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Co-occuring pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance is a common symptom cluster among patients
      with advanced cancer, diminishing functional status and quality of life.
      Cognitive-behavioral (CB) strategies (e.g., relaxation, distraction, and imagery) are
      effective treatments for each of these symptoms, and provide a logical choice in managing
      all three co-occurring symptoms. CB strategies are thought to work psychologically by
      reducing anxiety and stress, improving expectations for symptom outcomes, and enhancing
      perceptions of personal control. Recent research also suggests a physiologic pathway, in
      which CB strategies attenuate dysregulation in stress hormones and reduce proinflammatory
      cytokines that contribute to symptom exacerbation. CB strategies are not equally effective
      for all patients, with differences based on individual preferences and skills and concurrent
      symptoms. Thus, training in a single strategy is not sufficient. Our previous work
      demonstrates feasibility and initial efficacy of a patient-controlled cognitive-behavioral
      (PC-CB) intervention in which patients receive information about their symptoms and
      rationale for CB strategies, then self-administer their selection of various relaxation,
      distraction, and imagery strategies via MP3 player, using the CB strategies at whatever time
      and place they are needed. This brief intervention was designed to be mindful of the high
      symptom burden, unpredictable treatment course, and often short life expectancy of persons
      with advanced cancer. The purpose of this study is to test efficacy of the PC-CB
      intervention in a randomized controlled trial and to test moderators and mediators of
      intervention effects. The specific aims are (1) to test efficacy of the PC-CB intervention
      on severity, distress, and interference with daily life from the pain, fatigue, sleep
      disturbance symptom cluster, (2) to test proposed moderators (imaging ability, concurrent
      symptoms) of PC-CB intervention effects, (3) to test psychological mediators (anxiety,
      stress, outcome expectancy, perceived control) of PC-CB intervention effects, and (4) to
      explore two types of physiological mediators (neuroendocrine stress hormones and indices of
      inflammation) of PC-CB intervention effects. A sample of 160 adults receiving chemotherapy
      for advanced breast, lung, colorectal, prostate or gynecologic cancers and experiencing
      pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance will be recruited.  Patients randomized to the PC-CB
      intervention will receive a brief training session and instructions to use the recorded CB
      strategies during 9-weeks of cancer treatment.  Patients randomized to attention control
      will receive instructions to use cancer educational recordings over the same period.
      Measures of symptom severity and distress, symptom interference with daily life, and
      proposed psychological and physiologic mediating variables will be completed at baseline and
      the 3-week (primary) time point. Symptom outcome measures will be repeated at 6- and 9-week
      (secondary) time points to evaluate longer term treatment effects.

    <description>Standard care + cancer education
Participants receive a single session with a research nurse to discuss the importance of understanding cancer and cancer treatment strategies, and to introduce educational recordings available on an MP3 player. The educational recordings provide a selection of publicly available American Cancer Society patient information materials addressing topics related to cancer and cancer treatment strategies. Participants are asked to listen to at least one recording per day, or more frequently as desired.</description>

Participants will receive a single training session with a research nurse including: 1) Information about the causes of cancer-related pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. 2) An explanation of how cognitive-behavioral interventions may affect symptoms. 3) Review of the specific cognitive-behavioral strategies provided on the MP3 player. 4) Individualized recommendations for using the cognitive-behavioral strategies. The nurse interventionist and patient will develop a written plan for practicing the strategies with recommendations to use a strategy at least once a day, or more frequently as needed.</description>

             proinflammatory cytokines at each of the two measurement points.

          -  Report all three symptoms (pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance) as present in the
             past week with worst severity rating ≥ 3 (0-10 scale) for at least two of the three
             symptoms  -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pain that is post-operative (&lt; 3 months since surgery) or neuropathic in origin.

          -  Hospitalized for psychiatric reasons within the past 3 months.

          -  Unable to read, write, or understand English, or otherwise unable to complete study
