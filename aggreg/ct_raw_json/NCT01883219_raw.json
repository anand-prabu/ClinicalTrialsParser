            "textblock": "Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) is a reciprocal chromosomal translocation t(9;22\uff09(q34;q11),\n      which leads to the formation of the BCR/ABL oncogene. Ph is the most frequent cytogenetic\n      abnormality in ALL characterized by poor outcome. With the BCR/ABL protein TKI, imatinib, in\n      the combination chemotherapy regimes for newly  diagnosed Ph+ ALL, more than 95% of patients\n      can achieve complete remission(CR)1. Several studies have shown decreased relapse rates and\n      improved disease-free survival for patients with imatinib-based treatment prior to\n      allo-HSCT. However, the efficacy of maintenance therapy with imatinib after transplant for\n      Ph+ ALL patients is still uncertain. In addition, acquired resistance to imatinib is\n      frequently caused by point mutations in BCR/ABL that inactivate imatinib.\n\n      Detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) after transplant is associated with an increased\n      risk of relapse. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a sensitive\n      method for detecting low-level BCR/ABL transcripts to assess MRD in Ph+ ALL. It has been\n      corroborated by several reports that detection of MRD after SCT was predictive of imminent\n      relapse.\n\n      In this study, we will evaluate the safety and efficacy of TKI therapy,  when initiating\n      treatment based on BCR-ABL transcript levels after allo-HSCT."
