  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the treatment of patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
      (COPD) stage III and IV who will self administer the AlphaCore stimulation three times a day
      over a course of 2 months.  Patients will either receive an active AlphaCore device or a
      Sham device during these two months while not knowing which device they have been provided.
      At the end of the two months, all patients will be asked to continue in the study for
      another 2 months to self administer with the active AlphaCore device.  Subjects will
      complete diaries at home on their breathing and quality of life and will return to the
      clinic monthly for assessment by the investigator.

      PERFORMANCE AND SAFETY VARIABLES:

      The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is the total Chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD) Assessment Test (CAT) score change from baseline to the 8 week follow-up
      period comparing the two device groups.

      Secondary efficacy endpoints will be the mean difference from baseline to the 8 week
      follow-up for the following assessments: Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea scale, 6
      minutes walking test and Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1)

      Safety Variables:

      Each subject will be assessed throughout the study for Adverse Events and at the last visit
      (4 months) subjects will undergo another physical examination including vital signs and
      blood pressure.
