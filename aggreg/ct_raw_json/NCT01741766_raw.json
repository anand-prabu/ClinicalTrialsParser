            "textblock": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Hypertension and abdominal\n      obesity are associated with dysfunction of the main mechanisms of cardiovascular regulation,\n      the autonomic nervous system and the vascular endothelium. Increased sympathetic activity\n      and endothelial dysfunction are associated with increased arterial stiffness, which is an\n      independent risk factor for the development of hypertension and other cardiovascular\n      diseases. The recommended intervention for controlling BP in pre- and stage 1- hypertensive\n      individuals is lifestyle modifications such as exercise, and not drug therapy.Although\n      aerobic and resistance exercise has been shown to be beneficial for the cardiovascular\n      system, special populations such as the elderly and obese may have physical and/or\n      musculoskeletal limitations which may limit their participation in these exercise\n      modalities.\n\n      Stretching is a form of exercise that is widely recommended for injury prevention. Among the\n      benefits of stretching are an increased flexibility, enhanced muscular coordination, stress\n      relief, improved range of motion and an improved posture. Previous studies have shown\n      stretching training to increase arterial compliance and acutely increase sympathetic nerve\n      activity. In addition, low flexibility levels have been found to be associated with arterial\n      stiffness. Given that stretching of skeletal muscle causes an increase in sympathetic nerve\n      activity; repetitive stimulation of sympathetic activity induced by habitual stretching,\n      might chronically reduce resting sympathetic activity. The reduction in sympathetic activity\n      might result in a decrease of arterial stiffness and blood pressure.\n\n      The investigators hypothesis is that 8 weeks of stretching training would reduce arterial\n      stiffness, blood pressure and sympathetic activity in obese women. The investigators also\n      hypothesize that the improved arterial function with stretching would be associated with\n      increases in flexibility levels."
