  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomised controlled trial aims to compare the effectiveness of hand reflexology
      received during office based vein surgery, under local anaesthetic on patient's reports of
      pain and anxiety, compared to usual standard care.

    <textblock>
      The negative effects of anxiety and pain on surgical recovery are well documented. It is
      also accepted that distraction can be effective in pain reduction. This randomised
      controlled trial will explore the effect of intra operative hand reflexology on pain
      perception and anxiety during office-based surgery under local anaesthetic.  Participants
      will be randomly allocated to either the experimental condition, in which they will receive
      a hand reflexology during treatment, or control condition in which they will receive usual
      standard care. Immediate and longer term outcomes will be explored.

      Eight weeks after surgery, participants will return to the clinic for a follow up
      appointment. While they are in the waiting area they will be asked to complete a short
      questionnaire to assess time taken to return to pre surgical levels of functioning, pain
      experienced in the first four weeks after surgery,  severity of venous symptoms and
      satisfaction with treatment.
