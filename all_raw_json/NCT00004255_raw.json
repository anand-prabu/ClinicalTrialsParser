Patients are stratified\n      according to degree of HLA matching and disease (chronic vs acute). Acute myelogenous\n      leukemia patients are further stratified according to prior myelodysplastic syndromes (yes\n      vs no). Patients are randomized to one of two bone marrow transplantation arms.\n\n      All patients receive a conditioning regimen comprising fludarabine IV on day -6,\n      cyclophosphamide IV on days -5 and -4, anti-thymocyte globulin IV on days -4 and -2, and\n      total body irradiation on days -3 to 0. Patients also receive methylprednisolone IV every 12\n      hours for 4 doses on days -2 to 0. Tacrolimus IV is administered continuously on day -1 and\n      continues either orally or IV for 6 months. Bone marrow is infused on day 0. Filgrastim\n      (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously from day 0 until blood counts recover.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive allogeneic bone marrow that has been processed to produce a\n           mononuclear cell preparation.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive unprocessed allogeneic bone marrow. Patients are followed\n           weekly for 100 days and then at 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 260 patients will be accrued for this study within 17 months."
