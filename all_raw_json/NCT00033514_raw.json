Biological\n      therapies such as erlotinib may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth\n      of the tumor. Combining trastuzumab with erlotinib may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining trastuzumab with erlotinib\n      as first-line therapy in treating women who have metastatic breast cancer associated with\n      HER2/neu overexpression."

(Phase I closed to accrual as of\n           01/2004)\n\n        -  Determine the safety profile of this regimen in these patients.\n\n        -  Determine the rate and duration of objective response in patients treated with this\n           regimen.\n\n        -  Determine the pharmacologic behavior of this regimen in these patients.\n\n        -  Determine time to disease progression and duration of survival in patients treated with\n           this regimen.\n\n        -  Correlate the antitumor activity of this regimen with epidermal growth factor receptor\n           expression in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of erlotinib. (Phase I closed to accrual as of\n      01/2004).\n\n      Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily beginning on day 2 and trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV\n      over 30-90 minutes (1-4 hours after erlotinib) once weekly beginning on day 1. Courses\n      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional\n      patients are treated at the recommended phase II dose.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-18 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion (closed\n      to accrual as of 01/2004) and 27-81 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of\n      this study."
