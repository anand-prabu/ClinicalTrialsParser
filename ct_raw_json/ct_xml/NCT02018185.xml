  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a preliminary pilot study, the investigators tested the efficacy of rTMS over the medial
      prefrontal cortex in symptom profiles of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) patients. This
      study revealed considerable benefit in using rTMS for the treatment of OCD.

      In the current proposal, in a randomized clinical trial, the investigators aim to further
      evaluate the efficacy of rTMS in OCD in a larger sample size and for a longer period.
      Studies into the efficacy of rTMS in other psychiatric disorders such as depression have
      consistently shown that extension of the treatment to four weeks significantly increased the
      effect size. In the pilot study, the investigators applied rTMS for only two weeks. Although
      all patients consistently showed improvement in their symptoms, none of them showed complete
      remission of their OCD. Here, the investigators hypothesize that longer duration of rTMS
      treatment will have greater benefit in OCD symptom reduction.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of study is to examine the efficacy of rTMS over the medial prefrontal cortex in
      the treatment of OCD.

      rTMS will be provided to OCD patients in a randomized double blind controlled setting, and
      the investigators hypothesize that in this setting the treatment group would still show
      significant improvement in OCD symptoms as compared to the sham group.

      rTMS will be applied for four weeks on OCD patients and the investigators will assess
      improvement after four weeks of rTMS. The investigators hypothesize that patients will show
      significantly greater improvement after four weeks of rTMS vs. two weeks of rTMS.
