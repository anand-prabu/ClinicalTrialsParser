The genotyping of\n      patients will be performed to compare the genetic factors and the pharmacological effects.\n\n      Expected Results: How to select a anti-diabetic drug tailored to the individual becomes more\n      and more important because the enormously increasing classes of treatment modality. This\n      study could be of great help in recommending the best possible agent for an individual,\n      improving the possibility of treatment success, and justifying if the need of expensive\n      drugs in a given patient."
