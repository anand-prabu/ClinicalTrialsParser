Histologic documentation of\n             the original primary tumor is required via the pathology report.\n\n          -  All patients must have measurable disease. Measurable disease is defined as at least\n             one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest\n             dimension to be recorded). Each lesion must be >20mm when measured by conventional\n             techniques including CT, and MRI, or >10 mm when measured by spiral CT.\n\n          -  Patients must have at least one \"target lesion\" to be used to assess response as\n             defined by RECIST.  Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as\n             \"non-target\" lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to\n             confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy.\n\n          -  Patients must have had one prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen for\n             management of primary disease containing carboplatin, cisplatin, or another\n             organoplatinum compound.  This initial treatment may have included intraperitoneal\n             therapy, high-dose therapy, consolidation, non-cytotoxic agents or extended therapy\n             administered after surgical or non-surgical assessment.\n\n          -  Patients are required to receive at least one additional cytotoxic regimen for\n             management of recurrent or persistent disease.  Patients are allowed to receive, but\n             are not required to receive, biologic (non-cytotoxic) therapy either alone or as part\n             of the cytotoxic regimens for management of recurrent or persistent disease.\n\n          -  Age >18 years.  Women all races and ethnic groups will be included.\n\n          -  Patients with an ECOG performance status < 2.

Continuation of hormone\n             replacement therapy is permitted. Continuation of other established medical\n             treatments for a known medical condition is permitted.\n\n          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic\n             composition to Abraxane or Bevacizumab.\n\n          -  Patients who have had prior therapy with Abraxane.\n\n          -  Patients who have received radiation to more than 25% of marrow-bearing areas.

Prior radiation for\n             localized cancer of the breast, head and neck, or skin is permitted, provided that it\n             was completed more than five years prior to registration, and the patient remains\n             free of recurrent or metastatic disease.\n\n          -  Patients who have known active liver disease or hepatitis.\n\n          -  Patients with active bleeding or pathologic conditions that carry high risk of\n             bleeding, such as known bleeding disorder, coagulopathy, or tumor involving major\n             vessels.\n\n          -  Patients with history or evidence upon physical examination of CNS disease, including\n             primary brain tumor, seizures not controlled with standard medical therapy, any brain\n             metastases, or history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA, stroke), transient ischemic\n             attack (TIA) or subarachnoid hemorrhage within 6 months of the first date of\n             treatment on this study.\n\n          -  Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease, including:\n\n        uncontrolled hypertension, myocardial infarction, unstable angina within 6 months of\n        enrollment, NYHA Grade II or greater heart failure, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring\n        medication, grade II or greater peripheral vascular disease.\n\n          -  Patients with clinically significant proteinuria.  Patients with a urine protein of\n             1+ on dipstick should undergo a 24-hour urine collection, which must demonstrate <\n             100 mg protein/24 hr to allow participation in the study.\n\n          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or other\n             recombinant human or humanized antibodies.\n\n          -  Patients who have a major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic\n             injury within 28 days prior to enrollment on the study, or anticipation of need for\n             major surgical procedure during the course of the study.\n\n          -  Patients who have received commercial bevacizumab within 28 days prior to enrollment\n             on the study.\n\n          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active\n             infection(with the exception of uncomplicated UTI), chronic non- healing wound, bone\n             fracture, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with\n             study requirements.\n\n          -  Pregnant or lactating women are excluded from this study because of possible risk to\n             the fetus or infant.\n\n          -  Known HIV-positive patients are excluded from the study because of possible risk of\n             lethal infection when treated with marrow suppressive therapy.\n\n          -  Safety data regarding Abraxane use in patients with ascites is not available;\n             therefore patients with symptomatic ascites will be excluded from participation in\n             the study.  Patients may have asymptomatic ascites."
