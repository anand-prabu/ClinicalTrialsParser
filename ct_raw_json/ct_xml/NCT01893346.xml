      To assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of a single dose of CAZ-AVI in
      children from 3 months of age to &lt;18 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, single-dose study. The study aims to characterize the
      pharmacokinetics of CAZ-AVI and assess its safety and tolerability following a single IV
      dose given to hospitalized pediatric patients receiving systemic antibiotic therapy for
      suspected or confirmed infection. This study will include 4 cohorts, each consisting of at
      least 8 evaluable pediatric patients, aged ≥3 months to &lt;18 years, who are hospitalized with
      infections.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent will be obtained from parent(s) or other legally acceptable

          3. Hospitalized, receiving systemic antibiotic therapy for the treatment of a suspected
             or confirmed infection, and expected to require hospitalization until after the end
             of treatment (EOT) evaluations are completed.

          4. If female and has reached menarche, or has reached Tanner stage 3 breast development
             (even if not having reached menarche), the patient is practicing appropriate birth
             control or is sexually abstinent.

          5. Likely to survive the current illness or hospitalization.

          6. Sufficient intravascular access (peripheral or central) to receive study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of hypersensitivity reactions to carbapenems, cephalosporins, penicillin,
             other β-lactam antibiotics.

          2. If female, currently pregnant or breast feeding or has a positive serum β-human
             chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) pregnancy test.

          3. Receipt of a blood or blood component (e.g., red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma,
             platelets) transfusion during the 24-hour period before enrolment.

          4. BMI outside the range (below the 5th percentile or above the 85th percentile) for
             height, age, and weight except for children &lt;2 years of age.

          5. Babies born prior to 37 weeks gestation (cohort 4 only).
