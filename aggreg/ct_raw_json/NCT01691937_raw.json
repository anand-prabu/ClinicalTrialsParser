            "textblock": "Patients often experience moderate to severe postoperative pain, especially during the first\n      hours after hepatectomy. Systemic opioids given with patient-controlled analgesia has be\n      used after hepatectomy in many medical center(Aubrun, Monsel et al. 2001; Aubrun, Salvi et\n      al. 2005), but the analgesic effect can be limited and undesirable side effects may occur.\n\n      A case report described that right thoracic paravertebral block reduced pain and analgesic\n      requirements after right lobe hepatectomy(Ho, Karmakar et al. 2004). Compared with epidural\n      analgesia, thoracic paravertebral block probably carries a much lower risk of spinal\n      haematoma in the presence of moderate haemostatic deficiencies (Richardson and Lonnqvist\n      1998; Karmakar 2001).\n\n      We therefore designed a prospective, randomized, subject and assessor blinded,\n      parallel-group, placebo controlled study to test the hypothesis that continuous right\n      thoracic paravertebral analgesia decreases opioid consumption during the first 24 h after\n      right lobe hepatectomy in patients receiving i.v. patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with\n      sufentanil."
