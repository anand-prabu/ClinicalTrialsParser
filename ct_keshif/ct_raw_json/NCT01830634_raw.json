They are retrieved from the \"Adult Health\n      Examination\" and allocated into intervention group and control group. All the fallers have\n      at least one risk factor of accidental falls and no indication for exclusion criteria.\n      Health professionals assess the risk factors of falls and provide medical educations and\n      suggestions to all subjects concerning modification of environmental hazards, dizziness,\n      multiple drugs use, and general transfer skill, etc. Physical therapists instruct the\n      elderly of intervention group to do lower-limb strength and flexibility program by the aid\n      of Theraband. There are three times of variables measurement at baseline, 6 months and 12\n      months after examination. Differences in baseline characteristics between groups are tested\n      by independent samples t test, Mann Whitney U test, or Chi-square test. To compare the\n      outcomes in different groups, the investigators evaluate balance and mobility with multiple\n      linear regression, accidental falls or not with logistic regression, and all-related\n      injuries with Cox's proportional hazard model."
