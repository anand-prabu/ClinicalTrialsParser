  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if co-administration of subcutaneous (SQ)Insulin glargine in combination with
      intravenous (IV) insulin decreases the time to resolution of ketoacidosis and requirement
      for ICU admission compared to IV insulin with delayed administration of SQ glargine for the
      treatment of DKA.

    <description>Anion Gap is a measure of acidosis that results from decompensated Diabetes Mellitus. Acidosis is the result of the body being unable to utilize glucose for energy production and instead uses fatty acid metabolism resulting in ketone formation. Anion Gap is a surrogate measure for the level of ketones resulting in the excess acid production.</description>

    <time_frame>Participants will followed for the duration of the Emergency Department stay, an expected average of 12 hours</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The goal was to determine if we could reduce the amount of patients admitted to the ICU by providing more efficient resolution of the critical condition which is the acidosis.</description>

    <description>Determine the amount of time patient is admitted to the intensive care unit with the goal of assessing if more efficient correction of the acidosis results in decreased time in the intensive care unit for the patients.</description>

    <time_frame>Participants will followed for the duration of the hospital stay, an expected average of 7 days</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Hospital length of stay was determined to assess whether a more efficient correction of the acidosis will result in decreased time that the patient is admitted to the hospital.</description>

    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>To determine whether it is safe to administer both IV and subcutaneous insulin, it is important to assure that patient's glucose does not drop to critically low level and lead to adverse events.</description>
