            "textblock": "Background: Osteoporosis is defined as an absolute decrease in the amount of bone (volume\n      and/or density).  Chronic liver disease is associated with osteoporosis in both adults and\n      children.  Bone density is also decreased in the months immediately after liver\n      transplantation, but improves to pretransplant values after 1 to 2 years.  Immunosuppressive\n      agents, most notably steroids, are a cause of osteoporosis.  However, studies on adults have\n      shown that bone densities afer transplantation continue to improve within the normal range\n      for healthy adults.  In the case of children, bone accretion is necessary for growth.\n      Chronic liver disease and transplantation in childhood will have an adverse effect on bone\n      metabolism and the outcome in terms of bone density after the growth period cannot be\n      predicted on individuals transplanted as adults or other transplant groups."
