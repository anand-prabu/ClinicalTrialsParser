  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be selected from the Dialisys Centers in Iasi, Romania and will be randomized
      to a lung-US guided treatment policy or to standard clinical care. In patients randomized to
      the active arm of the study, LW-US will be performed before and after dialysis session and
      their results used to titrate dialysis and drug treatment. Patients in this arm with
      moderate to severe lung congestion (&gt;15 lung comets pre-dialysis) LW measurements will be
      repeated once a month until the treatment goal is achieved. The same (monthly) monitoring
      frequency will be adopted also in patients without pulmonary congestion at pre-dialysis
      baseline (&lt;15 comets). Furthermore the use of the technique will be allowed whenever its
      application is deemed useful to assume clinical decisions by attending physicians. Patients
      in the active arm of the study without evidence of lung congestion at baseline who will
      develop pulmonary congestion (i.e. clinical signs and/or &gt;15 lung comets) during the trial
      will receive the same treatment contemplated for those with lung congestion at baseline. At
      the same time with the evaluation of lung water (monthly), the investigators will evaluate
      the hid ration status using the BCM MonitorÂ®. Of the two methods of evaluating hydration
      status (lung ultrasound and body impedance), only LW will be used to guide the clinical
      intervention (UF intensification or drug treatment).

      The treatment goal will be pursued by ultrafiltration intensification according to
      individual tolerance and feasibility. If the treatment goal will not be achieved within the
      first 3-4 months or intolerance to UF supervenes, adjustment of drug treatment will be
      considered including the introduction and/or dose adjustments of drugs of proven efficacy
      like carvedilol and ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II blockers, as recommended by a recent
      consensus document by KDIGO (KI 77, 273-284, 2010). Other cardiovascular and
      non-cardiovascular medications will be maintained unchanged or appropriately adapted in
      relationship to the individual needs.
