            "textblock": "Study Drug Administration:\n\n      The study drugs will be given in what are called cycles.  Each cycle is 28 days.\n\n      Induction:\n\n      The first cycle of study drugs is called Induction.  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you\n      will have up to 2 Induction cycles.  During Induction cycles, you will receive:\n\n        -  Clofarabine by vein over about 60 minutes on Days 1-4.  If the doctor thinks it is in\n           your best interest, you will only receive it on Days 1-3.\n\n        -  Idarubicin by vein over about 30-60 minutes on Days 1-3, about 1-2 hours after you\n           receive clofarabine.   If the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you will only\n           receive it on Days 1 and 2.\n\n        -  Cytarabine by vein over about 2 hours on Days 1-4, about 3-6 hours after you receive\n           clofarabine.\n\n        -  Vincristine by vein over about 15-30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15.\n\n        -  Dexamethasone by vein over about 10-30 minutes on Days 1-4 and 15-18. If you have a\n           certain type of leukemia and the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you will\n           also receive rituximab by vein over about 4-6 hours on Days 1 and 11.  The study staff\n           will tell you if you will receive rituximab.\n\n      If the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, your dose will be reduced after Induction.\n\n      Consolidation:\n\n      If the disease responds to the study drugs during Induction, you may receive up to 6 more\n      cycles of study drugs.  This is called Consolidation.  During Consolidation cycles, you will\n      receive:\n\n        -  Clofarabine by vein over about 60 minutes on Days 1-3.  If the doctor thinks it is in\n           your best interest, you will only receive it on Days 1-2.\n\n        -  Idarubicin by vein over about 30-60 minutes on Days 1-2, about 1-2 hours after you\n           receive clofarabine.\n\n        -  Cytarabine by vein over about 2 hours on Days 1-3, about 3-6 hours after you receive\n           clofarabine.  If the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you will only receive\n           it on Days 1 and 2.\n\n        -  Vincristine by vein over about 15-30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15.\n\n        -  Dexamethasone by vein over about 10-30 minutes on Days 1-4 and 15-18.\n\n        -  If you have a certain type of leukemia and the doctor thinks it is in your best\n           interest, you will also receive rituximab in Consolidation Cycles 1-3, by vein over\n           about 4-6 hours on Days 1 and 11.  The study staff will tell you if you will receive\n           rituximab.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      Before each cycle, you will have a physical exam.\n\n      Every 3-7 days, blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n      At the end of every cycle (+/- 7 days), you will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy\n      collected to check the status of the disease and for cytogenetic testing.\n\n      If the disease appears to get better, you will have these study visits less often.  Blood\n      will be drawn every 7-14 days, and you will only have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy when the\n      study doctor thinks it is needed.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You may continue receiving the study drugs for 1-2 induction cycles and then up to 6\n      consolidation cycles.  You will no longer be able to receive the study drugs if the disease\n      gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study\n      directions.\n\n      Your participation on the study will be over after you have completed the end-of-study\n      visit, unless you will have maintenance treatment as discussed by you and the study doctor.\n\n      End-of-Study Visit:\n\n      You will have an end-of-study visit about 30 days after you stop receiving the study drugs.\n      At this visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate and/or\n           biopsy.\n\n        -  If you can become pregnant, you will have a urine pregnancy test.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Clofarabine is FDA approved and commercially available to\n      treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children. Idarubicin and cytarabine are FDA\n      approved and commercially available to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  Rituximab is FDA\n      approved and commercially available to treat various types of lymphoma and leukemia.  The\n      use of these drugs in combination with vincristine and dexamethasone to treat mixed\n      phenotype acute leukemia is investigational.\n\n      The study doctor can explain how the drugs are designed to work.\n\n      Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this study.  All will take part at MD Anderson."
