To conduct a dose-escalation study to determine safety and compliance of varying\n      lyophilized black raspberry (LBR) delivery vehicles (a gummy confection and a nectar) at two\n      different doses.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To precisely quantify changes in the content and distribution of black raspberry\n      phytochemicals and their metabolites in the blood and urine and correlate these\n      concentrations with prostate tissue phytochemicals.\n\n      II. Measure the ability of black raspberry gummy confection and nectar in altering hormonal\n      patterns (lower insulin-like growth factor-1 [IGF-I], higher insulin-like growth\n      factor-binding protein 3 [IGF-BP3], lower androgens) consistent with reduced prostate\n      carcinogenesis and in parallel with an enhanced capacity to quench reactive oxygen.\n\n      III. Investigate histopathologic, immunologic, and molecular biomarkers associated with\n      prostate carcinogenesis that may serve as surrogate endpoint biomarkers and provide\n      information regarding their ability to be modulated by black raspberries.\n\n      IV. Determine if consumption of black raspberries alters molecular markers in the human\n      prostate including: (a) neuroendocrine markers such as IGF-I and IGF-BP3, (b) signal\n      transduction markers such as phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) and phospho-AKT, and\n      (c) angiogenesis regulators such as (vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF).\n\n      V. Collect and store plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from each patient\n      to assess systemic markers of inflammation and immune response.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lyophilized black raspberry gummy confection and\n      nectar. Patients are assigned to 1 of 7 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I: Patients follow a regular diet for 4-6 weeks and then undergo prostatectomy.\n\n      ARM II: Patients follow a low polyphenol diet for 4-6 weeks and then undergo prostatectomy.\n\n      ARM III: Patients follow a low ellagitannin diet for 4-6 weeks and then undergo\n      prostatectomy.\n\n      ARM IV: Patients follow a low ellagitannin diet and receive lower-dose black raspberry gummy\n      orally (PO) daily for 4-6 weeks and then undergo prostatectomy.\n\n      ARM V: Patients follow a low ellagitannin diet and receive higher-dose black raspberry gummy\n      PO daily for 4-6 weeks and then undergo prostatectomy.\n\n      ARM VI: Patients follow a low ellagitannin diet and receive lower-dose black raspberry\n      nectar PO daily for 4-6 weeks and then undergo prostatectomy.\n\n      ARM VII: Patients follow a low ellagitannin diet and receive higher-dose black raspberry\n      nectar PO daily for 4-6 weeks and then undergo prostatectomy."
