Clinical evidence indicates potent antagonists of 5-HT2A are more likely to cause\n      hypothermia. Risperidone is a potent 5-HT2A and a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist and is\n      proposed to have effect on reduciton of hot flashes through its dopaminergic and\n      serotonergic antagonism. The primary purpose of this study is to determine if RCN3028 is\n      effective and safe in the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated. In\n      accordance with the latest FDA guidance study participants will have a minimum of 7 moderate\n      to sever hot flashes per day, or 50 per week at baseline."
