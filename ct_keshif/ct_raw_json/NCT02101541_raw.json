Inc.), then processed and the activation patterns visualized (RhythmView\u00ae 3D\n      Electrophysiologic Mapping System, Topera, Inc.).\n\n      Focal impulse and rotor modulation (FIRM) will then be performed with standard irrigated\n      radio frequency catheter ablation until rotor or focal impulse elimination is confirmed by\n      repeat FIRM mapping.\n\n      Treatment efficacy will be assessed with continuous heart rhythm monitors (Reveal XT\u00ae,\n      Medtronic, Minneapolis, USA) implanted 3 months prior to ablation, and freedom from AF\n      defined as AF burden <1% at follow-up at 12, 24 and 30 months."
