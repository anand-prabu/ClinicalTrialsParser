MF has shown to posses bone forming and bone sparring actions. The present study\n      was designed to investigate effectiveness of MF, 1 % in an indigenously prepared\n      biodegradable controlled-release gel as, as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) in\n      treatment of chronic periodontitis subjects with intrabony defects.\n\n      Materials and Methods: Sixty five subjects were categorized into two treatment groups: SRP\n      plus 1% MF and SRP plus placebo. Clinical parameters were recorded at baseline and at 3 and\n      6 months; they included plaque index (PI), modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), probing\n      depth (PD), and clinical attachment level (CAL). At baseline and after 6 months, radiologic\n      assessment of intrabony defect (IBD) fill was done using computer-aided software."
