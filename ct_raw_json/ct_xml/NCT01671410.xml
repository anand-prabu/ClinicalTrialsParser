  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The opioid neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a condition of withdrawal symptoms after
      utero exposure to opioids. Sublingual buprenorphine shows promise as a new treatment in NAS.
       This trial will investigate the safety and tolerability of sublingual buprenorphine in
      infants exposed to both opioids and benzodiazepines in utero or with exposure of opioids in
      those who are breastfeeding.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infants with in utero exposure to opioids often require therapy with morphine for an
      extended period. In a clinical trial, sublingual buprenorphine reduced this treatment period
      by ~30%.  However, infants with both opioid and benzodiazepine exposure were not included in
      the trial.  This study will test the safety and tolerability of sublingual buprenorphine in
      infants with in utero exposure to benzodiazepines or who are breastfeeding.

          3. Demonstration of signs and symptoms of neonatal abstinence syndrome requiring
             treatment

          4. Exposure to benzodiazepines in utero and/or receiving breast milk.  Benzodiazepine
             use is defined as maternal use in the past 30 days, and/or receipt of benzodiazepines
             by prescription (as determined by self-report or intake urine) by the mother 30 days
             prior to birth.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Major congenital malformations and/or intrauterine growth retardation defined as
             birth weight &lt;2200 gm

          2. Medical illness requiring intensification of medical therapy.  This includes, but is
             not limited to suspected sepsis requiring antibiotic therapy.

          3. Hypoglycemia requiring treatment with intravenous dextrose

          4. Bilirubin &gt;20 mg/dL (The need for phototherapy is not exclusionary)

          5. Seizure activity or other neurologic abnormality
