Biopsy may also\n      miss significant pathology if the small biopsy specimen is taken from an uninvolved part of\n      the liver.  Non-invasive techniques such as MRI are now used to evaluate the liver iron\n      content.  MRI can visualize the whole liver and measure liver iron content.  MRI, however,\n      will not detect liver scarring.\n\n      Liver transient elastography (FibroScan) is a non-invasive tool for assessing liver fibrosis\n      or scarring by measuring liver stiffness (LSM).  Compared with liver biopsy, FibroScan\n      provides immediate results and is a painless, short (3 mins), simple procedure to perform.\n      In some studies FibroScan reports have correlated well with liver biopsy results of fibrosis\n      and cirrhosis, and with MRI T2*, ferritin and liver function tests.\n\n      This purpose of this study is to investigate the role of FibroScan in individuals with\n      sickle cell anemia and iron overload or who have a diagnosis of liver disease, and to\n      compare FibroScan readings with magnetic resonance imaging."

The ultrasound then detects the propagation of the shear wave through the liver (at a depth of 25 - 65 mm below the skin surface) by measuring its velocity.  The shear wave velocity is directly related to the tissue stiffness, with a higher velocity equating to higher tissue stiffness, corresponding to increasing severity of fibrosis.",
