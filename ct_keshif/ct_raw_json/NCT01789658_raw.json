            "textblock": "There is a complex pathobiology behind OM; chemo and radiotherapy affects the mucosa and\n      submucosa causing DNA-strand brakes and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This\n      initiates a cascade of events, among others activation of transcription factors,\n      up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and activation of macrophages and proteases\n      leading to tissue injury causing symptoms such as erythema, edema, ulceration, taste\n      perception alterations, and mouth dryness. OM often causes local and systemic infections,\n      fatigue, pain, and difficulties in basal functions such as swallowing (and hence drinking\n      and eating) and talking and reduces patients' psychological well-being. Nearly 90 % of\n      pediatric patients undergoing HSCT are afflicted with OM. In pediatric patients mucositis is\n      reported as one of the most painful and debilitating side effects during cancer\n      treatment.Beyond a significant suffering for the patient it is hence associated with higher\n      costs for health care and increased mortality.\n\n      The current scientific situation regarding prevention and treatment of OM  has been\n      summarized in Cochrane reports showing limited data on adults and practically missing data\n      on children and adolescents. Concluding guidelines from these reports emphasize the need for\n      well conducted randomized controlled trials (RCT's) to evaluate and refine treatments in\n      order to establish evidence based interventions.\n\n      The use of cryotherapy to prevent oral mucositis in patients who are receiving high-dose\n      chemotherapy as a conditioning agent prior to HSCT continue to show evidence in the adult\n      population.\n\n      The aim of this study is to compare treatment with cryotherapy (Arm 1)with a standard oral\n      care protocal (Arm 2)\n\n      ARM 1 Children are instructed to use chew on ice-chips, ingest ice-cream or ice-water during\n      infusion of chemotherapy as part of the conditioning treatment prior to HSCT. Melted ice\n      should be replaced by new as soon as possible. Children receiving a 24-hour infusion are\n      instructed to use cryotherapy for one hour 4 times a day.\n\n      ARM 2 Standard care for prevention and management of oral mucositis\n\n      Primary outcome\n\n        -  Degree and duration of Oral mucositis\n\n      Secondary outcomes\n\n        -  Oral pain\n\n        -  Opioid use\n\n        -  Duration of parenteral nutrition\n\n        -  Weight loss\n\n        -  Duration of neutropenic fever\n\n        -  Duration of antibiotic treatment\n\n        -  Duration of hospitalization\n\n        -  Emotional and psychological status\n\n        -  C reactive protein (CRP) and s-albumin correlation to grade of Oral Mucositis"
