    <textblock>
      This trial will assess the efficacy and safety of autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells,
      transduced ex-vivo with Lenti-D lentiviral vector, for the treatment of childhood cerebral
      adrenoleukodystrophy (CCALD). A subject's blood stem cells will be collected and modified
      using the Lenti-D lentiviral vector to add a functional copy of the human ABCD1 (ATP-binding
      cassette, sub-family D, member 1) complementary DNA (cDNA). After modification with the
      Lenti-D lentiviral vector, the cells will be transplanted back into the subject following
      myeloablative conditioning.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Informed consent is obtained from a competent custodial parent or guardian with legal
             capacity to execute a local Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics
             Committee (IEC) approved consent. (Informed assent will be sought from capable
             subjects, in accordance with the directive of the IRB/IEC and with local
             requirements).

          -  Boys aged 17 years and younger, at the time of parental/guardian consent and, where
             appropriate, subject assent.

          -  Active cerebral ALD as defined by: Elevated VLCFA levels, and active central nervous
             system (CNS) disease established by central radiographic review of brain MRI
             demonstrating:

             i. Loes score between 0.5 and 9 (inclusive) on the 34-point scale, and ii. Gadolinium
             enhancement of demyelinating lesions on MRI.

          -  NFS ≤ 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Receipt of an allogeneic transplant or gene therapy.

          -  Availability of a willing 10/10 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor.

          -  Use of statins, Lorenzo's Oil, or dietary regimens used to lower VLCFA levels. Note:
             subjects must discontinue use of these medications at time of consent.

          -  Receipt of an investigational study drug or procedure within 3 months before Day -60
             that might confound study outcomes.

             i. Peripheral blood absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1500 cells/mm^3 or, ii.
             Platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm^3 or, iii. Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL or, iv. Uncorrected
             bleeding disorder.

             Alanine transaminase (ALT) value &gt; 2.5 × ULN or, iii. Total bilirubin value &gt; 3.0
             mg/dL, except if there is a diagnosis of Gilbert's Syndrome and the subject is
             otherwise stable.

          -  Renal compromise as evidenced by abnormal renal function (creatinine clearance &lt; 50
             mL/min).

          -  Cardiac compromise as evidenced by left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 40%.

          -  Immediate family member with a known or suspected Familial Cancer Syndrome.

          -  Clinically significant active bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic infection.

          -  Positive for presence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 or 2 (HIV 1, HIV 2),
             hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human T lymphotrophic virus 1 (HTLV 1).

          -  Any clinically significant cardiovascular or pulmonary, or other disease or condition
             that would be contraindicated for any of the other study procedures.
