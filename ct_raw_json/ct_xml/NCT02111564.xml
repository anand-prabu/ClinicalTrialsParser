  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban compared
      with placebo in the prevention of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) events and
      VTE-related death post-hospital discharge in high-risk, medically ill patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither
      physician nor participant knows the identity of the assigned treatment), placebo (an
      inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real
      effect)-controlled, event-driven, multicenter study in patients who are hospitalized for a
      specific acute medical illness and have other risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE).
      The study is designed to evaluate rivaroxaban in the prevention of symptomatic VTE events
      and VTE-related deaths for a period of 45 days post-hospital discharge.

      The study will consist of a screening phase, a 45-day double-blind treatment phase, and a
      30-day follow-up phase. Study drug will start at randomization (Day 1), and will continue
      until Day 45 (inclusive). A total of approximately 8,000 patients will be randomly assigned
      to either rivaroxaban or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The total duration for a patient who
      completes the study after randomization is expected to be 75 days.
