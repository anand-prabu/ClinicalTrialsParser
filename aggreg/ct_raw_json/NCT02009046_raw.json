It also trains teachers\n           and school staff to distribute condoms to students as needed.\n\n      The evaluation design involves two levels of randomization: First, all schools are\n      randomized into one of two conditions: receiving all three SEI school wide components (peer,\n      parent, clinical services) or receiving only one of these three school wide components\n      (clinical services). Schools are randomized within matched pairs of demographically similar\n      schools. Second, within each school, classrooms are randomized into one of two conditions: a\n      basic 3-session sex education curriculum (control) or the 12-session SEI curriculum\n      (intervention). Thus, all participating 9th grade students will receive at least three\n      sexuality education curriculum sessions and access to on-site clinic services.\n\n      The primary research questions for the evaluation are:\n\n        1. Is the 12-session SEI gender-sensitive, rights-based sexuality education curriculum\n           more effective than a 3-session comparison curriculum in reducing risk of unwanted\n           pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among high school students?\n\n        2. Is the full comprehensive program (all four components as a package) more effective\n           than the two-component comparison condition (only the 3-session comparison curriculum\n           and the clinical services linkages) in reducing risk of teen pregnancies and STIs?\n\n      The first hypothesis is that the 12-session SEI gender-sensitive, rights-based curriculum is\n      more effective than the 3-session comparison curriculum in improving sexual health outcomes\n      (as defined in section 7) among program participants one year after participation in the\n      program. The second hypothesis is that the full SEI program (all four components as a\n      package) is more effective than the comparison condition (only the 3-session comparison\n      curriculum and the clinical services linkages) in improving sexual health outcomes one year\n      after participation.\n\n      In addition to addressing these questions using the designated primary and secondary\n      outcomes, this study will examine changes in the following short-term outcomes that measure\n      critical concepts being addressed by the curriculum and serve as the hypothesized mediators\n      in the SEI theory of change:\n\n        -  Attitudes about rights in sexual relationships\n\n        -  Communication about relationships, rights and sexuality with partners\n\n        -  Communication about relationships, rights and sexuality with parents/ guardians\n\n        -  Access to accurate information about sexuality and sexual health\n\n        -  Knowledge about sex, sexuality and sexual risk protection\n\n        -  Self-efficacy to assert sexual limits and manage risky situations\n\n        -  Intentions to protect self from sexual risk\n\n        -  Awareness of sexual and reproductive health services"
