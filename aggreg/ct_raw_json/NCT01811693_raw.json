The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the\n      feasibility, safety, and physiologic efficacy of field-initiated glyceryl trinitrate in\n      achieving modest reduction of blood pressure. Patients with acute stroke will be identified\n      in the field by paramedics who have received training in basic and advanced cardiac life\n      support, stroke recognition, and specific procedures relevant to the proposed study.\n      Physician-investigators will obtain informed consent for each subject for study entry after\n      cellular phone contact with paramedics. Paramedics will initiate antihypertensive treatment\n      by applying transdermal GTN patch in the first two dose-tiers, and administering a single\n      sublingual GTN metered spray followed by application of the transdermal system in the last\n      dose tier. The sites involved in the study will be emergency medical services rescue\n      ambulances and 8 receiving Stroke Center hospitals in Orange County, California, USA."

The study design is an open-label dose escalation study with three dose\n      tiers,.  It is anticipated that the trial will identify the most promising prehospital GTN\n      regimen to advance to a pivotal, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.\n\n      Primary Hypothesis: Prehospital glyceryl trinitrate treatment reduces severely hypertensive\n      blood pressure elevation by ED arrival.\n\n      The primary study endpoint to test this hypothesis will be the mean change in SBP from\n      pre-treatment to ED arrival.\n\n      Secondary Hypotheses:\n\n        1. Prehospital glyceryl trinitrate treatment reduces severely hypertensive blood pressure\n           elevation at early post-arrival timepoints and increases the proportion of patients\n           with target blood pressure at ED arrival and early post-arrival timepoints.\n\n           The secondary study endpoints analyzed to test these hypotheses will be: 1) mean change\n           in SBP from pre-treatment to 30 minutes after ED arrival and 60 minutes after ED\n           arrival; and 2) the proportion of patients with SBP < 180 mm Hg at ED arrival, 30, and\n           60 minutes after arrival.\n\n        2. Prehospital initiation of glyceryl trinitrate in the first 2 hours for severely\n           hypertensive patients with stroke is feasible and safe.\n\n      Safety of GTN in the first 2 hours for severely hypertensive stroke patients will be\n      assessed by analysis of serious adverse events, neurologic change, and mortality. We\n      hypothesize that initiation of  treatment of the patients in the field will be  associated\n      with a favorable side effect profile and without severe blood pressure lowering to les than\n      120 mm Hg systolic.\n\n      Successful completion of the study will demonstrate feasibility to recruit hypertensive\n      stroke participants and  initiate GTN therapy in the field by paramedics."
