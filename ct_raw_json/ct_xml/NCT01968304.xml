  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In cancerology, anemia is a frequently-found situation, with a prevalence ranging from 30%
      to 90%, according to the series, disease stages, primary tumor locations and age (Scotte,
      Launay-Vacher et al. 2012). Although very probably a major cause of anemia, iron deficiency
      (ID) has been seldom investigated in the field of cancer. Its prevalence and incidence have
      never been assessed in a prospective study. It is well-known that anemia in the cancer
      setting is a source of asthenia and deterioration of quality of life, and can even reduce
      the efficacy of anticancer treatments such as radiotherapy. Correcting anemia therefore
      constitutes a daily challenge. Before 2004-2005, a very large proportion of patients were
      treated with erythropoietin (EPO). However, prescriptions for EPO appear to have
      considerably declined since the warnings issued by various scientific societies and
      governments on account of the possible increase in death rates and a higher incidence of
      thromboembolic events, as reported in 8 studies published to date (NCCN 2012).
      Simultaneously, the transfusion rate augmented from 3.4% to 8.7% and the median hemoglobin
      level fell from 10.8 to 8.9 g/dL (Feinberg, Bruno et al. 2012). The use of injectable iron
      appears to have improved the correction of anemia by EPO, as reported in several concordant
      studies versus oral iron and placebo (Pedrazzoli, Rosti et al. 2009; Steensma, Sloan et al.
      2011). However, no monotherapy study has been conducted to evaluate the impact of injectable
      iron, alone without EPO, for the correction of ID (with or without anemia) in cancer
      treatment. Consequently, there exists a wide variety of practices, with an injectable iron
      prescription rate which, a priori, does not match the number of patients with iron
      deficiency. There exist other iron-based parameters to characterize ID but these are not yet
      used routinely during chemotherapy and need to be validated in the cancer field.

      These parameters include:

        -  An assay of reticulocyte hemoglobin content (rHC)

        -  An assay of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) Soluble transferrin receptors are
           mainly located on red blood line cells receiving iron delivered by transferrin.

      In this study, we propose to make a prospective assessment of the iron status of cancer
      patients beginning chemotherapy. The aim is to determine the proportion of patients who
      might benefit from injectable iron treatment. All ID will be covered prospectively over a
      2-year period.

      Predictable risks The study will involve no increased risk or additional discomfort. Blood
      samples used in the study will be taken at blood samplings scheduled by the hospital
      practice of the reference institution. Only small amounts of blood will be taken for this
      study and they will have no repercussion on the patient's general status.

      Evaluation of the expected results Improved knowledge of ID epidemiology in patients
      receiving chemotherapy would enable more effective targeting of potential patients
      specifically requiring management by injectable iron.

      Expected benefits

      Through the medium of this study :

        -  We hope to optimize ID screening, increase our knowledge of ID characteristics and
           enhance patient management.

        -  Management of anemia in the cancer setting could thus be modified, i.e. via injectable
           iron treatment involving no EPO, the dangers of which (increase in the number of
           thromboembolic events, and even its potentially negative impact on survival) are being
           more and more fully documented.

        -  Patients included in this study will benefit from the detection of ID, which otherwise
           would not have been discovered.
