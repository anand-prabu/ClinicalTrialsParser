The measurement of oral NO is a\n      non-invasive,easy to perform low cost procedure that is used frequently in the diagnosis and\n      management of asthma. The diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) requires conscious\n      sedation, an upper endoscopy with biopsy, and histologic evaluation of the biopsy specimen.\n      This is a costly and somewhat invasive procedure. If oral NO was elevated as a result of\n      activity of esophageal eosinophils in EoE, the measurement of oral NO may potentially be a\n      very convenient and useful test in the evaluation and treatment of EoE. We propose a pilot\n      study  to determine if oral NO levels are elevated in patients with eosinophilic\n      esophagitis."
