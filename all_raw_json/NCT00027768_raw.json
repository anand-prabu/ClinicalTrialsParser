Patients are stratified according to\n      participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Within 4-6 weeks after prior resection, patients receive adjuvant hepatic\n           intra-arterial iodine I 131 lipiodol once.\n\n        -  Arm II: After prior resection, patients undergo observation. Patients are followed\n           monthly for 1 year and then every 3 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 300 patients (150 per treatment arm) will be accrued for\n      this study."
