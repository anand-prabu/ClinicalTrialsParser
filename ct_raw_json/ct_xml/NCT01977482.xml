    <textblock>
      This study is intended to evaluate the dose-response relationship of GSK1278863 over the
      first 4 weeks of treatment and evaluate the safety and efficacy of GSK1278863 over 24 weeks
      to maintain hemoglobin (Hgb) level in hemodialysis-dependent (HDD) subjects with anemia
      associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are switched from a stable dose of
      recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO). The data generated will enable selection of the
      starting dose(s) and optimize dose adjustment regimen(s) for Phase 3 clinical trials.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  -  Subjects are eligible if they meet all of the inclusion criteria below:

          -  General criteria

          -  Age: &gt;=18 years of age.  (Week -4 verification only)

          -  Gender: Female and male subjects.  (Week -4 verification only)  Females: If of
             childbearing potential, must agree to use one of the approved contraception methods,
             from Screening until completion of the Follow-up Visit OR of non-childbearing
             potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation,
             hysterectomy, or oophorectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle
             stimulating hormone (FSH) 23.0-116.3 International units per liter (IU/L) and
             estradiol &lt;=10 picomole per liter (pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone
             replacement therapy (HRT) whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use
             one of the approved contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during
             the study. Otherwise they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
             post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2
             weeks must elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval
             depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their
             post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a
             contraceptive method;

          -  Q-T Interval Corrected for Heart Rate (QTc): Bazett's Correction of QT Interval
             (QTcB) &lt;470 millisecond (msec) or QTcB &lt;480 msec in subjects with bundle branch
             block. There is no QTc inclusion criterion for a subject with a predominantly paced
             rhythm.

          -  CKD-related criteria

          -  Dialysis frequency: On hemodialysis (HD) three to five times weekly for at least 4
             weeks prior to Week -4 Screening through Week 4. NOTE:  Combination methods including
             hemofiltration (HF) or ultrafiltration (UF) with HD are allowed. However, the type of
             dialysis (HD, hemodiafiltration (HDF) or UF) should not change during the study.

          -  Dialysis adequacy:  A single-pool dialyzer clearance multiplied by dialyzer time
             divided by volume of distribution of urea (Kt/Vurea) of &gt;=1.2 based on a historical
             value obtained within the prior month in order to ensure the adequacy of dialysis. If
             Kt/Vurea is not available, then an average of the last 2 values of urea reduction
             ratio (URR) of at least 65%. NOTE: Only needs confirming at Week -4.

          -  Hemoglobin: Baseline Hgb of 9.0-11.5 g/dL (may rescreen in a minimum of 2 weeks).

          -  Stable rhEPO dose: Using the same rhEPO (epoetins or their biosimilars, or
             darbepoetin) with total weekly doses varying by no more than 50% during the 4 weeks
             prior to Week -4. At Day 1 (randomization), confirm that total weekly doses varied by
             no more than 50% during the screening period.

          -  Iron replacement therapy: Subjects may be on stable maintenance oral or IV (&lt;=100
             mg/week) iron supplementation. If subjects are on oral or IV iron, then doses must be
             stable for the 4 weeks prior to Week -4, during the screening phase, and through the
             first 4 weeks after Randomization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects are not eligible if they meet any of the exclusion criteria below:

          -  CKD-related criteria

             time period.

          -  Renal transplant:  Pre-emptive or scheduled renal transplant.

          -  Drugs and supplements: Use of any prescription or non-prescription drugs or dietary
             supplements that are prohibited from Week -4 Screening until the Follow-up Visit.

          -  Prior investigational product exposure: The Subject has participated in a clinical
             trial and has received an experimental investigational product within the prior 30
             days from Week -4 Screening through Day 1 (randomization).

          -  General health-related criteria

          -  Other Conditions: Any other condition, clinical or laboratory abnormality, or

             chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test OR women who are lactating at Week -4 Screening or
             during the trial.

          -  Other Eligibility Criteria Considerations

          -  Laboratory eligibility criteria will be assessed according to the central laboratory
             results for the screening samples.

          -  Subjects who fail screening may be rescreened as soon as the investigator feels they
             may have become eligible. However, an individual subject may not rescreen more than
