Settings and Design: Twenty-four students\n      aged 17 to 28 years old participated in this randomized clinical trial.\n\n      Materials and Methods: Quadrants 1-3 or 2-4 were randomly allocated to the test group\n      (brushing without dentifrice) or control group (brushing with dentifrice). After 72 hours of\n      cessation of oral hygiene, Quigley & Hein (Turesky) plaque index was assessed before and\n      after brushing by a calibrated and blind examiner. Overtime and intergroup comparisons were\n      performed by paired sample t test."
