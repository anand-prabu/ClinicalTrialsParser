  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to investigate if vitamin E status in healthy individuals and
      individuals with metabolic syndrome can be improved by dairy fat. The investigators
      hypothesize that full-fat dairy will substantially increase the bioavailability of
      alpha-tocopherol, a form of vitamin E. The results of this study will contribute to the
      application of dairy fat as a simple and effective strategy for improving vitamin E status,
      which is partly due to poor vitamin E intake. By completing this study, the investigators
      anticipate developing new dietary recommendations to achieve adequate vitamin E status
      through the regular consumption of dairy fat paired with foods containing vitamin E.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and
      affects &gt;70 million Americans. Weight loss and vitamin E supplementation are leading
      strategies for preventing and/or treating NASH. However, the long-term success of weight
      loss is limited and &gt;92% of Americans fail to meet dietary recommendations for vitamin E.
      Thus, the investigators' objective is to define the extent to which dairy fat facilitates
      adequate vitamin E status in individuals with metabolic syndrome, a population at high-risk
      for NASH, by improving Î±-tocopherol bioavailability. The investigators'  central hypothesis
      is that full-fat dairy will substantially increase alpha-tocopherol (a-T) bioavailability to
      the extent needed to facilitate production of alpha-carboxyethyl-hydroxy-chromanol (a-CEHC),
      a metabolite of a-T that predict a-T status. The investigators  will therefore complete the
      following specific aims: 1) define milk fat-mediated improvements in a-T bioavailability,
      and 2) define dairy fat-mediated improvements in a-T status. This study involves a
      randomized crossover study design where healthy adults and those with metabolic syndrome (n
      = 10/group) will ingest deuterium-labeled a-T with fat-free milk, low-fat milk, whole milk,
      or soy milk. Urine and blood samples will be collected at timed intervals prior to and
      following milk consumption. Blood collection will be performed using single needle sticks or
      cannula (for frequent blood collections) by skilled personnel. Plasma samples will be
      analyzed by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry to determine pharmacokinetic
      parameters and vitamin E adequacy by measuring labeled and unlabeled a-T and a-CEHC. Risk to
      participants is expected to be minimal and will be outlined in the informed consent form in
      clear and simple terms. Upon successful completion of this study, the investigators expect
      to demonstrate that whole milk, compared to low-fat and fat-free milk, increases a-T
      bioavailability in a milk fat-dependent manner and that low-fat milk compared to soy milk
      (both beverages contain identical amounts of total fat, but differ in fatty acid profile),
      significantly improves a-T bioavailability. The investigators' results will provide timely
      evidence demonstrating the amount and type of fat needed to achieve optimal vitamin E status
      specifically in a population of significant public health concern. Overall, these studies
      will fill a substantial knowledge gap regarding the importance of dairy fat in contributing
      to optimal health and provide a simple dietary approach to ameliorate poor vitamin E status
      among a significant proportion of Americans.
