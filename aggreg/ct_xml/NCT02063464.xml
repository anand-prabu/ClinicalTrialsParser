    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Monocytes are a type of white blood cell found in human blood. They help the immune
      system. Researchers have found that monocytes taken from the blood of healthy people can
      kill tumor cells. Now they want to know if monocytes taken from the blood of people with
      ovarian cancer can kill tumor cells.

      Objective:

      - To see if monocytes taken from the blood of people with ovarian cancer can kill tumor
      cells.

      Eligibility:

      - Women 18 years and older with ovarian cancer.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with:

        -  Medical history and physical exam.

        -  Blood tests.

        -  CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and/or an MRI. For these scans, they will lie
           in a machine that takes pictures of their body.

        -  A small amount of blood (two tubes) will be collected by needle during one visit.

      Background:

      Using both in vitro and in vivo assays we have shown that human monocytes primed with
      Interferons alpha and gamma are tumorcidal and are capable of killing a number of tumor cell
      lines and human tumors implanted into immunocompromised mice. We have shown that monocytes
      isolated through elutriation at the NIH blood bank and monocytes isolated from
      anticoagulated peripheral blood from healthy women from the NIH blood bank are equally
      capable of killing tumor cells. No data have been collected as to whether monocytes from
      patients with Ovarian Cancer have tumorcidal properties. The goal of this protocol is to
      measure the tumorcidal properties of monocytes from patients with Ovarian Cancer.

      Objectives:

      To obtain blood samples from patients with ovarian cancer.

      Eligibility:

      Females greater than or equal to 18 years of age with a prior diagnosis of ovarian cancer
      seen in the Women   s Cancer Clinic of the NCI. Patients must be able and willing to provide
      informed consent.

      Design:

      We will collect approximately 20 ml of peripheral blood at a single time point from patients
      with ovarian cancer who are not currently on therapy and are screening for trials, being
      seen in consultation, or presenting for enrollment on a clinical trial.
