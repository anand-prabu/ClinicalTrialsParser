All patients will irrespective of\n      their registration in the trial receive radiotherapy according to the standard treatment\n      regimen at the Department of Oncology, Aarhus University Hospital. Participation implies\n      baseline and follow-up procedures. In the treatment planning phase patients will be\n      randomized to one of the following arms: Arm 1 SPECT/CT-based treatment plan with functional\n      dose-volume parameters and Arrm 2 Standard CT-based plan with conventional dose-volume\n      parameters.\n\n      The trial will consist of two parts. To initiate the trial a pilot study (part 1) will be\n      performed to determine the feasibility in our setting at Aarhus University Hospital as it is\n      described in the literature. Consecutive patients will be enrolled in the pilot study during\n      1-year period. The interim analysis after one year of enrollment will be performed to\n      determine what patients are most likely to benefit from functional radiotherapy planning\n      based on SPECT. The main objective of this part is to determine whether V/Q-SPECT data are\n      valid and usable in the radiotherapy planning. The timing for acute and late follow-up SPECT\n      will be determined. Randomized trial (part 2) will be performed thereafter.\n\n      Statistical analysis. The randomization by permitted blocks method will be used to allocate\n      patients to treatment arm. Stratification factors will be age, gender, disease stage,\n      histology, concurrent chemotherapy and irradiated volumes.\n\n      The chi-squire test (\u03b1=0.10) with the continuity correction will be used for analysis of the\n      primary analysis. For all other comparisons, two-sided analyses will be performed and a\n      p-value of 0.05 or less will be considered statistically significant. 95% confidence\n      intervals will be constructed for outcomes of interest. Descriptive statistics will be used\n      to summarize patient characteristics and outcomes by intervention arm. Differences in\n      outcomes between intervention arms will be compared by using paired t-tests, Wilcoxon rank\n      sum tests or McNemar tests as appropriate. Adjusting for stratification factors will be\n      performed using logistic regression or linear regression. Time-to-event analyses will be\n      estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared using Cox proportional hazards\n      regression.\n\n      Estimation of the relationship between dose-volume parameters and toxicity will be evaluated\n      using logistic regression analyses. Within patients who were planned using SPECT, the\n      association between dose-volume parameters calculated using SPECT and those calculated under\n      a CT-plan will be evaluated using correlation coefficients.\n\n      All patients who are randomized will be included in the analysis of safety and efficacy\n      outcomes. Secondary analyses may be performed on those patients only on those who received\n      radiotherapy as per the treatment plan based on SPECT or CT as per the intervention arm. Any\n      patient who is randomized but does not receive radiotherapy based on the intervention\n      allocated treatment plan will be described in detail along with the reason for not receiving\n      the prescribed plan."

The threshold level is adjusted individually for each patient in order to match the size of the SPECT image within the lung volumes defined on CT. A new contour of functional lung is created from the SPECT images using a threshold of 30% of the maximum uptake for each patient. A treatment plan is generated. The principal objective for each plan is to minimize the volume of lungirradiated",
