            "textblock": "Fampridine-SR (4-aminopyridine) is a slow release oral medication that acts as a selective\n      neuronal potassium-channel blocker.  It has been investigated in several multiple sclerosis\n      (MS) studies and has been shown to improve ambulation, fatigue, and endurance.  The\n      hypothesis for the mode of action of fampridine in MS patients is based on the fact that\n      demyelinated axons do not effectively conduct action potentials partly due to abnormal\n      potassium currents that contribute to conduction failure by decreasing action potential\n      duration and amplitude.  Thus, potassium channel blockers such as 4-aminopyridine or 3,4\n      diaminopyridine improve nerve impulse propagation by enhancing action potential formation,\n      improving conduction and preventing conduction block.   In a randomized, multicenter,\n      double-blind, placebo controlled phase III trial, 301 patients were treated with either\n      fampridine (10 mg BID n=229) or placebo (n=72).  Consistent improvement on the timed 25 foot\n      walk (T25FW) was the primary outcome measure.  The proportion who improved on the T25FW was\n      higher in the fampridine than placebo group (35% vs. 8%; p<0.0001).  This data shows that\n      fampridine improves walking speed in MS.  Additionally, the study suggested there is a\n      \"responder effect\" meaning MS subjects who respond to the medication respond very well\n      (timed walk responder), while others do not show any beneficial response (timed walk\n      non-responder).  A responder was defined as an increase in walking speed, compared to\n      placebo run-in, for at least 3 of 4 assessments while on treatment during the trial.\n      However, this study demonstrated that responders could be identified as early as the first\n      and second week after the initiation of treatment, as there was a significant difference\n      between responders and non-responders at this time point.  After discontinuation of\n      fampridine, T25FW scores returned to baseline within one week\n\n      MS and Cognitive Fatigue It is estimated that 43-60% of patients with MS have cognitive\n      dysfunction and studies using objective neuropsychological (NP)  tests have consistently\n      shown impairment in speed of information processing and sustained attention.  Further, MS\n      patients complain of \"cognitive fatigue\", a symptom that may or may not be associated with\n      generalized/central fatigue.  Cognitive fatigue has been defined as a decline in cognitive\n      performance during a task requiring sustained cognitive activity.   Although generalized or\n      motor/muscle fatigue has been shown to affect the subjective assessment of cognitive\n      performance, it does not affect performance on objective cognitive measures.  In contrast,\n      cognitive fatigue has been demonstrated in MS patients on objective neuropsychological\n      tests.  Kujala et al (1995) examined MS patients with and without mild cognitive impairment\n      on a task of sustained attention.  Both groups declined over time while healthy controls did\n      not.  Krupp et al (2000) administered a verbal learning/memory task twice separated by a\n      continuous cognitively effortful task involving processing speed and attention.  Normal\n      controls demonstrated an increase in number of words recalled (+2.6) on the 2nd test\n      administration, as expected due to a practice effect.  In contrast, the MS subjects showed a\n      decrease in test scores (-1.8) on the 2nd test administration.  This difference was found\n      despite both groups subjectively reporting an increase in mental fatigue over the testing\n      period.  Finally, Schwid et al (2003) examined the decline in performance on the Paced\n      Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), a measure of processing speed and sustained\n      attention.  There was a 5.3-5.8% decline in correct responses when comparing the MS\n      subjects' performance at the beginning vs. the end of the test. Normal controls did not show\n      a significant decrease in performance.\n\n      Treating MS Associated Cognitive Impairment and Cognitive Fatigue Currently approved MS\n      specific medications have been shown to affect physical disability, relapse rate and MRI\n      progression in MS subjects but cognition, fatigue and cognitive fatigue have not been the\n      main focus of any of these studies.  Further, symptomatic treatments for generalized fatigue\n      have not focused on cognitive fatigue.  Studies of l-amphetamine found a positive response\n      on measures of processing speed in a small sample of MS subjects, but a larger,\n      multi-centered placebo controlled trial by Morrow et al did not find any significant\n      benefit.  Cognitive fatigue was not specifically addressed in this study.\n\n      Aminopyridines and Cognition in the MS Population Only two previous studies have addressed\n      the effect of aminopyridines on cognition in MS subjects.  In one study, no benefit was\n      found.  It is important to note that the primary aim of the study was to examine changes in\n      generalized fatigue and the cognitive outcomes were tertiary outcomes only.  Further, the\n      measure of attention used has not been validated in the MS population.  In the other study,\n      performance on Rao's Brief Repeatable Neuropsychological Battery (BRN-B) before and after\n      treatment with 4-aminopyridine was compared.  A trend was found for improvement on measures\n      of verbal learning and on the PASAT 2.0 second version, but the findings were not\n      statistically significant.  However the trial was underpowered, with only 20 subjects.\n\n      Summary Cognitive impairment and cognitive fatigue are common in MS yet there are no\n      currently effective treatments for these debilitating symptoms.  Based on the proposed\n      mechanism of action of fampridine, it is probable that it will improve cognitive fatigue in\n      MS by improving nerve conduction.  Using a placebo controlled cross-over study with a two\n      week washout period in between, changes on tests of attention and processing speed under the\n      two conditions can be compared.  Since cognitive impairment is the leading cause of work\n      disability, as well as having an negative impact on social activities and relationships,\n      improving cognitive fatigue will contribute positively to the quality of life of MS\n      patients.\n\n      Trial Objectives\n\n      To determine if fampridine SR 10mg BID has a beneficial effect on cognitive fatigue in MS\n      patients.\n\n      Study Design and Duration\n\n      The design is a cross-over, placebo controlled, double-blind study with four weeks of\n      treatment for drug (fampridine 10mg BID) and placebo separated by a one week washout period.\n       For each visit subsequent to visit 1, we will encourage subjects to ensure similar\n      environmental and behavioural compartment as the first assessment (i.e. amount of sleep,\n      caffeine intake etc.) to try to ensure similar testing settings. Additionally, the\n      assessments will occur at similar times of day as visit 1."
