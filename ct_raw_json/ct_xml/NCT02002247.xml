      The aim of our research program is to investigate the effects of perioperative high dose
      selenium supplementation in high-risk cardiac surgical patients undergoing complicated open
      heart surgery. We hypothesize that the therapeutic strategy tested in this randomized trial
      may contribute to a fewer complications, less organ injury and fewer deaths. Before we
      conduct a very large, international trial testing this hypothesis, we must first conduct a
      pilot study to assess the feasibility of this protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over a million patients undergo open heart surgery annually and this number is likely to
      accelerate as the population ages and the prevalence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease
      continue to increase. Unfortunately, death, organ failure, and other serious complications
      are all too frequent following open heart surgery, especially in some high-risk patient
      populations.

      Selenium is a trace element that is important for many of the body's regulatory and
      metabolic functions especially during times of stress. International members of our study
      team have shown in a non-randomized study that high dose selenium supplementation was
      associated with improved clinical outcomes compared to a historical control group. The next
      step in our program of research is to conduct a randomized trial.

      The aim of our research program is to investigate the effects of perioperative high dose
      selenium supplementation in high-risk cardiac surgical patients undergoing complicated open
      heart surgery. We hypothesize that the therapeutic strategy tested in this randomized trial
      may contribute to a fewer complications, less organ injury and fewer deaths. Before we
      conduct a very large, international trial testing this hypothesis, we must first conduct a
      pilot study to assess the feasibility of this protocol.

      We propose to conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicentre pilot
      study of 80 patients in 6 sites located in Germany and Canada. We have an industry partner
      (Biosyn) that will provide us with product and support for the European sites. Patients will
      be randomized to receive either a daily perioperative high-dose selenium or placebo until
      postoperative day 10 (maximum) or upon earlier discharge from ICU. If our hypothesis is
      proven true, and this simple, inexpensive nutrient reduces complications and improves
      recovery of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, we have the potential to dramatically
      change clinical practice and improve health outcomes.
