Subjects: 1100 active smokers (consumption>10 packs/year) aged 35-70,\n      seeking medical advice for any reason, with no exclusion criteria, will be randomized to\n      receive the intervention or not.\n\n      Intervention: A 20-minutes visit with details of the spirometry data (values of respiratory\n      capacity and volumes referring on the theoretical). The lung age index will be reported\n      compared to chronological age to illustrate lung damage suffered as a result of tobacco\n      consumption.\n\n      Measurements: Basal Spirometry. Structured questionnaire interviewed in the center at 0 and\n      12 months and telephone interview at 3 and 6 months. At 12 months, patients who stopped\n      smoking will perform a CO test and if the CO exhaled will be <10ppm abstinence will be\n      verified by determination of urinary cotinine.\n\n      Primary endpoint: Cessation of tobacco consumption at 12 months. Analysis: Data will be\n      analyzed in the \"intent to treat\", the unit of analysis will be the smoker.\n\n      Expected Results: smoking cessation in the intervention group will exceed at least 5% the\n      achieved by normal practice in primary care."
