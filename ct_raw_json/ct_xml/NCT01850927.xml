  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent data suggests that subclinical myocardial injury occurs in patients undergoing major
      abdominal surgery, and the degree of damage is proportionally linked to morbidity and
      mortality in the short and medium terms. Therefore, new methods of limiting myocardial
      damage are urgently needed.

      Ischemic preconditioning is a phenomenon whereby a brief non-lethal ischemia-reperfusion
      stimulus gives a protective effect to further ischemic insults. In remote ischemic
      preconditioning (RIPC), this initial stimulus is carried out away from the region of
      interest, normally a limb. In meta-analysed syntheses the effect size of RIPC in reducing
      cardiac damage during bypass grafting, as characterised by troponin release, seems to be
      about 35%.

      The PRIME Study will assess the value of RIPC in reducing subclinical myocardial injury in
      patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. Post-operative troponin release will be used as
      a surrogate marker of myocardial damage. There is no good data on which to build a reliable
      sample size calculation, therefore we estimated samples sizes using supplementary data from
      the recent VISION study. The investigators intend to build a clinically powered study from
      the results of this study.

      Study design will be by single-centre single-blind randomised control trial. Allocation will
      be 1:1. All treatments will be carried after induction of anaesthesia, prior to surgery. In
      the RIPC-treatment group, a blood pressure cuff inflated on an upper limb to 200mmHg for 5
      minutes, and then deflated for 5 minutes, repeated in three cycles. In the control group,
      the blood pressure cuff will not be inflated, but the patient will remain under anaesthesia
      for the same amount of time.

      Primary endpoint will be peak post-operative 5th generation hs-TnT (highly sensitive
      Troponin-T, ng/ml). Secondary endpoint will be hs-TnT area-under-the-curve, major adverse
      cardiovascular events, serious surgical complications, non-cardiovascular death, quality of
      life, and length of stay.
