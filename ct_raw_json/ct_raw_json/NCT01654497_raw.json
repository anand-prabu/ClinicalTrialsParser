            "textblock": "Protection from apoptosis is a key survival factor for cancer cells. Dexanabinol is under\n      investigation as a novel anti-cancer therapy based on its tumoricidal activity observed in\n      vitro and in vivo, presumably due to inhibitory activity against NF\u0138B, TNF\u03b1, COX-2 and\n      additional putative targets suck as HAT, FAT and cyclin dependent kinases. Targeted\n      induction of apoptosis in cancer cells versus normal cells provides an attractive strategy\n      for the treatment of brain cancer, a pernicious disease with debilitating neurological side\n      effects and poor prognoses. A single intravenous dosing of dexanabinol has demonstrated\n      safety in humans. Therefore, we are conducting a phase I dose escalation study to examine\n      the safety of multiple dosing of dexanabinol and drug penetration into the brain, and to\n      determine a suitable dose for moving into a phase II trial for efficacy."
