      This study is designed to evaluate safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity, and efficacy of
      GSK Biological's malaria candidate vaccine 257049 administered as standard doses at 0 and 1
      months and 1/5th standard dose at 7 months (delayed fractional dose group) and 257049
      administered as three standard doses one month apart (0, 1, 2-month group) in healthy
      malaria-naïve volunteers aged 18-50 years in the sporozoite challenge model.

             vaccinated subject in the delayed fractional dose group, approximately 10 months per
             vaccinated subject in the 0, 1, 2-month schedule and approximately 7 months per
             subject in the infectivity control group).

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.

               -  Non-childbearing potential is defined as pre-menarche, current tubal ligation,

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the
             subject:

               -  has practiced adequate FDA-approved contraception for 30 days prior to
                  vaccination, and

               -  has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and

               -  has agreed to continue adequate FDA-approved contraception during the entire
                  treatment period and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series
                  and/or malaria challenge.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccine
