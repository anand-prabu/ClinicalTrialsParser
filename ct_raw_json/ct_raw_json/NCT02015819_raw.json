Placing the gene for Escherichia coli (E. coli) cytosine\n      deaminase into neural stem cells may improve the body's ability to fight cancer or make the\n      cancer more sensitive to chemotherapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as flucytosine, work\n      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by\n      stopping them from dividing. Leucovorin calcium may help flucytosine kill more tumor cells\n      by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Giving genetically-modified neural stem\n      cells and flucytosine with leucovorin calcium may be an effective treatment for high-grade\n      gliomas."

To determine the feasibility of treating study patients with more than 1 dose of NSCs\n      followed by 7-day courses of 5-FC and leucovorin.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I.

To characterized the relationship between intracerebral and systemic concentrations of\n      5-FC and 5-FU at the maximum tolerated dose level.\n\n      III.
