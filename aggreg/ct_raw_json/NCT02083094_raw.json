No prospective comparative data in advanced RCC\n      (or other indications) have been published. A search in the clinicaltrials.gov database did\n      not reveal any planned or ongoing studies. As sequential therapy is now the standard of\n      treatment for advanced RCC it is important to evaluate in clinical trials what the value of\n      different sequential strategies is. This needs to be done every time new agents are\n      introduced into the treatment armamentarium. As there are no data yet on the sequential use\n      of sorafenib followed by pazopanib or vice versa, this sequence, however, will most\n      certainly be used in daily practice, it is required to examine efficacy and safety of this\n      sequential approach in a clinical trial in a randomized setting.\n\n      Therefore, the investigators have designed an open randomized study in patients not\n      previously treated for advanced RCC. Suitable patients will be randomized (1:1) in 2 groups."
