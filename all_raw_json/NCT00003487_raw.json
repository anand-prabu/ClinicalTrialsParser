Patients achieving a complete response (CR) continue treatment for at\n      least 8 months beyond CR. Patients achieving a partial response or stable disease continue\n      treatment until disease progression.\n\n      Tumors are measured every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for the second year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
