Even though\n      evidence shows medications are effective in reducing ADHD symptoms, many families experience\n      ongoing parenting stress around parent-child interactions. Children often have ongoing\n      impairments in functioning.  ADHD is a common condition identified and managed by primary\n      care pediatricians.  However current care in the clinic is not optimal to address parents'\n      and children's needs around ADHD chronic care.  Time is the biggest barrier.  Group visits\n      are a viable option to improve pediatric ADHD care, but requires extensive study.  The goal\n      of this proposed study is to test the feasibility and effectiveness of the group visit model\n      for ADHD management within pediatric primary care.  This study will be a randomized\n      feasibility study that will generate important pilot data, as well as result in an\n      innovative, exportable pediatric ADHD group curriculum for primary care practice."
