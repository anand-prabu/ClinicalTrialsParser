      This study is undertaken to explore whether compared to fasting until lunch, the breakfast
      consumption influence the oscillation of the metabolic clock gene expression in peripheral
      blood cells (PBC), in type 2 diabetic patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most of our metabolic function is controlled by metabolic clock genes that regulate glucose,
      lipid metabolism and several other circadian metabolic pathways involved in insulin
      resistance obesity and type 2 diabetes. The main group of clock genes resides in the SCN
      nuclei and is synchronized by light/dark signals(11). However similar clock oscillators
      called peripheral clocks are found in almost all tissues, including in the liver, heart,
      kidney, intestine, skeletal muscles, and adipocytes and in peripheral blood cells (PBC). The
      peripheral clocks, and specially those metabolic clock genes, seem to be controlled  mainly
      by food cues.

      The time of food intake synchronize simultaneously and in parallel way  almost all the
      peripheral metabolic clock genes including those expressed and in peripheral blood cells
      (PBC) i.e. leucocytes, monocytes; allowing to explore the oscillation of the metabolic clock
      gene expression of the whole body by assessing  its expression in the PBC.  Impaired
      oscillation of the metabolic clock gene mRNA expression was found in diabetic animal models
      and in patients with type 2 diabetes and  were inversely correlated with HbA1c.

      In support of these finding we reported that high calorie  breakfast with reduced dinner
      improved insulin sensitivity and  weight loss rate among obese subjects, while in type 2
      diabetic patients the high calorie breakfast was associated with improvement of HbA1c.

      Moreover, recently was shown that very short time (only 120 min) after food intake in the
      breakfast, was sufficient to reset the expression of the circadian clock genes.

      This  study  is  undertaken  to explore  whether  compared  to  fasting  until lunch , the
      breakfast  consumption   influence  the oscillation of the metabolic clock gene expression
      in PBC, in  patients  with type 2 diabetes
