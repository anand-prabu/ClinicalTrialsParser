            "textblock": "Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is the reconstitution of normal flora by a \"stool\n      transplant\" from a healthy individual to a C. difficile-infected recipient, and has long\n      been a successful approach to recurrent/refractory C. difficile. The purpose of this project\n      is to generate a frozen FMT inoculum from well-screened healthy volunteer donors which can\n      be used repeatedly, particularly in those who do not have a healthy intimate partner or\n      other related donor. Delivery of FMT has been performed colonoscopically, by fecal retention\n      enema, or by the nasogastric route. This study will evaluate the safety and secondarily the\n      efficacy of an inoculum administered by frozen orally-administered capsules.\n\n      Subjects with recurrent/relapsing C. difficile infection will receive FMT via oral capsules\n\n      The primary endpoint is assessment of safety as measured by clinical events (GI, procedural,\n      systemic). Efficacy will be defined as a resolution of diarrhea off antibiotics for C.\n      difficile, in the absence of a need for OTHER systemic antibiotics, i.e. resumption of a\n      normal bowel status for the individual. Secondary efficacy endpoints include weight,\n      subjective well-being and relative clinical improvement per standardized questionnaire, and\n      subject qualitative assessment of, and satisfaction with, the transplant procedures.\n      Subjects will be monitored for clinical safety by history and standard exams and the\n      follow-up questionnaire as well as followed closely by phone and in person."
