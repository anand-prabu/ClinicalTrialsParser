    <textblock>
      Decompressive craniectomy has been reported for the treatment of patients with intracerebral
      hemorrhage. But no prospective randomised controlled trials have yet been undertaken to
      confirm its effect.The purpose of the study is to determine whether decompressive
      craniectomy post hematoma removal surgery after intracerebral hemorrhage will reduce the
      chances of a person dying or surviving with a long term disability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is one of the most serious subtypes of stroke, affecting
      approximately 2-3 million people worldwide each year. About one third of people with ICH die
      early after onset and the majority of survivors are left with major long-term disability.
      Hematoma removal (HR) surgery is the primary treatment for ICH which volume is more than
      30ml. But whether decompressive craniectomy (DC) should be employed during the HR surgery
      still has considerable controversy. Outcomes in this study will be measured at 3 months
      after surgery via a postal questionnaire including the Glasgow Outcome scale, Modified
      Rankin Scale, and Barthel index. Two hundred patients will be recruited to the trial over 36
      months. Follow-up will take three months with analysis and reporting taking one year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of a spontaneous lobar and basal ganglia ICH on CT scan

          -  Patient within 72 hours of ictus

          -  Best score on the GCS of 5-13.

          -  Volume of hematoma between 30 and 100ml [Calculated using (a x b x c)/2 method]

        Exclusion Criteria:

             arteriovenous malformation.

          -  Intraventricular hemorrhage of any sort

          -  ICH secondary to tumour or trauma.

          -  If the hematological effects of any previous anticoagulants are not completely
             reversed.
