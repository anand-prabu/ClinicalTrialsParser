  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) and Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic
      Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CP/CPPS) are often characterized by chronic pelvic pain with or
      without voiding dysfunction.  IC and CP/CPPS remain an enigma within urology, with no known
      etiology or widely effective therapies.  However, some IC and CP/CPPS patients suffer bowel
      co-morbidities, and it is well established that the GI tract can influence bladder function
      and sensation via pelvic organ crosstalk.

      Like other body sites, the gut harbors a rich microflora.  Studies characterizing microbial
      diversity and relative abundance at a particular body site, the &quot;microbiome,&quot; reveal that
      microbiomes play critical roles in normal cellular and organ function, and thus this
      importance is emphasized with the Human Microbiome Project (HMP), an NIH Common Fund
      initiative.  Microbiomes are also dynamic and subject to skewing, and these changes are
      increasingly associated with diseases including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and
      obesity.  Antibiotic therapies alter microbiomes, often causing temporary dysfunction and
      sometimes resulting in diseases such as colitis.  Since some IC/PBS patients have a history
      of urinary tract infection (UTI), they typically receive multiple courses of antibiotics.
      This therapeutic history of treatment may have adverse consequences for two reasons.  First,
      potential skewing of the gut microbiome may alter normal sensory and functional homeostatic
      mechanisms, contributing to pain and voiding dysfunction.

      Second, an altered gut microbiome may foster uropathogen reservoir expansion, and our
      preliminary data demonstrate urinary E. coli isolates can induce chronic pelvic pain
      persisting long after microbial clearance.  Together these lines of reasoning raise the
      provocative possibility that microbiomes contribute to IC and CP/CPPS directly by supplying
      uropathogens or indirectly through organ crosstalk dysfunction.  Therefore, is an altered
      gastrointestinal and/or reproductive tract microbiome associated with IC and CP/CPPS? Our
      team marries core NIH and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
      Diseases (NIDDK) missions, digestive diseases and kidney/urologic, to address this novel
      question with synergistic expertise in clinical diagnosis of IC and CP/CPPS, quantifying GI
      and reproductive tract microbiomes, and mechanisms of microbe-induced pelvic pain.
