            "textblock": "Peanut allergy is a common problem with no current treatment. Recent studies have shown some\n      success with oral or sublingual immunotherapy for the treatment of food allergy. Oral\n      treatment, which requires very high doses, is associated with a small but appreciable risk\n      of systemic reactions. Sublingual immunotherapy, which utilizes much smaller doses, is safer\n      but constraints inherent in the available methods of sublingual administration have limited\n      the utility of this method. Typically sublingual immunotherapy for food allergy has used\n      either fresh foods or a simple liquid extract. These methods are not optimized for\n      practicality or dwell duration in the mouth, and, thus far, dosing has been limited by the\n      ability to make concentrated extracts and by the volume of extract that can be applied to\n      the sublingual space. This study is being conducted to determine if a dissolving peanut\n      extract film, will improve efficacy for immunotherapy for peanut allergy."
