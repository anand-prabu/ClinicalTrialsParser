Specifically, several studies suggest that deeper\n      level of anesthesia is associated with increased incidence of postoperative delirium and\n      longer-term cognitive decline.  In fact, some suggest that older patients undergoing surgery\n      should routinely be monitored with an anesthetic depth monitor to allow the titration of\n      anesthetics or sedation medications to lighter levels to promote better postoperative\n      cognitive outcomes.  However, such a practice has never been validated or proven to be\n      feasible or safe. Accordingly, the investigators plan an exploratory study to determine the\n      feasibility and safety of randomizing patients undergoing major surgery to receive deep vs.\n      light anesthetic levels during surgery."
