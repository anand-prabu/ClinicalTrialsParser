The aim of this study was to compare real-time continuous glucose\n      monitoring system (RT-CGMS) to standard method by intermittent capillary blood glucose\n      testing in detecting and managing hypoglycemia. The investigators calculated a number of 48\n      neonates to be randomized between 2 ways of glucose level monitoring for their 3 first days\n      of life : either by RT-CGMS (CGM-group), or by intermittent capillary glucose testing\n      (IGM-group) associated with a blind-CGMS to detect retrospectively missed hypoglycemia. The\n      investigators' hypothesis is that in the CGM group number and duration of hypoglycemia will\n      be lower."
