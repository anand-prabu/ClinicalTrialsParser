  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, dose-finding, multicenter study of intravesical BCG plus
      ALT-803 in BCG-naive Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose
      (MTD) of ALT-803 and determine the Recommended Dose (RD) level of ALT-803 combined with BCG
      in patients who have BCG-naive nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. The anti-tumor activity of
      BCG+ALT-803 will also be assessed. In addition, the study will characterize the molecular,
      immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic profile of BCG+ALT-803.

      The study includes a dose escalation phase (Phase Ib) and a dose expansion phase (Phase II).
      The dose escalation phase is concluded when the MTD is determined. A dose level (RD) will be
      designated for the expansion phase of the study. The expansion phase consists of a
      noncomparative randomized design of patients receiving ALT-803 at the RD level in
      combination with BCG  or BCG alone.
