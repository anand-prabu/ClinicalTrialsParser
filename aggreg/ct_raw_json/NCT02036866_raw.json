A secondary objective is to establish the feasibility of an\n      intervention study to determine if changes in the excitability of these supraspinal motor\n      and sensory processes can be modified by physical therapy interventions targeting pain and\n      muscle strengthening. We hypothesize that patients with knee osteoarthritis will show\n      measurable deficits in quadriceps voluntary activation that can be explained by lower levels\n      of corticospinal excitability and increased pain sensitization. A 1 week physical therapy\n      intervention will improve voluntary activation and reduce pain with concurrent changes in\n      underlying motor and sensory processes. We further hypothesize that part of this improvement\n      will be attributed to positive treatment expectation."
