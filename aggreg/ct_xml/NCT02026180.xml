  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular access complications can occur during or after cardiac or peripheral arterial
      catheterization.  These complications increase patient morbidity and mortality, as well as
      healthcare costs.  Several strategies and devices have been employed to decrease the risk
      for vascular access complications, such as fluoroscopy-guided access, ultrasound-guided
      access and vascular closure devices.    Randomized trial data has failed to demonstrate that
      fluoroscopic guidance reduces common femoral artery access complications.  While
      meta-analysis data has demonstrated that vascular closure devices decrease time to arterial
      hemostasis, increase patient mobilization and facilitate earlier patient discharge, they do
      not reduce the incidence of vascular complications as compared to hemostasis achieved with
      manual pressure. Ultrasound guidance has been shown to facilitate femoral artery access and
      reduce femoral artery vascular complications. A new device, the Micropuncture Kit (Cook
      Medical, Bloomington, IN) allows vascular access with a small 21gauge needle as opposed to
      the standard method, which requires an 18 gauge needle. The use of the Micropuncture Kit for
      the purpose of decreasing vascular access complications has not been examined in a
      randomized study to date.

      The present study is a 552 patient randomized controlled clinical trial that will help
      determine whether femoral arterial access obtained using the Micropuncture Kit will reduce
      the incidence of vascular access complications compared to the standard 18 gauge needle.

      The specific aim of this proposal is to compare the rate of femoral artery access
      complications using the Micropuncture Kit vs. standard femoral artery access.

      It is our hypothesis that the incidence of femoral artery access complications will be lower
      among patients in whom the Micropuncture Kit is used.
