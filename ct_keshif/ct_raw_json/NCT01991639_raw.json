            "textblock": "Background: In elderly subjects frailty and malnutrition are very common and can lead to\n      serious health hazards, increase mortality, morbidity, dependency, institutionalization and\n      a reduced quality of life. In Austria, the prevalence of frailty and malnutrition are\n      increasing steadily and are becoming a challenge for our social system. Physical training\n      and adequate nutrition can invert it.\n\n      Methods/Design: In this randomized, controlled trial 80 malnourished, frail,\n      community-dwelling patients (\u2265 65 years) hospitalized in wards for internal medicine are\n      recruited. Additionally, 80 lay volunteers (\u2265 50 years) named buddies are recruited and\n      subsequently trained regarding health enhancing physical activity and nutrition in three\n      standardized training sessions. These buddies visit the malnourished, frail subjects at home\n      twice a week for about one hour during an initial period of 10-12 weeks. While participants\n      allocated to the intervention group (n=40) conduct intervention to improve their fluid\n      intake, their protein and energy intake, perform strength training and try to increase their\n      baseline activities, the control group (n=40) only gets home visits without any special\n      intervention. After 10-12 weeks, both, the intervention and the control group, receive the\n      nutrition intervention and the physical training. Health, nutrition and frailty status,\n      physical fitness and body composition and chronic inflammation of buddies and frails are\n      recorded before the intervention, after 10-12 weeks, and after 6 and 12 months.\n\n      Discussion: To the investigators knowledge this trial is the first of its kind to provide\n      nutrition and physical activity intervention to malnourished, frail, community-dwelling\n      subjects by trained lay buddies, in which the health status of buddies is also expected to\n      improve. This study assesses the effectiveness of such an intervention. If successful, the\n      intervention offers new perspectives for the management of frailty and malnutrition."
