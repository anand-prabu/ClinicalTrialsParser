To assess if there is a change in knowledge and attitudes about CRC screening after\n      watching the educational video.\n\n      II. To assess the effectiveness of providing communication skills training for improving\n      discussion focusing on CRC screening during the patient-provider visit.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms prior to a medical visit.\n\n      ARM I (Education only): Patients receive CRC and CRC screening information by an educational\n      video and a brochure with healthy hints to prevent CRC.\n\n      ARM II (Education and patient activation): Patients receive CRC and CRC screening\n      information and communication skills training (patient activation) intervention by\n      educational video and brochure and a brochure about healthy hints to prevent CRC.\n\n      After the medical visit, patients' medical records are reviewed at 1 month and 2 months\n      after the visit to document CRC screening completion."
