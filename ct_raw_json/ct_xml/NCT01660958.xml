      Project Grow Smart evaluates the impact of a 12-month intervention of
      micronutrient-fortified food and an early learning intervention on young children's
      cognitive ability. There is an infancy phase and a preschool phase.

      The infant phase is conducted through home visits - micronutrient sachets are distributed to
      be mixed with food. The preschool phase is conducted in Anganwadi Centers. Hypothesis #1 is
      that infants who receive both the micronutrients and the early learning intervention will
      have better scores on measures of child development than children who receive neither.
      Children who receive one of the two interventions will have intermediate scores.  Hypothesis
      #2 is that preschoolers in Anganwadi Centers that receive the micronutrient-enriched food
      wll have better scores on measures of child development than children in Anganwadi Centers
      who do not.

      The preschool phase is conducted in Anganwadi Centers (AWC), which are like preschools.
      Preschoolers age 36-48 months are recruited. AWC are classified as high or low stimulation,
      based on a rating system (Early Childhood and Childcare Environmental Rating Scale, ECERS).
      AWC are randomized into 2 cells: 1) multiple micronutrient-fortified food or 2)
      placebo-fortified food. Preschoolers receive the food in the AWC; their mothers receive
      information on iron-rich food. For both phases, evaluations are conducted at recruitment and
      after 6 and 12 months and focus on changes in the children's cognitive performance and
      micronutrient (iron) status.

      The investigators hypothesize that innovative multiple micronutrient (MN) fortification
      strategies for infants and preschoolers combined with early learning opportunities will
      impact children's micronutrient status, growth and development in Nalgonda district of
      Andhra Pradesh, India.

      Project Grow Smart evaluates the impact of a 12-month intervention of
      micronutrient-fortified food and an early learning intervention on young children's
      cognitive ability. There is an infancy phase and a preschool phase.

      In the infant phase, 6-12 month old infants are recruited and randomized into one of four
      cells to receive: 1) sachets of multiple micronutrients or sachets of placebo (vitamins) to
      be added to the infant's food and 2) an early learning intervention delivered in the home or
      control (no early learning intervention). Families of all infants will receive information
      on iron rich foods.

      The preschool phase is conducted in Anganwadi Centers (AWC), which are like preschools.
      Preschoolers age 36-48 months are recruited. AWC are classified as high or low stimulation,
