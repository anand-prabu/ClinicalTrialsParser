In adults, mutations in MC4R\n      are less penetrant for these phenotypes but it has been observed that individuals with MC4R\n      mutations have a smaller than expected blood pressure for their degree of obesity.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to explore the association between functional MC4R mutations\n      and obesity, insulin resistance and blood pressure."
