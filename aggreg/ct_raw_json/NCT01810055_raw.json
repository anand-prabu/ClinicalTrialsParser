It will enhance timely reporting of patient data and targeted support supervision on the CHWs who need support from their supervisors. With the CHWs receiving the above support and feedback messages, this will potentially increase CHW motivation, performance and retention. Data reported by CHWs can be used by the district planners to forecasting of medicine procurements and react to drug stock-outs or unusual data trends (e.g. disease outbreaks)."

Extensive formative\n      research was conducted to support the design of innovations aimed to improve motivation and\n      performance of community health workers.\n\n      Innovations which have potential to address the project's aims but lack sufficient evidence\n      of impact are being formally evaluated in a randomised control trial. In Mozambique, a\n      technology based intervention is being tested where community health workers (CHWs) are\n      provided with smart phones to programmed with a tool for decision support, immediate\n      feedback and multimedia audio and images to improve adherence to protocols. The tool will\n      also allow CHWs to send key indicators to a server and to keep a register of patients who\n      can be tracked over time. The indicators submitted will be used for performance monitoring\n      of the CHWs by providing automated timely, digestible reports with targeted follow-up\n      actions for CHW supervisors. In Uganda, one technology and one community based intervention\n      are being evaluated over a 12 month period. In the technology intervention, CHWs are given a\n      Java enabled mobile phone through which they can send their weekly reports and drug stocks,\n      receive immediate feedback based on data submission and monthly motivational messages. The\n      phones in both countries also contain innovative tools such as a respiratory timers to\n      support the CHWs in their work. CHWs and their supervisors are on closed user groups in\n      order to increase communication and support. The community intervention is focused on the\n      running of Village Health Clubs. These are designed to be highly participatory with the CHWs\n      in the role of facilitator, aimed at increasing awareness about the CHW role and improving\n      motivation through the support of the community.\n\n      Continuous Ministry of Health support for health facilities to provide referral care and\n      equip community health workers with medicines, tools, supervision and training are critical\n      for the success of the project"
