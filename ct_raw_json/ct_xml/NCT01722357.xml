  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to address 3 main sets of questions in the bariatric surgery
      population. 1) Does bariatric surgery, without any other intervention, lead to increased
      physical activity and improved physical fitness?  2) Does wearing a pedometer lead to
      increased physical activity in obese individuals prior to and/or after bariatric surgery?
      Does the increased activity result in improvements in physical fitness?   3) Does physical
      activity counseling increase physical activity prior to and or/after bariatric surgery?
      Does the increased activity result in improvements in physical fitness?   The overall goal
      of the study is to determine the impact of bariatric surgery on physical activity and assess
      the utility of additional interventions to help postoperative patients adopt a more active
      lifestyle.  Physiological measures will be assessed to determine whether bariatric surgery
      and/or improved physical activity levels result in improved physical fitness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery leads to improvement or resolution of a variety of health conditions.  It
      is also well established that physical activity, with or without weight loss, improves many
      health-related problems and can have a positive impact on mood.  Therefore, physical
      activity may amplify the health and psychological benefits often experienced from bariatric
      surgery.  Prior to surgery many patients are relatively inactive due to physical and social
      barriers associated with their weight.  In addition, many patients find it difficult to
      adopt an active lifestyle after surgery, despite an increased capacity to exercise.
      However, weight loss is associated with physical activity after bariatric surgery.
      Nonetheless, little is known about the most effective means to promote activity among this
      group of individuals.  This study will examine changes in physical activity and fitness
      after bariatric surgery and examine whether the addition of pedometer use and exercise
      counseling may lead to greater improvements.
