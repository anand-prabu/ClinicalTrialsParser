It has not been studied as an acute cardioprotective agent in percutaneous\n      coronary intervention (PCI).\n\n      We hypothesize that upfront administration of Ranolazine could decrease the myocardial\n      injury associated with PCI due to all the factors listed above (i.e. precondition the\n      myocardium). We plan to screen all patients scheduled for an elective coronary angiogram.\n      Those who meet criteria and consent will be randomized to either receive Ranolazine or\n      placebo twice a day for 3 days leading up to the PCI."
