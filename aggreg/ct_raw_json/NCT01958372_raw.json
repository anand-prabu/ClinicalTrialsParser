Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, pemetrexed sodium, and etoposide, work in different ways to\n      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from\n      dividing. Soy isoflavones may help radiation therapy, cisplatin, pemetrexed sodium, and\n      etoposide work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Soy isoflavones may\n      also protect normal cells from the side effects of radiation therapy and chemotherapy."
