Determine the lowest effective dose of oral isotretinoin for long-term\n      therapy that is capable of reducing the rate of formation of new skin cancers in patients\n      with xeroderma pigmentosum or nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. II. Determine the\n      possible side effects associated with long-term use of isotretinoin in this patient\n      population.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease type (xeroderma pigmentosum vs nevoid\n      basal cell carcinoma syndrome). Patients not previously treated with isotretinoin receive\n      oral isotretinoin daily for 2 years and then are followed without receiving isotretinoin for\n      1 year. After the follow-up period, treatment may be resumed if the rate of new skin tumor\n      formation reaches 2 per year provided original eligibility criteria are met. Treatment may\n      be resumed during the follow-up period if the rate of new skin tumor formation increases to\n      the rate observed before study. Patients previously treated with oral isotretinoin continue\n      treatment and are followed to evaluate any long-term effects of treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study."
