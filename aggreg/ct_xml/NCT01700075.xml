    <textblock>
      Study the mechanisms of atherosclerosis based on a comparative study of physical and
      chemical properties of lipid tissues at various localization with subsequent development of
      concept of treatment and prevention.

      The chemical and physical properties of different lipids of body. The clinical part of the
      work is a prospective randomized comparative controlled clinical trial of patients with
      atherosclerotic diseases.

      Developed the concept of &quot;limited biological resources&quot; of the body based on the increase in
      the expenditure of energy reserves of the body, allowing a critical look at overweight.

      The role of overweight in the development of atheromatous fat was revealed. The positive
      results from the weight loss in patients with atherosclerotic disease were drawn. Developed
      the metabolic concept of atherosclerosis associated with evolutionary aging and conversion
      of lipids in hard atherosclerotic fat.
