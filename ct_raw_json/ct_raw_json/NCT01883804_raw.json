            "textblock": "Type 1 Diabetes is an autoimmune condition in which segments of the immune system cause the\n      destruction of insulin producing cells in the pancreas, leaving individuals with an impaired\n      ability to control blood glucose levels. Currently there is no cure for Type 1 Diabetes and\n      the treatments involve lifelong insulin administration and careful monitoring of blood\n      glucose levels. Long-term complications like cardiovascular disease, nerve damage, and\n      retina damage, may result. Previous studies have shown that improvement in the control of\n      blood glucose can reduce the risks from these long-term complications. Residual insulin\n      production, typically within the first few years following diagnosis, helps to reduce an\n      individual's need to supplement insulin by injection or pump. This effect helps in\n      maintaining the body's ability to regulate blood glucose levels and reducing the needs of\n      external insulin.\n\n      Methyldopa, or Aldomet, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and is\n      commonly used to treat high blood pressure. This drug has been approved for several decades\n      and has been shown to be safe and effective. This drug has been identified by the researcher\n      to be able to block the communication between two important types of immune cells; which\n      play a critical role in the autoimmune processes of Type 1 Diabetes. The investigators\n      hypothesize that Methyldopa, over a 6 week treatment period, will block this communication\n      and possibly slow down the destruction of insulin producing cells. The investigators hope to\n      assess the appropriate and safe dose to achieve this effect, along with the drug's ability\n      to maintain insulin production and blood glucose control."
