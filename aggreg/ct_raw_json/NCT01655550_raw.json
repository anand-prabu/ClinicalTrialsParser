If the patient assents, he/she will\n      receive a phone call from a research assistant to obtain informed consent.  The first ten\n      patients to call the office to schedule a scan using a 64 slice MDCT will be recruited and\n      randomized if they consent.\n\n      Subjects will be randomized at the time of recruitment, which will be when he/she calls to\n      make the appointment for the exam, in a 1:1 ratio between the control arm (contrast) and the\n      experimental arm (no contrast).  The control arm will either pick up their two bottles of\n      oral contrast at a radiology office or have the bottles mailed to them as is currently the\n      standard.  They will drink the oral contrast two hours before the study.  They will also\n      ingest 300 mL of water immediately prior to imaging and be administered the standard\n      intravenous contrast dose.  The experimental group will not be mailed or given any oral\n      contrast.  They will arrive at their appointment and ingest 300 mL of water immediately\n      prior to the exam as well as the standard intravenous contrast dose and be scanned.  This\n      design will eliminate the need to repeat scanning patients, thus decreasing radiation dose.\n      A patient satisfaction survey  will be given to each patient following the exam and handed\n      to the technologist"
