  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tonsillectomy is the most common pediatric surgical procedure performed in the US, with over
      530,000 procedures performed annually in children under 15 years (Baugh et al., 2011). The
      postoperative period can be particularly painful. A recent clinical consensus acknowledges
      there is no standard analgesic protocol, and calls for further research comparing
      postoperative pain medications (Baugh et al., 2011).  Tramadol was found to be as effective
      as codeine with few reported side effects in a recent double-blinded, controlled trial
      conducted by the investigators at Children's Hospitals and Clinics (CHC), and it is
      currently being prescribed in the postoperative setting. However, despite its effectiveness
      for pain control, there were some children that continued to report pain during the 10-day
      follow-up period. In response, the investigators will conduct a randomized, double-blinded
      controlled trial to determine whether or not adding scheduled gabapentin to a scheduled
      tramadol + &quot;as needed&quot; (PRN) ibuprofen regimen provides better pain control than tramadol +
      ibuprofen PRN alone during the post-tonsillectomy period. Using a 10-day take-home diary,
      caregivers will be asked to record daily information about their child's postoperative pain
      and other core outcomes and domains as recommended in the recent consensus statement put
      forth by the Pediatric Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical
      Trials (IMMPACT) (McGrath et al., 2008). This study will offer new information regarding the
      efficacy and side effects associated with adding scheduled gabapentin to a postoperative
      pain management protocol in a pediatric population.

    <description>To compare the efficacy of scheduled tramadol + PRN ibuprofen vs. scheduled tramadol + scheduled gabapentin + PRN ibuprofen for pain management during the post-tonsillectomy recovery period. Efficacy will be measured through daily collection of three pain scores (FACES or numeric; 0-10 rating): &quot;pain right now,&quot; &quot;typical pain over the past 24 hours,&quot; and &quot;worst pain in the past 24 hours.&quot; Efficacy will also be measured daily with: 1) the Parents' Postoperative Pain Measure, 2) the number of times &quot;as needed&quot; medication is given by parents, 3) sleep quality, and 4) global satisfaction with pain management and recovery (on day 10 only). All efficacy measures will be recorded in a take-home diary by parents for 10 days postoperatively.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the side effects of scheduled tramadol  + PRN ibuprofen vs. scheduled tramadol +  scheduled gabapentin + PRN ibuprofen during the post-tonsillectomy recovery period. Safety will be measured through use of a daily take-home diary that the parents fill out, and through phone calls made to parents by the study coordinator every two days during the 10-day recovery period. Specifically, parents will document, on a daily basis, number and occurence of any side effects (e.g., vomiting, dizziness), number of doctor and emergency room visits, length of stay in days (if applicable), and the purpose and location of any medical visits.</description>
