      Treat Barrett's esophagus (BE) patients with tamoxifen to Barrett's metaplasia as measured
      by changes in Barrett's esophagus appearance by endoscopy and histology as well as changes
      in SOX2 and CDX2.

      Treat Barrett's esophagus (BE) patients with tamoxifen to  determine the effects on
      Barrett's metaplasia as measured by changes in Barrett's esophagus appearance by endoscopy
      and histology.  Tamoxifen treatment may induce SOX2 expression, decrease CDX2 and promote
      esophageal stem cell activity, leading to regression of Barrett's metaplasia. To test this
      hypothesis, we will conduct a prospective, pilot study where patients with BE, without high
      grade dysplasia, are treated with tamoxifen and assessed for changes in the appearance of
      their BE by endoscopy and histology as well as changes in the SOX2/CDX2 ratio indicative of
      an improvement in BE metaplasia

    <description>The biopsy procedures with 4 quadrant biopsies/2 cm for histology and additional biopsies for freezing for macromolecular analysis to assess the preliminary diagnostic value of this marker pair in identifying levels of metaplasia in BE and as an indicator of response to tamoxifen treatment. The tissue from the two endoscopic procedures will be assessed for changes in the following related to tamoxifen therapy: 1) changes in the length of Barrett's esophagus involvement; and 2) the specific studies included to assess the response to tamoxifen.</description>

    <description>The main outcome measurements are SOX2 and CDX2, analyzed as a ratio. We will use a one sample paired non-parametric Wilcoxon test to test the significant difference if the ratio difference is not normally distributed. Normality assumption can be examined by visual Q-Q plot and formal Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. In addition, we will explore the patient level characteristics on treatment effect using a linear regression model. Specifically, we will use the difference ratio as the response variable and patient characteristics of interest as explanatory variables. Regression coefficients associated with the explanatory variables quantify the effect of these variables on the difference ratio, with t or F statistic testing for the statistical significance.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Biopsy-proven Barrett's esophagus that is non-dysplastic or with low grade dysplasia.

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2

          -  Normal bone marrow and organ function as defined below:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcl

               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤&lt; 1.5 x IULN

               -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits or creatinine clearance ≥ 60
                  mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and
             for the duration of study participation.  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect
             she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating
             physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed
             consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior history of esophageal cancer.

          -  Prior history or current use of tamoxifen or anti-estrogen therapy.

          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to tamoxifen.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Female patients must have a negative urine pregnancy
             test within 14 days of study entry.

          -  Known HIV-positivity and on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the
             potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with tamoxifen. Appropriate studies will
             be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when
             indicated.

          -  Taking medications known to affect drug metabolism via the CYP3A4, CYP2C9, or CYP2D6
             pathways.

          -  History of blood clots (i.e. pulmonary embolism, DVTs).

          -  Concurrent use of anticoagulants (i.e. Coumadin/warfarin).
