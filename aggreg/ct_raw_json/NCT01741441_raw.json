To date, few studies have evaluated functional\n      outcome after LTF in patients with MR or WAR, with the majority reporting only short-term\n      results.\n\n      It has been shown that delayed gastric emptying (DGE) might also be an important factor for\n      abdominal distension and adverse outcome after LTF.9,10 However, the correlation between\n      poor long-term outcome after LTF and DGE is controversial. In addition, the effect of DGE in\n      patients with MR or WAR is poorly investigated."
