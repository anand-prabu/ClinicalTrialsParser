      When intravitreal bevacizumab injection is given before vitrectomy for proliferative
      diabetic retinopathy (PDR), a low dose of 1.25 mg/0.05 ml is considered sufficient. In a
      pilot study, we found that an even lower dose of 0.16 mg/0.05 ml achieved therapeutic
      efficacy (Hattori T, et al. Retina 2010). In the present prospective, double-blind,
      randomized, controlled study, we verified the usefulness of 0.16 mg/0.05 ml of intravitreal
      bevacizumab (IVB) given one day before vitrectomy.Ayumu Manabe, MD funded this study and he
      is a main connector.

    <textblock>
      Early postoperative hemorrhage in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) patients is a
      major complication. Intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      has reported to reduce vitreous hemorrhage. Recently, numerous reports have shown the
      efficacy of reducing neovascularization activity before vitrectomy by preoperative
      intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents. When intravitreal bevacizumab injection is used
      as an adjunct therapy, a shortterm effect is needed. Because it is reported some adverse
      events caused by bevacizumab injection. Hattori et al reported intravitreal injection of
      0.16mg/0.05ml bevacizumab in PDR patients marked blockage of intravitreal VEGF
      concentrations in the pilot study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate low dose of
      intravitreal bevacizumab as a preoperative adjunct therapy reduce the postoperative vitreous
      hemorrhage. This study involves PDR patients who underwent vitrectomy between May 2012 and
      August 2013 at Surugadai Hospital of Nihon University. The risks to participants are
      accompanied by the intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (especially the possibility of
      endophthalmitis and thromboembolic events).

      Between June 2012 and August 2013, one investigator (AM) randomized PDR patients with an
      indication for primary 25-gauge vitrectomy into a sham group and an IVB group. One day after
      injection, three surgeons except AM conducted the surgeries. Vitreous samples were collected
      at the start of surgery, and intraoperative and postoperative complications were evaluated.
