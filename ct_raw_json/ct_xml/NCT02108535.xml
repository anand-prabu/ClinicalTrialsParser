  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The evidence is insufficient to determine whether the types of dressings containing silver
      differ as the time/proportion to complete healing of the wound and pain. We will analyse
      cost-effectiveness of these dressings in outpatients, considering the service provided by
      the National Public Health System.

      Clinical trial, controlled, randomized, containing two parallel arms, the single center.

      Adult patients between 18 and 65 years, regardless of sex, with second degree burns treated
      in an outpatient setting without the need for surgical treatment will be randomized (1:1)
      into two groups: silver sulfadiazine 1% on healing and the base nanocrystalline silver.
      Primary endpoints include time to complete epithelialization of the wound / proportion of
      lesions completely epithelialized over a period (15 days) specified time and change the
      surface area of the lesion with the passage of time / proportion of lesions epithelialized
      part in a specified period of time (15 days). Secondary outcomes include the number of
      dressing changes and the level of pain associated with your application and removal; direct
      medical costs and non-medical, need for surgery, incidence of infection and presence of
      adverse events.

    <description>Flexible polyester low-grip coated nanocrystalline silver dressing. The dressing was applied to the lesion after being soaked in sterile distilled water. About this compresses to bandage movements will have been added and comes to avoid tourniquet bandage on-site maintenance, temperature of the affected area, cushioning and absorption of wound exudate when present. Is finished with the application of crepe bandages in the form of flakes containment curative and maintenance of pressure. This procedure aids in the bloodstream, and avoids the increased edema. The bandage is started from the periphery to the central region, avoiding tourniquet. The exchanges were performed every three days.</description>

    <description>Ranges for rayon containing cream 1% silver sulphadiazine were used. Involving this layer bandages for dressings were added in movements back and forth to avoid the tourniquet, providing maintenance of the temperature of the affected area, cushioning and absorption of wound exudate when present. This application was completed with crepe bandages to contain the dressing and maintain pressure. This procedure aids in the bloodstream, and avoids the increased edema. The bandage is started from the periphery to the central region, scales, avoiding the tourniquet. Dressing changes were performed daily.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults between 18 and 65 years, regardless of sex and race, were included in the
             study when they had second degree burns (partial thickness), ie, involving the
             epidermis and part of the dermis, with at least the preservation of some dermal
             appendages from of which the wound may possibly be epithelialized spontaneously
             (ARTZ; Moncrief; PRITT, 1980) that required treatment in an outpatient setting
             without the need for surgical debridement of devitalized tissue and skin
             grafts-informed in the initial clinical diagnosis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - We excluded patients with diabetes, pregnant women, mentally disabled, with burns to the
        face or face and hands before the planting of the feet, as it was felt that there is need
        for specific treatment to prevent functional sequelae. Patients who have already started
        treatment at other institutions, those who arrived after the 5th day of the burn or unable
        to sign the consent form or who declined to participate.
