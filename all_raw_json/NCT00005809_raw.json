Compare retrospectively the accuracy of computerized tomographic colonography\n      (CTC) vs pathology and colonoscopy in the detection of clinically important colorectal\n      neoplasia, defined as at least one proven lesion with a diameter measuring at least 1 cm.\n      II. Compare the physician image display preferences and interpretation time across three\n      viewing platforms for CTC images.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a retrospective, multicenter study. Radiologists evaluate each patient's\n      optimal diagnostic computerized tomographic colonography (CTC) data. Patients' CTC findings\n      are evaluated by a radiologist at a central facility using an imaging display software\n      platform from General Electric, Vital Images, or the Mayo Clinic. CTC findings are compared\n      with conventional colonoscopy findings and pathologic analysis. A comparison is made between\n      physician image display preferences and interpretation time across three viewing platforms\n      for CTC images.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients will be accrued for this study."
