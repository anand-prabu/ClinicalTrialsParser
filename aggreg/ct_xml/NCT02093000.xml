  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, single arm, non-interventional study will investigate the
      effectiveness of Avastin monotherapy for patients with lung adenocarcinoma who previously
      received 4 to 6 cycles of induction platinum doublet plus Avastin. The study is expected to
      last approximately 34 months.
