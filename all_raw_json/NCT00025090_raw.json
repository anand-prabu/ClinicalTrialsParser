Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or\n      die. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet\n      known if fluorouracil plus radiation therapy is more effective with or without additional\n      chemotherapy in treating anal cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of fluorouracil plus\n      radiation therapy with or without additional chemotherapy in treating patients who have\n      primary anal cancer."

Patients are randomized to one\n      of four treatment arms.\n\n      All patients undergo radiotherapy daily 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks. All patients also\n      receive fluorouracil IV continuously over days 1-4 and 29-32.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive mitomycin IV on day 1.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive cisplatin IV on days 1 and 29.\n\n        -  Arm III: Patients receive mitomycin as in arm I and maintenance therapy comprising\n           fluorouracil IV continuously over days 1-4 and cisplatin IV on day 1 beginning 4-8\n           weeks after completion of primary therapy and repeating once 3 weeks later.\n\n        -  Arm IV: Patients receive cisplatin as in arm II and maintenance therapy as in arm III.\n\n      Patients are followed at 2 months, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years,\n      and then annually thereafter.\n\n      Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 600 patients (150 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
