The TAP block has been recommended and shown in case reports, but not clinically studied with trials, for patients on methadone or buprenorphine, to improve post-operative pain control.  A long active local anesthetic, called ropivacaine, will be used to provide this anesthesia."

One study revealed equal analgesic efficiency, higher patient satisfaction scores, and less side effects with patient controlled epidural ropivacaine compared to epidural morphine (Chen).   This is an especially attractive option for opioid dependent patients, but like the TAP block, has been not studied whether or not it lessens acute or chronic postoperative cesarean section, in the setting or in the absence of neuraxial opioids."

            "textblock": "More and more women are on buprenorphine or methadone during pregnancy for a history of\n      opioid addiction.  Currently, pain control after cesarean section for women already on these\n      medications, if they need operative delivery, is a challenge due to the pharmacology of\n      those drugs.  They have higher pain scores and 45-47% higher opiates requirement.  To\n      improve pain control, some unique regional anesthesia techniques have been employed, besides\n      opioid and non-opioid medication management through the oral, intravenous, and/or neuraxial\n      (spinal or epidural) route.  One is a TAP block ( transversus abdominis plane block), a\n      regional anesthesia procedure in which long acting local anesthetic, such as ropivacaine, is\n      injected on both sides of the patient's abdomen to numb the nerves supplying the abdominal\n      wall, or the surgical site.  Another is a patient - controlled epidural, a small flexible\n      catheter that is inserted in the back into the epidural space near the spine, which bathes\n      the spinal nerve roots with long acting local anesthetic, such as bupivacaine, and with an\n      opioid, such as fentanyl, to numb the nerves going to the surgical site.  Through an\n      epidural pump, the patient receives a continuous infusion of local anesthetic and can\n      delivery more medication as needed through a bolus feature.  There have case reports, or\n      case by case accounts, of these techniques, and it is suspected these techniques result in\n      better pain control with minimal side effects.  No clinical, human or animal, has evaluated\n      these techniques in a controlled and through manner, either comparing the two techniques to\n      each other or comparing them to the common care of opioid and non-opioid medication\n      management through the oral, intravenous, and/or neuraxial route, including neuraxial\n      hydromorphone or morphine."
