      Comparison between different treatments of obesity in the short and medium term:
      prescriptive diet therapy compared to  to cognitive-behavioral  approach in the treatment of
      obesity according to the method of clinical trial.

      According to  the Italian guidelines on obesity, the target to reach is the weight loss of
      10% compared to the initial weight, obtained in six months and maintained for the next 5
      years.

      The guideline considers six months as the time required to lose weight, but many patients
      are not able to achieve this result. Since in clinical practice many patients fail to
      achieve this weight loss in six months, it was decided to extend to 12 months the time to
      reach the target. As an intermediate goal it has been proposed to achieve a weight loss of
      at least 5% on respect of the basal weight in six months.

      The hypotheses to be tested is that the addition of a short CBT, as it can be applied in a
      public outpatients, is able to improve the percentage of responders and to raise the
      proportion of subjects able to maintain the result over time.
