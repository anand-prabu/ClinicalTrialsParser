  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hatha Yoga is a traditional practice that encompasses aerobic exercise, breathing
      techniques, and meditation. It is used in India since centuries to improve well-being and
      cope with diseases and is gaining more and more interest in Europe and the US. While studies
      have demonstrated benefits of Hatha Yoga for patients with breast cancer, no studies on
      patients with colorectal cancer are available yet. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate the effect of Hatha Yoga in patients with colorectal cancer.
