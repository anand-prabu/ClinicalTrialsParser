The FDA approved regimen for the treatment of AK is application\n      of 250 mg of cream twice a week for 16 weeks to a 25-cm2 area. In 2011, a lower strength\n      imiquimod cream, Zyclara (imiquimod) Cream, 2.5% was approved by the FDA. When used for the\n      treatment of AK, Zyclara is applied for a shorter duration and in an expanded treatment area\n      (e.g., face or scalp) in comparison to Aldara\u00ae.  This study will be conducted in compliance\n      with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the applicable regulatory\n      requirement(s).  Marketed by Medicis, Zyclara\u00ae (imiquimod) cream 2.5% is a safe and\n      effective topical therapy for the treatment of actinic keratosis of the face and scalp.\n      Actavis has developed a generic formulation of imiquimod 2.5% cream and the current study is\n      designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this formulation."
