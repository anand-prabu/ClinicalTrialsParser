The study consists of a screening period, a 9-day\n      treatment period (with 5 days of actual medication intake) and a 4-week follow-up period.\n      The patients will be divided over 4 panels of 10 patients each that will be initiated\n      sequentially. In each panel patients will receive JNJ-47910382 or placebo during 5\n      consecutive days. JNJ-47910382 or placebo will be administered once daily or twice daily.\n      Within each panel, 5 patients of genotype-1a and 5 patients of genotype-1b will be enrolled.\n      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive active treatment or placebo in such a way that\n      4 patients of each genotype receive active treatment and 1 subject of each genotype receives\n      placebo. The pharmacokinetic profile of JNJ-47910382 will be assessed in each panel. HCV RNA\n      kinetics (HCV RNA level) and HCV resistance will be studied and biomarkers at the messenger\n      RNA (mRNA), protein and cell level will be explored. The entire study duration for each\n      participant will be approximately four weeks."
