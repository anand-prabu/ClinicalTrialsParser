The second aim is to detect differences in hepatic gene expression\n      (messenger RNA, mRNA) and epigenetic regulation (micro RNA, miRNA) between patients with SS\n      or NASH and healthy controls, in addition to determine in patients with non-alcoholic fatty\n      liver disease (SS+NASH combined) whether there is an association between hepatic n-3 PUFA\n      content and gene expression.

Fat accumulation in the liver\n      is likely due to variable degrees of disordered fatty-acid metabolism and insulin resistance\n      (IR).  Liver steatosis, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the liver,\n      increases lipid peroxidation and is associated with a reduction in the antioxidant defense\n      system. This oxidative stress can lead to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines\n      (TNF-\u03b1, transforming growth factor-beta) contributing to the development of steatohepatitis\n      and fibrosis.TNF-\u03b1 - may further contribute to IR. In addition, changes in fatty acid\n      composition within the liver may influence lipid metabolism and inflammation. In particular,\n      n-3 PUFA have an effect on the insulin sensitivity, transcription of antioxidant genes,\n      inflammatory response and production of reactive oxygen species. Differences might be seen\n      on the gene expression level (mRNA) and also in epigenetic regulation (miRNA).\n\n      Microbiota composition might influence energy metabolism, and inflammatory tone and IR\n      through increased endotoxemia and therefore could also play a role in the development of\n      NAFLD."
