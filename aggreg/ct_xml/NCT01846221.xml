  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidural analgesia has proven to be an effective method for severe pain relief associated
      with labor and delivery. During labor, a low dose continuous infusion of local anesthetic
      and narcotic will be administered through an epidural catheter. As labor progresses and the
      baby's head makes it way through the pelvis, breakthrough pain may emerge and often needs
      further treatment. The investigators provide pain relief by administering analgesics through
      the epidural catheter.

      The patient will be randomly assigned to receive one of two medication mixtures believed to
      be successful in treating this type of pain associated with advanced labor. After this
      initial treatment, if pain relief is not attained, the patient may receive the other
      medication as well. The medications used in this study have been used at this institution
      for some time and have been found to be safe for mother and baby. The opioid (fentanyl) dose
      is small and only a small fraction will be transmitted to the baby. The other medication
      (clonidine) better known as a blood pressure medication has also been used for pain relief.
      Studies and clinical experience have shown that clonidine when given epidurally in the doses
      used in this study has minimal if any effect on the blood pressure of the mother or of the
      baby. The investigators will record medical and obstetric history and labor progress
      relevant to the patient. The patient will be asked questions regarding labor pain and side
      effects before and after the analgesic is administered.

      The primary objective is to determine which treatment regimen is more successful in
      abolishing breakthrough pain in advanced labor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidural analgesia is a popular choice among patients for relief of severe pain associated
      with labor and delivery.

      Currently, at the investigators' institution the investigators use a continuous infusion of
      low dose local anesthetic and narcotic (12 ml/hr of 0.0625% bupivacaine with 2 micrograms/ml
      fentanyl) after the initial spinal or epidural dose to maintain patient comfort until
      delivery. This dose of the infusion is chosen because it often provides adequate comfort
      without interfering with the mobility of the patient and her ability to effectively push
      during delivery. However, this low-dose epidural infusion strategy often results in
      recurrence of pain after an initial pain-free period. This recurring pain is known as
      breakthrough pain and is alleviated by administering small boluses of analgesics via the
      epidural catheter.

      The pain occurring in labor is initially of visceral origin and is mediated by pain fibers
      originating from the low thoracic and upper lumbar segments of the spinal cord. As labor
      progresses to the late first phase (also known as transitional stage), pain sensations
      originating from the distension of the pelvic floor, vagina and perineum adds a somatic
      component to labor pain. This type of breakthrough pain, mediated by nerve fibers
      originating from the sacral nerves at dermatomes S2-S4, is often difficult to treat.
      Patients may experience inadequate analgesia even after boluses of analgesics are
      administered. Inadequate analgesia is deleterious due to subjective discomfort with its
      associated neurohumoral and physiological changes, and can be an initiator of the urge to
      bear down (push). Pushing before complete dilation of the cervix may lead to swelling,
      cervical injury and premature exhaustion of the mother. Adequate pain control will allow the
      cervix to fully dilate and motivate the mother to push effectively at the appropriate time.

      Although requests from patients to alleviate late stage breakthrough pain are common, there
      are no established data in the literature regarding the most effective strategy for pain
      management in this stage of labor.

      This study is designed to compare the efficacy of two treatments for controlling late first
      stage breakthrough pain during labor: clonidine-bupivacaine versus fentanyl-bupivacaine.
      Both strategies are used at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) in this clinical
      situation, and there is no clear evidence whether one is superior.
