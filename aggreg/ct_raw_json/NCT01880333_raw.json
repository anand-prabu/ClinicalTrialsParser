Modified Atkins diet is of special importance\n      in resource constraint settings with paucity of trained dieticians.  However, there is\n      paucity published data on the use of the modified Atkins diet in refractory epilepsy in\n      young children. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the modified\n      Atkins diet in refractory epilepsy in young children."
