  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, randomized, single-blinded, placebo controlled trial will examine the
      safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a polyurethane tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)
      vaginal ring when used continuously for 14 consecutive days.

      The primary objective is to assess the safety of TDF vaginal rings when used continuously
      for 14 days by healthy, HIV-uninfected, sexually abstinent women, as compared with a placebo
      vaginal ring.
