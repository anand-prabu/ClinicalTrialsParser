Recurrent C. difficile infection is meant as the reappearance\n      of clinical symptoms and positivity of C. difficile toxin test within 8 weeks after the end\n      of the previous therapy. Patients' stool will be screened for detection of parasites and\n      enteric bacterial pathogens to exclude other infective pathogens. Patients with severe\n      clinical features (sepsis, severe dehydration, major co-morbidities), former colectomy,\n      high-risk of endoscopic complications, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), irritable bowel\n      syndrome (IBS), viral hepatitis, AIDS or syphilis will be excluded.\n\n      Patients will be instructed and invited to signal recurrent symptoms and diarrhea after\n      treatment. Monthly clinical and lab checks will be performed for a period of six months\n      after the treatment.\n\n      Treatment procedures:\n\n      All patients will start therapy with vancomycin for four days before of stratification, with\n      random allocation (1 to 1) to one of the two treatment schemes: 1) FMT, with the infusion in\n      the cecum - through the biopsy channel - of 60-120 gr (depending on production) of donated\n      feces, obtained from the donor within 6 hours from transplantation, and manually homogenized\n      in 100/200 ml of physiological solution; or 2) standard vancomycin-based therapy according\n      to the international recommendations. Colonoscopy will be performed by an expert\n      endoscopist, with mucosal biopsy (when possible) for histology examination. Patients\n      allocated to FMT arm will undergo preparation for colonoscopy  (four liters of a solution\n      with saline laxatives). All patient will be instructed on hygiene rules to be followed at\n      the patient's domicile to avoid re-infections at home. Stool donors should preferably be\n      patient's relatives or intimates, must not have taken antibiotics in the last 6 months,\n      should not present significant intestinal symptoms of other intestinal diseases and must\n      result negative at the serum screening for viral hepatitis, AIDS or syphilis. Their stool\n      will be tested for C. difficile, enteric bacteria, intestinal protozoa and helminthes\n      pathogens."
