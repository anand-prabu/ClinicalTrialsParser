The initial dose was reduced to 9 mg/m2 if the preinfusion white-blood-cell count was 3.0-3.99 \u00d7109/L,and to 6 mg/m2 if the white-blood-cell count was 2.0-2.99 \u00d7109/L. No infusion if the white-blood-cell count was less than 2.0\u00d7109/L. The initial dose was reduced to 10 mg/m2 for nonhaematological toxic effects of WHO grade 2-3. Subsequent dose after 3 month was reduced to 10 mg/m2 for infections that occurred within 3 weeks of a previous infusion accompanied by a white-blood-cell count below 2\u00d7109/L, or to 8 mg/m2 for infections accompanied by white-blood-cell count of less than 1\u00d7109/L."
