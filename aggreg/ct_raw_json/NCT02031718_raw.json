For this study, the virtual coach will consist of online\n      videos aimed at providing acne education and promoting behaviors that support healthy skin.\n      The use of Web-based technologies and virtual coaching in acne-related patient education is\n      novel, and may significantly improve clinical outcomes and quality of life in acne patients.\n      We hypothesize that an interactive Internet-based education and counseling program will be\n      more effective than Internet-based education alone in improving clinical outcomes and\n      quality of life in acne patients."
