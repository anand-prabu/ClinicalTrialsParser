The\n      Triple A Initiative Study is designed to improve the coordination of care for patients with\n      acute dyspnea alerting the Emergency Medical Service (EMS). We hypothesize that the\n      coordination of care starting at the EMS level including point-of-care testing of the\n      cardiac biomarker NTproBNP will support preclinical and clinical diagnostic clarification.\n      Treatment deriving from earlier diagnostic clarification will reduce length of stay in the\n      hospital, treatment costs and improve patient's outcome."
