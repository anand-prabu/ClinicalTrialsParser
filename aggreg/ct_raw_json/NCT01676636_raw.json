Once\n      the powder is developed, it can be incorporated into various oral delivery vehicles. The\n      overall effectiveness of a micronutrient program is highly dependent on the acceptance and\n      regular consumption of supplements (i.e., adherence) by the targeted users. This is a study\n      of the preference, acceptability, and palatability of 4 alternative delivery vehicles for\n      the innovative prenatal multiple micronutrient supplement: traditional tablets, oral\n      disintegrating tablets, unflavoured powder with a suspension agent, and flavoured powder\n      with a suspension agent. This study will be conducted in Dhaka, Bangladesh. This study\n      hypothesizes that that the formulation of the delivery vehicle will impact preference,\n      acceptability, and palatability."
