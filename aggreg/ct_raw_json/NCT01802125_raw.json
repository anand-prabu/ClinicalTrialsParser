To determine what proportion of unclassifiable sarcomas are unclassifiable because the\n      initial evaluation was not sufficiently comprehensive versus what proportion can be regarded\n      as \"true\" undifferentiated sarcoma when a comprehensive assessment has been performed.\n\n      II. To develop formal diagnostic criteria for establishing the diagnosis of undifferentiated\n      sarcoma.\n\n      III. To determine whether undifferentiated sarcoma can be subdivided into separate and\n      distinct pathologic entities that are distinguishable by light microscopy,\n      immunohistochemistry, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array profiling, or clinical\n      features.\n\n      IV. To determine whether undifferentiated sarcomas with specific \"actionable mutations\" can\n      be identified based on their histologic appearance, immunohistochemical staining\n      characteristics, or SNP array profiling features.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Tissue samples are analyzed for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and SNP array profiling using\n      microarray and immunohistochemistry."
