  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine in a randomized trial whether it is possible to
      decrease the discomfort of mammography by using the analgesic ibuprofen, or by using a
      scripted, supportive text informing patients about mammography.

      This study is designed to evaluate two methods of reducing pain and discomfort caused by
      mammography, one of the barriers to the procedure.

    <description>The Primary outcome measure will be the response to question 1 of the post-mammogram questionnaire: 'How painful was today's mammogram?' [O-no hurt, 1-hurts a little bit, 2-hurts a little more, 3-hurts even more, 4-hurts a whole lot, 5-hurts worst].  The response to question 2, 'Was the amount of pain you experienced something that might make you reluctant to return for your next mammogram?' [yes, no] will be of secondary interest. The response to question 5 of the pre-mammogram questionnaire: 'How painful do you expect today's mammogram to be?' [O-no hurt, 1-hurts a little bit, 2-hurts a little more, 3-hurts even more, 4-hurts a whole lot, 5-hurts worst] will be used for statistical adjustment and to compute a change score as described in the protocol.</description>
