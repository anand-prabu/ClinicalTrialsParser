  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of fibrin sealant (FS) Grifols in
      patients undergoing open surgical procedures where bleeding may be present on parenchymous
      tissue (e.g., solid abdominal organs such as the liver). The purpose of this study is to
      demonstrate that FS Grifols is not inferior to commercially-available oxidized cellulose
      pads (Surgicel®) in providing benefit in the time to hemostasis (i.e, the stoppage of
      bleeding). This study has a Preliminary Part (I) for study teams to become familiar with the
      application of FS Grifols and a Primary Part (II) to assess the safety and efficacy of FS
      Grifols. In both parts of the study, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either FS
      Grifols or Surgicel.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 9.0 g/dL at Baseline (within 24 hours prior to surgical
             procedure).

          -  Require elective (non-emergency), open (non-laparoscopic), hepatic resection
             (anatomic or non-anatomic resections of at least one anatomical hepatic segment, or
             equivalent tissue volume).

          -  A target bleeding site can be identified.

          -  Target bleeding site is identified on the cut raw liver surface (resection area).

          -  Target bleeding site has moderate bleeding according to the Investigator's judgment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Require hepatic resection due to trauma.

          -  Infection in the anatomic surgical area.

          -  History of severe (e.g. anaphylactic) reactions to blood or to any blood-derived
             product.

          -  Previous known sensitivity to any FS Grifols component or any Surgicel® component.

          -  Females who are pregnant or nursing a child at Baseline (within 24 hours prior to
             surgical procedure).

          -  Receiving an organ transplant during the same surgical procedure.

          -  Undergone a therapeutic surgical procedure within 30 days from the screening visit.

          -  A target bleeding site cannot be identified.

          -  The target bleeding site has a mild or severe bleeding.

          -  Occurrence of major intraoperative complications that require resuscitation or
             deviation from the planned surgical procedure.

          -  Application of any topical haemostatic material on the resection surface of the liver
             prior to application of study treatment.

          -  Radiofrequency precoagulation of the liver resection surface, except focal use of
             radiofrequency as primary haemostatic treatment.
