Evaluate the safety, tolerance, and potential efficacy of 3 doses of human\n      anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV) monoclonal antibody SDZ MSL-109 (MOAB MSL-109) in the treatment\n      of newborns with congenital CMV infection and no central nervous system disease.\n\n      II.  Determine the relationship between plasma concentrations of MOAB MSL-109 and\n      therapeutic outcome.\n\n      III.  Determine whether MOAB MSL-109 influences the antibody response and clearance of virus\n      from the urine."
