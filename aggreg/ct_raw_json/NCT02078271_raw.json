            "textblock": "WHO has urged all developing countries to develop programmes to improve\n      complementary-feeding (CF) practices because of their importance for optimal growth,\n      development and health of infants and young children  While supplementation programmes\n      and/or highly-fortified \"super-foods\" have limited success in improving CF-practices in\n      disadvantaged environments, population-specific food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG), based\n      on locally-available foods and requires minimal changes to local food pattern, will enhance\n      the chances of programme success.\n\n      Our previous study was able to identify the need for, potential and finally develop FBDG for\n      CF of 6-8mo and 9-11mo infants using combined linear-and-goal programming approach (LP\n      approach). This research is therefore being made to support the next phase of the study i.e.\n      to assess the efficacy of FBDG, for improving CF/dietary-practices and growth in <24mo\n      children (window of opportunity). As growth and development is inter-related, home-based\n      stimulation will be included in this trial to see the effect on child development. While\n      studies have shown that stimulation at early age benefits children through their late\n      adolescence; evidence from Indonesia is lacking. This study therefore aims to see the effect\n      on growth and development of community trial using food-based dietary guideline and\n      stimulation. It is expected that findings from this study will provide scientific evidence\n      as the basis for program formulation."
