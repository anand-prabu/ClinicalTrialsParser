  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucose oxidase is a hydrogen peroxide producing enzyme, which also is present in honey.
      Human rhinoviruses are sensitive to the action of hydrogen peroxide, which is documented in
      laboratory studies.

      In the present study we aim to investigate if a nasal spray with glucose oxidase could treat
      a common cold, when the treatment is started even after the onset of the symptoms. The study
      is randomized and placebo controlled.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persons that are convinced of that they have caught an episode of common cold can be
      included into the study within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms.

      Before they start the treatment with the nasal spray they perform a viral sample from the
      nose and also fill in the WURSS-21 protocol. After this the persons spray with glucose
      oxidase+glucose/only saline+glucose 5 times the first day and thereafter 3 times daily for a
      total treatment of one week. Every day the included persons fill in the WURSS-21 protocol.

    <description>Symptoms of a common cold, recorded in a home protocol (WURSS21) daily for 7 days is used as evaluation method of the treatment.Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Score (WURSS-21)is a validated protocol for assessing symptoms of a common cold. We are using this protocol at start, before the persons in the study start their treatment and thereafter every day for the next 7 days, while they use the nasal spray(glucose oxidase+saline and glucose or only saline+glucose). The outcome measure is predominantly calculated as &quot;the sum of all symptoms&quot; in the WURSS-21 protocol.</description>
