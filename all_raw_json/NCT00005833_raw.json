Assess the time\n      to treatment failure and survival of these patients with this treatment regimen. III.\n      Determine the frequency and severity of toxicities of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral R115777 twice daily on days\n      1-21. Treatment continues every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study over 5-7 months."
