Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy and kill more\n      tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy and autologous\n      peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients with recurrent or persistent\n      epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer."

Following\n      induction therapy, peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested. After patients receive\n      high dose paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy, a portion of the PBSC are reinfused. When\n      patients recover from the paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy the administration of\n      topotecan and etoposide phosphate begins. Topotecan is administered, as a 72 hour continuous\n      infusion, according to a dose escalation schedule with a fixed dose of etoposide phosphate.\n      A second portion of PBSC are reinfused after topotecan/etoposide phosphate chemotherapy. A\n      course of thiotepa is given along with the final portion of PBSC after treatment with\n      topotecan and etoposide phosphate.\n\n      Dose escalation of topotecan continues until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.\n      The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 or more patients experience dose\n      limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and every 4 months thereafter to determine\n      progression free and overall survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25-30 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of\n      this study, and 25 more patients will be accrued for the phase II portion."
