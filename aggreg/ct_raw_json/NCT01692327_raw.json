After the fat overload, we hypothesized that there will be a worsening of\n      endothelial function and microvascular reactivity in OB/DM2 and OB group compared to C, but\n      also find lower concentrations of incretins in OB/DM2 group compared to other groups.\n\n      These hypotheses may be confirmed by techniques for evaluating microvascular function, the\n      use of DFT skin for vasomotion evaluation and finally analysis of analytes through metabolic\n      and cardiovascular read by Multiplex kit."
