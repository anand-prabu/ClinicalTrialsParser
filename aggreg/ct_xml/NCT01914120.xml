      The goal of this study is assess the quality of life of advanced non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) patients who are undergoing first-line chemotherapy, analyze the current status and
      tendency of quality of life (QOL). The method is to use the Functional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy-Lung (FACT-L) scales, assess the quality of life before the chemotherapy, after 1st
      cycle of chemotherapy and after 2nd cycle. After 3 time-points, investigators analyze all
      the subscales and constructs of FACT-L. The assumption is the quality of life will be better
      after 2 cycle of chemotherapy.

      1. Lung cancer is the most deadly cancer in the world, 85% lung cancer are non-small cell
           lung cancer (NSCLC). The quality of life of NSCLC patients become more and more
           important, because of most NSCLC is incurable.

        2. The recruitment will take place in 20 center all over the country and 500 patients will
           enrolled.
