Patients\n      are stratified according to participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2\n      treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral megestrol twice daily for 1 year.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive an oral placebo twice daily for 1 year. Quality of life is\n           assessed at baseline and then monthly for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 300 patients (200 for arm I and 100 for arm II) will be\n      accrued for this study."
