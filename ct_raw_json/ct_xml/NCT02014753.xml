      stent in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients by optical coherence tomography (OCT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI)
      patients with elevated cardiac troponin, XIENCE PRIME/Xpedition, a current standard
      drug-eluting stent (DES), and MULTI-LINK 8, a bare-metal stent with the same design as
      XIENCE PRIME/Xpedition, were randomly allocated in the ratio of 1:1, to compare the vessel
      response of the stented segment by optical coherence tomography (OCT), and to clarify the
      mechanisms of action and characteristics of these stents in AMI patients with elevated
      cardiac troponin. OCT observation timing was also randomly allocated in 2-weeks and 4-weeks
      after stent implantation.
