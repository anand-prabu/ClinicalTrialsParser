The primary end point is 20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology\n      criteria (ACR-20) at week 24. Comparing CHS-0214 to Enbrel for efficacy and safety.\n\n      Pt. 2 is an open-label single arm study in which patients with at least an ACR-20 response\n      receive CHS-0214. Continued response and safety will be evaluated."
