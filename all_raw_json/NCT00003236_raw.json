Estimate the proportion of women with previously treated metastatic breast\n      cancer who are progression free at 4 months after receiving ISIS 5132 or ISIS 3521. II.\n      Determine duration of response to these treatment regimens in this patient population. III.\n      Evaluate toxicities and tolerability of these treatment regimens in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to\n      number of prior therapies for metastatic breast cancer (1 vs 2). Patients are randomized to\n      one of two treatment arms. (Arm I closed 12/22/99) Arm I: Patients receive ISIS 5132 IV\n      continuously over 21 days. (closed 12/22/99) Arm II: Patients receive ISIS 3521 IV\n      continuously over 21 days. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. After every 2 courses, patients are evaluated for\n      response. Patients are followed every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months the\n      next 3 years, then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 68 patients (34 per arm) will be accrued in this study (Arm\n      I closed 12/22/99)."
