  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our knowledge on the genetic mutations in cancer is rapidly expanding and we are
      increasingly testing drugs in mainly metastatic cancer patient populations with rare
      mutations. Successful examples of this new strategy are ALK inhibitors in ALK translocated
      NSCLC (less than 5% frequency) and EGFR inhibitors in EGFR mutant NSCLC (approximately 5%
      frequency). Selecting molecularly stratified patient populations for studies benefits the
      patient as it increases the odds of obtaining benefit from experimental treatment,
      especially in early clinical trials. Moreover it increases the speed and efficacy of drug
      development as signs of efficacy are picked up in earlier phases. Therefore, broad screening
      of molecular lesions in the tumors of patients that are being considered for participation
      in trials is crucial. This pre-selection increases our ability to perform several trials in
      parallel and thus include more patients in more meaningful trials. With the still dismal
      prognosis of patients with metastatic cancer, increasing the accrual rate to pivotal trials
      in selected patient populations is a key factor in improving prognosis.

      The advent of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) platforms enables us to probe a limited
      number of cancer related genes within 2-4 weeks. We have extensively piloted this approach
      and are now able to deliver clinically meaningful turn-around-times. This development
      enables us to use this technology to enrich clinical trials using targeted therapies for
      patients with specific mutations.

      We will obtain tumor biopsies of a metastatic or locally advanced lesion and a peripheral
      blood sample from all patients included in the trial; the biopsies to obtain information on
      the tumor related genetic mutations (mutational profile) and the blood samples to assess
      each patient's germline DNA background variation. As patients will be asked to undergo an
      invasive procedure it is important to address the potential safety issues. Review of the
      literature and our own experience show that tumor biopsies can be performed with only minor
      complications and acceptable risks. We will recruit patients with metastatic or locally
      advanced solid tumors from patients that can potentially be included in clinical trials.
