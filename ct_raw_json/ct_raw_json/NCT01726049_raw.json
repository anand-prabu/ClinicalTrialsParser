            "textblock": "Rationale: Treatment of diastolic left heart failure is a challenging task. Compared to\n      systolic left heart failure the level of evidence for known medical treatment regiments is\n      low. Sildenafil, a PDE 5 inhibitor and effective therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension\n      acts as a selective pulmonary vasodilator by inhibiting the impaired NO pathway. Reducing\n      the pulmonary vascular resistance would be the primary target by treatment of diastolic left\n      heart failure with PH. But clinical and hemodynamical studies to evaluatie the role of\n      Sildenafil in diastolic heart failure, also called heart failure with preserved ejection\n      fraction (HFpEF) with secondary pulmonary hypertension are lacking. Our hypothesis is that\n      Sildenafil decreases pulmonary artery pressure in patients with HFpEF and pulmonary\n      hypertension.\n\n      Objective: To investigate whether Sildenafil treatment results in a hemodynamic improvement\n      and in an improvement of exercise capacity in these patients.\n\n      Study design: single-center, prospective, randomized, placebo controlled study. Study\n      population: 52 patients with HFpEF and PH Intervention : One group receives three times\n      daily 20 mg Sildenafil for 2 weeks followed by three times daily 60 mg  Sildenafil for 10\n      weeks. The other group receives three times daily 20 mg of Placebo, followed by 3 times\n      daily 60 mg placebo.\n\n      Main study parameters/endpoints:\n\n      Primary objectives\n\n      1. To investigate whether Sildenafil treatment results in a reduction of pulmonary artery\n      pressure without decrease of CO in HFpEF patients with PH (investigated invasively by right\n      heart catheterisation) .\n\n      Secondary objectives\n\n        1. To investigate whether Sildenafil treatment results in a reduction of wedge pressure in\n           HFpEF patients.\n\n        2. To investigate whether Sildenafil treatment results in improvement of exercise capacity\n           in these patients ( defined as change in VO2max)"
