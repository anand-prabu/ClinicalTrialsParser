Subjects must be pre-adolescent without any signs of puberty (acc. to Tanner scale).\n\n          3. Subjects are in normal range for their age in height and weight. Weight and height\n             measurements should fall within the percentile range 3-97-% of normal values for age\n             according to Danish growth charts.\n\n          4. Known history of mild intermittent or persistent reversible asthma for \u2265 3 months\n             prior to the screening visit.\n\n          5.

Evidence of a clinically unstable disease, as determined by medical history, clinical\n             laboratory tests, and physical examination that, in the Investigator's opinion,\n             preclude entry into the study.  \"Clinically significant\" is defined as any disease\n             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the subject at risk through study\n             participation, or which would affect the outcome of the study.\n\n         10. No major surgery requiring general anesthesia for at least 3 months prior to the\n             screening visit.\n\n         11.

Significant, non-reversible active pulmonary disease (e.g. cystic fibrosis,\n             bronchiectasis, tuberculosis).\n\n         14. Subjects who have taken \u03b2- blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine\n             oxidase inhibitors, astemizole (Hismanal), quinidine type antiarrythmics, or potent\n             CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole within 1 week prior to the screening visit.\n\n         15. Current use of medications, other than those allowed in the protocol.\n\n         16. Current evidence of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to test medications or\n             components.\n\n         17. Receipt of an Investigational medicinal product within 30 days of the screening\n             visit."
