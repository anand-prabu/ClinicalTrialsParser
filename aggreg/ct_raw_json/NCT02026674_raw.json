Clinic-based\n      uroflowmetry has some flaws; the setting is artificial and often it is difficult to void at\n      the desired moment. Moreover, a single measurement of the voided parameters is a poor\n      representative of the patient condition due to high variability of the measured parameters.\n      Performing multiple Urofowmetry measurements provides representative and more accurate\n      results, in a more patient-friendly, cost effective method."
