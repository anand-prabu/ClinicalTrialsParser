The majority of allergic asthmatic patients have\n      reached concomitant ENT: the concept of \"one airway, one disease.\" Access to this material\n      of epithelial study in the different phenotypes of the disease appears to be crucial. Nasal\n      and bronchial epithelial tissues reveal essential differences in particular related to their\n      environment (remodeling less intense and a lower sensitivity to the virus in the nose), but\n      they nevertheless share many common cellular characteristics."
