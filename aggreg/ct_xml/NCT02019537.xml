        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Unilateral shoulder pain

          -  Symptomatic for &gt; 3months

          -  To be included in the study, participants are required to have a &amp; b.(mentioned
             below)

          -  a. Pain with one of the two tests

               -  Neer's sign: passive overpressure at full shoulder flexion with the scapula
                  stabilised

               -  Hawkins test: passive internal rotation at 90 degree of shoulder flexion in the
                  scapular plane and in progressive degree of horizontal adduction

          -  b. Pain with one of the two tests

               -  Painful arc: active shoulder abduction

               -  Jobe's test: The examiner passively elevates the patient's shoulder to 90
                  degrees of abduction with internal rotation. The examiner then applies a
                  downward pressure against the arm

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous subacromial injection in past 3 months

          -  History of shoulder dislocation, subluxation, fracture, breast cancer,
             cervical/shoulder/upper back surgery

          -  Isolated acromioclavicular joint pathology

          -  Full-thickness rotator cuff tears (evidenced by MR or ultrasonography)

          -  Symptomatic cervical spine disorders

          -  History of allergic adverse reactions to corticosteroid

          -  Unable to give informed consent to participate in the study

          -  Unable to come into the clinic for regular treatment over the course of the following
             month

             diagnosed fibromyalgia

          -  Concurrent bilateral shoulder pain

          -  Neurological abnormality

          -  Radiological findings: malignancy, osteoarthritis of the glenohumeral joint, skeletal
             abnormalities decreasing the subacromial space

          -  Presence of shoulder pain with limitation of both active and passive movements of the
             glenohumeral joint of  25% in at least 2 directions (abduction, flexion, external
             rotation, internal rotation), as compared with the contralateral shoulder or with
             normal values

          -  Diabetes mellitus

          -  Patients taking anticoagulants

          -  Pregnant, breastfeeding mothers

          -  Difficulty participating in data collection due to communication problem, serious
