    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I open-label, dose escalation trial to evaluate the use of Tice® BCG as a
      challenge for future assessment of in vivo TB immunity.  Subjects will be recruited from the
      target population reflecting the community at large at 2 VTEU sites.  It is anticipated that
      enrollment will occur over a 14-month period.  Subjects who provide informed consent will be
      considered for eligibility (screened), and up to 120 eligible, willing, healthy, HIV and TB
      uninfected subjects aged 18 to 45 years, inclusive, will be enrolled for study interventions
      and sequentially assigned to 1 of 4 dose groups.  Dose titrations of Tice® BCG from 2x10^6
      cfu to 16x10^6 cfu will be delivered intradermally in a dose escalation format to 4 groups
      of 30 subjects per dose group.

      This is a Phase I open-label, dose escalation trial to evaluate the use of Tice® BCG as a
      challenge for future assessment of in vivo TB immunity. Subjects will be recruited from the
      target population reflecting the community at large at 2 VTEU sites. It is anticipated that
      enrollment will occur over a 14-month period. Subjects who provide informed consent will be
      considered for eligibility (screened), and up to 120 eligible, willing, healthy, HIV and TB
      uninfected subjects aged 18 to 45 years, inclusive, will be enrolled for study interventions
      and sequentially assigned to 1 of 4 dose groups. Dose titrations of Tice® BCG from 2x10^6
      cfu to 16x10^6 cfu will be delivered intradermally in a dose escalation format to 4 groups
      of 30 subjects per dose group. In the first dose group, subjects will be immunized
      intradermally with a single dose of 2x10^6 cfu Tice® BCG. The Tice® BCG doses will be
      increased sequentially from 2x10^6 cfu to 4x10^6 cfu to 8x10^6 cfu to a maximum dose of
      16x10^6 cfu following assessment of safety and reactogenicity data from previous dose groups
      and sentinel subjects. Following administration of Tice® BCG, intradermal (ID) site
      reactions will be assessed for at least 30 minutes as well as by memory aid on a daily basis
      throughout the first 15 days.  Subjects will also return to the clinic on Days 22, 25, 29,
      32, 36, 39, 43, 46, 50, 53, and 57 to evaluate the ID challenge site, assess for
      lymphadenopathy if indicated based on review of interim medical history and clinical
      assessment, and review AEs/SAEs, concomitant medications and health status, and collect and
      dispose of returned biohazard materials.  A final clinic visit will be performed at
      approximately 3 months (Day 99) following administration of Tice® BCG to evaluate the ID
      challenge site, assess for lymphadenopathy if indicated based on review of interim medical
      history and clinical assessment, and review SAEs and health status. At approximately 6
      months (Day 181) following administration of Tice® BCG a telephone call will be performed to
      query for any SAEs that may have occurred since the last visit. Based on this information,
      subjects may be asked to return to the clinic to be evaluated. The duration of the study for
      each subject will be up to approximately 7 to 8 months. Primary Objectives:  1) Evaluate the
      safety of different doses of intradermal Tice® BCG for use as a human challenge model for
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. 2) Examine BCG shedding from intradermal challenge
      sites after administration of different doses of Tice® BCG in TB naive healthy subjects. 3)
      Evaluate the reproducibility of BCG shedding over time with both quantitative PCR and
      culture techniques. Parent protocol to sub-study 12-0096.
