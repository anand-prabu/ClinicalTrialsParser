The team maintains a focus on the whole person so that\n      non-medical as well as medical goals are established.  The care guide partners with patients\n      and caregivers to get the right support from within Allina, from their community, and from\n      the family's own strengths and assets.  As a result, patients and caregivers should feel\n      honored and supported in the process."
