      The aim of this Phase Ⅰ/Ⅱ study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dendritic cells
      (DCs) vaccine combined with cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells in patients with high-risk
      soft tissue sarcoma. Experimental recombinant adenovirus-transfected DCs, which engineered
      to express MUC1 and Survivin are used for DCs-based immunotherapy. Based on the results of
      our previously performed preclinical study with DCs vaccine combined with CIK cells, the
      investigators plan to perform the clinical trial.
