  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CANHelp Working Group Treatment Trials are part of a comprehensive research program
      carried out by the Canadian North Helicobacter pylori (CANHelp) Working Group, a
      collaborative team that links University of Alberta investigators with northern Canadian
      health authorities and community organizations. This research program uses a
      community-driven, participatory approach to investigate H. pylori infection in northern
      Aboriginal communities, with goals of characterizing the associated burden of disease and
      exchanging knowledge with community members and decision makers to identify effective
      solutions for reducing associated health risks. The treatment component involves a series of
      community-specific trials designed with community input and varying on the specific
      treatment regimens and number of treatment arms among other study details. For the
      participating communities, these treatment trials aim to:

        1. Estimate the effectiveness of alternate H. pylori treatment regimens to identify
           optimal regimens for the local setting

        2. Identify factors external to the treatment regimen that influence short- and long-term
           treatment success
