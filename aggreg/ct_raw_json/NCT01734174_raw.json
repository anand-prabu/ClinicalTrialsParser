Secondarily, we will also compare the 3D TEE assessment to the 2D TEE and TTE assessment, which is routinely performed simultaneously.  Last, we will compare this assessment to a third method of quantification of cardiac function via a pulmonary artery catheter using thermodilution."

The purpose of the study is to compare these two methods of\n      echocardiography and comparing them to the 2D TEE and TTE assessments, which are routinely\n      performed simultaneously.
