  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry Eye Syndrome (DES) is a common condition that affects approximately 20% of adults aged
      45 and older. Although several clinical tests for the diagnosis and monitoring of DES are
      available, currently no gold standard for the assessment of DES exists. It has, however,
      been hypothesized that the assessment of tear film osmolarity may be a new and promising
      approach of an objective and non-invasive method for diagnosis and monitoring of treatment
      success.

      Recently, a new commercially available instrument (TearLab®, OcuSens Inc, San Diego, USA)
      for the assessment of tear film osmolarity has been introduced. This instrument allows for
      the easy and non-invasive determination of tear film osmolarity. Unfortunately, no data
      about reproducibility are yet available. Consequently, the current study sets out to
      investigate the short time reproducibility of tear film osmolarity measurements using the
      TearLab® instrument.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with dry eye syndrome (DES):

          -  Men and Women aged between 45 and 80 years, with DES defined as a pathological
             Schirmer I test and / or a pathological break-up time test. Schirmer I test and break
             up time will be tested and analyzed according to the guidelines published in the
             Report of the International Dry EyeWorkShop (DEWS) 2007

          -  normal findings in the ophthalmic examination other than DES

        Healthy control group:

          -  Men and Women aged between 45 and 80 years,

          -  normal findings in the medical history and ophthalmic examination

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Abuse of drugs or alcoholic beverages
