            "textblock": "Urinary incontinence (UI) is defined as a complaint of involuntary leakage. Researches show\n      that 9%-72% women between age 17-79 are urinary incontinence, in which stress urinary\n      incontinence (SUI) is the most prevalent type of urinary incontinence. The morbidity rate of\n      UI through the world is 27.6%, which SUI take percentage of 50.Morbidity rate of UI in\n      Beijing is 46.5%,and among which 59.6% is SUI. Aging is a high risk for SUI, which will\n      increase morbidity rate of SUI. Totally, 61.9% women over 50 year-old have SUI. SUI is\n      defined as a complaint of involuntary leakage during sneezing or coughing, which make\n      patients embarrassed and can not attend social activity normally, decreasing the quality of\n      their lives. Attending social activity is very important for people's health, otherwise,\n      people will get a series of diseases, like osteoporosis, obesity, diabetes, hypertension,\n      coronary heart disease,etc The International Consultation on Urological Diseases recommended\n      pelvic floor muscle training as A level evidence treating simple mild and moderate stress\n      urinary incontinence, which curative rate varies 30% to 60%. But the length of treatment\n      should last at least 3 month. Therefore, patients' compliance is a key to the effectiveness.\n      While, electroacupuncture is verified as a better treatment for SUI, which length of\n      treatment is shorter than pelvic floor muscle training, and effective rate is over 80%,\n      showing potential advantages. Early clinical research show that electroacupuncture for SUI\n      is effective.\n\n      This subject is primary to compare effectiveness of electroacupuncture and pelvic floor\n      muscle training for SUI, and evaluate optimal efficiency of electroacupuncture for SUI. The\n      early clinical research is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a small sample, which\n      consists of two arms, electroacupuncture group and sham electroacupuncture group to value\n      difference of extent of SUI in 1h pad test after 4 weeks. The result indicates that\n      electroacupuncture is effective.\n\n      As a further study, this research is a large sample multicenter trial with two parallel arms\n      of  electroacupuncture group and pelvic floor muscle training group. The primary purpose is\n      to value effectiveness of electroacupuncture for SUI in aspect of frequency of leakage and\n      amount of leakage, comparing with pelvic floor muscle training.
