  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall hypothesis of this research study is that gluten intake alters intestinal
      barrier function in patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) diarrhea who also exhibit
      non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this hypothesis-generating, pilot study is to randomize (like the flip
      of a coin) patients who have Non Celiac Gluten Sensitivity to a 4-week Gluten-containing
      diet (GCD) or to a Gluten free diet (GFD).  The study will evaluate small bowel (SB)
      permeability functionally (2-sugar differential excretion), morphologically, using
      probe-based confocal laser to evaluate the small intestinal, as well as molecularly, using
      tight junction (TJ) messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in small bowel mucosa in response to the
      different diets.

    <description>Assessment of current diet and amount of gluten consumed will be determined by the dietitian and by means of a questionnaire at baseline. Subjects will have a 2-week run in period, in which they will continue or initiate a gluten free diet plan prepared by the dietitians.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Non celiac gluten sensitive patients with a functional bowel disorder

          2. Age 18 to 70 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Positive serum tissue transglutaminase (TTG)  Immunoglobulin A (IgA) positive or
             medical record of small bowel biopsy suggestive of celiac disease.

          2. Use of tobacco products within the past 6 months (since nicotine may affect
             intestinal permeability).

          3. Abdominal surgeries (except appendectomy, cholecystectomy and vaginal hysterectomy or
             tubal ligation)

          4. Use of Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs(NSAIDs) or aspirin within the past week
             (since Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) affect intestinal permeability).

          5. Use of oral corticosteroids within the previous 6 weeks.

          6. Ingestion of artificial sweeteners such as Splenda™ (sucralose), Nutrasweet ™
             (aspartame), lactulose or mannitol 2 days before the study tests begins, e.g., foods
             to be avoided are sugarless gums or mints and diet soda.

          7. Bleeding disorders or medications that increase risk of bleeding from mucosal
             biopsies.

          8. High anxiety or depression score (&gt;11 on each subscale) on the Hospital Anxiety
             Depression Score questionnaire.

          9. Known allergy to fluorescein.
