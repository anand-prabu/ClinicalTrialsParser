    <textblock>
      The VHA estimates that over 15,000 Veterans incur a stroke each year.  As the population of
      older Veterans grows, stroke will become an increasingly important problem to the VHA.
      Recovery of walking function is the most common goal of stroke survivors. The proposed study
      will test whether training with accurate walking tasks to engage the damaged supraspinal
      motor pathways is more effective than training with steady state walking.  The investigators
      expect that training accurate tasks will be more effective, thereby improving walking
      function of Veteran stroke survivors and reducing the burden of care placed on families and
      on the VHA.  Furthermore, this rehabilitation approach can be accomplished at comparable
      cost to existing rehabilitation approaches, which is important given that the VHA invests
      $88 million per year toward outpatient care, including physical rehabilitation, in the first
      six months after stroke.  This research also has implications for rehabilitation of other
      neurologically injured populations, including traumatic brain injury and incomplete spinal
      cord injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current approaches for rehabilitation of walking following stroke do not sufficiently
      restore mobility function. For instance, fewer than 50% of individuals with stroke-induced
      walking dysfunction recover the ability to walk independently in the community.  New
      breakthroughs in rehabilitation are needed that will target the motor impairments
      responsible for poor walking function in individuals post-stroke. Functional recovery can
      occur in response to task-specific neuroplasticity of damaged brain circuitry.  The
      corticospinal tract is an important target for neuroplasticity because it plays an important
      role for control of walking in humans.  Research has shown that, compared to steady state
      walking, accurate gait modification (ACC) tasks are a potent behavioral stimulus for
      activating the corticospinal tract. Therefore, the investigators propose that training with
      ACC tasks (e.g., obstacle crossing/avoidance, accurate foot placement, etc.) may be superior
      to training with steady state walking (SS) for eliciting corticospinal neuroplasticity and
      recovery of walking function.  Most rehabilitation paradigms have previously focused on SS
      training. This is largely because therapists consider it premature to progress to ACC tasks
      when persistent deficits of steady state walking still remain.  However, this reasoning
      might be counter-productive, because training only steady state walking may not sufficiently
      stimulate neuro-plasticity of the damaged corticospinal pathway. In contrast, ACC training
      is specifically designed to stimulate corticospinal neuroplasticity.  Importantly, since ACC
      training targets a central mechanism, its benefits are expected to generalize across walking
      conditions.  Furthermore, it is expected to benefit most stroke survivors who possess at
      least a minimal residual capability to activate the corticospinal tract.  ACC training also
      provides an opportunity to practice tasks that are analogous to challenges encountered in
      the home and community environments.  Accordingly, there is strong mechanistic and practical
      rationale for ACC training.

      A number of earlier studies have cumulatively established exciting preliminary evidence
      showing that walking function is enhanced by training with ACC tasks.  However, no prior
      study has been specifically designed and sufficiently powered to determine the extent to
      which the &quot;accurate gait modification&quot; ingredient is crucial for recovery of walking
      function.  Also not known is the extent to which ACC training reduces the neural impairments
      underlying poor walking function. The central hypothesis of this study is that ACC training
      will be superior to SS training for increasing walking function and for reducing underlying
      neural control of the paretic leg in adults with post-stroke hemiparesis.  Each intervention
      will involve twelve weeks of training, 3 days per week (36 sessions total), and will
      emphasize the motor learning principles of high intensity, repetition and task-specificity.
      Assessments will be conducted immediately pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention
      and at a follow-up session 3 months later.  Walking function will be measured in the lab and
      in the &quot;real world&quot;.  Neural impairment measures will include electromyography-based
      measures of inter-muscular coordination and corticospinal drive.

      The investigators expect that the benefits of ACC training will justify larger randomized
      controlled trials to optimize the use of ACC training, including timing relative to stroke,
      combination with other therapeutic approaches, and identifying individuals who are most
      likely to benefit from this approach. This research is expected to enhance walking function
      in stroke survivors, including for the 15,000 Veterans who suffer a stroke each year.
