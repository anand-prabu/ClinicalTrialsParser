In fact, cognitive impairment is currently considered\n      as one of the most pervasive features of this genetic disorder but its relationship with the\n      worsening of quality of life found in this population has not been directly investigated to\n      date.\n\n      Secondary objectives of this study are (i) to compare neuropsychological and quality of life\n      measures between patients and healthy controls matched by age, gender and education level,\n      (ii) to contrast neuropsychological deficits incidence between patients and controls, and\n      (iii) to differentiate NF1 children's self versus hetero-assessment of quality of life.\n\n      The main hypothesis of this study is that the neuropsychological impairment classically\n      identified in this clinical population will be associated to the quality of life's worsening\n      both in children and adults."

A sample of 150 healthy controls (100 adults and 50 children) will also be\n      recruited from sport and leisure clubs to serve as a normally developing control group.\n\n      The protocol assessment includes a standard and thorough neuropsychological examination\n      specific to children and adults, to investigate the different aspects of cognitive domains:\n      language, visuoperceptive and visuomotor abilities, memory, attention, executive function\n      and intelligence skills. Quality of life is measured by a questionnaire specifically adapted\n      to children and adults.\n\n      Other factors linked to the NF1 disease (familial or sporadic form, severity and visibility)\n       and to demographic characteristics (sex, age, education level) will be taken into account\n      to study their respective impact on quality of life, as compared with neuropsychological\n      measures."
