We think that giving men\n      with low sperm counts retinoic acid may increase their sperm counts and improve their\n      chances of fathering a pregnancy.  We want to see if retinoic acid administration over\n      twenty weeks can increase sperm production and help infertile men become fathers without the\n      need for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF) and/or ICSI."
