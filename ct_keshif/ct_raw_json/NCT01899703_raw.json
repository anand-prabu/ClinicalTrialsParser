The total duration of subject participation will be 12 weeks for screening (28 days)\n      and the treatment period. Subjects who are eligible for enrolment will participate in a\n      2-week placebo run-in period. Subjects will be randomized in a crossover fashion (Sequence 1\n      / Sequence 2) to receive placebo or GSK2330672 treatment during two consecutive 2-week study\n      periods. Subjects will then participate in a 2-week placebo dosing period ending in\n      follow-up assessments.
