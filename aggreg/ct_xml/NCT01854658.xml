        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant diseases other than COPD, i.e. disease or condition which, in the opinion
             of the investigator, may put the patient at risk because of participation in the

             pulmonary hypertension, or uncontrolled sleep apnea

          -  Hospitalized due to poorly controlled COPD within 3 months prior to screening or
             during the Screening Period

          -  Poorly controlled COPD, defined as acute worsening of COPD that requires treatment

             the Screening Period

          -  Lower respiratory tract infections that required antibiotics within 6 weeks prior to
             screening or during the Screening Period

             infarction within 12 months of enrollment.

          -  Clinically significant abnormal 12-lead ECG

          -  Abnormal liver function tests defined as AST, ALT, or total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 times
             upper limit of normal at Visit 1 and on repeat testing

          -  Cancer not in complete remission for at least five years

          -  History of hypersensitivity to β2-agonists, glycopyrronium or other muscarinic
