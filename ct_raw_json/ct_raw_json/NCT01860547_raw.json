The study\n      design was a randomized cross-over clinical trial. The participants were slightly and\n      moderately overweight female subjects.  In total, 110 female volunteers were recruited, and\n      they followed four different berry diets (bilberry, sea buckthorn, sea buckthorn phenolic\n      extract and sea buckthorn oil) in a randomized order for 33-35 days. Each intervention was\n      followed by a wash-out period  of  30-39  days.  Blood  samples  were drawn  and  physical\n      measurements  were performed  after  each  period.  Eighty volunteers completed the study.\n      Different markers of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and inflammation were measured form\n      the blood samples."
