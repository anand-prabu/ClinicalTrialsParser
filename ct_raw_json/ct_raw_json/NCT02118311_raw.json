The nTreg cells (manufactured from a 3rd cord blood unit) are infused on\n      day 0 at least 1 hour after the 2nd unit of the double umbilical cord blood (UCB)\n      transplant.\n\n      The nTreg cells require an 18 day (\u00b12 days) lead time based on the planned transplant day.\n      The combined CD3+ cell content from the two graft UCB units is enumerated upon thaw (day 0).\n       The patient then receives the number of nTregs cells from the 3rd cord product to achieve a\n      Treg:CD3+ cells ratio of 5:1.  The nTreg cell dose depends on the CD3+ cell content of the\n      two graft UCB graft units, but it will not exceed the highest dose level safely tested in\n      the ongoing University of Minnesota phase I Treg dose escalation study MT 2006-01."
