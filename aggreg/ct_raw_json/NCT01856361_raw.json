Ramipril is an Angiotensin\n      Converting Enzyme Inhibitor (ACEI) currently used to treat high blood pressure. However,\n      previous studies have shown that this class of medications can improve sperm parameters. The\n      purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ramipril compared to placebo (Substance\n      That is not known to have treatment effect), in improving sperm density in infertile men\n      with documented low sperm count. This study will help us identify subjects that might\n      benefit from treatment with this medication, and the effect it will have on sperm count,\n      shape, and motility."

            "textblock": "Approximately half of all infertility problems are caused by male factors. These men account\n      for 17% of patients at the primary health care level that seek help for infertility.\n      Oligospermia (Low sperm count) of unknown cause occurs in up to 60% of men with unexplained\n      infertility. Certain group of patients with oligospermia can father children, but those with\n      infertility have long posed a major therapeutic challenge. A variety of empirical\n      non-specific treatments have been used, in attempt to improve their semen characteristics\n      and fertility. In the past, androgens were suggested as a treatment; however, exogenous\n      testosterone was found to exert negative feedback on the pituitary-gonadal axis and thereby\n      suppresses Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH) secretion then\n      adversely affects sperm production. Other treatment modalities like clomiphene citrate,\n      tamoxifen, recombinant FSH, zinc, selenium, and L-carnitine have been tried with minimal\n      success. In the present study we are proposing the use of an angiotensin converting enzyme\n      inhibitor (ACEI) for the treatment of oligospermia. A recently published pilot study showed\n      that the use of lisinopril improved sperm quantity and quality in oligospermic men. ACEI are\n      inexpensive, safe, widely available, and, if effective in improving sperm production and\n      quality, could avert couples from undergoing invasive procedures."
