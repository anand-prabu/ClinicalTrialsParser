In addition, it has a port for suctioning material from the hypopharynx and a pilot balloon valve that constantly monitors intracuff pressure. In the following randomized, non-crossover study, the investigators test if oropharyngeal leak pressures differed between the Guardian Laryngeal Mask and the LMA proseal in paralysed, anaesthetised patients.",
