Sometimes\n      the transplanted cells are rejected by the body's normal tissues. Transplanting donated\n      cells that have been treated with psoralen may prevent this from happening.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and\n      psoralen-treated donor cells in treating patients who are undergoing peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation for hematologic cancer."

Determine the maximum tolerated dose of T-cells photochemically treated with\n      psoralen and ultraviolet A given with peripheral stem cell transplantation in patients with\n      hematologic malignancies or bone marrow failure myelodysplastic syndrome. II. Assess the\n      toxicity of this treatment in these patients. III. Evaluate this regimen in terms of\n      prevention of graft versus host disease and control of malignancy in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study of T-cells photochemically treated\n      with psoralen and ultraviolet A. Patients receive thiotepa IV over 2 hours on day 1,\n      cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days 2 and 3, and whole body radiotherapy on days 5-8.\n      Patients undergo preserved stem cell or bone marrow allogeneic transplant plus psoralen\n      treated T-cell allogeneic transplant on day 9. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating\n      doses of photochemically treated T-cells until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is\n      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 patients\n      experience dose limiting toxicities. Patients are followed for 100 days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 37 patients will be accrued for this study."
