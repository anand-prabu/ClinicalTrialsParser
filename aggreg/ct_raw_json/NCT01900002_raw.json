            "textblock": "TheraSphere is a medical device that has radioactive material called yttrium-90 (Y-90) in\n      it.  When Y-90 is put into microscopic glass beads called microspheres, it can be injected\n      through an artery directly into the liver.  This allows a large dose of radiation to be\n      delivered directly to the tumor, which lowers the risk of side effects from the radiation to\n      other parts of the body or to healthy liver tissue.  The radiation from TheraSphere stays in\n      the body and begins to lose its energy and break down within 12 days. The glass microspheres\n      will not break down and will stay in the body from that point on.\n\n      Study Drug Administration:\n\n      Each study cycle is 28 days.\n\n      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will start taking sorafenib\n      2 times a day starting on Day 1 of Cycle 1, 4 weeks before starting TheraSphere treatment.\n\n      You will need to take the sorafenib tablets 12 hours apart, at about the same time each\n      morning and evening.  The sorafenib tablets should be taken without food, at least 1 hour\n      before or 2 hours after a meal, and with about 1 cup (8 ounces) of water.\n\n      While taking sorafenib, you should avoid having any grapefruit, Seville (sour) oranges, star\n      fruit, pomegranate, and any products containing juices of these fruits.\n\n      TheraSphere Treatment:\n\n      After 4 weeks of taking sorafenib (+/- 1 week), the TheraSphere treatment will be performed.\n      The procedure should take about 1\u00bd to 3 hours to complete.\n\n      After starting sorafenib treatment, an angiogram will be scheduled to occur at least 2 weeks\n      before TheraSphere treatment.  The angiogram is an imaging test that uses radiologic\n      contrast dye that allows doctors to view your body's blood vessels or arteries.  It should\n      take about 1\u00bd to 3 hours to complete.  You will be given drugs through a vein in your arm or\n      hand to help you relax, but you will be awake during the procedure.  During the procedure,\n      an area in your groin will be numbed with local anesthetic and the doctor will insert a\n      catheter (a sterile plastic tube) into a blood vessel in your groin that leads to the blood\n      flow in your liver.  The contrast dye will then be injected into the catheter and a series\n      of X-rays will be taken to allow the doctor to see the blood vessels in your liver.  At the\n      end of the procedure, the catheter will be removed.  The X-rays will be used by your doctor\n      to plan your TheraSphere treatment.  You will be required to sign a separate consent form\n      for the angiogram that explains the procedure and associated risks in more detail.\n\n      You will also have an albumin scan, which is part of the angiogram. Imaging spheres similar\n      in size to the TheraSphere microspheres will be injected into your liver to test how well\n      the TheraSphere microspheres may stay in your liver and not travel to other organs.\n\n      During the TheraSphere treatment, you will again be given drugs through an IV in your arm or\n      hand to help you relax, but you will stay awake during the procedure.  An area in your groin\n      will be numbed with local anesthetic.  The doctor will insert a catheter into a blood vessel\n      in your groin that leads to the blood flow in your liver.  Based on the planning from the\n      results of your angiogram procedure, the doctor will guide the catheter to the target blood\n      vessel.  Once the doctor thinks the catheter is in the proper blood vessel, TheraSphere\n      microspheres containing Y-90 will be injected into the catheter to block the blood supply to\n      the blood vessel and to inject the microspheres filled with Y-90 to the tumor in the liver.\n      After the TheraSphere microspheres are injected, the catheter will be removed from your\n      groin.\n\n      After the TheraSphere treatment procedure is over, you will stay at the Interventional\n      Radiology recovery area for several hours so that the staff can monitor you for possible\n      side effects.  If you experience any serious side effects or complications after receiving\n      the TheraSphere treatment and the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you may\n      be admitted to the hospital to be monitored and for additional treatment.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      If you are receiving warfarin, blood (about 1 tablespoon each time) will be collected every\n      week to check your blood's ability to clot.  If your doctor thinks it is in your best\n      interest, you may be switched to enoxaparin instead of warfarin.\n\n      On Day 1 of Cycle 2 and every cycle after that:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) be drawn for routine tests.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check your blood's ability to clot, for\n           liver function tests, and to measure levels of alpha-feto protein.\n\n      At the end of every 2 Cycles (Cycles 3, 5, 7 and so on):\n\n        -  Urine will be collected for routine testing and to measure general protein levels.\n\n        -  You will have a CT or MRI scan to check the status of the disease.\n\n      Length of Treatment:\n\n      The TheraSphere treatment will only be performed one time.  You may continue taking\n      sorafenib for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest.  You will no longer\n      be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur,\n      or if you are unable to follow study directions.\n\n      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up phone calls.\n\n      End-of-Treatment Visit:\n\n      After you have completed the TheraSphere treatment and taken your last dose of study drug,\n      the following tests and procedures will be performed:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine be collected for routine tests. The urine sample\n           will also be used to measure general protein levels.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check your blood's ability to clot,  for\n           liver function tests, and to measure levels of alpha-feto protein.\n\n        -  You will have a CT or MRI scan to check the status of the disease.\n\n      Follow-Up Phone Calls:\n\n      After you have completed the End-of-Treatment visit, the study staff will contact you by\n      phone every 3 months to learn how you are doing since the treatment ended.  During these\n      phone calls, you will be asked if you have started any additional anti-tumor or anti-cancer\n      therapy, and the name of any anti-cancer drug(s) you may be taking.  You will also be asked\n      about any side effects you may still be experiencing.  Each follow-up phone call should last\n      about 15-30 minutes.  If you have a standard of care visit around the time this phone call\n      is scheduled, you may be asked these questions in person at the clinic.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Sorafenib is commercially available and FDA approved to\n      treat advanced liver cancer. TheraSphere is commercially available and FDA approved for use\n      in the radiation treatment or as neoadjuvant therapy before surgery and/or transplantation\n      for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\n\n      Up to 20 patients will take part in this study.  All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."
