    <textblock>
      This study was designed as a prospective multicenter trial to determine the accuracy of
      combined CT coronary angiography and perfusion imaging, specifically quantitative dynamic
      perfusion imaging in patients with suspicious coronary artery disease compared conventional
      coronary angiography and quantitative dynamic perfusion MRI as standard reference.
