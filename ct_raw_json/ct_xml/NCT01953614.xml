  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the abundance of theories concerning the effects of chiropractic adjustments on
      brain function, this remains an understudies area for the profession.

      Quantitative Electroencephalography (qEEG)is a technique that allows for an in-depth
      analysis of brain function. A normative database will be used to compare before, during and
      after effects of chiropractic adjustments on brain function. This will include usage of Low
      Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA).

      This study seeks to objectively document effects of chiropractic adjustments on brain
      function.

    <time_frame>Baseline, during adjustment, after adjustment, follow up in 7 days</time_frame>

    <description>There will be a baseline measurement. There will be measurements during the adjustment. There will be measurements immediately after the adjustment. There will be measurements 7 days after the adjustment.
Data will then be analyzed comparing values to a normative database. This database is adjusted for age. This will generate z-score values in addition to raw EEG values. Statistical analysis of P-values will then be run to test significance of changes.</description>
