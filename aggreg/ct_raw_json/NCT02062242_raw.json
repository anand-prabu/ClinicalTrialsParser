One hundred twenty women with PFM function graded 0 and 1\n      measured by Oxford Modified Scale will be submitted at random to physical therapy with\n      transvaginal electrical stimulation, vaginal palpation, vaginal palpation associated with\n      posterior pelvic tilt and contraction of accessory muscles (glutes and hip adductors) and\n      the control group who receive verbal instructions related to the pelvic floor and its\n      contraction. For the evaluation of the sexual function will be applied the Female Sexual\n      Function Index (FSFI).\n\n      The patients will be assessed by vaginal palpation, perineometry and surface\n      electromyography before and after the intervention."
