The optimal technique should enable\n      secure sealing of the vascular and biliary structures that results in low intraoperative\n      blood loss as well as low postoperative complication rates. Although numerous devices have\n      been introduced and are used widely, high-level evidence, randomized controlled trials, that\n      evaluate efficacy and safety of these devices are scarce. In the present randomized\n      controlled trial two techniques of hepatic resection using vascular staplers and the\n      LigaSure vessel sealing device are compared. While the primary endpoint is intraoperative\n      blood loss a set of general and surgical variables will be analyzed to evaluate efficacy and\n      safety of both methods."

To obtain a more precise estimate for the individual patient patient's individual transection area will be considered as a continuous covariate in the analysis of covariance (ANOVA). The transection area will be assessed using an imprint of the resected specimen on a paper sheet with a known density of 80 mg/m2. The marked paper area will be cut and weight to calculate the transection area. Intraoperative blood loss will be measured according to the blood collected in the suction containers. Spilling water and ascites will be subtracted. Furthermore, swabs will be squeezed and their content will also be sucked and added to the fluid collected in the suction containers. Central venous pressure will be lowered below 5 cmH2O for the transection period.",
