  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial, to determine
      whether providing financial incentives for meeting daily step goals (a) increases the daily
      step counts of participants, (b) increases compliance with the overall program (including
      diet recommendations), and (c) increases weight loss.

    <description>Compliance with the physical activity prescription, means meeting or exceeding the step goal for that day. Participants' compliance was assessed by totaling the number of days they met their step goal and dividing it by the total number of days of the intervention. Thus, providing investigators the percentage of days that each participant complied with their physical activity prescription.</description>
