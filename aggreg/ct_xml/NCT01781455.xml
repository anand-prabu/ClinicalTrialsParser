        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed written informed consent must be obtained and documented according to
             International Conference on Harmonization (ICH)- Good Clinical Practice (GCP), the
             local regulatory requirements, and permission to use private health information in
             accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) prior
             to study-specific screening procedures

          2. A histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumor that is metastatic,
             unresectable, or recurrent and for which standard curative or palliative therapies do
             not exist or are no longer effective.

          3. ≥ 18 years of age

          4. Measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
             (RECIST, see Section 9)

          5. Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70% (Section 14)

          6. Male or female patients of child-producing potential must agree to use contraception
             or avoidance of pregnancy measures during the study and for 30 days after the last
             BBI503 dose

          7. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test

          8. Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) &lt; or equal to 1.5 × upper
             limit of normal (ULN)

             patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal

         12. Absolute neutrophil count &lt; or equal to 1.5 x 109/L

         13. Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Anti-cancer chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or investigational agents
             within four weeks of first dose with the exception for a single dose radiation up to
             8 Gray (equal to 800 RAD) with palliative intent for pain control up to 14 days
             before beginning the administration of BBI503

          2. Surgery within 4 weeks prior to first dose

          3. Any known untreated brain metastases.  Treated subjects must be stable for 4 weeks
             after completion of that treatment, with image documentation required.  Patients must
             have no clinical symptoms from brain metastases and must be either off steroids or on
             a stable dose of steroids for at least 2 weeks prior to protocol enrollment. Patients
             with known leptomeningeal metastases are excluded, even if treated.

          4. Pregnant or breastfeeding

          5. Significant gastrointestinal disorder(s), in the opinion of the Principal

             and small intestinal resection)

          6. Unable or unwilling to swallow BBI503 capsules daily

          7. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, clinically significant non-healing or healing wounds, symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, significant
             pulmonary disease (shortness of breath at rest or mild exertion), uncontrolled
             infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements
