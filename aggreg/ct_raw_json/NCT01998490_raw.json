In addition the study will investigate how knowledge transfer occurs among\n      involved health personnel, and how knowledge is refined and transformed as practical\n      competence. The design will be a prospective and cluster randomized multicenter trial, but\n      mixed-methods will be used to target different outcomes. The study population will be\n      elderly (age above 65) at nursing homes diagnosed with dementia, or having a cognitive\n      deficit. The intervention will consist of 30 minutes sessions with animal-assisted activity\n      or robot-assisted activity two times a week for 12 weeks in groups of 4-6 participants.\n      Control groups will receive treatment as usual. Research questions:\n\n        1. Is there an effect in use of ordinary and optional medication among elderly persons\n           with dementia at nursing homes participating in animal-assisted or robot-assisted\n           interventions compared to a control group?\n\n        2. Is there an effect on agitation, restlessness and depression among elderly persons with\n           dementia at nursing homes participating in animal-assisted or robot-assisted\n           interventions compared to a control group?\n\n        3. Is there an effect on social interaction, activeness and wellbeing among elderly\n           persons with dementia at nursing homes participating in animal-assisted or\n           robot-assisted interventions compared to a control group?"
