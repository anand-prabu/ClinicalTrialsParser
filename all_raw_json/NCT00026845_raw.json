Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo total mastectomy and axillary dissection.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo excisional biopsy and axillary dissection followed by whole\n           breast radiotherapy and a boost to the tumor bed. Patients with positive axillary\n           dissections undergo radiotherapy to the supraclavicular nodes.\n\n      In both arms, patients with positive nodes receive cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin.\n\n      Patients are followed for at least 20 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 237 patients (116 for arm I and 121 for arm II) were accrued\n      for this study within 8 years."
