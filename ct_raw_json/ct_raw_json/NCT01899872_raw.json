            "textblock": "The aim of this study is to compare the effect of endurance and resistance exercises on\n      endothelial function in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). For this purpose, the\n      sample size will consist of 15 patients with DM1, aged between 18 and 45 years, which will\n      undertake the two types of exercises, randomly distributed. Ergospirometry testing will be\n      performed in order to assess possible contraindications to the proposed protocol as well as\n      functional capacity, which will be used in prescription of the endurance exercise session.\n      Similarly, a strength maximal testing will be conducted and used in the prescription of the\n      resistance exercise session.\n\n      The endothelial function will be evaluated by vascular reactivity of the forearm and\n      circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) counting. To analyze the vascular reactivity\n      of the forearm, non-invasive venous occlusion plethysmography will be used, whereas flow\n      cytometry method will be used to the analysis of the number of circulating EPC. The\n      endurance exercise session will consist of 40 minutes of cycling on heart rate corresponding\n      to 60% of VO2 max. The resistance exercise session will last 40 minutes, consisting of 4\n      sets of 12 repetitions at 60% of 1RM, in four exercises for lower limbs. The research will\n      be performed at the Exercise Pathophysiology Research Laboratory of the Hospital de Clinicas\n      de Porto Alegre. The investigators expect to find greater increase in the number of\n      circulating EPC after the endurance exercise session, when compared to the benefits obtained\n      from a session of resistance exercise. Likewise, it is expected to find greater benefits in\n      relation to vascular reactivity of the forearm after a session of endurance exercise when\n      compared to a session of resistance exercise. Considering that most part of the studies that\n      analyze the effects of physical exercise on vascular function does not involve patients with\n      DM1, this project aims to provide a clearer picture of the benefits of different exercises\n      in the acute response of endothelial function in these patients."
