Additionally, dry eye\n      symptoms will be documented in form of questionnaires.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that the treatment will be effective in improving clinical\n      signs and will relieve dry eye symptoms for the patient. If this method of managing\n      Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD) is found to be efficacious and safe, it will be made\n      available to patients in Singapore."

At least one out of 8 questions on dry eye symptoms is answered with often or all the\n             time.\n\n          3. Eyes should not show any other ocular surface pathology which required more treatment\n             than eye lubricant and conventional eyelid hygiene.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Known history of thyroid disorders (diagnosed by physician).\n\n          2. No ocular surgery within the previous 6 months and LASIK within the previous 1 year.\n\n          3. Any intake of central nervous system and hormonal drugs within last 30 days and\n             inability to withhold such drugs for at least 6 weeks.\n\n          4. Active ocular infection or pterygium.\n\n          5. Anticipated necessity to wear contact lens in the duration of the study.\n\n          6. Living in the same household as another participant of the study.\n\n          7. Any other specified reason as determined by clinical investigator, for example, the\n             need to use any treatment or eyedrops not permitted by the study."
