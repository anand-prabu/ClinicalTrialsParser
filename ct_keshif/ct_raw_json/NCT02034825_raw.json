All study participants (ie: urologists) will be masked to the original\n      actual treatment decision and patient outcome.\n\n      The design of this study is such that any participating urologist may or may not review a\n      patient originating from their own clinical practice, but will not review a case they\n      themselves identified.  Patient cases will be de-identified and randomized amongst\n      participating urologists .  By the retrospective nature of this study, cases may be several\n      years post-RP. It is not expected that that participation in this study will have any impact\n      on actual clinical management of patients.\n\n      Participants will be asked to complete two web-based electronic Case Report Questionnaires\n      (eCRQ):\n\n        1. Pre-Decipher: will collect information on their recommended treatment decision and\n           their decision confidence based on the de-identified clinical and pathological\n           information provided for each patient case.\n\n        2. Post-Decipher: will collect their treatment recommendation and decision confidence for\n           each de-identified patient case in the presence of the Decipher test results."
