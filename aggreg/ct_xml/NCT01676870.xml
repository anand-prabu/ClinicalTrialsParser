  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to compare in a real-world setting the efficacy of
      traditional training (today's guideline, vigorously or moderate exercise) and amount of
      aerobic interval training (1-AIT) in reduction of risk factors constituting metabolic
      syndrome.

      The secondary objective is to compare the efficacy of traditional moderate training (today's
      guideline) and amount of aerobic interval training (1-AIT vs. 4-AIT) in improving aerobic
      capacity, cardiovascular function, skeletal muscle contractile function, skeletal muscle
      energy metabolism, left ventricle systolic and diastolic function at rest and right
      ventricular function.

      The investigators hypothesized that aerobic interval training would reverse features of the
      metabolic syndrome more than traditional training.

      This study describes a randomized multicenter clinical trial designed to test the hypothesis
      that a 16-week program, with one year follow up of vigorously exercise defined from today's
      guidelines (performed as 4-AIT (4x4min aerobe interval training)) yields larger beneficial
      effects in reducing risk factors constituting the metabolic syndrome than continuously
      moderate intensity exercise (CME) defined from today's guidelines.

      Furthermore, the importance of the amount of aerobic interval training remains unclear and
      it is unknown how little &quot;one can get away with&quot; and still obtain substantial beneficial
      cardiovascular effects. Therefore, the investigators will also determine whether one bout of
      AIT (1-AIT (1x4min aerobe interval training)) can give beneficial effects compared to 4-AIT
      and CME.

      Evaluation criteria are risk factors constituting metabolic syndrome, aerobic capacity
      measured as peak oxygen uptake and compliance to intervention. Assessments will be made
      before and after the 16-week program, and at six month, and 1 and 3 years follow-up.
      Calculations based on previously results suggest a total number of 750 patients randomized
      1:1:1 (250 in each group) to the three intervention groups is sufficient to detect larger
      beneficial effects with AIT with a p-value of 0.05 (two-sided test) and statistical power of
      0.85 (primary endpoint is reduction in cardiovascular risk factors constituting metabolic
      syndrome).
