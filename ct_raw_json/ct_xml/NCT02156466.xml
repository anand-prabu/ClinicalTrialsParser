    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in
      subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis to assess the safety, tolerability,
      immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and efficacy of multiple
      subcutaneous ascending doses of MSB0010841 (Anti-interleukin-17A/F [Anti-IL-17A/F]
      Nanobody).

             or that could interfere with the trial objectives, conduct or evaluation

          -  Currently having a form of non-plaque psoriasis as specified in the protocol

          -  Drug induced psoriasis

          -  Biological treatments as specified in the protocol, within 3 months prior to Day 1
