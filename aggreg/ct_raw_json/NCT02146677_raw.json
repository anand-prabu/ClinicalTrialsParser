Moreover it was reported the absence of adverse events and side effects considering\n      the approach safe (Cerritelli 2013, 2014).\n\n      OMT was extensively used to treat, prevent and manage pain symptoms. Numerous research was\n      published addressing acute and chronic pain in different medical conditions. However, no\n      trials were carried out on pain in newborns. The aim of the present clinical trial is to\n      explore the effectiveness of OMT in reducing pain in a sample of preterm infants."
