Cohorts 1 and 2 will include healthy male subjects. Part B (Cohorts 3, 4 and 5)\n      will include three cohorts of 12 healthy male subjects to examine the safety, tolerability,\n      PK, and pharmacodynamic (PD) of repeated doses of GSK2881078 over 14 days. The total\n      duration of the study including screening and follow-up, is not expected to exceed 70 days."
