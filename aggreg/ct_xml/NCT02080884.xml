  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effectiveness of MabThera therapy added to a standard
      chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia
      (CLL). Patients who have received a single prior MabThera plus chemotherapy treatment are
      eligible. The overall response rate of patients treated for approximately 5 months (as per
      current label guidelines) will be analysed according to various factors (i.e., age,
      concurrent treatment, and chromosomal abnormalities).
