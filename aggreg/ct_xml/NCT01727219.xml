    <textblock>
      The frequency of depression in COPD patients are substantial and early detection and
      prevention of depression is critical.

      Recently, COPD assessment test (CAT) was developed and validated to assess the impact of
      COPD on patients' quality of life.

      In this prospective study, we will investigate the predictive utility of CAT for predicting
      depression in COPD patients.

      This study is aimed to investigate the association between the COPD Assessment Test (CAT)
      and depression in stable COPD patients. Stable COPD patients will be enrolled from the
      tertiary hospitals. All patients will undergo lung function tests. The Korean versions of
      the CAT (COPD assessment test) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) will be used to
      assess COPD symptoms and depressive disorder, respectively.

      We will compare the depresssion frequency among GOLD classifications of airway limitation
      and among the four CAT groups. And. we will also investigate which items of the CAT are the
      strongest indicators of depression.
