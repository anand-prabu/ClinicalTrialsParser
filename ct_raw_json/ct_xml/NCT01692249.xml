    <textblock>
      To determine whether spa therapy has a beneficial effect on pain and disability in the
      management of shoulder pain due to chronic rotator cuff lesions, this multicentre randomized
      prospective clinical trial includes patients with shoulder pain due to chronic degenerative
      rotator cuff tendinopathy who attend French spa resorts as outpatients. Subjects are
      randomized into two groups: immediate spa therapy (18 days of standardized treatment) and
      control (spa therapy delayed for 6 months). All patients continue usual treatments during
      the 6-month follow-up period. The main endpoint is the mean change in the DASH score at 6
      months. Secondary endpoints are the mean change in SF-36 components, treatments used, and
      tolerance. The effect size of spa therapy is calculated and the proportion of patients
      reaching minimal clinically important improvement (MCII) is compared between groups.

    <description>The domains explored by the Quick DASH are: (1) physical arm, shoulder or hand activity problems (6 items); (2) severity of pain and tingling (2 items); (3) social activities, work, and sleep (3 items). Each item has five response options, ranging from 1, ''no difficulty or no symptom,'' to 5, ''unable to perform activity or very severe symptom.'' If at least 10 of the 11 items are completed, a score ranging from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability) can be calculated [(sum of n responses/n) - 1] x 25.the effect size and the percentage of patients reaching Minimal Clinical Important Improvement was determined</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  chronic shoulder pain (symptom duration of more than 6 months) due to primary or
             secondary tendinopathy of the rotator cuff.

        In cases of rotator cuff tendinopathy related to traumatic events, the trauma was required
        to have happened at least 6 months previously. Corticosteroid treatment for concomitant
        disease could be continued at a stable dose. Shoulder x-rays within the previous 18 months
        were required in all cases.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  shoulder pain related to neurological or vascular disorders or neoplasms; referred
             pain from internal organs; systemic rheumatic conditions; inability to complete
             questionnaires because of cognitive impairment, or language difficulty;
             contraindication (immune deficiency, evolving cardiovascular conditions, cancer,
             infection, non-equilibrated diabetes mellitus) or intolerance to any aspect of spa
             treatment; spa treatment within the previous 6 months; steroid injection within the
             previous 3 months; physiotherapy in the previous month; changes in non-steroidal
             anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) administration within the previous 5 days or in other
             analgesic drug use within the previous 12 hours.
