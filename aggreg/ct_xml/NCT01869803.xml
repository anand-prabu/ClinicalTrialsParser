      This clinical trial studies gemtuzumab ozogamicin in treating patients with relapsed or
      refractory acute myeloid leukemia or acute promyelocytic leukemia. Monoclonal antibodies,
      such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the
      ability of cancer to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry
      cancer-killing substances to them.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To provide patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute promyelocytic leukemia
      (APL), who have relapsed or who are refractory to standard treatments, with access to
      gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) when no other comparable or satisfactory alternative
      therapy is available.

      II. To carefully monitor safety and to report safety information from patients receiving
      Mylotarg in this setting.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1 and 15.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every month for 1 year.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of relapsed or refractory AML and not candidate for standard consolidation
             treatment after daunorubicin and cytosine arabinoside OR diagnosis of APL relapsed
             after tretinoin (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide therapy or APL with persisting or rising
             blasts, and no other comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy available
             (including patients not eligible for, or who have access to, investigational
             therapies via a clinical trial)

          -  Patients must have an initial diagnosis of AML, biphenotypic acute leukemia, or APL

          -  Patients must have cluster of differentiation (CD)33 positivity of &gt; 30%

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 3 / Karnofsky &gt; 60%

          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT])
             =&lt; 2 x institutional upper limit of normal

          -  It is deemed ethical to provide an experimental drug (e.g., Mylotarg) that is
             associated with hepatotoxicity (veno-occlusive disease [VOD]) and myelosuppression

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to receiving Mylotarg
             and for the duration of treatment; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while receiving treatment with Mylotarg, she should inform her treating
             physician immediately

             Board (IRB)-approved informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients may not currently be receiving any other investigational agents for leukemia

          -  Patients with known untreated hepatitis C

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to active liver disease,

             therapy are ineligible; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving
             combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated

          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to gemtuzumab ozogamicin or its parts:
             recombinant humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal (hP67.6) antibody, calicheamicin
             derivatives or other ingredients
