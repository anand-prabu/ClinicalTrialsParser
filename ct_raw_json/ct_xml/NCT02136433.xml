  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test the effectiveness of training using novel tablet
      applications for hand function, compared to traditional hand exercises. In addition, we aim
      to examine brain plasticity following treatment with the new tablet applications. We
      hypothesize that training with a tablet would prove to be more effective than traditional
      exercises. We expect to observe neuroplastic changes in the brain in patients who practiced
      finger movements using the tablet.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>To assess dexterity of the affected hand. This test is a assesses dexterity and the time to remove and return nine pegs is measured. The Nine Hole Peg Test is a reliable, valid and responsive measure in clients with stroke</description>

    <measure>Accelerometers</measure>
    <time_frame>An average of one week before intervention and one week after intervention</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Daily use of the weaker and stronger arms will be measured using Actical (TM) (Mini-Mitter Co.) accelerometers, which measure acceleration and the intensity of movement. This accelerometer is a small (28X27X10 mm), lightweight (17g) sensor, which has a frequency range to detect human movements. It detects acceleration in all 3 planes although it is more sensitive in the vertical direction. Data is stored as activity counts. The accelerometers will be worn on the wrists for 2-3 days.</description>

    <time_frame>An average of one week before intervention and one week after intervention</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>To quantify the level of the motor impairment. The participants are required to perform different movements. Each movement is rated 0 (inability to perform) to 2 (full movement). The total score ranges from 0 (no active movements) to 60 points (full movements).</description>

    <description>Existing tablet Apps that encourage finger movement in a fun manner while playing a game will be used. The apps will be taught to the participants and then they will be requested to exercise alone (or with family) everyday for one hour in addition to their regular rehabilitation sessions (Occupational, Physical Therapy, speech).
The intervention will include 15-20 sessions of 60 minutes of self-training using a tablet.</description>

    <description>GRASP (Graded Repetitive Arm Supplementary Program)(Harris et al., 2009)is an arm and hand exercise program developed for individuals with stroke with upper extremity impairments GRASP provides a method for patients to undertake a self-directed arm and hand exercise program.
The exercises will be taught to the participants and then they will be requested to exercise alone (or with family) everyday for one hour in addition to their regular rehabilitation sessions (Occupational, Physical Therapy, speech).
The intervention will include 15-20 sessions of 60 minutes of self-training</description>
