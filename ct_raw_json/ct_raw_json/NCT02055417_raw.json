PATCH is a brief intervention\n      designed to support participants' decision-making processes and enhance intrinsic motivation\n      to initiate ART, using motivational interviewing (MI) techniques. The intervention will be\n      targeted at HIV-positive African-American adults in inner-city Baltimore, Maryland who are\n      suboptimally engaged in care and who endorse conspiracy beliefs about HIV or low readiness\n      to begin ART. The specific aims are: (1) Develop and refine a manual for a brief MI\n      intervention to support ART decision-making and reduce the likelihood of ART refusal: (2)\n      Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of implementing the PATCH intervention in a small\n      sample of individuals who are African-American, recommended for ART but who are not current\n      taking it, and who experience multiple barriers to ART adherence; and (3) Conduct a small\n      randomized controlled pilot to test the potential efficacy of the PATCH intervention in\n      producing positive attitudinal changes, including a reduction in conspiracy beliefs and\n      perceived barriers to ART and stated readiness to begin ART."
