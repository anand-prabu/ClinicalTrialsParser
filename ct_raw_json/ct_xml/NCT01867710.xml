    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and clinical benefit of the combinations
      of abiraterone acetate and prednisone or abiraterone and dexamethasone in prostate cancer
      patients. Prednisone will be given at one of three different dose schedules.  Dexamethasone
      will be given at one dose schedule. This will include looking at what side effects occur and
      how often they occur. In addition the impact of the study drug on quality of life and pain
      will be evaluated. The study will also collect data on subsequent treatment of patients
      after they come off the study drug (up to a maximum of 5 years after the study starts). By
      analyzing blood samples, the study aims to identify if some markers could help to understand
      if the treatment with abiraterone is effective and also help to understand if patients can
      become resistant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study drug is assigned by chance), open-label (all people know the
      identity of the intervention), parallel-arm, multicenter, phase 2 study of treatment with
      abiraterone acetate (AA) and 4 alternative steroid treatment strategies in asymptomatic,
      chemotherapy-naïve, mCRPC patients. A target of 144 patients will be enrolled in this study
      with 36 patients planned per treatment arm. All patients participating in this study will
      receive abiraterone acetate. All patients will also take either prednisone or dexamethasone.
       Patients will receive abiraterone acetate along with either prednisone at one of three
      different dose schedules or with dexamethasone at one dose schedule.  Patients may also be
      asked to take a medication to protect from osteoporosis as this can be increased by long
      term use of corticosteroids. There are 4 treatment groups in this study: (a) Four 250mg
      tablets of abiraterone acetate taken together once daily and one 2.5 mg tablet of prednisone
      taken twice daily; (b) Four 250mg tablets of abiraterone acetate taken together once daily
      and one 5 mg tablet of prednisone taken once daily; (c) Four 250mg tablets of abiraterone
      acetate taken together once daily and one 5 mg tablet of prednisone taken twice daily; (d)
      Four 250mg tablets of abiraterone acetate taken together once daily and one 0.5 mg tablet of
      dexamethasone taken once daily. The chance that patients will get prednisone is 3 out of 4
      patients.  The chance that they will get dexamethasone is 1 out of 4 patients. Abiraterone
      acetate, prednisone and dexamethasone will be considered as study drugs. The main study will
      consist of a screening phase of 4 weeks followed by an open-label treatment period of a
      maximum of 39 treatment cycles (156 weeks or approximately 3 years). The main study
      treatment period cut-off date will be 156 weeks after the start of study treatment for the
      first patient participating in the study. Patients will participate in the main study
      treatment period until the cut-off date, and will receive study treatment until radiographic
      disease progression and/or unequivocal clinical progression and/or other specific reasons
      for discontinuation of treatment. Patients will be asked if they would be willing to
      participate in a follow-up or extension phase of the study for a maximum of 5 years after
      the study starts.  The amount of time patients will be in the study will vary depending when
      they join the study and time remaining to the study end date and on their response to the
      treatment. Patients may come off the study drug if their cancer worsens, if they are unable
      to tolerate the study treatment, if their doctor determines that they should begin another
      cancer treatment, or if they decide to withdraw consent. A treatment &quot;cycle&quot; in this study
      is the amount of time a patient will be asked to take the study medication, and have
      regularly pre-scheduled checkups and laboratory assessments. Each treatment-cycle will last
      28 days. There are a maximum of 39 treatment cycles in this study (over a period of 156
      weeks).  If patients enter the extension phase, they will be asked to attend hospital every
      12 weeks for the remaining time that they stay on the study. Other anticancer therapy or
      immunotherapy must be ended before and while participating in this clinical study with
      abiraterone acetate.   Also some medications are not allowed during the study. For example,
      if patients are receiving a steroid other than prednisone, it will be necessary to switch it
      to prednisone or dexamethasone, depending on to which treatment group patients have been
      assigned, for the duration of the study.  If needed, their study doctor may slowly decrease
      and stop some or all of their current medicines before the study treatment starts. This is
      called washout. Do not stop taking any of their current medicine unless their study doctor
      tells patients to do so. At screening the study doctor will first check that patients are
      qualified.  Screening procedures will be conducted within 4 weeks before randomization.
      During the main study treatment phase patients will come to the study clinic for Study
      Visits about 21 times in total (including for screening) if they stay on treatment for 39
      cycles. During Cycle 1 of this study, patients will be asked to come to the clinic three
      times for assessments: on Day 1 which also will usually be their first day of treatment, Day
      15 and two weeks later. After that patients will need to return to the clinic once every
      four weeks for the first 6 months. After that, the visits are once every 3 months for
      assessments.  In addition, patients will need to visit either the clinic or the Outpatients
      every 2 weeks for the first 3 months and every 4 weeks after that to the end of their
      treatment to provide a small quantity of blood for testing. If patients either continue
      study treatment to 39 cycles, or if patients discontinue from the study before 39 treatment
      cycles, their last visit with drug dispensed will be called an End-of-main-study-treatment
      (EOMT) visit.  EOMT assessments will be performed for all patients who started study
      treatment, either at the cut-off date or when they discontinue before the cut-off date.
      Additionally, for patients discontinuing study treatment before the cut-off date, an
      end-of-main-study (EOMS) visit will be performed 4 weeks after study medication is stopped.
      Patients will also be required to return to the study site 4 weeks after their last
      treatment for the &quot;End of Main Study&quot; visit as below.  This visit is for some routine study
      assessments. During the extension phase, patients will be provided with study drug outside
      of the main study for up to a maximum of 5 years after the study starts.  During this phase,
      patients will receive study drug during their 12 weekly visits and their doctor will check
      on their health status at the same time.  Patients will not be required to provide blood or
      urine samples during this phase.  Patients are likely to be eligible to join this extension
      phase if patients have responded well to the study drug and have not been discontinued from
      the main study.  Also even if they have discontinued from the main study, if they have had
      no disease progression their doctor may advise them that they are eligible to join this
      phase.  Their last visit will be called an End of Extension visit.  For this visit, patients
      will be required to return to the study site 4 weeks after their last treatment for some
      final assessments.   Follow-Up: Following discontinuation of study treatment at any time
      during the study, for any reason other than withdrawal of consent, survival and subsequent
      prostate cancer therapies will be monitored until 5 years after the start of study treatment
      of the first patient participating in the study. This information will be obtained by
      6-monthly telephone contact and/or chart review, with a source data verification visit
      scheduled after the death of the patient or at the end of the study. Their doctor may phone
      them or their family to ask about their health status during this 5 year period if he/she
      feels that their chart records may need to be updated. A Scientific Advisory Committee will
      be commissioned to ensure scientific validity of this study, to identify any scientifically
      relevant trends, and to provide recommendations to the sponsor.
