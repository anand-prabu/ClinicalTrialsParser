  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We examined the effects of short-term (2-wk) consumption of HF- and HG-sweetened beverages
      in adolescents (15-20 yr of age) on insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, insulin
      clearance, triacylglycerol (TAG), and cholesterol concentrations.

    <textblock>
      This counterbalanced study consisted of two trials including 1) high fructose (HF) trial
      and, 2) a high glucose (HG) trial. Each trial was blind to the participant, performed in a
      random order, and was 15 d in length. During days 1-14 of each trial, the participants
      consumed either 710 ml per day of a HF-sweetened beverage (sweetened with 50 g fructose and
      15 g glucose) for 2-wk (HF trial) or 710 ml per day of a HG-sweetened beverage (sweetened
      with 50 g glucose and 15 g fructose) for 2-wk (HG trial) on top of their normal diet. In
      addition, the participants were instructed to maintain their normal physical activity levels
      during each trial (which were measured with an accelerometer). On day 15 of each trial, the
      participants reported to the lab after a ~ 11 h overnight fast for metabolic testing. During
      this testing day, the participants remained in the lab for 12 h and consumed three liquid
      meals (one meal every 4 h and HF meals during HF trial and HG meals during HG trial), while
      blood samples were taken every 15 or 30 min throughout the 12 h testing day. During testing,
      the participants remained physically inactive (&lt; 3,000 steps).
