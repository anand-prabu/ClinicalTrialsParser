  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to determine whether the 'incubation of craving' phenomenon also occurred in
      alcoholics, investigators employed an experimental approach to investigate the time course
      of cue-induced craving in alcoholism. Eighty male participants were randomly divided into
      Four groups, and they were assessed at 7, 14, 30, and 60 days of abstinence for cue-induced
      alcohol craving . Another group including 19 patients was repeatedly tested for the
      cue-induced alcohol craving at the above abstinence days. Other psychological and
      physiological measures were administered at the four abstinence time points.
