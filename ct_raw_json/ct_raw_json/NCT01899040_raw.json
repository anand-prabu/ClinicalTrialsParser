The patients will not have had\n             changes in medication usage for the three Months leading up to the Study, nor will\n             they introduce new medications during the Study period. Patients will satisfy these\n             criteria: On a Monthly basis, at least four, and not more than a total of fourteen\n             (4-14), Headache Days (Pain Score between one and ten) of which between four and nine\n             (4-14) are Migraine Headache Days\n\n          -  The patient must not have failed on more than two classes of properly administered\n             prophylactic pharmaceutical therapies for migraine headache.  The patient may be on a\n             single migraine prophylactic as long as the dosage has not been altered within 3\n             months of starting the study and the dosage must not be altered for the duration of\n             the study.\n\n          -  The Investigator must have confidence in the patient's ability to reliably use the\n             Experimental Device and promptly complete the Daily Headache Diary forms.  The Daily\n             Headache Diary will be completed from the beginning of the Pre-Treatment Baseline\n             Period through the end of the Pivotal Study.\n\n        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n        Individuals who:\n\n          -  are pregnant\n\n          -  have a history of cardiovascular disease\n\n          -  work night shifts\n\n          -  have been diagnosed with vestibular migraine\n\n          -  have been diagnosed with migraine with aura\n\n          -  have menstrual migraine exclusively\n\n          -  have been diagnosed with post-traumatic migraine\n\n          -  have a history of unstable mood disorder or unstable anxiety disorder\n\n          -  use a hearing aid\n\n          -  have a cochlear implant\n\n          -  have chronic tinnitus\n\n          -  have temporomandibular joint disease\n\n          -  have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury\n\n          -  have been diagnosed with neurological disease other than Headaches\n\n          -  have a diagnosed vestibular dysfunction\n\n          -  abuse alcohol or other drugs\n\n          -  are experiencing medication overuse Headaches (individuals with respect to whom the\n             Investigator is concerned that analgesic abuse is involved based on the ICHD-II\n             guidelines).\n\n          -  are less than 18 years old or greater than 65 years old\n\n          -  have had eye surgery within the previous three months or ear surgery within the\n             previous six months\n\n          -  have active ear infections or a perforated tympanic membrane\n\n          -  have participated in another clinical trial within the last 30 days or are currently\n             enrolled in another clinical trial\n\n          -  are using Botox treatments for migraines\n\n          -  Though not excluded, patients taking anti-histamines or anti-nausea drugs will be\n             encouraged not to take such medications within four hours prior to using the Device.\n             The Investigator should review other medications taken by the patient with properties\n             that mimic anti-nausea or anti-dizziness drugs as these may reduce responsiveness to\n             stimulation.  Such medications should also be avoided within four hours prior to a\n             treatment."
