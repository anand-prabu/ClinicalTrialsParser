The full scale assesses interest, enjoyment, surprise, sadness, anger, disgust, contempt, fear, guilt, shame, shyness, amusement, awe, contentment, gratitude, hope, love, pride, sympathy, and sexual feelings (e.g., \"I felt sexual, desiring, and flirtatious\"). The scale can be scored for total positive and negative affect,grouped according to where they would fall on the circumplex model of affect (e.g., high activation vs. lower activation),or individual affects can be examined.
