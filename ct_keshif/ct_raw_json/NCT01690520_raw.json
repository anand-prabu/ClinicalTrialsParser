Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor\n      umbilical cord blood transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the\n      patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's cells. When the healthy stem cells and\n      ex-vivo expanded cord blood progenitor cells are infused into the patient they may help the\n      patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It\n      is not yet known whether giving donor umbilical cord blood transplant plus ex-vivo expanded\n      cord blood progenitor cells is more effective than giving a donor umbilical cord blood\n      transplant alone."
