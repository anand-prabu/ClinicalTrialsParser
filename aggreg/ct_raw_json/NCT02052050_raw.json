These muscles are in charge of\n      lumbopelvic stabilization muscle linked to reduced ability to maintain independence in daily\n      activity life that could have affected their quality of life\n\n      Objective: The aim objective will be evaluated short and long-term effects of physical\n      activity program for muscle stabilization.\n\n      Methods: 20 colorectal cancer survivors will be recruited from the Department of Oncology of\n      Cl\u00ednico San Cecilio Hospital. Patients will be randomized in physical activity program group\n      and usual care group. Physical activity groups will receive an eight week program form\n      improve the muscle stabilization.\n\n      Discussion: Researchers attempts to increase the fitness level and reduce musculoskeletal\n      disorders in colorectal cancer survivors through a physical activity interventions focusing\n      in muscle stabilization."
