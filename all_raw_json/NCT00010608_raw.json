Numerous controlled studies\n      suggest that this disparity is associated with chronic psychosocial and environmental\n      stress. Research indicates that Transcendental Meditation (TM) may result in significant\n      improvements in CVD risk factors in this high risk population.\n\n      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to either active stress reduction with\n      TM or health education control, both in addition to usual medical care, for 12 months. The\n      primary outcome will be carotid artery atherosclerosis (IMT) measured non-invasively by\n      quantitative B-mode ultrasonography. Secondary measures will include traditional CVD risk\n      factors (blood pressure, serum glucose and insulin levels, obesity, and sedentary\n      lifestyle), stress-related neurohormones (catecholamine metabolite and cortisol),\n      psychosocial stress, and quality of life. The results of this trial will yield valuable new\n      knowledge for the prevention of CVD through a CAM intervention in high risk older African\n      American women."
