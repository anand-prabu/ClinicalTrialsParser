Study visits\n      will be at 7, 30, and 60 days after RBX2660 administration with additional follow-up at 3\n      and 6 months post treatment. Patients who have had at least two recurrences of CDAD after a\n      primary episode and have completed at least two rounds of standard-of-care oral antibiotic\n      therapy or have had at least two episodes of severe CDAD resulting in hospitalization may be\n      eligible for the study."
