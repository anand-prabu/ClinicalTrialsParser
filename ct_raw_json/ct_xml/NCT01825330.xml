  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study tests the effect of the NeuroAD on Alzheimer patients' cognitive function. The
      NeuroAD uses non-invasive stimulation of both magnetic and cognitive training.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The NeuroAD system is a combined system of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and cognitive
      training and is a non-invasive therapeutic system for the improvement of Alzheimer patients'
      cognitive function.

      A potential participant will undergo screening procedures to confirm eligibility to
      participate in the study, followed by randomization procedure to one of the study groups -
      treatment or sham (placebo) Patient will attend the clinic 5 times a week for 6 weeks,
      approximately an hour every day for treatment/sham. The patient will be required to return
      to the clinic for follow-up.

      120 patients will be enrolled in 7 clinical sites in the US and Israel.
