Investigators wish to study the feasibility and the effect on patient experience\n      of two drugs. Propofol administered by endoscopy nurses (NAPS) and conventional therapy with\n      a combination of fentanyl and midazolam. Investigators hypothesize that patients sedated\n      with propofol has a better procedure experience, that a well performed sedation equals a\n      better experience and that NAPS is as feasible as fentanyl with midazolam sedation."
