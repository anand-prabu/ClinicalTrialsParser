            "textblock": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing\n      so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Hyperthermia therapy kills tumor cells by heating them to several degrees above body\n      temperature. Combining hyperthermia with radiation therapy and chemotherapy may kill more\n      tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of cisplatin combined with radiation\n      therapy and hyperthermia in treating patients who have stage II, stage III, or stage IV\n      cervical cancer."

On\n      1 day of each week, patients also receive cisplatin IV over 3 hours and hyperthermia over 90\n      minutes beginning 1-6 hours after completion of EBRT. During week 6, patients receive\n      hyperthermia and cisplatin on the day before the 1 day of intracavity radiotherapy.\n      Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 6-8 weeks, every 3 months for 3 years, and then every 6 months\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-34 patients will be accrued for this study."
