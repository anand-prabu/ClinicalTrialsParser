No\n      treatment is consistently effective and most patients fail treatment multiple times.\n\n      Ethyl pyruvate (EP)is a common food additive noted to be 'generally regarded as safe' that\n      may improve the activity of salicylate in wart treatment by improving the ability to\n      penetrate and/or persist in the skin. The use of 17% salicylate with the addition of EP may\n      improve cures of common foot plantar warts in subjects who also be receiving other\n      standard-of-care treatment."
