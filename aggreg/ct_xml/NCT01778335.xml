  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to understand whether a new treatment of stroke - endovascular
      clot removal - can be added to the current standard of care to improve patient outcomes.

      All patients will receive the best standard stroke treatment.  This includes treating
      patients with the clot dissolving drug tPA (tissue plasminogen activator).  However, t-PA
      does not work in some patients and others are not eligible to receive t-PA because they
      present too late for treatment (they woke up with their stroke symptoms or their stroke was
      not witnessed).

      During endovascular revascularization the blockage in the artery is removed with the use of
      devices called stentreivers and or by giving clot dissolving drug at the site of the
      blockage in the artery to restore blood flow.  Stentrievers are devices that have been
      designed by different companies to remove blood clots from arteries.

      Approximately 250 people at 10-15 hospitals across Canada and other countries will
      participate in this study.

      ESCAPE is a phase 3, randomized, open-label with blinded outcome evaluation, controlled,
      parallel group design.

      The primary objectives of this study are to show that rapid endovascular revascularization
      amongst radiologically selected (small core/proximal occlusion) patients with ischemic
      stroke results in improved outcome compared to patients treated in clinical routine.

      Eligible patients will be enrolled within 12 hours of last seen normal with a baseline NIHSS
      &gt; 5 at the time of randomization. There must be a confirmed symptomatic intracranial
      occlusion, based on single phase, multiphase or dynamic CTA, at one or more of the following
      locations: Carotid T/L, M1 MCA, or M1-MCA equivalent (2 or more M2-MCAs). Anterior temporal
      artery is not considered an M2.

      All patients will receive the best standard of medical care according to modern acute stroke
      care guidelines.  Control arm subjects will receive best medical care.  In the
      intervention/experimental arm, subjects will be treated with endovascular thrombectomy or
      thrombolysis using currently available technology for use in the ESCAPE site for
      thrombectomy/thrombolysis.

      This study consists of one 90-day study period for each subject.   Subjects will be
      hospitalized for care after their acute stroke according to the current standard of care.
      Subjects are required to return to clinic on Days 30 &amp; 90 for end-of-study procedures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Acute ischemic stroke

          2. Age 18 or greater

          3. Onset (last-seen-well) time to randomization time &lt; 12 hours.

          4. Disabling stroke defined as a baseline NIHSS &gt; 5 at the time of randomization.

          5. Pre-stroke (24 hours prior to stroke onset) independent functional status in
             activities of daily living with modified Barthel Index of 90 or greater.  Patient
             must be living in their own home, apartment or seniors lodge where no nursing care is
             required.

          6. Confirmed symptomatic intracranial occlusion, based on single phase, multiphase or
             dynamic CTA, at one or more of the following locations: Carotid T/L, M1 MCA, or
             M1-MCA equivalent (2 or more M2-MCAs). Anterior temporal artery is not considered an
             M2.

          7. Non-contrast CT/CTA for trial eligibility performed or repeated at ESCAPE stroke
             center with endovascular suite on-site.

          8. Endovascular treatment intended to be initiated (groin puncture) within 60 minutes of
             CT/CTA with target CTA to first recanalization of 90 minutes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Baseline non-contrast CT reveals a moderate/large core defined as extensive early
             ischemic changes of ASPECTS 0-5 in the territory of symptomatic intracranial
             occlusion.

          2. Other confirmation of a moderate to large core defined one of three ways:

               1. On a single phase, multiphase or dynamic CTA: no or minimal collaterals in a
                  region greater than 50% of the MCA territory when compared to pial filling on
                  the contralateral side (multiphase/dynamic CTA preferred) OR

               2. On CT perfusion (&gt;8 cm coverage): a low CBV and very low CBF ASPECTS &lt;6 in the
                  symptomatic MCA territory OR

               3. On CT perfusion(&lt;8 cm coverage): a region of low CBV and very low CBF &gt;1/3 of
                  the CTP imaged symptomatic MCA territory.

          3. Groin puncture is not possible within 60 minutes of the end of CTA acquisition
             (please note that if CTP is performed it should be done after CTA).

          4. No femoral pulses

          5. Very difficult endovascular access will result in a CTA to recanalization time that
             is longer than 90 minutes.

          6. Pregnancy; if a woman is of child-bearing potential a urine or serum beta HCG test is
             positive.

          7. Severe contrast allergy or absolute contraindication to iodinated contrast.

          8. Suspected intracranial dissection as a cause of stroke.

          9. Clinical history, past imaging or clinical judgment suggests that the intracranial
             occlusion is chronic.

         10. Patient has a severe or fatal comorbid illness that will prevent improvement or
             follow-up or that will render the procedure unlikely to benefit the patient.

         11. Patient cannot complete follow-up treatment due to co-morbid non-fatal illness.
