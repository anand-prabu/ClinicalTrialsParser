            "textblock": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the most common complication in pregnancy. Both\n      mother and offspring have a significantly increased future risk for metabolic and\n      cardiovascular disease as a consequence of GDM. Pathological insulin resistance and the\n      pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction may contribute to the development and adverse outcomes of GDM.\n\n      Recently, fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) and FGF21 have emerged as key endocrine\n      regulators of glucose, lipid and energy metabolism. Both factors activate FGFRs in the\n      context of co-receptor \u03b2Klotho(KLB) expression. After that, both proteins alter ERK\n      phosphorylation and stimulate glucose uptake. Furthermore, these two factors ameliorate\n      insulin resistance through various ways including up-regulating insulin mRNA, IRS-1, GLUT-1\n      expressions, down-regulating GH-IGF-1 levels in different tissues and blood circulation and\n      also improving dyslipidemia.\n\n      Our previous studies showed that several factors which involved in insulin resistance and\n      FGF19/FGF21 signaling pathway had differential expression in placenta from GDM and normal\n      glucose tolerance pregnancy. Those led us to hypothesize that FGF19/FGF21 signaling pathway\n      could play an important role in the pathogenesis and development of insulin resistance state\n      in GDM.\n\n      In the present study, we will further investigate whether maternal and neonatal FGF19/FGF21\n      signaling pathway are altered and associated with insulin resistance, glucose intolerance,\n      dyslipidemia and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Thus we will evaluate the regulating action of\n      FGF19/FGF21 on gestational insulin resistance.\n\n      The aim of this study is to elucidate the role of FGF19/FGF21 in insulin resistance and\n      metabolic disorder in GDM."
