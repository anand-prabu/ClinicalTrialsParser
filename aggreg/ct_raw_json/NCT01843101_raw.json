For this purpose, a customized\n      ultra-high resolution Spectral Domain OCT will be used. To validate whether the protocol can\n      also be applied in patients with corneal pathologies, for whom it is intended to be used,\n      measurements in these patients will be performed. We propose to obtain images from patients\n      with keratoconus, since this is one of the most frequent causes for corneal transplantations\n      in Europe and from patients with corneal neovascularization which is a major cause of vision\n      loss in several ophthalmic diseases. Based on the obtained measurement protocol, further\n      studies investigating the pathophysiology or treatment success of several corneal\n      pathologies can be planned."
