      The purpose of this study is to determine whether exemestane plus everolimus are effective
      in the treatment of patients who have achieved disease stabilization after induction
      chemotherapy for hormone-receptor positive metastatic breast cancer.

      Postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer achieving
      clinical benefit after the induction chemotherapy for visceral disease with sign(s) and/or
      symptom(s) will be recruited to receive study the maintenance treatment of everolimus plus
      exemestane.
