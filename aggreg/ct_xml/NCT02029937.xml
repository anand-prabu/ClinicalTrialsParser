  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this multicenter trial is to determine whether the use of a
      low-cost, high-resolution microendoscope during diagnostic upper endoscopy can improve the
      efficiency and accuracy of endoscopic screening for esophageal squamous cell neoplasia.
      This is a multicenter clinical trial of a novel technology, a miniaturized, lower cost (&lt;
      $3, 500) microscope device which can be used during upper endoscopy to image the
      gastrointestinal epithelium.  This high-resolution microendoscope  (HRME) was developed by
      our collaborators at RICE University and provides &gt;1000X magnified images of the esophageal
      mucosa.
