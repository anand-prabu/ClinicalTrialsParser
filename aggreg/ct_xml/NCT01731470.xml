    <textblock>
      Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) is a poorly understood chronic
      disorder of unknown etiology consisting of irritative bladder symptoms and pelvic pain that
      dramatically affects quality of life.

      Liposomes (LP), the treatment article in this proposal, were discovered in the process of
      exploring a &quot;control&quot; compound when measuring the efficacy of liposomally encapsulated
      capsaicin for the intravesical treatment of interstitial cystitis. Liposomes are lipid
      vesicles composed of concentric phospholipid bilayers, which enclose an aqueous interior.
      Liposomes have the ability to form a molecular film on cell and tissue surfaces and are
      currently being tested as possible therapeutic agents to promote wound healing. Application
      of liposomes at the wound surface provides a moist protective film over the wound and
      augments wound healing without chronic inflammatory reactions in the neodermal layer.
      Preclinical study data (obtained by using an IC/PBS model in Sprague-Dawley female rats)
      have demonstrated normalization of urinary frequency indicating that LP may be a potent
      protectant of the bladder mucosa against inflammation and irritation.  Intravesical LP has
      so far demonstrated an excellent safety profile and minimal toxicity at concentrations of 2
      mg/ml. Thus, we hypothesize that intravesical instillation of LP may form a molecular film
      on bladder ulcer surfaces in patients with IC and provide a safe, effective, and minimally
      invasive treatment option to alleviating symptoms.

               -  History of IC/PBS for at least 6 months documented in the medical record

               -  Recurring IC/PBS symptoms

               -  An average of 8 or more urine voids over a 3-day period, confirmed by the
                  baseline voiding diary

               -  Bladder pain score &gt; 4 in the last 24 hours (assessed at screening visit)

               -  Previous use of medications and/or treatment(s) for symptom relief

               -  Females of child-bearing capability agree to use a reliable form of birth
                  control (condoms and/or oral contraceptives (birth control pills)) during the 4
                  week course of therapy and 1 week thereafter

               -  Willing and capable of understanding and complying with all requirements of the
                  protocol, including proper completion of the voiding diaries and
                  self-administered questionnaires

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Subjects currently taking prescribed medications for IC/PBS will be able to
             continue the medications throughout the course of the study. If the patient cannot be
             maintained on a stable dose of the medication(s) throughout the treatment and
             follow-up period they will be excluded.

               -  Subjects must not have had intravesical treatment(s)/bladder installations of
                  the following medications: DMSO, lidocaine and/or heparin within 1 month prior
                  to study visit 1

               -  Pregnant or lactating

               -  History of bleeding diathesis
