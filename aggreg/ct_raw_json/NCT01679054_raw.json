            "textblock": "Background\n\n      The oral chemotherapy agent Xeloda\u00ae was recently extended by the Hong Kong Hospital\n      Authority as subsidized therapy for the treatment of colorectal cancer1.  Xeloda\u00ae-based\n      chemotherapy regimen has shown to be more cost-effective than 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)\n      considering they had equivalent clinical efficacy in colorectal cancer treatment2,3.  The\n      total cost for 5-FU-based regimen was higher for the healthcare provider and society as a\n      whole.  Gastric cancer ranks fourth in cancer-related cause of death in the Hong Kong\n      population4.  5-FU has known antitumor activity and has been used successfully in advanced\n      gastric cancer (aGC) with cisplatin (FP), as well as with oxaliplatin \u00b1 epirubicin (FOLFOX4,\n      EOF).  When substituted with Xeloda\u00ae, the XP and EOX regimens have demonstrated to be\n      noninferior in terms of progression-free survival when compared with FP and EOF,\n      respectively5,6.  In an economics evaluation done by the manufacturer for NICE submission on\n      the use of Xeloda\u00ae for treatment of aGC, the use of XP regimen allowed a cost reduction\n      while eliminating possible complication related to intravenous therapy7.  Moreover, FOLFOX4,\n      one of the common 5-FU-based regimens used locally, has demonstrated to produce a median\n      overall survival of 10 months in advanced/metastatic gastric cancer patients8.  An effect\n      similar to that of EOX.  Currently, there is no local data suggesting similar economic\n      impact with Xeloda\u00ae-based regimen for gastric cancer when compared with 5-FU-based regimens.\n       It is worthwhile to see if Xeloda\u00ae-based therapy for gastric cancer is a cost-effective\n      alternative.\n\n      Study Objective\n\n      To compare retrospective costs of treatment with Xeloda\u00ae-based and 5-FU-based regiments in\n      patients with advanced gastric cancer in Hong Kong.\n\n      Methods\n\n      This is a retrospective cost-minimization study to be conducted in a public hospital in Hong\n      Kong.  Sixty (60) gastric cancer patients will be identified from existing case records (30\n      who completed a Xeloda\u00ae-based regimen and 30 who completed a 5-FU-based regimen) in the\n      study sites.  Baseline characteristics from both groups prior to chemotherapy, including\n      demographics, ECOG performance score, liver/renal function, metastases, and survival will be\n      obtained.  Cost data will also be extracted from patient records.\n\n      Information to be collected include cost of hospital admission and length of stay,\n      outpatient visits, diagnostic tests and treatments, chemotherapy regimens, all other drug\n      therapy, adverse side effect management, travel, and patient time.  Baseline characteristics\n      and costs will be compared.  Descriptive statistics will be utilized and sensitivity\n      analysis will be performed to investigate the robustness of the cost model."
