In numerous studies, when conventional laparoscopic appendectomy using\n      3 ports is compared with open appendectomy, it has advantages of reduced pain, reduced\n      hospital stay, and enhanced cosmetic effects. Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS)\n      was developed with the aim of reducing the invasiveness of conventional laparoscopy. In this\n      study the investigators aimed to compare results of SILS appendectomy and three port\n      conventional laparoscopic appendectomy prospectively."
