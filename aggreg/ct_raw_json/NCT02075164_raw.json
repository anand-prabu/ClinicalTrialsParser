Moreover, NAFLD is\n      an important risk factor for progression of diabetes and atherosclerosis. However, the\n      pathomechanisms determining disease progression are poorly understood. The overall aim of\n      this project is to test the central hypothesis that excessive fructose consumption provides\n      a multiple metabolic hit in the pathogenesis and progression of NAFLD/NASH by impairment of\n      hepatic lipid homeostasis and mitochondrial function resulting in hepatic lipotoxicity with\n      inflammasome activation and disturbed interorgan cross-talk among insulin sensitive tissues."

            "textblock": "To achieve these goals we will address the following specific hypotheses that\n\n        -  Fructose-induced changes in lipid composition of hepatocellular stores determine\n           lipotoxicity which may be associated with abnormalities in mitochondrial function,\n           energy homeostasis, inflammasome activation and cellular injury in progression to NASH,\n           effects which will be compared to glucose\n\n        -  Non-invasive characterization of fructose (compared to glucose)-induced lipotoxic\n           hepatic and extrahepatic metabolic risk profiles (lipid composition and energy\n           metabolism) obtained by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) will identify patients\n           with NASH\n\n        -  Severity of fructose (compared to glucose)-induced lipotoxic lipid and adenosine\n           triphosphate (ATP) derangements (identified by MRS) critically determines the degree of\n           insulin resistance and abnormalities in hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism\n\n        -  Compensatory hyperinsulinemia, secondary to skeletal muscle insulin resistance, may be\n           a primary mechanism of hepatic lipotoxicity and progression to NASH\n\n        -  Gender differences in the hepatic and systemic metabolic response to fructose are\n           mediated by the impact of female sex hormones and their nuclear receptors on hepatic\n           lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function and inflammasome activation.\n\n        -  Age differences in the hepatic and systemic metabolic response to fructose are mediated\n           by the impact of age related alterations on hepatic lipid metabolism and mitochondrial\n           function.\n\n      These key hypotheses will be addressed by a translational research consortium including\n      hepatologists, radiologists, physicists, endocrinologists and specialist in gender medicine\n      allowing an integrated mechanistic approach to NAFLD. The strength of the current proposal\n      comes directly from bridging basic science and clinical perspectives of different\n      disciplines involved in the management of NAFLD, including cutting edge non-invasive\n      technologies such as high field MRS metabolic profiling ('virtual metabolic liver biopsy')\n      and mechanistic in vitro experiments. This project will provide novel mechanistic insights\n      in the role of fructose as emerging hepatic 'toxin' in the pathogenesis and progression of\n      NASH, as increasing health problem in Western society. Moreover, this study will clarify the\n      impact of sex and gender on fructose-induced alterations in hepatic and systemic metabolism,\n      providing a rational and scientific basis for future dietary interventions and regulatory\n      actions."
