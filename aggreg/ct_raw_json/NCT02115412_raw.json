Non-adherence can be due to various forms and have multiple causes.\n\n      To address this need, Philips Research has developed Medication Non-adherence model. This\n      tool will help in developing a systemic way of assessing medication non-adherence and\n      providing decision support for targeted intervention to healthcare professionals. The aim of\n      this study is to validate this model with 750 chronically ill patients in UK."
