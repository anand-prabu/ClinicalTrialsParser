  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study Vitamin D3 replacement for patients at high risk of
      developing  ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer, and see if the Vitamin D3
      replacement may be able to prevent the cancer.

      This study is being done because in the United States ovarian cancer is the leading cause of
      death among women with gynecologic cancer. Women with BRCA mutations, a personal history of
      breast cancer, and a family history of breast and ovarian cancer are at high risk of
      developing ovarian, fallopian, and primary peritoneal cancer. Novel treatments other than
      surgery which can decrease the risk of developing ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary
      peritoneal cancer are important. Vitamin D has been shown to reduce the risk of developing
      bladder, breast, colon, endometrial, esophageal, gallbladder, gastric, lung, pancreatic,
      prostate, rectal, renal, vulvar and Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and it may play a role
      in the prevention of ovarian cancer.

    <description>Patients will take Vitamin D3 by mouth in the weeks prior to and including the morning of surgery. If blood test done at the start of the study shows that patients have a low (&lt; or = 30 ng/ml) Vitamin D level, patients will be given two 25,000 IU Vitamin D3 Tablets (for a total of 50,000 IU) to take once a week until surgery. If baseline Vitamin D level is &gt;30ng/ml, patients will be given on 2,000 IU Vitamin D3 tablet to take once a day until day of surgery.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be undergoing prophylactic or therapeutic oophorectomy

          -  Patients must be considered to be at a high risk of developing ovarian, fallopian or
             primary peritoneal cancer, according to 1 or more of the following characteristics:

          -  Patients with a BRCA mutation including variants of uncertain significance

          -  Patients with Lynch syndrome

          -  Patients with a family history that places them at high risk of developing ovarian
             cancer

             replacement doses of Vitamin D3 to begin with but in order to prevent against
             toxicity their Vitamin D3 levels will be checked at the start of the trial.

          -  Patients who are unwilling or unable to undergo oophorectomy are NOT eligible

          -  Patients with suspicious or abnormal findings on preoperative physical exam,
             laboratory results, or imaging studies within 4 weeks of treatment start are NOT
             eligible
