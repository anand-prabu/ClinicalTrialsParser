Continuous infusion of\n      beta-lactam antibiotics is more likely to optimize T>MIC than intermittent infusion. At the\n      Department of Infectious Diseases, Aarhus University Hospital, continuous infusion with\n      piperacillin/tazobactam for a period of 2 weeks, has been used for several years in patients\n      with CF, suffering from acute pulmonary exacerbations (APE). It is an outpatient treatment,\n      and the patients are given 16 g of piperacillin per 24 hours. To assess the efficacy and\n      quality of the treatment, a blood test every 3rd day will be required to monitor the\n      blood-plasma concentration of piperacillin, as well as C-reactive protein (CRP) and white\n      blood cell count (WBC)."
