However the risk of SCC of the anal canal has been\n      growing recently. The standard treatment of anal cancer stage II-III is multimodal and\n      consists of combined chemotherapy (infusional 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin) and\n      radiotherapy. This scheme currently used was proposed in 1974, and since then no other\n      effective treatment has been developed.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of\n      capecitabine and mitomycin with radiotherapy in patients with carcinoma of the anal canal.\n      For this will be selected 51 patients to be treated with chemo-radiotherapy.\n\n      The primary endpoint will be local control rate after 6 months of the end of radiotherapy\n      and chemotherapy, defined by the rate of radiological and clinical neoplasia."
