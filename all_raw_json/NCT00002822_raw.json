Combining more than one drug is a way to kill more tumor cells.\n      Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effect of two combination chemotherapy\n      regimens followed by radiation therapy in treating patients with small cell lung cancer."

Courses\n      repeat every 4 weeks for 6 courses.\n\n      Patients in both groups are considered for thoracic radiotherapy beginning 4-5 weeks after\n      the first day of the last course of chemotherapy.\n\n      Concurrent prophylactic antibiotics should be given. Patients who relapse may receive\n      further treatment at the clinician's option.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months, every 2 months for up to 1 year, every 3 months\n      for up to 2 years, every 6 months for 5 years, and annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients will be entered over 3 years."
