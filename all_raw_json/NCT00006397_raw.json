Prior to\n      therapy, a peer-based patient education intervention is presented. Patients receive a\n      combination of IDV, RTV, enteric-coated ddI, and d4T. Responses to this multi-agent\n      antiretroviral drug regimen are explored based on sex differences. A pharmacokinetic\n      sub-study, balanced so that half of patients are male and half are female, is performed on\n      IDV and RTV for 20 to 25 of the patients. About 20 females are examined for study-drug\n      effects on gonadotropic hormone levels."
