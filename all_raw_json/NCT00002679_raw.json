Evaluate the efficacy of dose intensive, sequential adjuvant chemotherapy\n      with doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and cyclophosphamide in patients with stage II/III resected\n      breast cancer. II. Evaluate the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: All patients receive sequential chemotherapy regimens consisting of 3 courses each\n      of doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and cyclophosphamide on a schedule of one course every 14 days.\n      Following completion of chemotherapy, patients who underwent breast conservation surgery\n      receive radiotherapy. Mastectomy patients with 10 or more positive nodes or with T3-4 tumors\n      are also eligible for delayed radiotherapy. Patients who are hormone receptor positive (or\n      whose receptor status is unknown) are treated with oral tamoxifen for 5 years, beginning\n      after completion of all other therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years,\n      every 6 months for 3 years, then yearly.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At total of 90 patients will be entered."
