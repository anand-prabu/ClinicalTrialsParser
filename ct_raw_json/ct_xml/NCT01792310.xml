  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, non-randomized study in patients with advanced solid tumours
      including malignant glioma. The study will be performed in two phases - a dose escalation
      phase following a standard &quot;3+3&quot; design to establish dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and a safe
      dose of 2-OHOA followed by two expanded safety cohorts (approximately 10 of whom have
      malignant glioma and approximately 10 of whom have other advanced solid tumours that are
      suitable for biopsy) treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). If the MTD is well
      tolerated in the expanded safety cohorts, that dose becomes the recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D). During each dose cohort, at least one week must elapse between the first and
      subsequent patients receiving treatment with 2-OHOA. Up to five dose cohorts are
      anticipated.

      Patients may receive palliative localized radiotherapy, if needed (however, this lesion
      cannot be a target lesion for evaluation of the treatment response).

      Safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics and efficacy will be evaluated during the
      study at pre-defined timepoints

    <description>Patients will receive treatment cycles of 21 days, until any criterion for discontinuation (clinical or radiological progression of disease, clinically unacceptable toxicity, or another &quot;general&quot; discontinuation criterion) is met.
Patients are expected to receive between one and 6 cycles of treatment. The treatment period may be extended if clinical benefit is shown.
In the event of significant GI toxicity, the treatment schedule may be modified from continuous dosing to an intermittent regime In the case of toxicity, the dose of 2-OHOA may be reduced or delayed by up to 14 days at the discretion of the Investigator. A maximum of two dose reductions will be permitted per patient. Treatment &quot;holidays&quot; of no more than 14 days are also permitted for reasons other than toxicity. Intra-patient dose escalation may be permitted in certain specific circumstances.</description>
