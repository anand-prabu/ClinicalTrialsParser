      Closer examination of granular lipid data in a large population offers numerous
      opportunities to generate new knowledge, ranging from studies examining concordance between
      commonly used lipid parameters to phenotypic  characterization of rare or extreme disorders
      of lipid metabolism, opening possibilities to better personalize future treatment of
      abnormal blood lipids.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      The Very Large Database of Lipids (VLDL) includes adults and children who were clinically
      referred for a Vertical Auto Profile (VAP).

      LIPID MEASUREMENTS:

      The VAP test (Atherotech, Birmingham, Alabama, USA) directly measures cholesterol
      concentrations of low density lipoprotein, very low density lipoprotein, intermediate
      density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein, their subfractions, and lipoprotein(a).
      Triglycerides in the database are directly measured using the Abbott ARCHITECT C‚Äê8000 system
      (Abbott Park, Illinois, USA). Lipid distributions in the database closely match those from
      the population-representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
      2007-2008.

      STUDY PROCEDURES:

      This database was investigator-initiated. Only de-identified data reach the investigational
      site. The first data harvest was in 2011, and encompassed 1,350,908 samples. The second
      harvest is underway; thus far, an updated database suited to assess seasonal variation has
      been established with 2,859,333 samples. The master database is housed at The Johns Hopkins
      Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, and maintained by Drs. Jones and Martin. Only electronic
      data, and not biospecimens, are sent to Hopkins. The academic investigators have
      unrestricted access to study data, take responsibility for the accuracy of analyses, and
      have authority over manuscript preparation and submission.

      VARIABLES:

      The variables currently in the VLDL database are testing date, age, sex, low density
      lipoprotein, very low density lipoprotein, intermediate density lipoprotein, high density
      lipoprotein, their subfractions, lipoprotein(a), and LDL pattern. From these primary
      variables, many additional variables were derived for inclusion in the master database
      (e.g., non-HDL-C, Friedewald LDL-C, TC/HDL-C, etc.). Other analytes measured by validated
      assays in subsets of the VLDL database include apoB, apoA1, hsCRP, homocysteine, uric acid,
      insulin, hemoglobin A1c, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, cystatin C, Lp-PLA2, TSH, free T3 and T4,
      pro-BNP, direct bilirubin, CPK, creatinine and other components of the comprehensive
      metabolic panel, magnesium, and phosphate.

      DATABASE ORGANIZATION:

      In the current database, each record represents a unique patient. The 1st available VAP test
      for each patient is included. To meet the needs of a variety of research questions, we are
      prospectively planning to organize harvest 2 data into 3-year interval datasets (i.e., VLDL
      2006-2008, 2009-2011, VLDL 2012-2014, etc), a summation dataset (first VAP test for each
      patient), serial lab dataset (patients who have had repeated testing), and ancillary
      datasets (subsets of patients with coexisting data on other measures such as
      apolipoproteins, vitamin D, hs-CRP, TSH/T4, etc).

      INDIVIDUAL STUDIES:

      Individual VLDL studies will be based on a priori hypotheses or aims with statistical
      analysis plans (SAPs) peer-reviewed prior to execution. In the expandable &quot;Detailed
      Description&quot; section below, the VLDL investigators will periodically register individual
      studies and update their status on clinicaltrials.gov.
