Fluoroscopy has been used traditionally for image guidance for\n      this procedure but there is a growing interest in use of ultrasound (US) for this procedure.\n       US avoids radiation exposure to the patient and the health care team (HCT) and is less\n      expensive.  We aim to compare procedural efficacy related outcomes for SIJ injections\n      performed using these image-guided modalities."
