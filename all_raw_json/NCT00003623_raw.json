The use of high-dose multivitamins may be an effective\n      way to prevent the recurrence of early stage bladder cancer. It is not yet known whether\n      high-dose vitamins are more effective than no further therapy in decreasing the risk of\n      early-stage bladder cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized double-blinded phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of high-dose\n      multivitamins with a placebo in preventing the recurrence of cancer in patients with early\n      stage bladder cancer."

Determine whether high dose multivitamins have chemopreventive efficacy\n      beyond standard therapy in reducing the risk of recurrence in patients with resected stage 0\n      and I (Ta, T1, and Tis) transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind study. Patients are randomized to receive\n      multivitamins or placebo orally once daily for 3 years. Patients are followed every 3 months\n      for 2 years, then every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 360 patients (180/arm) will be accrued for this study within 3\n      years."
