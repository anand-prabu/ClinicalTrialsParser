This program of research serves\n      as a venue by which to produce and test an innovative, science-based, and cost-effective\n      means to intervene in a private, convenient, and individualized way with employed adults who\n      report non-dependent levels of risky drinking. Responsible Drinking offers computer-tailored\n      intervention sessions directed at increasing readiness to limit drinking to national\n      guidelines for low-risk drinking and a complementary dynamic web portal providing additional\n      information, activities, and strategies designed to activate and reinforce the change\n      process. The primary objective is to complete and enhance the development of Responsible\n      Drinking and test it in an effectiveness trial. In Phase II the program capabilities and\n      innovation will expand to integrate the e-Health components (CTI and e-Workbook) with\n      m-Health (mobile health) technologies. The e-Health components will be enhanced to offer a\n      more interactive and engaging user experience. In addition, m-Health technologies (text\n      messaging and mobile device browsing optimization) will be integrated to support engagement\n      in the program and flexible delivery options. 996 employed adults will be recruited to\n      participate in the randomized trial. The treatment group will receive three intervention\n      sessions during the course of six months and group differences on a number of outcomes will\n      be evaluated at 12 and 18 month follow-up assessments."
