Additional\n      steroid injection will be given to half of patients after allocation with randomized\n      selection by permutaed block randomization.\n\n      Primary outcome measure is mean fall in pain visual analogue scale (pVAS) and secondary\n      outcome will be proportion of patients with good response (defined as \"Perfect\" or \"much\n      better\" as reported by patients).\n\n      Follow-up will be conducted 3 weeks and 3 month after index procedure"
