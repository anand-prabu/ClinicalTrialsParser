  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial is to estimate the effects of allocation to irbesartan,
      or doxycycline, or a combination of both irbesartan and doxycycline, compared with placebo,
      on measures of elastic function of the aorta in people with the Marfan syndrome and
      enlargement of the aorta.
