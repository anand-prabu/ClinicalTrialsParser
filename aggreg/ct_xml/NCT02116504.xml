  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the main potential causes of these failures of BP therapy response is the development
      of Anti-drug Anti-body (ADAb) in some patients. ADAb may decrease the efficacy of BPs by
      neutralizing them or modifying their clearance and they may be associated with BP-specific
      hypersensitivity reactions. The prediction, prevention and cure of anti-drug (AD)
      immunization are thus major goals in BP development.  This prospective study (ABI-RA) will
      assess the occurrence of ADAb using standardized and validated assay(s) and also cellular,
      genetic and molecular parameters in RA patients treated with adalimumab, etanercept,
      infliximab and rituximab, to address the mechanism of immunogenicity. Patient-related
      factors that might predispose an individual to an immune response will be taken into
      account: underlying disease, genetic background, immune status, including immunomodulating
      therapy and dosing schedule.

    <textblock>
      The ABIRISK (Anti-biopharmaceutical Immunization: Prediction and analysis of clinical
      relevance to minimize the risk) consortium, within the IMI (Innovative Medicines
      Initiative), is a Public Private Partnership between pharmaceutical companies, academic
      institutions and clinical centers. The ABIRISK aims are to better analyze and predict the
      phenomenon of immunogenicity in order to reduce its occurrence.  One of the main objectives
      of ABIRISK is to set up prospective cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
      (ABI-RA) to provide, using an integrated approach, new tools for being able to detect
      earlier and even before the beginning of the therapy, immunization to biopharmaceutical
      (BP).    The introduction of BP has been a critical step forward in care for RA and 9 BP are
      now licensed for the treatment of RA. In spite of this progress, failure of response to BP
      is frequent and in most of the registries, less than 50 % of patients are still on drug at 5
      years. These failures may be primary failures or secondary failures. The fact is that the
      low level of responses becomes insufficient compared to the expectations. One of the main
      potential causes of these failures of BP therapy response is the development of Anti-drug
      Anti-body (ADAb) in some patients. ADAb may decrease the efficacy of BPs by neutralizing
      them or modifying their clearance and they may be associated with BP-specific
      hypersensitivity reactions. The prediction, prevention and cure of anti-drug (AD)
      immunization are thus major goals in BP development.   This prospective study (ABI-RA) will
      assess the occurrence of ADAb using standardized and validated assay(s) and also cellular,
      genetic and molecular parameters in RA patients treated with adalimumab, etanercept,
      infliximab and rituximab, to address the mechanism of immunogenicity. Patient-related
      factors that might predispose an individual to an immune response will be taken into
      account: underlying disease, genetic background, immune status, including immunomodulating
      therapy and dosing schedule.
