This research project translates a well established\n      cognitive bias in major depressive disorder (MDD), working memory bias, into a novel\n      intervention target.  In a double-blind, randomized, controlled study, MDD participants\n      undergo 4 weeks of cognitive training sessions, with two sessions per week."
