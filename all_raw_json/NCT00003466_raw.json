Courses repeat every 28 days.\n      In the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, patients may continue with\n      treatment until tumor has remained stable for 12 courses.\n\n      Patients are followed every 8-12 weeks for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36-100 patients (9-25 per stratum) will be accrued for this\n      study within 3 years."
