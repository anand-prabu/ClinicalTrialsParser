Is HCV positive (documented by HCV RNA testing at Screening). Chronic hepatitis C is\n             defined as a) Positive for anti-HCV antibody, HCV RNA, or an HCV genotype at least 6\n             months before screening, and positive for HCV RNA and anti-HCV antibody at the time\n             of screening; or b) Positive for anti-HCV antibody and HCV RNA at the time of\n             screening with a liver biopsy consistent with chronic HCV infection (or a liver\n             biopsy performed before enrollment with evidence of CHC disease, such as the presence\n             of fibrosis), according to \"Guidance for Industry. Chronic Hepatitis C Virus\n             Infection: Developing Direct-Acting Antiviral Agents for Treatment\".\n\n          4. Has previous results from HCV genotype testing. If previous results are not\n             available, such testing should be performed at Screening.\n\n          5. Has had a liver biopsy or Fibroscan\u2122 within 3 years.\n\n          6. Has minimal hepatic dysfunction, defined as follows:\n\n               -  Stage 0, stage 1 or 2 fibrosis(according to liver biopsy or Fibroscan\u2122 results)\n                  ALT and AST values not exceeding 5 x ULN (Baseline value for each parameter will\n                  be calculated as the average of 3 values obtained 7 days apart, i.e., at each\n                  screening visit [Days -28, -21, and -14])\n\n               -  Normal albumin, total bilirubin, and prothrombin time values\n\n          7. Has elevated liver test results (ALT) at least 1.5 x ULN and not exceeding 5 x ULN\n             (Baseline value for each parameter will be calculated as the average of 3 values\n             obtained 7 days apart, i.e., at each screening visit [Days -28, -21, and -14]).\n\n          8.

Is intolerable to, or relapsed from previous interferon-based therapies or other\n             anti-HCV  therapies. Relapser is defined as HCV RNA undetectable at the end of\n             treatment with a standard or pegylated interferon-based regimen or other anti-HCV\n             therapies, but HCV RNA detectable within 24 weeks of treatment follow-up. The\n             intolerable is defined as HCV patients who cannot tolerate the side effects of\n             previous interferon-based therapies or other anti-HCV  therapies,  or who were not\n             suitable for interferon-based therapies  or other anti-HCV  therapies.\n\n         10. Is opioid-free for at least 10 days prior to the first screening visit (Day -28).\n\n         11.

Is capable of understanding and signing the informed consent document. If subject is\n             unable to sign the informed consent form, then the subject's legal representative or\n             guardian may provide written consent per state and institution guidelines.\n\n         13.

Is being treated with any prescription narcotic drug (including transdermal delivery\n             systems)\n\n          8.
