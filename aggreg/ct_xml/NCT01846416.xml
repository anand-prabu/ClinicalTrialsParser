    <textblock>
      This multicenter, single-arm study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of MPDL 3280A in
      patients with PD-L1-positive locally advanced or metastatic non-small c ell lung cancer
      (NSCLC). Patients will receive an intravenous dose of 1200 mg MP DL3280A on Day 1 of 21-day
      cycles for a maximum of 16 cycles.
