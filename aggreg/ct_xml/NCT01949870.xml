    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of oral dose of
      selumetinib in combination with chemotherapies (cisplatin and gemcitabine) in Japanese
      patients with advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC). In addition, the pharmacokinetic (PK)
      profile of selumetinib and chemotherapies will be investigated. Also, the Maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) of selumetinib in combination with chemotherapies for Japanese BTC patients will
      be identified, if possible.
