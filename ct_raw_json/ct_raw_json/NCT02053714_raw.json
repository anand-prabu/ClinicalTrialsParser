Evidence-based diabetes\n      self-management education and support interventions have yet to be adapted for persons with\n      mental illness and there have been no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to examine their\n      feasibility and efficacy. The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of\n      conducting a RCT of a diabetes self-management intervention for persons with severe mental\n      illness and T2DM."
