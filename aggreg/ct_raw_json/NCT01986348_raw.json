If so, the patient will be assigned to Arm A. The\n      patient will receive 2 or 3 doses of the study drug and then undergo surgery on Day 3 or Day\n      8.  After recovery from surgery treatment with the study drug will resume.\n\n      If the patient does not require surgery on their brain tumor they will be assigned to Arm B\n      (non-surgical arm).\n\n      Selinexor will be taken orally twice weekly on days 1 and 3 of each week (Monday and\n      Wednesday or Tuesday and Thursday). One cycle is 28 days (4 weeks) and includes 8 doses of\n      selinexor.\n\n      Patients may continue to receive treatment with selinexor until either progression of\n      disease is demonstrated by brain MRI according to RANO criteria, unacceptable toxicities,\n      subject's consent is withdrawn, or the investigator believes it is in the best interest of\n      the patient."
