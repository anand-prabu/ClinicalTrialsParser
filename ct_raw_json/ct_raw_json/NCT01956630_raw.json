Relapse after transplantation, being a main obstacle for patient\n      survival, is so far treated by second transplantation and donor leukocyte infusion (DLI),\n      which seems to have high risk and low survival. Need for a new medication on relapse is\n      urgent. The immunotherapy using Dendritic cells (DCs) combined with cytokine induced killer\n      (CIK) cells holds promise for the adjuvant treatment of AL to eradicate or control residual\n      disease. This randomized study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility and effective of\n      genetically modified DCs combining to CIK immunotherapy in relapse AL after allo-HSCT."
