  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A healthy volunteer study to characterise the exposure of the two study medications,
      following administration of OZ439 + TPGS granules with piperaquine phosphate granules
      (intended for children) and with piperaquine phosphate tablets (intended for adults).
      Ideally, to confirm the exposure demonstrated in an earlier bioavailability study.
