  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized to receive open-label (honestly described placebo) immediately
      at baseline or be eligible to receive the open-label treatment three weeks after the
      baseline measurements.   Therefore all patients will be eligible to receive open-label
      placebo treatment for their chronic low back pain during the course of the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is a debilitating and costly condition that affects 1.2 million
      Portuguese with an estimated cost in the United Stated of $50 billion.  Randomized
      controlled trials has shown that placebo interventions can dramatically reduce chronic low
      back pain and its associated disability.  Generally, it is assumed that response to placebo
      requires concealment or deception, which presents a dilemma to the clinician.   In clinical
      practice, how can patients benefit from an available, effective and potentially
      cost-effective intervention without being deceived?  This study seeks to determine ethically
      acceptable open-label placebo treatment (with full informed consent) can lead to meaningful
      benefits.   The primary study will involve 80 patients with cLBP who will be randomly
      assigned to a three-week course of either non-deceptive open-label placebo pills in the
      context of a persuasive rationale + treatment as usual or to be continued on their
      treatment-as-usual.   Primary outcome measures will be pain intensity and symptom
      bothersomeness on the previous week.    Additionally, the study will investigate a possible
      association between the genetic variation of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT
      polymorphisms) with the hypothesized observed placebo effect on cLBP patients.
      Participants will be followed for 3 weeks with a mid-point (11 days) visit. Patients who
      receive only usual care for the first three weeks will be eligible to elect a three week
      course of treatment with open-label placebo after which they will be assessed.  This study
      has been submitted and approved by the following review board: Comissão de Ética do Centro
      Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental (Lisbon West Hospitals Centre's Ethical Committee)
      Institutional Review Board.
