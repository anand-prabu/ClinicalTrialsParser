      This study will investigate if adding complementary therapies such as acupuncture, massage
      and reiki to inpatient pediatric cancer care is feasible and what the effects are on
      outcomes such as patient symptoms, cost, safety, satisfaction and  length of stay.

      Study Objective: To determine if a pediatric integrative medicine (PIM) service is effective
      in reducing overall  symptoms of pain, nausea/vomiting, and/or anxiety (PNVA), length of
      stay, and costs, in hospitalized children when compared to conventional care. In this
      context, &quot;integrative&quot; refers to a combined approach of complementary and conventional
      medical therapies in an evidence-based fashion.

      Design: cluster trial; 2-arm controlled evaluation study in pediatric oncology. Intervention
      will be offered during a 6-month PIM period following a 6 month control period.

      Population: Inclusion criteria: (i) In-patients in pediatric oncology and (ii) informed
      consent/assent. Exclusion criteria: (i) lack of parent participation, fluency in English, or
      informed consent

      Intervention: Recommendations for specific CAM therapies will be determined by a staff PIM
      pediatrician. Any combination of the following CAM therapies (dose, duration, amount to be
      based on patient need as assessed by CAM provider, patient, and parent):
      acupuncture/acupressure, massage, Reiki; all are to be offered in addition to usual care.

      Control: Usual care.

      Outcomes: Primary outcome: feasibility (i.e enrollment); Secondary outcomes: (i) PNVA
      symptom management, (ii) need for conventional pharmacotherapy, (iii) adverse events; (iv)
      parent and health care provider satisfaction with care provided, v) length of stay; and vi)
      cost-effectiveness (analysis of this outcome to be limited to patients admitted for at least
      2 days and for not more than 30 days).

      Significance: To our knowledge, this study will be the first comparative effectiveness trial
      to assess the impact of PIM for hospitalized children with cancer.
