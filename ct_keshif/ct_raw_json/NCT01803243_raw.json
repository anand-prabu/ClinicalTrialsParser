Therefore,\n      the purpose of this study is to use an enhanced trunk marker set in order to evaluate the\n      biomechanical effects of lower extremity treatments on spine dynamics in patients with\n      different pathologies.\n\n      It has been hypothesized that\n\n        1. the enhanced trunk marker set is a reliable method for the measurement of spine\n           dynamics during gait in patients with deviations occurring secondary to leg length\n           inequality.\n\n        2. the enhanced trunk marker set is a reliable method for the measurement of spine\n           dynamics during gait in patients that present both primary and secondary deviations\n           such as seen in hemiplegic and diplegic cerebral palsy.\n\n        3. treatment by means of either a shoe insole or a modified shoe with sole lift on the\n           shorter side has an effect on spine dynamics during gait in patients with leg length\n           inequality.\n\n        4. treatment by means of an ankle foot orthosis to control the foot position has an effect\n           on spine dynamics during gait in patients with hemiplegic and diplegic cerebral palsy.\n\n      To verify the hypotheses, instrumented gait analyses with a standard full body marker set\n      and the enhanced trunk marker set will be carried out before and immediately after an\n      orthotic lower extremity treatment in the respective patient group."
