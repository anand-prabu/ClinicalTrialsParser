Specifically, to determine whether the vaccine formulated\n      with and without alum induces CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) that may be\n      cross-reactive against multiple HIV-1 stains. Also, to determine whether boosting with the\n      vaccine orally or rectally will help induce mucosal antibody responses.\n\n      Induction of CD8+ CTL activity is considered a critical property for a candidate vaccine.\n      Additionally, since the majority of HIV-1 infections occur after inoculation of a mucosal\n      surface, it is desirable to induce mucosal immunity as well as systemic immunity. The HIV\n      p17/p24:Ty-VLP vaccine may potentially induce both CTL and mucosal antibody responses\n      against HIV-1."
