            "textblock": "Endometriosis is a hormone dependent disease of women, in which endometrial tissue (the\n      cells which line the uterus or womb) are found outside the uterus (womb). Some women with\n      endometriosis may be infertile. However, treatments for infertility such as in vitro\n      fertilization (IVF) or IVF with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF-ICSI) appear to be\n      less successful, i.e. the pregnancy rates are lower, for women with endometriosis than for\n      women who may be infertile for other reasons.\n\n      Since endometriosis is hormone dependent, it has been suggested that suppressing the\n      activity of hormones produced by the ovaries (which affect endometrial growth) may\n      inactivate endometriosis and so increase the chances of pregnancy. Recently it has been\n      proposed that taking the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) for 6 to 8 weeks before IVF or\n      IVF-ICSI treatment could be used for this purpose.\n\n      For our study, which is a randomised controlled trial, women with endometriosis meeting the\n      study criteria planning to undergo IVF or IVF-ICSI at the Oxford Fertility Unit will be\n      recruited. Study participants will be randomised into 2 arms: experimental group and control\n      group. The experimental group will be instructed to complete an 8 week course of OCP before\n      beginning standard IVF treatment. The control group do not take any study medication before\n      beginning standard IVF treatment. The IVF or IVF-ICSI treatment for both groups is not\n      altered by participation in the study.\n\n      The aim of the study will be to determine if pretreatment with OCP improves IVF or IVF-ICSI\n      success rates, such as live birth and pregnancy rates, in patients who suffer from\n      endometriosis. The study is funded by the Oxford Fertility Unit."
