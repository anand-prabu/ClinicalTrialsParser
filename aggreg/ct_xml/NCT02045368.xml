      This phase I dose escalation study will evaluate IGF-Methotrexate conjugate (765IGF-MTX) in
      patients with advanced, previously treated tumors.  765IGF-MTX is administered as an IV
      infusion over 1 hour on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28 day cycle.  Treatment continues until
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal. Assessment of response will
      be confirmed with imaging studies performed at the end of cycle 2, and every 2 weeks after.

             at the Pathology Department of the University of Illinois Cancer Center.

          3. Measurable or evaluable disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria (appendix II).

          4. Age ≥ 18 years.

          5. ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2 (appendix IV).

          6. Prior systemic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or biological therapy, radiation therapy
             and/or surgery are allowed; however prior use of methotrexate is not allowed.

                  human)

               -  At least 6 weeks since prior nitrosureas or mitomycin-C

          7. Patient must have recovered from the acute toxic effects (≤ grade 1 CTCAE v4) of
             previous anti-cancer treatment prior to study enrollment; the only exception is that
             grade 2 neuropathy is permitted

             Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1.5 X 109/L Hemoglobin1 &gt; 9 g/dL Platelets1 &gt; 100 X
             109/L Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN Alkaline Phosphatase, AST and ALT &lt; 3 X ULN (&lt; 5 x

          9. Negative urine or serum pregnancy test in females.  Male and female patients with
             reproductive potential must use an approved contraceptive method if appropriate (for
             example, abstinence, oral contraceptives, implantable hormonal contraceptives, or
             double barrier methods) during and for 3 months after the last dose of 765IGF-MTX.

         10. Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure
             not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Untreated or symptomatic CNS metastases.

          2. Radiation therapy to more than 25% of the bone marrow. Whole pelvic radiation is
             considered to be over 25%.

          3. ≥ Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy within 14 days before enrollment.

          4. Systemic infection requiring IV antibiotic therapy within 7 days preceding the first
             dose of study drug, or other severe infection.

          5. Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment or has New York Heart
             Association (NYHA - appendix IV) Class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina,
             severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of
             acute ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities. Prior to study entry, any
             ECG abnormality at Screening has to be documented by the investigator as not
             medically relevant.

          6. Pregnant or breastfeeding - methotrexate is Pregnancy Category X - has been reported
             to cause fetal death and/or congenital abnormalities. Confirmation that the subject
             is not pregnant must be established by a negative serum Beta-human chorionic
             gonadotropin (Beta-hCG) pregnancy test result obtained during screening.  Pregnancy
             testing is not required for post-menopausal or surgically sterilized women.

             the study.

          9. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions, or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for enrollment in this study.

         10. Recent (within 6 months) arterial thromboembolic events, including transient ischemic
             attack (TIA), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), unstable angina, or myocardial
             infarction (MI).

             abscess within 28 days prior to beginning study treatment.

         12. Abnormalities on 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) considered by the investigator to be
             clinical significant or baseline prolongation of the rate-corrected QT interval
             (e.g., repeated demonstration greater than 2 occasions of QTc interval &gt; 450
             milliseconds).

         13. History of cerebrovascular accident, pulmonary embolism or untreated deep venous
             thrombosis (DVT) within the past 6 months. Note: Subjects with recent DVT who have
             been treated with therapeutic anticoagulants for at least 6 weeks are eligible.

         14. Presence of any non-healing wound, fracture, or ulcer within 28 days prior to the
             first dose of study drug.

             chemically related to IGF or methotrexate.
