  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking and depressed mood are both predictive of mortality following Acute Coronary
      Syndrome. However, to date, no counseling treatment has been designed to target smoking
      cessation and manage mood in this population. This trial will test such a treatment based on
      Behavioral Activation, an approach that has shown promise as an integrated treatment for
      smoking and mood management in other populations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The occurrence of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS; unstable angina, ST and non-ST elevation
      myocardial infarction) can be conceptualized as a &quot;teachable moment,&quot; whereby patients may
      be more receptive to smoking cessation messages. Continued smoking following ACS is an
      independent predictor of mortality. Depressed mood post-ACS is also predictive of mortality,
      and smokers with depressed mood are less likely to abstain from smoking following an ACS
      hospitalization. Thus, a single, integrated treatment that targets both depressed mood and
      smoking could be highly effective in reducing post-ACS mortality. Behavioral Activation (BA)
      may be an ideal treatment for this population as BA can easily integrate both mood and
      smoking cessation related goals and it focuses on addressing restriction of valued
      activities, which is common in the post-ACS population.

      Thus, the overall aim of the current study is test a BA treatment manual that integrates
      smoking cessation and mood management for post-ACS smokers (Behavioral Activation Treatment
      for cardiac patients who smoke; BAT-CS). We will conduct an RCT (N=72) comparing BAT-CS (1
      in-hospital session and 5-9 post-discharge sessions) to Standard Care (SC; 1 in-hospital
      session and 5 mailed packets of printed self-help materials). Differences in smoking
      cessation, depressed mood, and positive affect will be compared between conditions.
