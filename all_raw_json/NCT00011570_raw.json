Electrical stimulation produces simultaneous contraction of sphincters with\n      the target organs, making emptying difficult.  By optimizing electrode placement, employing\n      a new electrode design and waveform choice, it is hoped to improve the 50% of subjects able\n      to defecate with existing approaches.  This is part of a multi-center study with multiple\n      support sources, including Rehab R&D, PVA and a commercial stimulator company."
