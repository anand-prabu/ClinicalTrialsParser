Other\n      muscular dystrophies (including Becker's muscular dystrophy) get worse much more slowly.\n\n      Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by a defective gene for dystrophin (a protein in the\n      muscles). However, it often occurs in people without a known family history of the\n      condition.\n\n      Symptoms usually appear before age 6 and may appear as early as infancy. They may include:\n\n      Fatigue\n\n      Learning difficulties (the IQ (intelligence quotient )can be below 75)\n\n      Intellectual disability (possible, but does not get worse over time)\n\n      Muscle weakness\n\n      Begins in the legs and pelvis, but also occurs less severely in the arms, neck, and other\n      areas of the body\n\n      Difficulty with motor skills (running, hopping, jumping)\n\n      Frequent falls\n\n      Trouble getting up from a lying position or climbing stairs\n\n      Weakness quickly gets worse\n\n      Progressive difficulty walking\n\n      Ability to walk may be lost by age 12, and the child will have to use a wheelchair\n\n      Breathing difficulties and heart disease usually start by age 20"
