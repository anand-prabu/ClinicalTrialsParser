            "textblock": "Gastroenteritis remains one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in children\n      <5 years of age worldwide. A critical factor in the reduction in mortality over the past 30\n      years has been the introduction of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) for the treatment of\n      dehydration.\n\n      However, its use has stagnated in many low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) where many\n      children lack access to alternatives such as intravenous (IV) rehydration. When such\n      children have fluid losses that cannot be replaced orally due to intractable vomiting, death\n      is common. Finding a safe, non-invasive, and effective strategy to reduce vomiting in\n      children would substantially decrease the need for IV rehydration and hence morbidity and\n      mortality in LMICs. Although antiemetic agents are included in the WHO list of Essential\n      Medicines, their use in children with gastroenteritis is not endorsed by the World Health\n      Organization (WHO). Concerns include a lack of evidence that antiemetic agents can improve\n      outcomes and that they are associated with dangerous side effects. However, in high-income\n      settings, studies on ondansetron, an antiemetic agent, have demonstrated that it can reduce\n      vomiting, IV rehydration, and hospitalization. Recent reviews by prominent organizations\n      (e.g. International child Health Review Collaboration; the Committee on the Selection and\n      Use of Essential Medicines) have indicated an interest in ondansetron use in children with\n      gastroenteritis, and they have concluded that further evidence is required. This trial aims\n      to determine  if the administration of a single dose of oral ondansetron results in improved\n      outcomes in children brought for emergency department care with vomiting and diarrhea in\n      Pakistan.\n\n      Two trials will be conducted under the umbrella of one study. The proposed trials will be\n      identical with the exception of the severity of dehydration at enrollment (either \"some\" or\n      none \"well\").\n\n      This study will have immediate impact on patient management. Based on the results, it will\n      be discovered if oral ondansetron plays a role in reducing the need for intravenous\n      rehydration in children with gastroenteritis in Pakistan. As ondansetron is now available in\n      generic formulations, and is relatively inexpensive, it is anticipated that if this study is\n      positive, ondansetron will be considered for inclusion in the WHO - gastroenteritis care\n      package. This could ultimately lead to a decrease in the need for intravenous rehydration in\n      children in countries such as Pakistan. Moreover, these findings will lead to a subsequent\n      study evaluating its potential benefit in outreach communities where treatments such as\n      intravenous rehydration are unavailable."
