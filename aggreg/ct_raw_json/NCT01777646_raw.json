It is anticipated that the study will be conducted at\n      the Department of Neurology & Laboratory of Neuroimmunology, at the Hadassah Hebrew\n      University Medical Center, Jerusalem in Israel. In addition, ALS patients could also be\n      referred to the clinical site above by other medical centers.\n\n      All patients enrolled will have a documented history of ALS disease prior to study\n      enrollment. Patients diagnosed as early stage ALS disease with duration of less than 2\n      years. ALS patients identified as \"predisposed\" will be approached and requested to sign an\n      Informed Consent Form (ICF). Overall, 14 patients will be recruited.\n\n      Treatment will start with the lowest dose (94x106 cells) and the dose will be increased to\n      the next medium and high dose (141x106 and 188x106 respectively), for the next patients\n      group only following safety analysis.\n\n      The expected duration of patient screening period prior to enrollment into this study is\n      in-between two weeks up to 2 days prior to the study enrollment day during visit 2\n      (verification of compliance with inclusion/exclusion criteria including clinical laboratory\n      results). Eligible patients will be enrolled into the study and will be observed for every\n      month during a \"run in period\" of 3 months for determination of the progression rate of the\n      disease (allowing a time window of \u00b1 5 days for all visits). During the \"run in period\"\n      after about 6 weeks following enrollment, patients of both study groups will undergo a Bone\n      Marrow Aspiration (BMA) procedure and MSC-NTF cells will be produced from the bone marrow\n      aspirate based on Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Ltd proprietary method. On the last \"run in\n      period\" visit, patients will undergo the treatment and MSC-NTF will be transplanted by IM+IT\n      to the early ALS patients.\n\n      After the MSC-NTF transplantation patients will be observed on a monthly basis for a post\n      treatment follow up period of 6 months (allowing a time window of \u00b1 5 days for all visits).\n      Treatment safety, adverse events and exploratory parameters, to establish ALS progression\n      rate assessment of the disease will be recorded throughout the duration of the \"run in\n      period\" and the post treatment follow up period."
