Ablation therapy, such as radiofrequency ablation uses a\n      high-frequency, electric current to kill tumor cells. Ablation therapy, such as microwave\n      ablation kills tumor cells by heating them to several degrees above normal body temperature.\n      Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and\n      cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving ablation therapy together with stereotactic body\n      radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells."
