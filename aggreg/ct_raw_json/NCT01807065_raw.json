To assess the effect of radiation therapy to single metastasis on immune response\n      (antibody and T-cell proliferation to prostate acid phosphate [PAP] and fusion protein\n      PA2024) generated by sipuleucel-T immunotherapy.\n\n      II. To assess the effect of external beam radiotherapy to single metastasis on prostate\n      specific antigen (PSA) response to therapy with sipuleucel-T.\n\n      III. To assess the effect of external beam radiotherapy to single metastasis on radiographic\n      response rate to therapy with sipuleucel-T.\n\n      IV. To assess the time from the onset of therapy with sipuleucel-T +/- radiation to the need\n      for subsequent therapy for prostate cancer.\n\n      V. To assess the toxicity associated with sipuleucel-T +/- radiation.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM A: Patients receive sipuleucel-T intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes days 22, 36, and 50.\n\n      ARM B: Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy in weeks 1-2. Patients also receive\n      sipuleucel-T as in Arm A.\n\n      In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up until week 60."
