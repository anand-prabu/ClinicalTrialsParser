Monoclonal antibodies, such\n      as brentuximab vedotin, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of\n      cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry\n      cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine\n      hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing\n      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving brentuximab vedotin together with\n      gemcitabine hydrochloride may kill more cancer cells."

To define and describe the toxicities of brentuximab vedotin in combination with\n      gemcitabine administered on this schedule.\n\n      III. To determine the complete response (CR) rate after treatment with four cycles of\n      gemcitabine with brentuximab vedotin among patients with relapsed or refractory HL.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I.
