    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop innovative immunological read-outs and new technologies in order
      to further characterise the early immune response and its kinetics as well as the adaptive
      immune responses to adjuvanted vaccines.

      This study will also evaluate the reactogenicity in healthy, hepatitis B virus naive adults
      vaccinated with the hepatitis B surface antigen in combination with a GSK Biologicals'
      Adjuvant System.

      This study will be conducted in 2 steps:

        -  Step 1 will aim at the development of innate and adaptive read-outs. This evaluation of
           the early immune response will lead to the selection of the most informative
           time-points for Step 2.

        -  Step 2 will gather additional data on the cellular component of the vaccine-induced
           immune response at selected time-points and will evaluate additional exploratory
           read-outs of the innate immune response.

      There will be 2 study groups in each step. The entire study period for Step 1 is from Day
      -30  to Day 210 (240 days). The entire study period for Step 2 is from Day 0  to Day 210
      (210 days).
