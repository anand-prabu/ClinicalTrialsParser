  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fetuin-A levels are reported to be low as a negative acute phase reactant in systemical
      inflammatory situations. Hashimoto thyroiditis is characterized with inflammation. In this
      study, we hypothesised that the serum fetuin A levels could be found to be low due to
      inflammation in patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis

      Patients ≥ 20 years of age being followed up at the outpatient clinics of the Internal
      Medicine Department in Medeniyet University Goztepe Training and Research Hospital and
      fulfilling the eligibility criteria will be included in the study. Approval of the local
      ethics committee and informed consent of the participants will be received for the study.
      The study is conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Demographic
      characteristics, concomitant diseases, smoking and alcohol drinking habits, concomitant
      medication usage, anthropometric and biochemistry data of the eligible patients will be
      recorded. Patient group will consist of patients with newly diagnosed Hashimoto thyroiditis
      and the control group will consist of healthy volunteers.

      Groups will be compared according to their demographic, an¬thropometric and biochemistry
      data and serum fetuin-A levels. In order to detect the relationship between the serum
      fetuin-A levels and clinical features, correlation analyses will be done.
