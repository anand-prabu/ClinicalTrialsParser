      The aim of the study is to generate additional safety and immunogenicity data to support the
      registration of the product in Japan.

      Primary objectives:

        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of SP306 versus DT (DT BIK® 0.1mL) vaccine in terms
           of diphtheria and tetanus booster response rate (proportion of subjects with booster
           responses) and seroprotection rate (percentage of subjects with antitoxin
           concentrations ≥0.1 IU/mL) at 28 days (window 28-35 days) after one injection in
           Japanese adolescents 11-12 years of age.

        -  To evaluate the immune response of SP306 against the pertussis antigens PT and FHA in
           terms of booster response rate (proportion of subjects with booster responses) at 28
           days (window 28-35 days) after one injection in Japanese adolescents 11-12 years of
           age.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To further evaluate the immune response of the study vaccines against diphtheria,
           tetanus and pertussis antigens.

        -  To assess the safety of the study vaccines after one injection in Japanese adolescents
           11-12 years of age.

      Study participants will receive either a single dose of SP306 vaccine intramuscularly or a
      dose of DT BIK® vaccine subcutaneously. They will be monitored after vaccination for
      immediate adverse events (AEs) solicited injection site and systemic reactions and
      unsolicited AEs including serious adverse events throughout the study period, approximately
      28 days (+7 days).
