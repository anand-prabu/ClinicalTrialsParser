            "textblock": "Osteoarthritis (OA) affects approximately 10% of people older than 60 years, and compromises\n      the quality of life of more than 21 million North Americans. Studies on the use of\n      complimentary and alternative medicines have reported that OA patients in the US are among\n      the highest users of CAM. Previous studies on a unique natural mineral product SierraSil\u00ae\n      demonstrated an improvement in joint health and function in subjects with mild to moderate\n      OA of the knee. Extracts of Sierrasil\u00ae are reported to reduce cartilage degradation in\n      response to IL-8 and nitric oxide production suggesting an ability to suppress IL-8 mediated\n      events in human cartilage.  The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of SeirraSil\n      Joint Formula versus placebo on the symptoms of osteoarthritis as assessed by WOMAC\u2122\n      Osteoarthritis Index Pain subscale in subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee."
