            "textblock": "Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of acute respiratory illness and hospitalization in\n      infants and young children. The mainstay of treatment is supportive care, which includes\n      frequent nasal suctioning, intravenous fluid hydration, and supplemental oxygen for\n      hypoxemia.\n\n      The airways normally heat and humidify inspired ambient air to core temperature amd 100%\n      relative humidity at the carina. This environment, at core temperature, allows for optimal\n      mucociliary clearance. Supplemental oxygen delivered via wall source is cold and dry, and\n      does not reach core temperature and 100% humidity until some point distal to the carina,\n      past the main bronchi. This presses on the lower respiratory tract to assist in heat and\n      moisture exchange and thus decrease ciliary function. This, in combination with\n      bronchiolitis, can impair mucociliary clearance.\n\n      Specific aim 1: Determine the effect of heated and humidified oxygen therapy on clinical\n      improvement in children with bronchiolitis, based on Respiratory Distress Assessment\n      Instrument (RDAI) and respiratory rate (RR).\n\n      Specific aim 2: Determine the effect of heated and humidified oxygen therapy on length of\n      hospital stay, duration of supplemental oxygen requirement, and frequency of inhaled\n      therapies in children with bronchiolitis."
