The investigators will compare the change in cardiovascular health,\n      bone health, sexual function, quality of life, and menopausal symptoms over 3 years of\n      follow-up between women who undergo RRSO (baseline just prior to surgery) and age-matched\n      controls that do not undergo RRSO.\n\n      The investigators hypothesis is that women who undergo a premature surgical menopause\n      induced by RRSO have worse cardiovascular health and bone health compared with women who do\n      not undergo RRSO."
