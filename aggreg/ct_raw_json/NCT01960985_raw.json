It is a double blinded, randomized clinical trial performed at Center of Research of the\n      courses of Speech Therapy, Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy of S\u00e3o Paulo\n      University.\n\n      Forty two patients with idiopathic PD will take part in this study, at stages 2 to 3 of the\n      Hoehn and Yahr Classification (HY). They are randomly assigned into one of 3 groups: one\n      group receiving motor training associated to external cues (ET),  the other  one group\n      performing motor training only (MT) and a third group receiving no treatment just generalize\n      orientations. Performance in gait and balance are assessement before and after 10 training\n      sessions (two 45-minute sessions per week) for the ET and MT groups, and before and after 5\n      weeks for the CG, using the BERG test (BT), Postural Stress Test (PST), Time Up and Go\n      (TUG). Patients are also assessment for independence in daily life activities and motor\n      performance using section II and III of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale\n      (UPDRS); for Quality of Life using the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life (PDQL), and for\n      emotional state by Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI). The training consist on: the\n      experimental group receiving the motor program to balance associated to rhythmical auditory\n      cues. The directions of the training were I. self-perception (strategies - Verbal and visual\n      guidance); II. motor performance (Speed variation, Range of motion, Trunk mobility, Turning,\n      balance exercices); III. Attention Strategies (Division of attention between guidance,\n      environment and yourself movement, Maintenance of attention during all sets); IV. Cues.\n\n      The training program consisted on 5 weeks with 45 minutes duration, divided in 05 minutes\n      warm-up, 30 minutes main part, 10 minutes cool down. The control group (CG) wasn't training\n      just received orientations. Each session will consist on 05 minutes Warm-Up including:\n      Muscle stretching, joint movements, upper and lower global, movement slowly and using wide\n      joint movement range, and turning. The Main Part including: Head movement (bending,\n      rotation, and leaning sideways), Axial and proximal movements, coordinated movements with\n      Upper and Lower range and speed, Functional reach, weight shifts, stationary and walking\n      gait with rhythmic and speed variation, postural reactions, trunk rotation, Balance\n      exercises. And the last part is the Cool Down, including: Slow walk, breathing exercises\n      associated to Upper limb movements and global muscular relaxation and stretching.\n\n      During the study there aren't changes on patient's usual medicine. The subjects will be\n      reassessment after 4 and 30 weeks without the program training."
