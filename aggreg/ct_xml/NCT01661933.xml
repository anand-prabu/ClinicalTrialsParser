  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We have established that the hookworm Necator americanus (Na) dramatically alters the local
      and systemic immune landscape of the infected human host. Consistent with the principle of
      desensitisation, diet managed celiac disease subjects previously infected by us with Na will
      be invited to receive small incremental doses of gluten as pasta (3-25 mm straw of
      spaghetti) over 16 weeks. Each participant will then be carefully re-assessed to determine
      if it is appropriate to undertake a 12-week gluten challenge.

      Hypothesis The adaptive Th2/regulatory profile imposed by Na will promote gluten tolerance
      following a micro-dose desensitising programme.

      Primary Aim: To determine the safety and efficacy of Na as a tolerising agent in celiac
      subjects

      Specific Aim 1. Undertake a therapeutic pilot study comparing mucosal histopathology before
      and after a gluten challenge, to be preceded by a programmed desensitising micro-challenge
      using Na as a tolerising agent.

      Specific Aim 2. Assess systemic and mucosal immune responses to gluten micro-challenge, Na
      infection, and gluten re-challenge throughout the pilot study, to be referenced against
      hookworm-naive people with treated and untreated celiac disease.

      Specific Aim 3. Utilising blood and tissue from hookworm-naive celiac disease volunteers,
      undertake in vitro studies focusing on the effects of Na-derived excretory/secretory (ES)
      products on gluten-stimulated gut mucosal cell apoptosis, cytokine and gene profiles.

    <description>Biopsies will be fixed in neutral buffered formalin, processed and carefully orientated and embedded in paraffin wax. Sections (3 µm) will be stained with H&amp;E and immunostained with anti-CD3 and -CD8 (lymphocyte) and anti-CD94 (NK cell). All slides will be blinded and scores will be graded by Dr John Croese after which randomly selected counts will be verified by Dr Andrew Clouston. The Marsh score will be scored as Marsh 3A = 1, 3B = 2 and 3C = 3. CD3+IEL per 100 intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) will be counted at 24 randomly selected sites between the villus tip to the base of the crypt in each biopsy to establish a IEL:IEC ratio. The Vh:Cd ratios will be measured independently of the Marsh grading, to be performed on 10 randomly selected well-orientated sites. The null hypothesis is that hookworm infection will not protect against mucosal damage following 12-week exposure to gluten in celiac disease.</description>

    <description>Previously inoculated subjects will be further inoculated as previously undertaken with 20 3rd stage infective Na larvae (10 + 10 over 4 weeks). Four weeks after the 2nd inoculation, each participant will receive a micro-dose of gluten (10 mg daily) as pasta for 8 weeks, to be followed by a low-dose of gluten (50 mg daily) for 8 weeks. After this, a detailed assessment involving upper endoscopy and duodenal biopsy will be performed before deciding on an individual case basis that it is safe for the participant to proceed to challenge. A gluten challenge of 1 G (15-20 G of pasta or a ½ slice of standard white bread) twice weekly for 12 weeks will commence.</description>

    <description>After completion of the previously planned challenge, volunteers will be invited to extend the gluten challenge. The extension is for 4 weeks total. The gluten challenge is stepwise: gluten 10 mg daily for one week, 50 mg daily for one week and finally 3 grams daily for 2 weeks. The outcome measure is serum tissue transglutaminase to be compared before and after the intervention.</description>
