  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Generic antiepileptic drugs (AED) achieve blood concentration similar to the brand AED.
      However, controversies exist about efficacy and safety of substituting generic AEDs. Because
      even minor absorption and kinetic differences can elicit a breakthrough seizure in patients
      who are changed to a generic AED from brand AED. Therefore, more ideal evaluation of
      interchangeability from the brand AEDs to generic formulation of the same drug is three-way
      or four-way crossover study, which can evaluate within-subject variability in
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic. Investigator designed three-way crossover study aimed
      to assess bioequivalence of brand and generic topiramate, to measure scaled average
      bioequivalence, and to evaluate tolerability and side effect of generic topiramate.

    <measure>To Measure the Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve(AUC)0-t of generic and brand topiramate through pharmacokinetics study. To Measure the Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of generic and brand topiramate through pharmacokinetics study.</measure>

    <description>All comparisons of the drug formulations fulfill the bioequivalence criteria, with all 90% Confidential intervals(CIs) for Cmax and AUC being within the 80-125% acceptance range.
Scaling average bioequivalence that the acceptable bioequivalence limits of 90% CI of generic to brand topiramate will be those limits that are within and/or similar to the bioequivalence limits of the 90% CI of Brand to Brand topiramate</description>
