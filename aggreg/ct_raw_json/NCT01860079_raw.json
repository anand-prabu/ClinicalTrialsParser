In addition, it has been indicated that an early discharge policy may lead\n           to a substantial cost saving.\n\n        -  Although much work has been done in developing and validating risk scores that identify\n           low risk patients, data on the implementation of early discharge strategies have been\n           quite limited There are 3 randomised trials investigating the possibility of early\n           discharge after PPCI. However, certain limitations of these studies are preventing to\n           implement an early discharge strategy in all-comers, particularly because of the\n           underrepresentation of older patients in clinical trials. The verification of this\n           policy is also needed in patients with multivessel disease. The first prospective\n           randomized trial, the PAMI II,7 is partly obsolete as major changes have been made in\n           PPCI with respect to devices and adjunctive medication. The other two randomized trials\n           were single-center pilot studies with small number of patients.\n\n        -  Therefore, the above mentioned literature information warrants to test the\n           reproducibility of safety endpoints in a large scale multicenter trial, prior to\n           application of the early discharge strategy in clinical practice."
