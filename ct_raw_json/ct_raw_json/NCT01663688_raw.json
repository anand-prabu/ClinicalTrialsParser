OCT stands for Optical Coherence Tomography, a\n      technique that uses invisible wavelengths of light to make detailed images of the tissues at\n      the back of the eye.  These images provide information that physicians may use to help\n      diagnose eye conditions and/or to monitor changes in the eye during treatment."
