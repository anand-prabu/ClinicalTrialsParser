  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot sub-study of patients receiving myeloablative transplant using total body
      irradiation (TBI) or total marrow irradiation (TMI) in their preparative regimen. The
      objective of this stub-study is to estimate the heterogeneity in cellular proliferation
      (FLT-PET uptake) as well the heterogeneity in marrow composition distribution (measured
      using whole body water-fat MRI) using positron emission tomography imaging. This will be
      used to design future trials as well as to determine the feasibility of PET and MRI imaging.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of acute leukemia for which a myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell
             transplant is planned through one of the following University of Minnesota protocols:

               -  MT2006-24 &quot;Total Marrow Irradiation and Myeloablative Chemotherapy Followed by
                  Double Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation in Patients with Refractory Acute
                  Leukemia&quot;

               -  Any one of the current University of Minnesota myeloablative trials using total
                  body irradiation

          -  Aged 18 through 55 years

          -  Women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (diaphragm,
             birth control pills, injections, intrauterine device [IUD], surgical sterilization,
             subcutaneous implants, or abstinence, etc.) for the duration of the study (3 months
             post HSCT)

          -  Able and willing to provide written consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Otherwise eligible patients meeting one or more of the contraindicates for an MRI,
             may enroll in the study without undergoing the MRI:

               -  ferromagnetic implants

               -  history of shrapnel or shot gun injury

               -  too large to fit in the magnet (approximate body mass index â‰¥ 40)

               -  cardiac pacemakers or other implanted devices that are not MR-compatible

               -  claustrophobia

               -  large tattoos
