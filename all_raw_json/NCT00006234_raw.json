Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to\n      replace stem cells that were destroyed by the radioactive drug.\n\n      PURPOSE: This Phase I/II trial is studying the effectiveness of holmium Ho 166 DOTMP\n      followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have metastatic\n      Ewing's sarcoma or rhabdomyosarcoma that has spread to the bone."

Autologous peripheral blood stem cells are\n      infused on days 7-10.\n\n      Patients are followed at least weekly for 4 weeks and then monthly for 1 year or until\n      disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 4 patients will be accrued for this study."
