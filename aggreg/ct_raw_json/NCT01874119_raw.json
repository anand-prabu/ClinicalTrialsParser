            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of intravenous fosaprepitant\n      therapy to reduce nausea and vomiting during the treatment of high dose interleukin-2 (HD\n      IL-2) therapy for metastatic melanoma or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.  Fosaprepitant is\n      an intravenous (IV) medication that is FDA- approved for use in adults for the prevention of\n      nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy.  Fosaprepitant works by blocking the neurokinin-1\n      receptor, which is a receptor in the brain that is known to cause nausea and vomiting.  Past\n      studies estimate that up to 70% of patients undergoing treatment with HD IL-2 will have\n      nausea and/or vomiting.  While fosaprepitant has been used in clinical practice to treat\n      nausea and vomiting during HD IL-2, there have not been any studies done to see how well it\n      works.  All patients will receive treatment (IV fosaprepitant) during the study during\n      either the first or second hospital admission for HD IL-2.  On the admission that the\n      subject is not receiving IV fosaprepitant, the subject will receive placebo (a medicine that\n      looks like fosaprepitant, but is not active).  The study is double-blinded, which means\n      neither the subject, nor the study doctor will know to which group you have been assigned to\n      that admission (IV fosaprepitant or placebo).  This study design was chosen to limit the\n      potential for bias, which means the trial was designed to try to ensure that unknown factors\n      do not affect trial results.  When patients start the study, patients will be randomly\n      assigned to one of two groups: those who receive treatment (IV fosaprepitant) first and\n      those who receive placebo first.  During the first admission, subjects will be given the IV\n      fosaprepitant or IV placebo during admission.  During the second admission, subjects will\n      'crossover' and receive the other treatment that they did not receive during the first\n      admission.  Improvement in nausea and vomiting will be assessed by counting the number of\n      nausea and vomiting episodes, recording if the subject needs additional medication for\n      nausea and vomiting, and by using patient questionnaires."

Recording of whether or not pruritus was observed\n      will also be collected within the subject diary.  If a patient reports pruritus, the\n      severity of pruritus on the 1-100 scale visual analogue scale (VAS) will also be collected.\n      The study team will record any episodes of vomiting and the use of rescue therapy and ensure\n      completion of patient diary during inpatient portion.  Assessments will be made via\n      telephone contact to determine onset of any episodes of CINV during outpatient portion.\n      Safety assessments including adverse events (AEs) monitoring will be performed and assessed\n      using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0."
