  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conventional urethrography is the standard diagnostic evaluation for patients with a
      suspicion of urethral stricture. The radiation dose of this examination is 5-9 mSV.
      Sono-urethrography was introduced in 1988 (McAninch et al. , J Urol 1988); the diagnostic
      accuracy of sono-urethrography is equal compared to conventional urethrography, with even a
      better measurement of stricture length and degree of spongiofibrosis with
      sono-urethrography. However, sono-urethrography remained underused among urologists and
      radiologists.

      Patients will be randomly assigned into two groups:

      Group A: conventional urethrography Group B: sono-urethrography In case sono-urethrography
      is inconclusive or of poor quality, a conventional urethrography will be performed.

      The radiation dose in the two groups will be measured. The stricture length and location
      will be recorded and compared with the perioperative findings in order to evaluate the
      diagnostic accuracy. The complications of the procedure(s) will be recorded with a
      questionnaire directly after and two weeks after the conventional or sono-urethrography.
