AD has a complex pathogenesis, characterized by: 1)\n      immune activation with increased numbers of T-cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and increased\n      expression of inflammatory molecules 2) marked epidermal hyperplasia in chronic diseased\n      skin, and 3) defective barrier function with increased trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) and\n      decreased lipids, reflecting underlying alterations in keratinocyte differentiation.  AD is\n      predominantly a Th2 (IL-4, IL-13, and IL-31) disease, and recently was also found to be a\n      \"T22\" (IL-22) polarized disease.\n\n      ILV-094 is an anti IL-22 antibody and therefore should reverse the immune activation of AD.\n      This study is being done to assess the safety, tolerability, clinical efficacy, and\n      mechanism of action of ILV-094 in patients with AD."
