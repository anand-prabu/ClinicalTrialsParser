            "textblock": "This is a phase II, open label study to determine the efficacy and safety of treatment with\n      MEK162 in patients with a diagnosis of select solid tumors or hematological malignancies\n      that have been pre-identified (prior to study consent) to have activations of the\n      RAS/RAF/MEK pathway and whose disease has progressed on or after standard treatment.\n\n      Genomic profiling is becoming more accessible to patients and their physicians. This is a\n      signal-seeking study to match patients with mutations in RAF, RAS, NF1 or MEK to the\n      ATP-noncompetitive MEK 1/2 inhibitor, MEK162. Pre-identification of these mutations or\n      activations in the pathway will be performed locally at a CLIA certified laboratory prior to\n      screening for participation on the trial.\n\n      Once the patient has been identified, treating physicians who are qualified investigators\n      may contact Novartis to consider enrollment in this study. For the purpose of this study,\n      genomic profiling is not considered part of screening. Informed consent must be signed\n      before any screening activities take place. Once eligibility (screening criteria met) has\n      been confirmed by Novartis, the patient will initiate therapy with single agent MEK162. The\n      patient may not receive any additional anti-cancer therapy during treatment with MEK162.\n\n      Patients will continue to receive study treatment until disease progression (assessed by\n      RECIST 1.1 or appropriate hematologic response criteria), unacceptable toxicity, death or\n      discontinuation from study treatment for any other reason (e.g., withdrawal of consent,\n      start of a new anti-neoplastic therapy or at the discretion of the investigator), otherwise\n      known as End of Treatment. All patients who discontinue from study treatment due to disease\n      progression must have their progression clearly documented.\n\n      Disease assessment (per RECIST 1.1 or appropriate hematological response criteria) will be\n      performed every 8 weeks (\u00b14 days) after first dose of study drug (Day 1 of every odd cycle),\n      until disease progression or end of treatment, whichever occurs first. The frequency of\n      disease assessment may be reduced to every 12 weeks for patients who have at least 4\n      post-baseline disease assessments and are clinically stable (except AML and MM patients).\n      Scans will be assessed locally by the investigator. After discontinuation of treatment,\n      patients, regardless of reason for treatment discontinuation, will be followed for safety\n      for 30 days after the last dose.\n\n      All patients will be followed for survival status every 3 months for 2 years after the last\n      patient has enrolled in the study regardless of treatment discontinuation reason (except if\n      consent is withdrawn or patient is lost to follow-up.)"
