Hence, early intervention is desirable to prevent any\n      damage to the kidneys. In the early stage of diabetic nephropathy, endothelium dysfunction\n      is a key pathogenetic process as indicated by increased leakage of albumin through the\n      glomerular barrier (2).\n\n      Hence, improvement of endothelium function is an attractive therapeutic goal of antidiabetic\n      medication. Endothelial dysfunction, in particular basal nitric oxide activity, has been\n      also identified as pivotal determinant of glomerular filtration rate (3).\n\n      A new and promising class of antidiabetic drugs are the gliptins. Gliptins act by inhibiting\n      the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), which is responsible for the rapid inactivation\n      of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) - an incretin hormone of the gut (6 - 8), thereby\n      enhancing and prolonging the effects of GLP-1. GLP-1 - member of the incretin hormones - is\n      released into the blood after meal ingestion and stimulates the insulin secretion in a\n      glucose dependent manner.

However,\n      infusion of GLP-1, the incretin hormone affected by gliptins has been reported to ameliorate\n      endothelial dysfunction in patients suffering from coronary artery disease (9) and it was\n      recently shown that infusion of GLP-1 into healthy human subjects increases both normal and\n      ACh-induced vasodilatation (10).

Endothelial dysfunction, in particular basal nitric oxide activity, has been\n      also identified as pivotal determinant of glomerular filtration rate (3). Previously,\n      blockade of the renin angiotensin system have been found to be effective in improving\n      endothelium function (4). Furthermore, we observed that renal endothelium function is\n      improved by cardiovascular risk factor control (e.g. blood pressure) and may be predictive\n      for the development of diabetic nephropathy (5).\n\n      A new and promising class of antidiabetic drugs are the gliptins. Gliptins act by inhibiting\n      the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), which is responsible for the rapid inactivation\n      of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) - an incretin hormone of the gut (6 - 8), thereby\n      enhancing and prolonging the effects of GLP-1.

This accounts for the marked prandial insulin response, which\n      prevents prandial hyperglycemia. Several efficacy studies demonstrated a significant\n      improvement of HbA1c with gliptins. In addition, gliptins improved fasting as well as\n      prandial glucose levels and did not induce weight gain. Due to these positive metabolic\n      effects in combination with a very small spectrum of side effects gliptins might very well\n      be part of the standard therapy for type 2 diabetes in the future.\n\n      Apart from surrogate parameters like reduction of fasting and postprandial blood glucose\n      levels or improvement of HbA1c, the effect of gliptins on micro- and macrovascular function\n      and cardiovascular outcome has not been the primary focus of current studies.

Gliptins\n      reduce hyperglycemia and hyperglycemic peaks by preventing inactivation of GLP-1, which\n      exerted beneficial effects on the endothelium in previous studies.\n\n      It is of major interest whether therapy with gliptins improves endothelial function of the\n      micro- and macrovasculature.
