  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valve disease in the United States and most common
      indication for valve replacement surgery. Anatomical and hemodynamic severity of AS is
      insufficient for elucidating patients' prognosis. Therefore, the decision about the optimal
      timing of surgical intervention remains critical. However, the changes in structure and
      electrical activity of the cardiac muscle can be assessed by noninvasive imaging and
      electrocardiography (ECG). Degenerative myocardial changes characterized by fibrosis or
      collagen deposits are frequently observed in AS patients and have a negative impact on
      patient outcomes. In this project, our objective is to determine whether echocardiographic
      image analysis of integrated backscatter (IB), which can express changes in myocardial
      tissue composition (amount of fibrosis) based on its ultrasound reflectivity, global left
      ventricular (LV) load as measured by Zva, and ECG analysis of the duration of the QRS
      interval have a role in risk stratification for AS patients and to apply those methods to
      identify which patients would benefit from surgical intervention.

      The investigators hypothesize that 1) the severity of myocardial damage can discriminate the
      prognosis in patients with AS, and 2) IB, Zva, and QRS interval can be diagnostic measures
      of the severity of myocardial damage. The investigators will measure the severity of
      myocardial fibrosis using MRI (reference) in 50 patients and will test the diagnostic
      significance of IB (testing method). Zva, QRS duration, and conventional echocardiographic
      measures will also be tested for diagnosing severity of myocardial fibrosis.
