Peripheral Nerve Stimulation (PNS) has obtained the European Conformity\n      mark for the treatment of chronic refractory neuropathic pain and is now commonly used in\n      some countries to target back pain. However, the potential value of combining SCS and PNS as\n      \"hybrid stimulation\" remains poorly described with only isolated case reports or limited\n      experience in various indications.\n\n      The \"CUMPNS\" comparative randomized study is designed to demonstrate the potential analgesic\n      efficacy of PNS in addition to previously implanted SCS, to treat the residual low back pain\n      component pain in refractory FBSS patients."
