However, the\n      hemodynamic changes during one lung ventilation have not been fully investigated. The goals\n      of this study are to compare the changes of hemodynamics (including blood pressure, heart\n      rate, cardiac output, pulse pressure variation, fluid responsiveness) and cerebral oximetry\n      during one lung ventilation between conventional intubated and non-intubated vedio-assisted\n      thoracoscopic (VATS) operations."
