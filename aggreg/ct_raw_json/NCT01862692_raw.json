            "textblock": "Parents of infants living in poverty are at significantly elevated risk of a host of\n      detrimental outcomes, including the development of child behavior problems, neglect and\n      abuse of children, child learning problems and parental substance abuse. Research has found\n      that early interventions to improve parenting practices were effective to ameliorate these\n      outcomes. Yet, there exist major obstacles to the effective delivery of mental health\n      services, particularly in rural areas. The need of rural families for mental health services\n      is reaching crisis proportions due to the dearth of trained professionals. In addition, the\n      meteoric rise of Internet use has created a new avenue for people to communicate and share\n      ideas. These two trends are helping fuel the demand for mental health services and on-line\n      support.\n\n      Internet programs can be interactive and provide social support from peers and\n      professionals. Through the use of recent advances in multimedia technology and software as\n      well as the rise of computer networking via the Internet, there now exists an opportunity to\n      provide such monitoring of outcomes and remote contact for rural locations. Prior\n      developmental R34 research (\"Infant Net\") successfully adapted and pilot tested an existing\n      empirically proven parenting program, for delivery via the Internet, enhanced with weekly\n      professional contact. This research provided 40 mothers of infants 3.5 to 7 months (at\n      enrollment) with a computer, computer camera, Internet connection, and technical\n      training/support for 6 months to evaluate the digital translation. Mother-infant dyads were\n      randomized to Experimental or Computer/Control conditions. Results found significant change\n      with infant-behavioral and positive trends were demonstrated in parenting behaviors. Mothers\n      rated the both computer program and interaction with coaches to be very high. These\n      encouraging developmental research results provide a very good empirical base for a fully\n      powered randomized control trial to test effectiveness."

Mothers in this condition will receive the same number of contacts with the computer and coach as mothers in the InfantNet condition and will participate in weekly phone calls with a coach.
