  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Combined treatment with eltrombopag (EP) and lenalidomide (CC-5013; REVLIMID) will reduce
      the incidence of thrombocytopenia due to Lenalidomide and enable patients to tolerate
      duration of therapy leading to higher rates of response.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for this study is that combined treatment with eltrombopag (PROMACTA) and
      lenalidomide (REVLIMID) will reduce the incidence of lenalidomide induced thrombocytopenia
      thus enabling patients to tolerate the required duration of lenalidomide therapy leading to
      higher rates of response to lenalidomide. A major reason why lenalidomide cannot be used for
      the treatment of MDS is because of the occurrence of thrombocytopenia. The use of
      eltrombopag will potentially raise platelet counts in these patients and enable a longer
      exposure to lenalidomide. Secondly, thrombocytopenia in the first 2 months after
      lenalidomide therapy predicts the subsequent response to lenalidomide treatment in patients
      with low risk MDS thus raising platelet counts to enable continuation of Lenalidomide
      therapy is important in these patients. Lastly, an increase in blasts has been a potential
      concern with the use of thrombopoietin mimetics. Preclinical studies have indicated that
      eltrombopag is less likely to increase blasts thus making it a possible potential
      therapeutic candidate in low risk MDS.

    <description>Patients with platelet counts &gt;=50k at baseline: These patients will start with Lenalidomide at 10mg/d for 3 weeks/month, and will not start eltrombopag until the platelet counts drop below 50k. When it drops 50k Lenalidomide will be stopped and eltrombopag will be started and gradually titrated up to achieve a platelet count above 50k. Once a platelet count above 50k is achieved and maintained for two weeks, eltrombopag will be discontinued and Lenalidomide will be started as a single agent. The same process will be repeated if the platelets again fall below 50k and eltrombopag will be re-initiated at the dose that was last given to the patient. Once the platelets are increased to above 50k and maintained at this level for 2 weeks Lenalidomide will be started again and this time will be given concurrently with eltrombopag.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 18 years.

          2. Patient must have a documented diagnosis of MDS of at least three months duration
             (MDS duration ≥ 3 months) according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (see
             Appendix IV) or non-proliferative chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) (WBC ≤
             12,000/L)).

          3. Patients must have International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) categories of Low-
             or Intermediate-1-risk disease (see Section 6).

          4. Patients must have symptomatic anemia untransfused with hemoglobin ≤ 9.5 g/dL within
             8 weeks of registration or with red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependence (i.e., ≥
             2 units/month) confirmed for a minimum of 8 weeks before randomization.

          5. Patients must have IPSS score determined by cytogenetic analysis prior to
             randomization. Patients with cytogenetic failure and ≤ 10% marrow blasts will be
             eligible.

          6. Patients must be off all disease modifying therapy for MDS for 28 days prior to
             initiation of study treatment. Patients may receive hydrocortisone prophylactically
             to prevent transfusion reactions.

          7. Patients must not have documented iron deficiency. All patients must have documented
             marrow iron stores. If marrow iron stain is not available, the transferrin saturation
             must be ≥ 20% or a serum ferritin ≥ 100 mg/100 mL or soluble transferring receptor &lt;
             5mg/L.

          8. Women must not be pregnant or breastfeeding. Females of childbearing potential should
             have 2 negative pregnancy tests. The first test should be performed within 10-14
             days, and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing lenalidomide.

          9. Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males must agree to use 2 methods
             of an accepted and effective method of contraception and counseled on the potential
             teratogenic effects of lenalidomide. Effective contraception must be used by patients
             for at least 4 weeks before beginning lenalidomide therapy, during lenalidomide
             therapy, during dose interruptions and for 4 weeks following discontinuation of
             lenalidomide therapy. Reliable contraception is indicated even where there has been a
             history of infertility, unless due to hysterectomy or because the patient has been
             postmenopausal naturally for at least 24 consecutive months. Two reliable forms of
             contraception must be used simultaneously unless continuous abstinence from
             heterosexual sexual contact is the chosen method. Females of childbearing potential
             should be referred to a qualified provider of contraceptive methods, if needed.
             Sexually mature females who have not undergone a hysterectomy or who have not been
             postmenopausal naturally for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., who have had
             menses at some time in the preceding 24 consecutive months) are considered to be
             females of childbearing potential. It is not known whether CC-5013 (lenalidomide) is
             present in the semen of patients receiving the drug. Therefore, males receiving
             CC-5013 (lenalidomide) must always use a latex condom during any sexual contact with
             females of childbearing potential even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy.

         10. Patients must not have received prior therapy with lenalidomide (for more than 2
             months) nor eltrombopag.

         11. Patients must not have uncontrolled hypertension.

         12. Patients must have absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥500 cells/L (0.5 x 109/L).

         13. ECOG Performance 0-3 (ECOG).

         14. Prothrombin time (PT/INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) must be
             within 80 to 120% of the normal range at baseline.

         15. Patient is able to understand protocol requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pre-existing cardiovascular disease (including congestive heart failure, New York
             Heart Association (NYHA) Grade III/IV), or arrhythmia known to increase the risk of
             thromboembolic events (e.g. atrial fibrillation), or subjects with a corrected QT
             interval (QTc) &gt;450 msec.

          2. Patients determined to be at increased risk of arterial or venous thrombosis by the
             investigator

          3. Bone marrow fibrosis that leads to a dry tap.

          4. Female subjects who are nursing or pregnant (positive serum or urine -human chorionic
             gonadotropin (-hCG) pregnancy test) at screening or pre-dose on Day 1.

          5. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) preceding the first dose of study medication.

          6. Patients with documented liver cirrhosis

          7. Patients with splenomegaly with a spleen size &gt; 16cm.
