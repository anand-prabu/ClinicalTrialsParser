            "textblock": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was defined as abnormal glucose tolerance detected for\n      the first time in pregnancy. GDM is a well-known risk factor for developing overt diabetes\n      later in life, especially type 2 diabetes. About 50-60% of woman with prior GDM will develop\n      type 2 diabetes during their lifetime. Recent studies show that women with previous GDM\n      exhibit a markedly increased prevalence of the metabolic syndrome, even when glucose\n      tolerance is normal. For both maternal and future offspring, women with prior GDM need safe,\n      efficient, and acceptable choices for contraceptive methods that do not enhance their\n      already substantial risk to develop either overt diabetes or metabolic syndrome and\n      associated sequelae. The intrauterine device (IUD) is a very effective and reversible\n      contraceptive method without metabolic disturbances and therefore is an ideal contraceptive\n      for women with prior GDM. Progestins do not increase globulin production; thus, they do not\n      increase coagulation factors or blood pressure. A nonrandomized open-label prospective trial\n      of healthy obese, reproductive-age women in California were studied about the metabolic\n      effects of progestin-only long-acting reversible contraception  levonorgestrel-releasing\n      intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) and etonogestrel implant (ENG-I)] comparing with nonhormonal\n      contraception (NHC).  The changes in fasting glucose and insulin sensitivity were seen among\n      obese at 3 months."
