  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with advanced levodopa-responsive Parkinson's Disease and severe motor
      fluctuations despite optimized treatment with conventional oral Parkinson's Disease
      medications, treatment with Duodopa represents an alternative treatment option to improve
      motor, non-motor performance and overall quality of life. These benefits have been obtained
      in short and mid-term trials (mainly up to 2 years). Data on long-term effectiveness (5
      years of treatment or more) and safety are not available. Also data concerning the benefit
      of Duodopa on cognitive function, axial symptoms and disability have to be confirmed. Recent
      data on deep brain stimulation (DBS), the alternative option treatment in advanced
      Parkinson's Disease patients, showed that after 5 years from the implant, a worsening of
      axial symptoms (gait and balance) and after 1 to 3 years of speech could occur. Moreover, it
      has never been assessed if the benefit on motor and non-motor symptoms in patients treated
      with DUODOPA could be influenced by age and duration of the disease, as already shown for
      DBS implanted patients. This study should clarify the missing information on long-term
      benefit of Duodopa (up to 7 years) especially focusing on motor fluctuations and disability.
