Patients will sign an informed consent form prior to the surgery\n      and will be randomized to one of the antibiotic regimens. Patients will be closely followed\n      up to one year after surgery. The number of surgical site infections according to the NNIS\n      criteria and loss of breast implants will be compared between the two groups."
