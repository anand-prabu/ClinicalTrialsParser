  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pinhole glasses which is using pinhole effect may induce a functional change on the eyes,
      including Distance and near visual acuity(DVA, NVA), Pupil size, DOF, Accomodative
      amplitude, CS, Visual field(VF), Stereopsis.

    <description>check by Donder's push-up method. The subject was instructed to view the target letter (20/20 reduced Snellen number), which initially was positioned at approximately 40 cm. The target then was moved progressively closer to the patient's eye at approximately 5 cm per second until the subject noticed the target starting to blur.
