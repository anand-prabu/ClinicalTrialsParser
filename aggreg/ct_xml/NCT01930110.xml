  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Closed-loop strategy is composed of three components: glucose sensor to read glucose levels,
      insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the required
      insulin dosages based on the sensor's readings. A dual-hormone closed-loop system would
      regulate glucose levels through the infusion of two hormones: insulin and glucagon.

      The objective is to compare the efficacy of single-hormone closed-loop strategy and
      dual-hormone closed-loop strategy at regulating glucose levels during continuous exercise
      and interval exercise.

      The investigator hypothesized that dual-hormone closed-loop strategy is superior to
      single-hormone closed-loop strategy in regulating glucose levels during exercise periods.

      Closed-loop strategy is composed of three components: glucose sensor to read glucose levels,
      insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the required
      insulin dosages based on the sensor's readings. A dual-hormone closed-loop system would
      regulate glucose levels through the infusion of two hormones: insulin and glucagon.

      We aim to conduct a randomized two-way cross-over trial comparing single-hormone closed-loop
      strategy and dual-hormone closed-loop strategy to compare the two interventions during
      exercise periods in adults with type 1 diabetes. A moderate intensity exercise will be
      performed for 60 minutes at 60% of the maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max). A high intensity
      exercise will be 40 minutes of interval training. The interval training will be preceded by
      a 10 minutes warm-up and followed by a 10 minutes cool down.
