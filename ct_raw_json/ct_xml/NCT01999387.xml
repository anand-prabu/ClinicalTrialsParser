    <textblock>
      Food allergy is a potentially life threatening condition. The current practice consists of
      elimination diet and injectable epinephrine in case of a reaction.

      Recently, oral immunotherapy has emerged as a treatment for food allergy in milk eggs and
      peanuts.

      We conduct an oral immunotherapy program with ~500 patients so far. In this study we intent
      to follow patients who completed the program and assess their allergy status and quality of
      life.

      Food allergy is a potentially life threatening condition. The current practice consists of
      elimination diet and injectable epinephrine in case of a reaction.

      Recently, oral immunotherapy (OIT) has emerged as an treatment for food allergy in milk eggs
      and peanuts. Since 4/2010,a clinical OIT program for milk eggs and peanuts is performed at
      the Institute fir Allergy Asthma  and Immunology at Assaf Harofeh Medical Center with ~500
      patients so far. Patients with IgE-mediated food allergy that are &gt;4 years old are eligible.

      In this study we intent to follow patients who completed the program. Patients will fill a
      questionnaire regarding current consumption of the allergenic food, adverse reactions
      experienced and treatments required including the use of EpiPen. Patients underwent skim
      prick tests (SPT) for the allergenic food prior to initiation and treatment and will undergo
      SPT again upon entering the study. Blood tests for IgE, IGG4, basophil activation and
      cytokines will be obtained.

      Patients who are not consuming the allergenic food regularly will undergo an oral food
      challenge in clinic.
