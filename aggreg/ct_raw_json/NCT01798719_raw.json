Several authors have proposed dietary weight loss strategies to ameliorate or\n      reverse fatty liver because of the potential role of weight loss on the supposed risk\n      factors of liver injury, mainly insulin resistance, free fatty acid levels, and\n      pro-inflammatory and profibrotic adipokines. There are no definite data regarding how much\n      and how rapidly weight loss should be to have the more favorable effects, but in obese\n      children, the larger the weight loss, the larger the decrease of liver enzyme levels and the\n      lower the prevalence of NAFLD. The American Gastroenterological Association recommends a\n      weight loss target of 10% of baseline. A loss of at least 10% of body weight in obese\n      patients is associated with a normalization of previously abnormal liver function tests as\n      well as decreased hepatomegaly, but even a moderate weight loss (approximately 6% of\n      baseline weight) can improve insulin resistance and intrahepatic liver content."
