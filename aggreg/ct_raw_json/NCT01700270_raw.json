The purpose of this study is\n      to evaluate the effect of a CYP1A2 inhibitor, 100 mg fluvoxamine, on the PK of dovitinib\n      when administered at a dose of 300 mg on the dosing schedule, 5 days on/2 days off. The\n      study will consist of 2 phases: a Pharmacokinetic (PK) phase and a clinical treatment phase.\n      The DDI test will be conducted in the PK phase. The DDI test will assess the steady state PK\n      profile of dovitinib when administered alone and in the presence of the CYP1A2 inhibitor,\n      fluvoxamine (AUC 0-24h, AUC 0-72h and Cmax parameters).  During the clinical treatment phase\n      patients may continue to receive treatment with TKI258 until disease progression (assessed\n      by RECIST 1.1), unacceptable toxicity, death or discontinuation from the study treatment for\n      any other reason."
