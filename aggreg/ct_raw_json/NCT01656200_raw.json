            "textblock": "Japanese encephalitis (JE) live attenuated vaccine SA14-14-2 has been in use for more more\n      than 20 years in Asia. JE vaccine SA14-14-2 is licensed in India and has been widely used\n      since 2006. JE vaccines give protection by generating a neutralizing antibody response, but\n      both naturally exposed persons and patients with JE also have T cell responses. Whether JE\n      vaccine SA14-14-2 elicits T cell responses is unknown. This study tests the hypothesis that\n      T cell responses are generated in response to JE SA14-14-2 vaccination. The aim of this\n      study is to characterize T cell responses to JE vaccine SA14-14-2 in healthy people, and to\n      investigate differences in T cell responses between natural exposure, vaccination and\n      disease."
