Patients older than 65 years who are in complete hematological\n      remission will be randomized to be vaccinated with dendritic cells or to receive regular\n      follow-up care. The primary aim of this innovative immunotherapeutic study is to determine\n      whether the antileukemic effects seen in our previous phase I/II study can be confirmed in a\n      large cohort of patients and whether dendritic cell vaccination can significantly prevent\n      relapse and increase survival of AML patients by eradicating minimal residual disease.\n\n      Patients will be recruited at 8 different centers in Belgium. Recruitment will start in the\n      second half of 2012 and will last for three years or until 138 efficacy-evaluable AML\n      patients are included. In the interventional group, 69 patients will be treated during two\n      years with autologous dendritic cells loaded by messenger RNA electroporation with the\n      Wilms' tumor antigen (WT1). The dendritic cell therapy product will be generated and\n      generally administered in the coordinating center, which is the Antwerp University Hospital,\n      more specifically the Center for Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine (CCRG) and the\n      Division of Hematology, both headed by Prof. Zwi Berneman.  After inclusion of 138\n      efficacy-evaluable patients, relapse rate, relapse-free survival and overall survival\n      analysis will be performed. Tumor marker levels and immune activation will also be monitored\n      to compare the 2 groups at a molecular and immunological level."
