Full View v. Tab View

Tab View - has some additional stuff, Original vs. Current Primary and Secondary outcome measures (They were the same for this study though.), Submission date for current and original primary/secondary outcome measures, other outcome measures (there were none in this study), Target follow-up duration (not provided), biospecimen (not provided), Intervention (none), recruitment status(completed already though), has data monitoring committee (No), "Data element required by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors and the World Health Organization ICTRP" ,and links to change history. 

Full View - has some additional info I couldn't find on tab view page, not sure how important it is: Results First Received, Health Authority, Keywords, additional MeSH terms, date at which ClinicalTrials.gov processed the record, and one small warning about signing up for the study under contacts/locations.

Overall both of them are pretty similar, the information is just organized/presented in a different order/layout. Another difference might be that tab view seems to have a set lay-out so if something is missing it's listed as "not included or n/a" while if some element isn't present it's simply not mentioned in the full view?

For Study Results you have to open all the little panels that say like "show outcome measure 3" or "show adverse events" otherwise the text in these hidden panels doesn't show up in the HTML.

JSON - Contains information from both study view and full/tab view, contains pretty much all the info except maybe "publications automatically indexed to this study."
