    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether tobacco affects recovery from PTSD.  There
      are 3 goals of the study; (1) to test if quitting tobacco prior to PTSD treatment affects
      treatment success, (2) to test how PTSD symptoms change in those who have quit tobacco
      compared to those who continue to use and (3) to explore how tobacco use and tobacco
      withdrawal symptoms change during PTSD treatment.

      The proposed research aims to examine the effect of tobacco on PTSD symptoms and PTSD
      recovery as well as the effect of PTSD recovery on tobacco use.  This study has 3 aims: (1)
      to evaluate whether tobacco use interferes with recovery from PTSD during empirically based,
      trauma focused PTSD treatment.  (2) To gather preliminary data about whether tobacco use
      alleviates PTSD symptoms among continued tobacco users vs. recent quitters.  (3) To explore
      the impact of recovery from PTSD treatment on tobacco use quantity and frequency, tobacco
      withdrawal symptoms, and craving for tobacco.  To test these aims, we propose a randomized
      two group design where 50 participants are assigned to receive either tobacco treatment
      (Contingency Management plus Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) or control treatment (Health
      Education) before completing Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) for PTSD.  Study outcome
      variables will be PTSD symptom severity following CPT, PTSD symptom severity during tobacco
      cessation treatment, and tobacco use and tobacco withdrawal during CPT.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  current tobacco use (a urine cotinine level  200ng/ml),

          -  motivation to quit (measured by the  8 on the Biener Contemplation ladder,

          -  and a current diagnosis of PTSD [as diagnosed by the Clinician Administered PTSD
             Scale for DSM-5]

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria will include current participation in another research study,
             history of bipolar I disorder,

          -  schizophreniform disorders except for psychosis NOS due to presence of trauma-related
             sensory hallucinations,

          -  cognitive impairment (&lt;25 of the Mini Mental State Exam),

          -  current suicidality/homocidality requiring clinical intervention or a suicide attempt
             in the past 10 years,

          -  inability to provide reliable study data (e.g., provide an adulterated urine sample,

          -  provide misinformation to study staff including stating differing information to two
             or more staff members,

          -  attempt to misrepresent self in order to avoid being excluded from the study,

          -  inability to answer study questions which are used to determine eligibility),

          -  current non-tobacco substance use disorder (abuse or dependence or a positive drug
             screen; participants who have been abstinent for greater than 6 months will be
             allowed to participate),

          -  participation within the past 6 months in trauma-focused therapy (e.g., Prolonged
             Exposure, Cognitive Processing Therapy),

          -  current use of tobacco cessation pharmacotherapy (i.e., nicotine replacement therapy,
             bupropion or varenicline),

          -  serious or uncontrolled medical condition precluding unaided tobacco cessation
             attempts,

          -  pregnancy,

          -  a recent change in psychiatric medications (change occurred &lt;2 months prior to
             entering the study),

          -  current participation in another research study.

          -  In addition, participants must agree to keep psychiatric medication doses stable for
             the duration of the study (except for dose adjustments for changes in medication
             blood levels due to tobacco cessation), unless there is a concern for participant
             safety.
