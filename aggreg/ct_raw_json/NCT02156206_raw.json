While on average\n      10 cases are reported (excluding referrals at night by the police, between 7pm and 7:00\n      a.m.), the average daily capacity of operation is 6 cases. So, is not possible for the 123\n      women team to track all women who call in 24 hours. Women who cannot receive the services of\n      the 123 women team only get the emergency support of the police and do not receive\n      additional aid (while it is verified that the rights of women are respected and they are\n      guided to relevant services). The excess of demand over the capacity of the team of the 123\n      women line represents a natural experiment.\n\n      Women will be recruited from those who are attended by the 123 emergency women phone line\n      immediately as well as from those who were only attended by emergency support of the police\n      and may have received later the support of the 123 women line (control group). In a first\n      instance, women will be called to verify their address. A face to face survey will be\n      conducted by mid-2015."
