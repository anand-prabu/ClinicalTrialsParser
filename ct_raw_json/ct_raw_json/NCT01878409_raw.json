The knowledge of sexual function in PD might help  to plan effective\n      interventionist measures and ultimately to optimize patient's and the partner's quality of\n      life.\n\n      Parkinson patients (aged 40-80) and 123 healthy controls (aged 40-80) will be recruited from\n      four Italian Movement Disorders Clinics."
