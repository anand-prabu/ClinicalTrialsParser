This development is unique in its kind as not other research groups\n      have reported successful live recordings with calcium imaging in this preparation.\n\n      In particular, the investigators aim:\n\n        1. to develop and validate the technique to measure activity in human enteric nerves in\n           the submucous plexus isolated from rectal biopsies from healthy subjects and IBS\n           patients;\n\n        2. to characterize this nerve activity in healthy subjects and IBS patients using both\n           calcium imaging to evaluate the effect of different neuromodulators,\n           immunohistochemistry and rtPCR to determine receptor expression levels and identify\n           neurons and glial cells in the submucous ganglia;\n\n        3. to investigate whether the biopsies of IBS patients secrete more modulators/cytokines\n           compared to healthy subjects and their potential to activate neurons."
