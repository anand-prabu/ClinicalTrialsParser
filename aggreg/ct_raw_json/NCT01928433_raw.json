If a female and\n\n               1. subject is of childbearing potential, must have documented use of using an\n                  effective contraceptive method (such as IUD, hormonal birth control, condom and\n                  spermicidal jelly, etc.) during the study, Contraception must have been used for\n                  at least 2 months before starting the study. A documented negative urine\n                  pregnancy test must be provided and the subject must be non-lactating.\n\n               2. subject is of non-childbearing potential, must be post-menopausal (i.e. has had\n                  amenorrhea for a minimum of 12 consecutive months) or surgically sterile due to\n                  bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy.\n\n               3. subject is truly abstinent. This is accepted as a method of contraception, but\n                  only when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.\n                  Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation\n                  methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n\n          3. If a male, should agree to use reliable birth control methods (contraception or other\n             barrier device) during study participation.\n\n          4. Must have complicated lower urinary tract infection or acute complicated or\n             uncomplicated pyelonephritis (cPN or uPN; see section 5.3) and must have at least two\n             of the following acute signs and symptoms\n\n               1. Chills or rigors or warmth associated with fever (e.g. oral temperature greater\n                  than 38.0 degrees Celsius ).\n\n               2. Flank pain (pyelonephritis) or pelvic pain (cUTI).\n\n               3. Nausea or vomiting.\n\n               4. Dysuria, urinary frequency, or urinary urgency.\n\n               5. Costo-vertebral angle tenderness (pyelonephritis) on physical examination.\n\n          5. Provide one pre-treatment adequate urine sample (the urine sample must return a\n             positive culture in order for the subject to remain eligible for the study) For\n             males: midstream clean catch, for females: in-out catheterisation or midstream clean\n             catch. The urine sample must be provided within 24 hours before the start of\n             administration of the first dose of study drug.\n\n             A positive urine culture is defined as:\n\n               -  \u2265 105 CFU/mL of one causative pathogen in the case of cUTI\n\n               -  \u2265 104 CFU/mL of one causative pathogen in case of Pyelonephritis\n\n             A negative urine culture is defined as:\n\n               -  < 105 CFU/mL of causative pathogen/s and/or non-target pathogens at any number\n                  of CFUs in the case of cUTI\n\n               -  < 104 CFU/mL of causative pathogen/s and/or non-target pathogens at any number\n                  of CFUs in the case of Pyelonephritis Patients may be admitted to the study\n                  pending baseline urine culture results. Treatment should NOT be delayed pending\n                  urine culture results.\n\n             NOTE: Because biofilms on indwelling catheters (e.g. Foley catheters) are more likely\n             to be present after the catheter has been in place for a period of time, samples\n             should be collected following the placement of a new catheter. If the placement of a\n             new catheter is contraindicated or is not feasible, specimens should be collected\n             using aseptic techniques with the urine obtained through a properly disinfected\n             collection port. Urine samples should never be obtained from the collection bag.\n\n             If the subject's pre-treatment culture shows the presence of a ciprofloxacin\n             resistant pathogen the Investigator has to decide according to clinical signs and\n             symptoms whether the subject can stay in the study.\n\n             In the event of a negative urine culture, the subject must be withdrawn from the\n             study and switched to standard care, because the inclusion criterion is not\n             fulfilled.\n\n             A urine culture is defined as contaminated if:\n\n               -  at least one causative pathogen with  \u2265 105 CFU/mL is present AND at least one\n                  non-pathogen or additional causative pathogen/s at any number of CFU/mL are\n                  present in the case of cUTI\n\n               -  at least one causative pathogen with \u2265 104 CFU/mL is present AND at least one\n                  non-pathogen or additional causative pathogen/s with any number of CFU/mL in the\n                  case of pyelonephritis Subjects with contaminated urine cultures will be\n                  permitted to continue in the study, although this will impact on the subject's\n                  eligibility for analysis (see section 9.3).\n\n          6. Have pyuria (i.e. a dipstick analysis positive for leukocyte esterase or at least 10\n             white blood cells per cubic millimetre [1 \u00b5l]).\n\n          7. Be considered ill enough to be hospitalized for at least 3 days and require initial\n             parenteral therapy to manage cUTI and/or acute pyelonephritis by the standard of\n             care.\n\n          8. Provide written informed consent to participate in the study.\n\n          9. Be willing and able to comply with all study procedures and activities.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Uncomplicated cystitis in females.\n\n          2. Failed previous antibiotic treatment within the last 4 weeks due to culture confirmed\n             fluoroquinolone resistant pathogens.\n\n          3. Having ileal loops, urinary diversion with bowel segments or suspected or confirmed\n             vesico-ureteral reflux, suspected or confirmed perinephric or intrarenal abscess (if\n             an abscess is suspected an ultrasound should be performed to confirm and exclude).\n\n          4. History of renal transplant any permanent complicating factors of the urinary tract\n             (including complete obstruction, suspected or confirmed prostatitis or epididymitis)\n             which cannot be effectively treated during the therapy of the infection.\n\n          5. Indwelling urinary catheters expected to remain in place after therapy has been\n             completed.\n\n          6.

Any concomitant psychiatric, neurological or behavioural disorder, including epilepsy\n             or other lesions of the central nervous system sufficient in the opinion of the\n             Investigator to prevent or compromise the subject's participation in the study.\n\n         13.

Any surgical or medical condition which might interfere with the distribution,\n             metabolism or excretion of the drug, including, but not limited to moderate\n             (including estimated creatinine clearance of 30 - 59  mL/min) or severe impairment of\n             renal function (including an estimated creatinine clearance of < 30 mL/min),\n             requirement for peritoneal dialysis, haemodialysis or haemofiltration, or oliguria.\n\n         16.

Microbiological response is defined as Elimination or reduction of study entry pathogens to \u2264 10e3 CFU/mL on urine culture. The clinical and microbiological response will be assessed for each group on Day 17 and will be compared between the three groups to assess the efficacy in each group.\nThe micro-ITT population is composed of all randomized patients who have a baseline bacterial pathogen on culture of urine or blood that causes UTI against which the investigational drug has antibacterial activity.",
