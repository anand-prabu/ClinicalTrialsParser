Red ginseng and placebo\n      capsules were provided by the Korea Ginseng Cooperation (KGC, Daejeon, Korea).\n\n      Subjects met with the investigational team at four different time points: Screening (Week\n      -1), randomization and treatment baseline (Week 0), treatment midpoint (Week 6), and\n      treatment endpoint (Week 12). Daily intake by 24-hour recall method and physical activity\n      were measured at baseline (Week 0), midpoint (Week 6), and endpoint (Week 12) of the\n      treatment period. Compliance with study restrictions and capsule consumption was monitored\n      via daily documentation by subjects on individualized study calendars and end-study count of\n      returned capsules."
