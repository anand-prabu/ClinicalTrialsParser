      HYPOTHESIS: The investigators hypothesize that sonoelastography (SE) provide accurate
      quantitative measurements that can be used to stage liver fibrosis in pediatric patients
      with chronic liver disease.

      Specific Aims:

        1. To measure liver stiffness with sonoelastography in adults with suspect diffuse liver
           disease who will undergo nonfocal liver biopsy as part of their routine clinical care.

        2. To assess the sensitivity and specificity of sonoelastography for the detection and
           staging of liver fibrosis.

        3. To obtain sonoelastography values of the liver in healthy children (control subjects).
