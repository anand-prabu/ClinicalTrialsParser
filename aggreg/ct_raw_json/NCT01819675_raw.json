They will receive the rTMS over the primary motor\n      cortex of the dominant hand. Individual subject will receive three sessions of rTMS with\n      wash-out period (more than 3 days) between the rTMS sessions. Three rTMS sessions are high\n      frequency (10Hz), low frequency (1Hz) and sham rTMS. The order of rTMS sessions will be\n      randomly decided. After completing each rTMS session, [18F]flumazenil-PET will be checked.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to investigate 1)whether rTMS over the primary motor cortex\n      can modulate the [18F]flumazenil binding potential and 2)whether the modulation of\n      [18F]flumazenil binding potential by rTMS can be different according to the applied\n      frequency of rTMS."
