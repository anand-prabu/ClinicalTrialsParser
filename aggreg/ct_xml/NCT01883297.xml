  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I clinical study for patients with metastatic metastatic (the cancer has
      spread to other parts of the body) melanoma. Patients will receive an infusion (given by
      vein) of autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) which will first be taken from the
      patient, then be stimulated with certain substances called autologous dendritic cells (DCs)
      and OKT3 (anti-CD3 antibody), and then given back to the patient as an infusion. This is
      believed to make the TILs work better. TILs are a type of white blood cells that recognizes
      tumor cells and enter them which causes the tumor cells to break down. After infusion of
      TILs, low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy will be given.

          -  Patient must be 18 years of age or older

          -  Performance status of ECOG 0 or 1

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 5 months from date of consent of TIL evaluation

        Inclusion Criteria (Eligibility for Treatment):

          -  Signed and dated the informed consent

          -  Must have measurable, unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma

          -  No brain metastases or stable brain metastases for 3 months following definitive
             treatment.

             both genders must be willing to practice birth control during treatment and for 6
             months post completion of IL-2 treatment

          -  HIV positive

          -  With active hepatitis B or hepatitis C, syphilis, or HTLV

          -  Must not have any active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or other active
             major medical illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system,
             uncontrolled psychiatric disorders, or other conditions that may affect following
             study procedures.
