The use of mass-market sensors such as accelerometers offers a\n      promising solution for the general public due to the growing smartphone market over the last\n      decade.\n\n      Thus, the proposed EE estimation function has been created using accelerometry data\n      collected from 10 volunteers equipped with a smartphone and two research sensors (Armband\n      and Actiheart) used to estimate EE during several controlled activities. The research\n      sensors' data serves as reference during the creation and evaluation of the proposed\n      function.\n\n      It has been evaluated with data of 6 other volunteers in free-living conditions. This new EE\n      function using the smartphone technology is dedicated to light- and moderate-intensity\n      activities, and we believe it can be a new way to help people controlling their daily\n      physical activity level."
