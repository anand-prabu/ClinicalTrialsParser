To that end, 10 opiate dependent subjects will be recruited through the\n      University of Pennsylvania's Treatment Research Center, an outpatient substance abuse\n      treatment facility. All subjects will receive buprenorphine (Suboxone\u00ae) (16 mg/day, adjusted\n      as needed according to individual requirements)."
