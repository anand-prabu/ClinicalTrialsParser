To our knowledge, the relationship between\n      vancomycin and vaginal GBS colony counts has never been studied. In this prospective cohort\n      study, our objective is to determine the relationship between intrapartum IV vancomycin and\n      vaginal GBS colony counts."

Patients presenting to the emergency room for labor\n      evaluation/labor evaluation/pre-term labor evaluation, may be pre-screened for potential\n      eligibility. Patients subsequently admitted in labor/preterm labor or with rupture of\n      membranes with documented GBS positivity and plan for vancomycin for intrapartum antibiotic\n      prophylaxis will be approached for screening.

These patients will then be approached for screening\n\n      Data collection: Demographic information such as age, race, date of initial GBS culture and\n      time of rupture of membranes will be abstracted from enrolled patients' charts. Intrapartum\n      vaginal cultures will be collected with a vaginal swab from the distal vagina by trained\n      obstetrics and gynecology residents, attendings, nurses, nurse midwives and nurse\n      practitioners prior to the initiation of antibiotics and at two hour intervals until\n      delivery or after eight hours has elapsed.\n\n      Swabs will be transported to the lab. Colony counts will be determined via serial dilution.\n      Specimens will be diluted in sterile saline and inoculated onto Columbia Agar containing 5%\n      sheep blood, colistin (10 mg), and nalidixic acid (10 mg/L). After incubation for 48 hours\n      at 35 C in ambient air, the number of colonies on the dilution plates will be visually\n      counted and multiplied by the appropriate dilution factor for that particular plate."
