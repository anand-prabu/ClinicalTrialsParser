Patients must be scheduled to undergo coronary angiography for the purposes of\n             primary PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) culminating in successful stent\n             implantation.\n\n          3. Age between 18 and 80 years. Male and WOCBP (women of child bearing potential)\n             willing to use highly effective methods of contraception from the time of first dose\n             until 3 months after the last dose of the drug.\n\n          4.
