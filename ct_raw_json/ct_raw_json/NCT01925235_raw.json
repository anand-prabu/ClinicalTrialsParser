AKI is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and\n      mortality. Effective AKI prevention strategies are needed. Remote ischemic preconditioning\n      (RIPC) is a novel and successful strategy to attenuate contrast medium induced AKI in\n      patients undergoing elective coronary angiography.\n\n      The retrospective RenPro-TAVI Trial was designed to test the hypothesis whether remote\n      ischemic preconditioning might attenuate kidney injury in patients receiving transcatheter\n      aortic valve implantation (TAVI).\n\n      Patients with impaired renal function undergoing TAVI will be evaluated in respect whether\n      they received remote ischemic preconditioning before the procedure or not. This study will\n      give insight if RIPC might be beneficial in these patients."
