            "textblock": "Consumption of a high-fat meal results in a postprandial (fed-state) response characterized\n      by hypertriglyceridemia. Postprandial hypertriglyceridemia increases the oxidation of\n      low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and increases blood concentrations of several biomarkers of\n      in\ufb02ammation. This postprandial lipemia-induced oxidative stress mediated response to a\n      high-fat meal has been suggested as a major contributor to the pathogenesis of\n      atherosclerosis along with other chronic disease states of diabetes and obesity. Consumption\n      of foods rich in antioxidant compounds provides a defence source to compliment endogenous\n      defence systems to protect against oxidative damage during pro-oxidant conditions.\n\n      The hypothesis of the study is that tomato extracted lycopene will be able to decrease\n      postprandial oxidation and in\ufb02ammation in healthy weight men and women when compared to\n      Placebo."
