  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the relative feasibility of 2 potential functional
      measures of target engagement (Glx MRS, BOLD fMRI) as well as EEG measures to systematically
      assess mGluR 2/3 in drug development for psychotic spectrum disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of healthy subject to assess the feasibility of Glx MRS, BOLD fMRI,
      and EEG to measure ketamine induced changes in glutamatergic indices. The investigators will
      recruit 20 subjects at each site in order to complete 15 subjects at each site. Subjects
      will be randomized to ketamine or placebo in a 2:1 ratio and receive two drug challenges
      separated by at least two weeks. Ketamine challenge is used to induce a &quot;glutamate surge&quot;
      within prefrontal brain regions that can be detected using neurochemical and functional
      imaging techniques. Each subject will receive MRS and BOLD fMRI during each challenge day.
      The goal of the pilot study is to assess the feasibility of both the proposed ketamine
      challenge paradigm and of the proposed imaging-based biomarkers. Specific indices to be used
      in assessing feasibility will include effect size, cross-site and cross-subject reliability,
      safety, and subject tolerability as similar studies will be performed independently at Yale
      and UC Davis.  Second this information will be used to select and refine final study
      parameters for a subsequent full proof-of-clinical mechanism (POCM) study investigating the
      effect of Pomaglumetad on ketamine-induced MRS and fMRI effects.
