Determine the\n      pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive flavopiridol IV over 1 hour on\n      day 1. Treatment continues every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression. A cohort of\n      3-6 patients receives treatment at each dose level of flavopiridol. If dose-limiting\n      toxicity (DLT) occurs in no more than 1 of 6 patients, subsequent cohorts of 6 patients each\n      receive escalating doses of drug on the same schedule. Intrapatient dose escalation to the\n      next level is permitted in the absence of DLT.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 36 patients will be accrued for this study within 27\n      months."
