The hypothesis is that a single perioperative dose of\n      dexamethasone 8 mg will significantly reduce postoperative opioid consumption at 24 h in\n      women having cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia."

            "textblock": "Steroids have been used to reduce inflammation and tissue damage in a variety of conditions,\n      have potent immunomodulatory effects, and are a mainstay in the treatment of acute allograft\n      rejection. Dexamethasone has been shown to be a safe and effective anti-emetic therapy for\n      patients undergoing cesarean section surgery with spinal anesthesia containing morphine.\n\n      However, recent evidence suggests that dexamethasone may also play a role in reducing\n      post-operative pain and opioid consumption. Early studies in patients undergoing dental\n      procedures showed that glucocorticoids were effective in reducing postoperative pain and\n      edema. Multiple recent studies have also investigated the potential analgesic benefit of a\n      single perioperative dose of dexamethasone, but the results have been inconsistent.  The\n      effect of single-dose, intraoperative, intravenous dexamethasone therapy on post-operative\n      pain and opioid consumption has not yet been studied in patients undergoing cesarean\n      section.\n\n      Pain is a significant source of morbidity for many women following cesarean section, and has\n      serious consequences beyond the immediate post-operative period. Patients with\n      poorly-controlled pain may have difficulty with ambulation that can lead to atelectasis,\n      pneumonia, and venous thromboembolism.\n\n      Poor maternal pain control may also affect the infant by interfering with bonding and\n      breastfeeding. Reduction of post-operative opioid consumption is desirable because it may\n      also reduce the incidence of opioid-induced side effects such as sedation, constipation,\n      nausea, vomiting and pruritus. Some evidence suggests that the severity of post-operative\n      pain following cesarean section may predict progression to chronic pain, and postpartum\n      depression.\n\n      Although 10 to 18% of women who undergo cesarean section will experience chronic pain\n      following surgery, it is difficult to predict those patients who will experience this\n      complication. Recent investigations have shown that patient responses to standardized\n      painful stimuli prior to surgery help predict severity of post-operative pain and possibly\n      progression to chronic pain. This type of information could potentially help to tailor the\n      clinical management of patients at risk for severe and/or chronic post-operative pain to\n      improve outcomes for these patients.  Landau and colleagues have described a simple and\n      minimally-invasive method of assessing response to noxious stimuli using a von-Frey filament\n      to obtain a mechanical temporal summation score."
