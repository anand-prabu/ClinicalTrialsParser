Study 2.\n      Methods\u2014Twenty -four participants with mild to moderate stroke were randomized into\n      telerehabilitation (Tele) group and conventional (Conv) group. They received balance\n      training with three sessions per week for 4 weeks. The pressure distribution of\n      buttock-pressure interface was measured by Pressure Distribution Plate (PDM-S).\n\n      Study 3.Methods: Twenty-four participants were recruited from three long-term care\n      facilities. Participants were assigned into tele-rehabilitation (Tele group) and\n      conventional Groups (Con group) randomly. Baseline and post-treatment physical function,\n      daily activities and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) were assessed by\n      Simplified-STREAM, Berge Balance scale (BBS), Barthel index (BI), and Stroke Impact Scale\n      (SIS 3.0), respectively. Interventions were conducted to both groups by two different\n      physical therapists with three sessions a week for four weeks of intervention.\n\n      Study 4. Ten participants with stroke were randomized into Tele or control group 1 (CG1) for\n      randomized controlled trial. The Tele group also received home PT at 3 weeks later as\n      control group 2 (CG2) for cross over design.\n\n      Intervention: All three groups received 4 weeks training (2 sessions/week, 50\n      minutes/session), including upper extremity and balance exercises.\n\n      Main outcome measures: The assessments were performed at baseline (pre), after 4 weeks\n      (post) and after 7 weeks (follow-up). The measures for physical function included Stroke\n      Rehabilitation Assessment (STREAM), Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patients (PASS),\n      and Barthel index (BI). The measures for satisfaction included Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) and\n      user-satisfaction questionnaires."
