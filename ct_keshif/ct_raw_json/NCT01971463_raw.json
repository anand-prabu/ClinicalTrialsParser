Subjects will have had an ischemic stroke\n      within 96 hours of enrollment.  The study intervention will be a one hour monitoring\n      session.  There will be a 15 minute baseline measurement period, followed by intravenous\n      administration of 500cc of 0.9% NaCl over 30 minutes, and finally 15 minutes of monitoring\n      post-bolus. All study measurements will cease after 1 hour.  Subjects will be followed\n      during their hospitalization for 7 days or until discharge, whichever is sooner, to monitor\n      for adverse events and to collect clinical information."
