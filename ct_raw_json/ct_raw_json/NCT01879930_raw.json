            "textblock": "Background\n\n      Doxycycline is used to treat bacterial infections. Doxycycline is in a class of medications\n      called tetracycline antibiotics. In addition to the general indications for all members of\n      the tetracycline antibiotics group, doxycycline is frequently used to treat chronic\n      prostatitis and pelvic inflammatory disease. Especially intracellular agents, such as\n      chlamydia, are generally susceptible to doxycycline. Assuming this infection to be\n      responsible for the chronic bladder pain syndrome in women, therapy will be performed in\n      accordance with the authorised indication and dosage.Bacterial cystitis is an exclusion\n      criterion for the diagnosis of chronic bladder pain syndrome. However, the detection of\n      microorganisms such as Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma\n      genitalium remains a challenge so that these organisms may well be involved in the\n      pathogenesis of chronic bladder pain syndrome. This is supported by the findings of our\n      retrospective study1 that doxycycline orally for 4 weeks including therapy of the sexual\n      partner lead to a reduction of symptoms in 71% of women complaining of persistent urgency\n      and frequency, chronic urethral and/or bladder pain. Therefore, doxycycline therapy is\n      sensible, especially considering that there are only a few, costly and often little\n      effective symptomatic other treatment options.\n\n      Thus, we aim to investigate the effectiveness of doxycycline in women with chronic bladder\n      pain syndrome in a prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study.\n\n      Chronic bladder pain syndrome is a chronic disabling disorder characterized by chronic\n      pelvic pain, pressure or discomfort perceived to be related to the urinary bladder\n      accompanied by at least one other urinary symptom such as persistent urgency or frequency in\n      the absence of an identifiable cause2. In Europe, prevalence rates in women range from 306\n      to 450/100'0003,4 - much higher than previously estimated. Thus, chronic bladder pain\n      syndrome is a serious economic problem for every health care system. In addition, chronic\n      bladder pain syndrome severely decreases an individual's quality of life and represents a\n      significant financial burden to those affected by it. Currently, multifactorial pathogenesis\n      is assumed including endocrine-involvement, pelvic floor muscle irregularities, immunologic\n      aspects and chemical causes. Corresponding to the wide spectrum of presumptive triggers, a\n      large number of therapeutic approaches are propagated, however most are associated with\n      limited effectiveness. Thus, treatment of BPS is a challenge and the ideal therapy remains\n      to be elucidated. We hypothesise that doxycycline orally for 4 weeks, including therapy of\n      the sexual partner, can significantly relieve symptoms in women with chronic bladder pain\n      syndrome.\n\n      Objective\n\n      To proof or reject the effectiveness of doxycycline in treatment of chronic bladder pain\n      syndrome\n\n      Methods\n\n      This is a prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled double-blind trial. Recruitment of the\n      study participants is performed in the urologic outpatient clinic of University Hospital\n      Inselspital Bern.\n\n      The randomisation-list in the institute of pharmacy University Hospital Inselspital Bern\n      will only be accessible to unblinded employees. In case of unblinding an authorized member\n      of the blinded trial team contacts the 24-hours service-number of the pharmacist on-duty in\n      the institute of pharmacy. After disclosure of the patient-number, the pharmacist on-duty\n      performs the unblinding and informs the authorized unblinded trial-member about allocation.\n      Finally unblinding is registered on the randomization list by the pharmacist on-duty.\n\n      The unblinded  trial-member will record the name of the person who performed unblinding and\n      the date and reason for unblinding in the patient's medical record."
