      To date no trials have been performed looking at whether or not intra-bursal injection of an
      IL-1 antagonist provides pain relief similar to that of a corticosteroid injection.  The
      subcutaneous injection of anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, in patients with shoulder
      pain due to rotator cuff tendonitis and subacromial bursitis was efficacious in relieving
      pain but this information was presented as a case series in a letter to the editor format,
      so the validity of these results would require additional testing [Omoigui S, et al. 2004].
      Based mainly on the data from the intra-articular administration of anakinra, there have not
      been any adverse trends in outcomes or safety to suggest that intra-bursal injection of
      rilonacept will carry an increase risk of adverse events.  The purpose of this trial is to
      compare the improvement in pain and function of patients with clinical symptoms and signs of
      subacromial bursitis of rilonacept vs. corticosteroid injection (standard of care).

      Background:  Subacromial bursitis is an inflammatory condition which is typically triggered
      by altered rotator cuff mechanics.  One of the mainstays of therapy is corticosteroid
      injection.  Given the inflammatory nature of subacromial bursitis coupled with prominence of
      interleukin-1 (IL-1) beta on histopathologic assessment of resected subacromial bursa,
      targeted anti-IL-1 therapy would be an attractive alternative to corticosteroid injection.

      Hypothesis:  One intra-bursal injection of the IL-1 trap rilonacept (Arcalyst ®), currently
      FDA approved for the treatment of cryopyrin associated periodic syndrome (CAPS), is
      non-inferior to intra-bursal corticosteroid injection at 4 weeks post-procedure.

      Methods:  This study is a prospective trial lasting a total of 4 weeks.  Patients with
      typical symptoms and signs of subacromial bursitis are randomized to either corticosteroid
      injection prepared in the usual fashion in clinic vs. injection of rilonacept.  Prior to
      injection of either medication patients will complete a QuickDASH Questionnaire and provide
      a verbal pain score from 0 to 10.  The Quick DASH Questionnaire and verbal pain score are
      then completed within 2 duty days of injection, 2 weeks after injection, and 4 weeks after
      injection by phone.

      Primary Outcome:  Primary outcome is improvement in QuickDASH.  Secondary outcomes are
      improvement in the verbal pain score and monitoring for infection or other complications
      from rilonacept administration.
