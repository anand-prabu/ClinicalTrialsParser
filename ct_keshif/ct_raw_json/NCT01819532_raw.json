Most preterm neonates born at less than 33 weeks gestation will\n      require at least one blood transfusion during their hospital course and many will require\n      repeated transfusions.  Blood transfusions, albeit necessary, carry increased risk of viral\n      infections and transfusion reactions as well as increase the cost of healthcare.  The\n      umbilical cord and placenta harbor up to 40% of blood available during fetal life. The\n      current standard of care is immediate umbilical cord clamping. The investigators are\n      performing a randomized controlled trial comparing immediate cord clamping to milking the\n      umbilical cord prior to clamping in neonate born preterm less than 33 weeks gestation. The\n      investigators hypothesize that milking the umbilical cord will demonstrate the same benefits\n      as delayed cord clamping, without delaying neonatal resuscitation."
