            "textblock": "RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab can locate tumor cells and either kill\n      them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or\n      die. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor\n      cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining cetuximab with combination\n      chemotherapy in treating patients who have stage IV colorectal cancer."

Determine the response\n      rate and time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours once\n      weekly on weeks 1-6. Patients also receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes, leucovorin calcium\n      IV over 10-15 minutes, and fluorouracil IV over 3-5 minutes once weekly on weeks 1-4.\n      Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 3 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 months."
