            "textblock": "Emergence is an important period of general anesthesia during which several problems can\n      occur.  Coughing, hypertension, tachycardia and agitation have been observed  during\n      emergence of general anesthesia.\n\n      Desflurane is a newer volatile agent allowing early recovery from anesthesia. This agent\n      has led to earlier discharge and more rapid resumption of normal activities after surgery.\n      However, an incidence of coughing around 70% has been reported after a desflurane-based\n      anesthesia. Different techniques and drugs have been studied to reduce coughing during\n      emergence.\n\n      Among others, the role of lidocaine  given  intravenously,  topically, or intracuff has been\n      studied. Intracuff lidocaine has been shown to increase the tolerance to the endotracheal\n      tube without reducing the swallowing reflex.  However, lidocaine slowly diffuses across the\n      tube's cuff.   The addition of bicarbonates is required to increase its diffusion to the\n      underlying tracheal tissue.  Alkalinization of lidocaine allows the diffusion of 65% of its\n      neutral base form over a period of 6 hours.\n\n      In vitro studies have demonstrated that the optimal time for local anesthetic diffusion\n      through the cuff may vary from 90 to 180 minutes.  Due to its low onset, this technique\n      would be appropriate for long-duration surgeries.  Pre-filling the endotracheal tube cuffs\n      with alkalinized lidocaine at least 90 minutes before intubation could be appropriate for\n      surgeries expected to last less than two hours.\n\n      This study will assess the efficacy of pre-filling endotracheal tube cuffs with alkalinized\n      lidocaine to prevent coughing during emergence in short-duration surgeries."
