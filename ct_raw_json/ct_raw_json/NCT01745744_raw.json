To switch to\n      the higher dose will require a favorable opinion of the Ethics Committee of the H.\n      Universitario Virgen Macarena to evaluate the clinical status of patients and therapeutic\n      safety and study procedures.\n\n      Patients who are randomized to the treatment control group will continue with conventional\n      treatment which they were performing at the time of inclusion in the study (including the\n      use of prostaglandins as protocol).\n\n      STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and feasibility of regenerative treatment with\n      mesenchymal stem cells from adipose tissue (CeTMAd), administered intraarterial in\n      nondiabetic patients with chronic critical ischemia of at least one lower limb without\n      possibilities of revascularization or alternative therapies. We will analyze the\n      complications from regenerative therapy and / or study procedures.\n\n        -  Main objectives:\n\n             1. Security: It will be studied the possible complications due to the procedure in\n                the first 24 hours of administration of CeTMAd, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9\n                months and 12 months.\n\n             2. Efficiency: It will be studied the generation of new vessels (vasculogenesis) and\n                enhancement of collateral circulation (angiogenesis / arteriogenesis).\n\n        -  Secondary objectives:\n\n      It will be studied the evolution of ankle brachial index, transcutaneous oxygen pressure,\n      degree of Rutherford-Becker, ulcer size, calf perimeter, the score of pain and intermittent\n      claudication (walking test).\n\n      Duration of the clinical trial: From the infusion to the patient of the Mesenchymal Stem\n      Cells from Adipose Tissue to the end of the monitoring, there will be 12 months."
