  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common type of cancer in men and the
      seventh in women and is the third most common cause of death from cancer worldwide. The
      overall incidence of HCC remains high in developing countries and is steadily rising in most
      industrialized countries.

      TACE with Doxorubicin-eluting beads  (DEB-TACE) has recently been developed as a novel
      therapy option for HCC. In order to maximize its therapeutic efficacy, doxorubicin-loaded
      beads were developed to deliver higher doses of the chemotherapeutic agent and to prolong
      its permanence within the tumor. The comparison of efficacy and safety of drug-eluting bead
      (DC bead®) TACE in comparison with conventional TACE (cTACE) showed that response and time
      to progression in the DC bead® group was significantly higher than that of the cTACE group.
      DC bead® TACE thus appears to be a feasible and promising approach to the treatment of HCC.

      This study's purpose is evaluating treatment efficacy, survival rate and safety of DEB-TACE
      using doxorubicin for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

      This study's purpose is to assess treatment efficacy, survival rate and safety of DEB-TACE
      using doxorubicin/Lipiodol emulsion for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Study Design:  Prospective observational study . Primary objective: To collect data on tumor
      response after administration of Dc-Beads that were preloaded with Doxorubicin-TACE.

      Secondary objectives: To collect data on survival rate, time to progression, tolerability of
      treatment, number of treatment required to achieve objective response and improvement of
      quality of life.

      Treatment method:

      Day -1 Doxorubicin at a dose of 35/50 mg/m2 has been charged onto 2 ml of 70-150 µm M1
      microspheres at Pharmacy. It is suggested to dissolve Doxorubicin powder with 2 ml of
      contrast medium. The charging time of Dc-Beads is at least 30 minutes.

      Day  0: prehydration, antibiotic prophylaxis and setting up of a therapeutic scheme
      appropriate for analgesic prophylaxis (3-day duration) as previously reported (17)

      Day +1:

      Upon admittance to the radiology room, 1 vial of tropisetron (diluted in 100ml of
      physiological solution) and 1 vial of morphine hydrochloride diluted in 100 ml i.v. are
      administered by slow drip.

      One vial of morphine hydrochloride diluted in 100 ml i.v. to be repeated one hour after the
      procedure and if necessary also after 6 hours.

      Tropisetron i.v. if needed. Intra-arterial premedication (optional) with 1 vial of verapamil
      diluted in 4 ml of normal saline solution followed by 4 ml of lidocaine.

      Tumor Infusion (segment/s with dominant disease) of Doxorubicin at a dose of 35/50 mg/m2
      preloaded into 2 ml of 70-150 µm M1 microspheres.

      A second tumor infusion is allowed if other lesions are present (daughter tumor), using
      Doxorubicin at a dose of 35/50 mg/m2 preloaded into 2 ml of 70-150 µm M1 microspheres
      (following radiologist and oncologist ' s planning of cure).

      Day  +30: The above procedure is repeated. Day  +90: In case of response, a third
      administration following the above procedures will be repeated

      Evaluation of response Response is assessed at 30, 90 and 120 days after DEB-TACE,
      monitoring tumor dimension using Chest-abdomen CAT scan with and without contrast medium,
      and cancer markers (CEA, Carbohydrate Antigen (CA) 19.9) Tumor response is performed
      according to  the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

      Assessment of quality of life Assessment of quality of life with Edmonton questionnaire is
      performed during the baseline visit and 30, 60 and 120 days after treatment.
