      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an experimental alternative imaging
      method, Near Infrared Spectroscopy (abbreviated as NIR), can be used with a controlled
      respiratory system to examine the breasts for cancer. The NIR system uses light beams to
      produce an image or picture of the inside of the breast. The respiratory system will help
      researchers get more information about the breast tissue by changing the amount of oxygen
      the tissue receives during NIR imaging.
