  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-arm, single site, open label study of the effects of parenteral testosterone followed
      by enzalutamide or abiraterone in men with metastatic CRPC who previously progressed on
      either of these agents. The study will enroll two cohorts of patients: men with metastatic
      CRPC who have progressed on enzalutamide (Cohort A); and men with metastatic CRPC who have
      progressed on abiraterone acetate (Cohort B).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will enroll up to 60 patients, 30 for each cohort. Eligible patients will continue
      on androgen ablative therapy with LHRH agonist (i.e. Zoladex, Trelstar, Eligard or Lupron)
      if not surgically castrated to suppress endogenous testosterone production. Patients will
      also receive intramuscular injection with either testosterone cypionate or testosterone
      enanthate at a dose of 400 mg every 28 days. This dosing scheme was designed to produce
      rapidly fluctuating serum testosterone levels from the supraphysiologic to the near-castrate
      range (i.e. Bipolar Androgen Therapy [BAT]). Assessments for response to testosterone will
      be made approximately every 3 months. Upon displaying evidence of progression, patients will
      then go on to receive either abiraterone or enzalutamide (whichever agent they had
      previously progressed on prior to study enrollment).

    <description>Men with castration-resistant prostate cancer who have progressed on either abiraterone or enzalutamide will be enrolled to this arm. These patients will then receive intramuscular injections with testosterone cypionate 400 mg every 28 days or testosterone enanthate 400 mg every 28 days. Upon progression on testosterone cypionate or enanthate, men will be retreated with either abiraterone 1000 mg by mouth daily or enzalutamide 160 mg by mouth daily, depending on which drug they previously received.</description>

             would put the patient at risk from therapy with testosterone (e.g. femoral metastases
             with concern over fracture risk, spinal metastases with concern over spinal cord
             compression, lymph node disease with concern for ureteral obstruction).

          7. Evidence of serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric or other
             condition (including laboratory abnormalities) that could interfere with patient
             safety or provision  of informed consent to participate in this study

          8. Active uncontrolled infection, including known history of AIDS or hepatitis B or C.

          9. Prior history of a thromboembolic event within the last two years and not currently
             on systemic anticoagulation.

         10. Prior myocardial infarction within one year of study entry.

         11. Hematocrit &gt;50%, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, uncontrolled or poorly
             controlled heart failure [per Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines (67)].
