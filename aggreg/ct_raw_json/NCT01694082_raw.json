This study aims to test versions of THRIVE tailored to American college students.\n      In addition to replicating original results with THRIVE, we will also test versions\n      containing unique subsets of protective behavioral strategies to reduce alcohol consumption.\n      The primary hypothesis is that versions of THRIVE will be associated with lower overall\n      alcohol consumption than an assessment and brief brochure control condition."
