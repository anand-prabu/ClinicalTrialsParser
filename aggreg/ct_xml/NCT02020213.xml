    <textblock>
      Invasive Aspergillus infection (IAI) occasionally occurs in immunocompromised people. Except
      administrating empirical anti-fungal agent, using objective parameters to support the
      tentative diagnosis of an IAI in order to make the anti-fungal treatment more specifically
      is also important. At present, serum galactomannan (GM) test is the less-invasive,
      non-cultural, and time-saving examination for augmenting a diagnosis of Aspergillosis. It
      was suggested by Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) 2008 as a screening and
      monitoring tool for Aspergillosis , and the cut-off value was adjusted to 0.5 by USA FDA .
      However, in clinical practice, GM seems not to have good predicted value even the
      sensitivity and specificity are declaimed more than 80% . Other controversial issues include
      the reproducibility of GM5 and the effect of piperacillin-tazobactam or other antibiotics on
      the accuracy of GM baseline In this study, serum GMs are examined in two conditions, one is
      collected for establishing a baseline and the other is collected after
      piperacillin-tazobactam administration. We hope to confirm the validity of GM baseline and
      the effect of piperacillin-tazobactam on GM value in Taiwan.

      We try to enroll patient who are followed in hematology department in TCVGH and are
      diagnosed as probable pulmonary Aspergillus infection or proven pulmonary Aspergillus
      infection.  If they have poor response to current thought effective agent for  pulmonary
      Aspergillus (eg, amphotericin B, Voriconazole, itraconazole) 2 weeks, then they can choose
      to receive Posaconazole as salvage therapy in our study. However, our study wants to
      quantification of therapeutic response, so the enrolled patient should be agree to let us
      check serum galactomannan level at beginning and per 2 weeks. They also should be receive
      chest CT in the beginning and in the end of posaconazole treatment. The rule out timing is
      evaluated by clinical doctors (hematology department) per 2 weeks, if posaconazole has poor
      effect to their disease, the clinical doctors can decided to terminate posaconazole
      administration. Another effective agent will be given when posaconazole fails.
