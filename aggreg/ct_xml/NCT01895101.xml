  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It remains still unclear whether topical tranexamic acid has an added value besides the
      administration of intravenously tranexamic acid. We hypothesize that the addition of topical
      tranexamic acid, besides intravenous administration of tranexamic acid, results in a 25%
      reduction of post-operative blood loss after cardiac surgery.

      The aim of this study is to determine whether the application of topical tranexamic acid
      reduces the 12 hours postoperative blood loss by 25% in patient scheduled for cardiac
      surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass, whereby intravenous tranexamic acid is administrated.

      Just before sternal closure, 250 subjects receives pericardial lavage with 2 gr tranexamic
      acid in 200 ml normothermic saline solution (NaCl 0.9%), 250 subjects receives pericardial
      lavage with 200 ml normothermic saline solution without TA and 250 subjects (control group)
      receives no pericardial lavage. The main study parameter is 12 hours post-operative blood
      loss and is assessed by 12 hours post-operative chest tube production.

    <description>the secondary objective of this study is to determine whether pericardial lavage with saline gives an improvement in haemostasis, compared with no pericardial lavage, resulting in a reduction of surgical re-explorations and post-operative 12-hour blood loss. The choice for a surgical re-exploration will be decided according to the ICU protocol.</description>
