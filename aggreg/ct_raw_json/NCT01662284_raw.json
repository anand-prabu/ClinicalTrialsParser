An investigational drug is a drug that has not been approved by the Food and Drug\n      Administration (FDA) and is available for research use only. 124I-NM404 is only taken up by\n      the cancer cells, not the normal cells. Compared to traditional methods such as CT (computed\n      tomography) or MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging), 124I-NM404 may help physicians more\n      accurately see and evaluate cancerous tumors. This agent has been safely studied in animals\n      and a limited number of human patients with lung cancer. This study is being done to\n      determine the best dose to use and to fully evaluate the images that result from using this\n      new agent."
