      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm study. The study
      population will consist of subjects, 35 to 75 years of age, with a diagnosis of moderate to
      severe COPD per Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines (GOLD,
      2011). The primary analysis will compare each of the EP-101 dose groups to placebo with
      respect to the change from baseline in morning trough FEV1 on Day 29. Trough FEV1 is defined
      as the mean of the two FEV1 values obtained at 23 hours 30 minutes and 24 hours after Day 28
      AM dose (ie, approximately 12 hours after the previous PM dose).

             least 1 pack/day for 10 years, or equivalent).

          -  Post-bronchodilator (following inhalation of ipratropium bromide MDI) FEV1 ≥ 30% and
             ≤ 70% of predicted normal value during the Screening Period.

          -  Post-bronchodilator (following inhalation of ipratropium bromide MDI) FEV1/FVC ratio
             &lt; 0.70 during the Screening Period.

          -  Post-bronchodilator (following inhalation of ipratropium bromide MDI) improvement in
             FEV1 ≥ 12% and ≥ 100 mL during the Screening Period.

          -  Use of systemic steroids within 3 months prior to the Screening Period.

          -  Respiratory tract infection within 6 weeks prior to or during the Screening Period.

          -  History of tuberculosis, bronchiectasis or other non-specific pulmonary disease.

          -  History of urinary retention or bladder neck obstruction type symptoms.

          -  History of narrow-angle glaucoma.

          -  Prolonged QTc interval (&gt; 450msec for males and &gt; 470msec for females) during the

          -  Recent history (previous 12 months) of excessive use or abuse of narcotic/illegal

          -  History of hypersensitivity or intolerance to β2-agonists or anticholinergics.
