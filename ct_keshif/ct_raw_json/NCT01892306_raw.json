            "textblock": "The specific goal of this research study is to investigate the feasibility, acceptability,\n      and preliminary efficacy of a transdiagnostic, cognitive-behavioral therapy developed\n      specifically to target common core processes across mood and anxiety disorders [Unified\n      Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP)], for the treatment of\n      patients with bipolar I disorder (BD-I) and comorbid anxiety. The study will compare\n      treatment-as-usual with pharmacotherapy (TAU) plus 18 one-hour sessions of treatment with\n      the UP to TAU alone. Patients in both treatment conditions will be followed over a 12-month\n      period and will be assessed monthly to track changes in mood, anxiety and emotion-related\n      symptoms; functional impairment; and relapse rates. Data on the acceptability of the\n      treatment will be gathered concurrently through monthly patient self-reported ratings of\n      treatment satisfaction, and by tracking rates of acceptance for randomization into the\n      study, number of completed sessions, and dropout rates. The study will examine: 1) whether\n      combined cognitive behavioral treatment (UP) for BD-I and comorbid anxiety disorders is an\n      acceptable and feasible approach to treatment; 2) whether treatment with the UP for BD-I and\n      comorbid anxiety disorders as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy treatment-as-usual (TAU) leads\n      to greater symptom reduction and reduced functional impairment than pharmacotherapy alone,\n      3) whether treatment for BD-I and comorbid anxiety disorders with the UP improves relapse\n      rates over a 6-month follow-up relative to TAU; and 4) whether reduction in symptoms,\n      relapse rates, and functional impairment are mediated by changes in emotion regulation\n      skills.  The broader aim of this study is to address the need for improved treatments for\n      bipolar disorder."
