  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 8-week randomized, open-label evaluation will examine the acute safety and tolerability
      of 4 different dosing regimens of Acthar to inform dose selection for future studies of
      Acthar in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis   (ALS).  The study will also
      investigate the mean rate of change in the ALSFRS-R total score as an exploratory endpoint
      to help design future studies.

      This study will enroll up to 40 patients and include an optional 28-week open-label
      extension period plus a 3-week treatment taper and 1-week follow up period.  After
      completion of Week 8, patients enrolled in a treatment group that is considered safe and
      tolerable at that time have the option to continue into the open-label extension period.  A
      3-week treatment taper and a follow-up visit are planned for all patients enrolled in the
      study, beginning either at Week 8 or at Week 36 if a patient continues into the optional
      open-label extension period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to provide informed consent.

          -  Diagnosis of clinically definite ALS, clinically probable-laboratory supported ALS,
             clinically probable ALS, or clinically possible ALS based on the revised El Escorial
             criteria.

          -  Patients with ALS ≤ 3 years since symptom onset.  Symptom onset is defined as date of
             first muscle weakness or dysarthria.

          -  Upright slow vital capacity (SVC)≥ 60% of predicted.

          -  If taking riluzole and/or Nuedexta®, stable regimen is required for ≥ 30 days prior
             to screening.

          -  Medically (either independently or with caregiver assistance) able to comply with
             study procedures, including subcutaneous (SC) injections of study medication and
             adherence to concomitant medication restrictions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any medical condition known to have an association with motor neuron dysfunction

             nocturnal hypoventilation).  Patients on assisted ventilation for other reasons
             require approval from the Medical Monitor.  (Supplemental oxygen is acceptable).

          -  Recorded diagnosis or evidence of major psychiatric disorder.

          -  Clinically evident cognitive and/or behavioral impairment that in the opinion of the
             Investigator would impair the ability of the patient to comply with the study
             procedures.

          -  Therapies and/or Medications:

               1. History of prior sensitivity to Acthar or other porcine protein products.

             surgery, history of or the presence of peptic ulcer, congestive heart failure,
             uncontrolled hypertension, primary adrenocortical insufficiency, or adrenal cortical
             hyperfunction.
