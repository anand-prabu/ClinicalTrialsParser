  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of two different dose
      levels of NT 201 (75 U or 100 U per cycle), compared with placebo, in reducing the salivary
      flow rate, and the severity and frequency of chronic troublesome sialorrhea that occurs as a
      result of various neurological conditions in adult subjects.

    <description>This is a co-primary outcome measure. The GICS is used to measure the investigator's impression of change due to treatment. The response option is a common 7-point Likert scale that ranges from -3 = very much worse to +3 = very much improved.
If the subject is not able to answer: carer's GICS entry.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented diagnosis of the basic neurological condition associated with sialorrhea
             (as above, (i), (ii) or (iii); with onset at least 6 months before screening).

          -  Chronic troublesome sialorrhea (for at least 3 months) at screening, defined as the
             presence of all of the following, at screening and at baseline and for at least the 3
             months before screening (where retrospective response to questionnaires is
             impossible, a statement of equivalent severity will suffice):

               1. A Drooling Severity and Frequency Scale [DSFS] sum score of at least 6 points
                  and

               2. A score of at least 2 points for each item of the DSFS and

               3. A score of at least 3 points on the modified Radboud Oral Motor Inventory for
                  Parkinson's Disease [mROMP], Section 'III Drooling', Item A).

          -  A score of at most 2 points on the mROMP Section 'II Swallowing Symptoms' Item A) and
             a score of at most 3 points on Item C), at screening and at baseline.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-neurological secondary causes of sialorrhea.

          -  Unstable concomitant medication influencing sialorrhea (such as anticholinergics for
             the treatment of parkinsonism; dosages of these medications must have been stable for
             at least 4 weeks before study entry and must be planned to remain stable during the
             course of the study.

          -  Recent (i.e., four weeks) drug treatment for sialorrhea.

          -  History of recurrent aspiration pneumonia.

          -  Extremely poor dental/oral condition.

          -  Recent (i.e., one year for sialorrhea, 14 weeks for other indications) treatment with
             - or known hypersensitivity to - Botulinum toxin, or known hypersensitivity to any
             ingredient of the study preparation.

          -  Recent (i.e., four weeks) changes in anti-parkinsonian medication.

          -  Previous or planned surgery or irradiation to control sialorrhea.
