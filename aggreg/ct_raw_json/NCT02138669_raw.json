The statute and the implementing regulation of\n      FDA (21 CFR 814.124 (aj) require IRB review and approval before a HUD is used.INTACS\n      prescription inserts are composed of two clear segments, each having an arc length of 150\u00b0,\n      they are manufactured form a biomedical material called polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and\n      are available in three thicknesses. Two INTACS inserts ranging from 0.250mm to 0.350mm may\n      be implanted depending on the orientation of the cone and the amount of myopia and\n      astigmatism to be reduced."

The two tiny INTACS\n      inserts are surgically placed into the periphery of the cornea through a tiny cut that is\n      made on the cornea after numbing drops have been applied. A specially designed instrument\n      creates a tunnel by separating the tissue layers in the outside periphery of the cornea, the\n      INTACS inserts are placed into this tunnel where they remain. One or two ophthalmic sutures\n      will be placed to close the incision. A postoperative care information booklet will be given\n      to the patients; patients will be followed by means of postoperative appointments for up to\n      12 months after the surgery. The visits/testing schedules are listed below:\n\n      Pre-OR visit (1.5 hours): Visual Acuity (VA), Refraction, Topography, Keratometry, Glare\n      Test. Mesopic Pupil Size, Pachymetry, Tonometry, Slit Lamp Exam and Contrast Sensitivity.\n\n      Surgery (30min): At Laser Center for Vision Care which is part of Aston and department of\n      Ophthalmology.\n\n      Post-OR Day 1(10min): VA, Slit Lamp Exam.\n\n      Post-OR 1week (20min): Visual Acuity, Refraction, Topography, Tonometry, Slit Lamp Exam.\n\n      Post-OR 1 month (20minj: Visual Acuity, Refraction, Topography, Tonometry, Slit Lamp Exam.\n\n      Post-OR 3 month (1.5 hours): Some as pre-op Visit.\n\n      Post-OR 6 month (20min): Visual Acuity, Refraction, Topography, Tonometry, Slit Lamp Exam.\n\n      Post-OR 12 month (1.5 hours): Same as pre-op."
