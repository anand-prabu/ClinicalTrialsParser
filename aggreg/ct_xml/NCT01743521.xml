      DARE-C is a prospective open label multi-centre pilot study examining the safety and
      efficacy of response guided triple therapy (PEG-IFN, Ribavirin and Telaprevir) for the
      treatment of early chronic HCV genotype 1 infection in individuals with and without HIV
      infection.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provision of written, informed consent.

          2. HCV genotype 1 infection

          3. Quantifiable HCV RNA at screening and baseline (&gt;10,000 IU/ml)

          4. Recent hepatitis C infection with an estimated duration of Infection &gt;6 months and ≤
             18 months defined as A) i) First anti-HCV antibody or HCV RNA positive within the
             previous 6 months and ii) Documented anti-HCV antibody negative or HCV RNA negative
             within the 24 months prior to anti-HCV antibody positive result OR B) i) First
             anti-HCV antibody or HCV RNA positive within the previous 6 months and ii) acute
             clinical hepatitis (jaundice or ALT&gt; 10 X ULN) within the 12 months prior to first
             positive HCV antibody or HCV RNA with no other cause of acute hepatitis identifiable

          5. Compensated liver disease (Child-Pugh A)

          6. Negative pregnancy test at screening and 24 hours prior to the first dose of study
             drugs.

          7. If heterosexually active, a female subject of childbearing potential and a
             nonvasectomized male subject who has a female partner of childbearing potential must
             agree to use 2 effective contraceptives from screening onwards until 6 months (female
             subject) or 7 months (male subject) after RBV therapy has ended. Note: Hormonal
             contraceptives may be continued but may not be reliable during telaprevir dosing and
             for 2 months following cessation of telaprevir. Therefore, subjects should agree to
             use 2 effective non-hormonal methods of contraception during telaprevir combination
             therapy and for 2 months after the last intake of telaprevir. As of two months after
             completion of telaprevir hormonal contraceptives can again be used as one of the two
             required effective methods of birth control.

          8. Subject is judged to be medically stable on the basis of physical examination,
             medical history and vital signs.

          9. Adequate English to provide written, informed consent and to provide reliable
             responses to the study interview

        Additional inclusion criteria for HIV positive individuals

          -  Confirmed HIV infection &gt; 6 months duration

          -  CD4 &gt; 200 cells/mm3 and HIV &lt; 50 c/ml on stable ART at least 3 months prior to
             treatment

          -  Or

          -  CD4 &gt;= 500 cells/mm3 and HIV VL &lt; 100,000 not on ART

          -  If on ART must be taking a regimen containing an accepted* combination of the
             following drugs: tenofovir ( TDF), lamivudine ( 3TC), emtricitabine (FTC), efavirenz
             (EFV), abacavir (ABC), raltegravir (RAL), etravirine (ETV), rilpivirine (RIL),
             ritonavir boosted atazanavir (r/ATZ) * Combination must be supported by current HIV
             treatment guidelines

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals considered by the study investigators to be unlikely to participate in
             intensive follow-up and/or unwilling to provide extra blood samples

          -  Current injecting drug use (any injecting within previous 4 weeks)

          -  Standard exclusions to Peg-interferon (PEG-IFN), Ribavirin (RBV) and Telaprevir (TPV)
