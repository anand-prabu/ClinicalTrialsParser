  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from pancreatic adenocarcinoma are
      released into the peritoneal cavity through blood lost during the surgical resection of
      these tumors resulting in peritoneal recurrence despite appropriate surgical resection.
      Targeting the mechanisms responsible for CTC adhesion to the peritoneum may result in
      inhibition of implantation and growth, thus preventing this mode of pancreatic cancer
      recurrence postoperatively.

      Research Plan:

      Intraoperative Subjects with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) who have been consented
      and enrolled into the study will be taken to the operating room (OR) for their previously
      planned pancreatectomy procedure.  After general anesthesia is induced, using universal
      precautions, blood sample (10ml) will be collected into a heparin tube for identification of
      circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and serve as one of two controls designed to assess
      background CTC counts.  Once the participant has undergone surgical exploration as planned
      and has been deemed a candidate for resection, normal saline will be used to wash the
      abdominal cavity and collected in a suction canister by the attending surgeon.  Abdominal
      washings are a normal part of the operative procedure, typically performed at the end of the
      operation to wash blood out of the abdominal cavity and is performed with variable amounts
      depending on the surgeon's discretion.  For purposes of a control for the study, this wash
      step will be moved to the beginning of the operation.  Additional washes/irrigations may be
      necessary at the end of the case at the surgeon's discretion.  Cells collected in this fluid
      will be centrifuged and collected in the lab for determination of the presence of malignant
      cells.  This will serve as the second of two controls.  As the pancreatectomy procedure
      proceeds, subject blood will be lost as a normal consequence of the procedure and suctioned
      from the operative field into a new container containing heparin chilled on ice to preserve
      cell viability.  This blood is normally discarded at the end of the case but a portion of
      the blood will be collected and utilized for downstream lab experiments to detect CTCs.

      Laboratory/Post-Processing Blood collected in the operating room as described above will be
      immediately brought to the laboratory and centrifuged to separate out the plasma, buffy
      coat, and erythrocytes.  The buffy coat, which contains the CTCs, white blood cells, and
      platelets, is removed and added to the commercially available cocktail per the kit protocol.
       Ficoll enrichment and separation of the CTCs will then be performed.  The isolated CTCs
      will then be used for further downstream characterization and experimentation which will
      include, but not limited to: identification of CTC number, growth of CTCs in vitro and in
      vivo, and identification/characterization of CTC adhesion molecules which allow binding to
      human peritoneum.  Any unused blood or component of blood not utilized in the experiment
      will be assigned a unique identifier and de-identified of patient for future cross-reference
      and stored at -80 degrees Fahrenheit at the University of Florida for potential future
      experiments or repeat CTC isolation.

      Participant Data Collection On all enrolled subjects, the following de-identified
      information will be collected:  participant demographic data, clinical and pathologic data,
      and data on cancer recurrence and overall survival.
