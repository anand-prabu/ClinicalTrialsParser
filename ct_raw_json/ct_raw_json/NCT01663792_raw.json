            "textblock": "The relationship between the relative breast cancer (BC) risk and seaweed intake among\n      humans is only now unfolding.  A small body of research, both in vivo and in vitro, suggests\n      seaweed may be useful in BC prevention (Funahashi et al. 1999; Teas et al. 1984; Yamamoto et\n      al. 1987) .  Seaweeds are specifically used to treat tumors in Traditional Chinese Medicine\n      and Japanese folk medicine.  On a population level, those people for whom seaweed is a\n      regular part of their diet, most notably in Japan, have dramatically lower rates of  BC\n      (Hebert et al. 1998; Hebert and Rosen 1996; Kodama et al. 1991).\n\n      Epidemiologic studies done in Japan in the 1980s, before Westernized diets were common,\n      reported that Japanese women had 1/3 the rate of premenopausal BC and 1/9 the rate of\n      postmenopausal BC (Ferlay et al. 2001; Reddy et al. 1980).  Even today, BC incidence rates\n      for women in Japan are 20/100,000 compared to the U.S. average of 118/100,000 (Statistics\n      2007) .  Although genetic predisposition has been proposed, when rates among migrants from\n      Japan to the US are compared, BC incidence almost doubles after 10 years of residence in the\n      US (20/100,000 to 35/100,000) (Shimizu et al. 1991), increase with each successive\n      generation (LeMarchand et al. 1985).  Japanese-American women who develop BC have\n      significantly better survival rates than other American ethnic groups (Kanemori and\n      Prygrocki 2005; Pineda et al. 2001).  On the other hand, Asian-American women over 50 years\n      of age living in Los Angeles, especially Japanese-American women, have one of the most\n      rapidly increasing BC incidence rates (Deapen et al. 2002).   These data support the\n      hypothesis that lifestyle changes and possibly gene-nutrient interactions are important in\n      BC susceptibility.\n\n      Seaweed is a typical part of East-Asian diets, although consumption varies widely among\n      individuals (Fukuda et al. 2007).  Seaweeds have no land equivalents in terms of their\n      specific components of fiber (alginate), primary carotenoid (fucoxanthin), sulfated\n      polysaccharide (fucoidan and laminarin), and polyphenol defense compounds, each of which has\n      been reported to have strong anti-cancer activity (Kotake-Nara et al. 2005; Koyanagi et al.\n      2003; Miao et al. 1999; Son et al. 2003).\n\n      Many in vivo and in vitro studies of dietary seaweed report decreased angiogenesis and\n      increased apoptosis of tumor cells (Konishi et al. 2006; Koyanagi et al. 2003; Sekiya et al.\n      2005), inhibition of tumor cell adhesion and metastasis (Liu et al. 2005) and enhanced\n      immune responses (Maruyama et al. 2003; Maruyama et al. 2006). Nishino and colleagues have\n      investigated seaweed modulation of the urokinase plasminogen system (Nishino et al. 1999;\n      Nishino et al. 2000). Based on the wide range of antitumor effects, we investigated the\n      possibility that seaweed could affect uPAR concentrations in women who consume seaweed.  The\n      urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor\n      (uPAR, CD87), and its plasminogen inhibitors 1 and 2 are central to the maintenance of\n      homeostasis, directly affecting the extracellular matrix (ECM), inflammation, tissue repair.\n       Increased concentrations have been shown to be associated with more rapid cancer\n      progression  (Foekens et al. 2000).  Urinary concentration of uPAR is highly correlated with\n      urinary uPA concentrations, and both are correlated with tissue concentration (Foekens et\n      al. 2000; Sier et al. 2004).When uPA/uPAR concentrations are increased, there is increased\n      ECM degradation that allows cancer cells to migrate, leading to metastases.  Urokinase is\n      also used therapeutically to treat serious conditions involving blood clots. In clinical\n      studies, tissue concentration of uPA is an independent prognostic predictor of BC\n      progression (Ceccarelli et al. 2010; Look et al. 2002).\n\n      We therefore included evaluation of one part of the urokinase system, uPAR, in this study as\n      a possible biomarker for seaweed activity that might be related to BC prevention.\n\n      To further assess whether a dietary seaweed intervention could alter protein expression in\n      urine and serum in a non-seaweed consuming population of healthy postmenopausal women, we\n      used surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time of flight coupled with mass\n      spectrometer (SELDI-TOF-MS). Proteomic analyses have been used to identify cancer biomarkers\n      with high sensitivity and specificity, including those related to BC (Gast et al. 2008;\n      Shimizu et al. 1991; van Winden et al. 2009). SELDI has also been shown to be sensitive\n      enough to be used to identify changes in serum associated with the addition of a novel food\n      (green tea) (Tsuneki et al. 2004)."
