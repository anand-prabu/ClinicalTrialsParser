In addition, with long-term treatment with AZT, there is evidence of virus\n      resistance to the drug. Compounds that are more effective and less toxic than those in\n      present use would be beneficial, especially if they are active against AZT-resistant\n      viruses. Nevirapine has shown in vitro (test tube studies) activity in inhibiting HIV\n      replication (reproduction). In vitro studies have shown that nevirapine and AZT work\n      together to inhibit HIV replication."

Five patients at each dose\n      level have less than 3 months of prior AZT treatment; five patients at each dose level have\n      at least 12 months of previous AZT treatment and tolerated an AZT regimen of 600 mg/day (200\n      mg every 8 hours). At least 24 patient-weeks of treatment with the combination treatment\n      must be completed without requiring dose interruption before the next dosage level can be\n      started. All 30 patients must be enrolled at a lower dosage level before a higher dosage\n      level is started. Patients begin treatment with AZT. 14 days later, patients begin treatment\n      with nevirapine in addition to the AZT. After 24 weeks, patients have the option to continue\n      long-term treatment with either nevirapine or standard treatment."
