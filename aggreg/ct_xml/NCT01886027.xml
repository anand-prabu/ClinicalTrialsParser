  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to test the efficacy of emotional awareness and expression
      training (EAET), a novel emotional processing intervention that the investigators have
      developed, for people with IBS. In this randomized, controlled trial, the investigators will
      compare EAET to a standard intervention that teaches the conceptually opposite
      approach—relaxation training (RT)—and test how both of these interventions compare to a
      wait-list control condition. The investigators hypothesize that individuals in the EAET
      group will demonstrate greater improvement in their IBS symptom severity, psychological
      functioning, quality of life, and health care utilization at 4 and 12-week follow-up time
      points, compared to individuals in the wait-list control group. It is also expected that
      both of the active interventions (EAET and RT) will be more efficacious than the wait-list
      control condition.
