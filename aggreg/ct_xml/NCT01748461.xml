    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the short-term and long-term effects of a
      cycle ergometer program on physical activity and physical fitness in elderly (65+).
      Therefore, physical activity, physical fitness and functionality are measured at baseline,
      after 10 weeks (after the intervention period), after 6 months and after 1 year.

      Different coaching techniques (to promote the use of a cycle ergometer and cycle ergometer
      program) will also be evaluated. What is the best (coaching) approach for long-term
      adherence (physical activity)?
