Each patient will receive an anterior rhinoscopy to select the most patent meatus for gauze pledegetting by a validated meatus scoring scale. The endoscope is preloaded with a 1.8 mm biopsy forceps to pick up the acute angle between the shorter leg and hypotenuse of a right-angled gauze strip (already soaked with anesthesia/decongestant) and retract back just into the biopsy channel. When the transnasal endoscope tip is set in the nasal vestibule, the preloaded biopsy forceps is protruded slowly into the desired meatus under endoscope monitoring. A gauze strip is at least brought onto the posterior end of the inferior or middle turbinate."

Two cotton-tippled applicators help determine the following: (a) right or left side, (b) inferior or middle nasal meatus (INM or MNM) and (c) the need of local epinephrine. The investigators apply gently in parallel two sterile 3\" x 1/10\", double-ended, plastic shaft cotton-tipped applicators, pretreated with minimal amount of 2% viscous lidocaine plus 4% liquid lidocaine, to lubricate and anesthetize the more patent meatus One cotton-tipped applicator is re-used to deliver a triangular gauze strip to the selected meatus during the gauze pledgetting procedure."

The\n      technique of using a cotton pledget soaked with lignocaine and decongestant is quite\n      effective but does cause some discomfort during application of anesthetic agent to the nasal\n      cavity. Hence, an effective method to deliver anesthetic agent, using a minimal dose of\n      drugs, and at the same time maintain a good \ufb01eld of vision during endoscopy are all very\n      important.\n\n      Using a cotton-tippled applicator to deliver a soaked gauze strip may cause kinking of it\n      around the nasal vestibule or just in the anterior end of a turbinate. Endoscopic guidance\n      to deliver a gauze strip can confirm delivering it to at least the posterior end of a\n      turbinate. We hypothesize that a simple endoscopic-guided gauze pledgetting method is more\n      tolerable than the \"blind\" cotton-tippled applicator method to deliver a gauze strip for\n      anesthetizing the nasal cavity."
