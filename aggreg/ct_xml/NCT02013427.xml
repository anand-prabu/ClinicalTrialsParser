  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine brain properties for placebo response in chronic back pain
      patients. The investigators have preliminary data indicating that, in blinded clinical trial
      studies with neutral instructions regarding treatment, chronic back pain (CBP) patients can
      be subdivided into placebo responders and non-responders, and these differences are
      PREDICTABLE a priori, by brain activity. The results imply that CBP placebo may have
      clinical utility and that its properties can be studied by human brain imaging techniques.
      In Phase I of the study, the investigators seek to identify brain imaging parameters that
      predict the propensity for the placebo response in an independent CBP cohort. In Phase II,
      the investigators will evaluate the interaction between placebo response and medication
      treatment in individuals stratified as placebo responders versus non-responders. This
      research is designed to critically assess the neurobiology of placebo analgesia for chronic
      pain in a double-blind clinical trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  History of low back pain for a minimum of 6 months with signs and symptoms of
             radiculopathy: positive straight leg raising test with dermatomal radiation and/or
             myotomal weakness and/or reflex asymmetry; pain must radiate into buttock or below.

          -  Must have a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain score &gt;50 mm (of 100 mm maximum) at the
             baseline visit (for which 0mm = no pain, and 100 mm = worst pain imaginable).
