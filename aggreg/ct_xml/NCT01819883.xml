        Thirty-two study subjects will be studied: 1) patients with active acromegaly, and 2)
        healthy controls. Study subjects with acromegaly will be prescribed treatment for
        acromegaly by their healthcare providers, and this study will not interfere in anyway with
        clinical care and will not provide surgery, medications or other forms of clinical care.
