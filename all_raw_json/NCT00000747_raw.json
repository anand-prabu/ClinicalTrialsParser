To evaluate safety of nevirapine in HIV-1 infected individuals with CD4 counts\n      greater than or equal to 500 cells/mm3.\n\n      Secondary: To evaluate the effect of nevirapine on surrogate markers. The anti-HIV agent\n      nevirapine is associated with rapid emergence of resistance when administered alone or in\n      combination with zidovudine to HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts <= 400 cells/mm3. In\n      persons with less advanced HIV disease and less viral burden, the emergence of resistance\n      may be delayed, thus permitting evaluation for beneficial effect in a population where there\n      is currently no established therapy."
