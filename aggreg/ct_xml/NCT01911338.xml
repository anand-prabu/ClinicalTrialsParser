      -  Background Context: no studies have been identified to analyse the effect of real time
           feedback (using inertial sensors) on physiotherapy students learning the art of
           posterior-anterior thoracic manipulation (PATM).

        -  Purpose: to study the effect caused by real-time feedback on the learning process for
           PATM, comparing two undergraduate physiotherapy student groups. Hypothesis: significant
           differences will exist in the execution parameters of manipulation among students
           receiving real-time feedback versus those who do not.

        -  Study Design/Setting: longitudinal, pre-post intervention.

        -  Patient Sample: Sixty-one undergraduate physiotherapy students were divided randomly
           into two groups, G1 (n = 31) (group without feedback in real time) and G2 (n = 30)
           (group with real-time feedback).

        -  Outcome Measures: time, displacement and velocity and improvement (only between groups)
           to reach maximum peak, to reach minimum peak from maximum peak, total manipulation
           time.

        -  Methods: two groups of physiotherapy students learned PATM, one using a traditional
           method and the other using real-time feedback (inertial sensor). Measures were obtained
           pre- and post-intervention. Intragroup pre- and post-intervention and intergroup
           post-intervention scores were calculated. An analysis of the measures' stability was
           developed through an ICC (1,2).

        -  Results: the values of ICC ranged from 0.881 to 0.997. Statistically significant
           differences were found in all variables analysed (intra- and inter-group) in favour of
           G2.

        -  Conclusions: the learning process for posterior-anterior thoracic manipulation is
           facilitated when the student receives real-time feedback.

    <description>An instrumented manikin (Resusci Anne Full Body with signal box, Laerdal Medical AS) joined an inertial sensor (Inertial Cube (Intersense Inc, USA)) was used to register the physical parameters during execution of the PATM. The inertial sensor was placed in the middle of the thoracic spine, placing hands immediately below the sensor. The manikin has a ribcage with a deformation capacity similar to that of a human thorax. This option was chosen to minimize the power variation when comparing differences in parameters between different groups of students. The inclusion criteria used were that they did not have any training in manual therapy techniques, especially those involving a high velocity, low amplitude execution.</description>
