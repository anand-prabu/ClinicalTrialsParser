However, the safety and the consequences regarding ovarian function after\n      RSS have not yet to be established. Therefore, the aim of this randomized controlled study\n      is compare the ovarian reserve via anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) between laparoscopic\n      hysterectomy (LH) alone and LH combined with RSS."
