Using a system of digital imaging analysis the percentage of re-pigmentation\n      obtained will be studied after 3, 6 and 9 months of treatment.\n\n      Secondary Objectives:\n\n      To demonstrate differences in efficacy (as measured by the percentage of re-pigmentation) of\n      each of the 2 techniques used: pure melanocytes in suspension and amniotic membrane with\n      melanocytes in monolayers.\n\n      To assess how rapidly epithelialization occurs and the cosmetic result in the short and long\n      term of the areas treated with each of the techniques.\n\n      To assess if de-epidermization with CO2 laser may be by itself a stimulus for the reservoir\n      of melanocytes in the adjacent epidermis or hair follicles or if the re-pigmentation\n      obtained with this procedure is merely postinflammatory as a result of trauma to the\n      epidermis."
