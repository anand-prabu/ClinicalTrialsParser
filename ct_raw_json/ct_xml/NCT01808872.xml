    <textblock>
      The AQT90 FLEX B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic
      peptide (NT-proBNP) Tests are in vitro diagnostic assays intended as an aid in the diagnosis
      and assessment of the severity of heart failure in point-of-care and laboratory settings.
      The purpose of the study is to establish the clinical performance of the AQT90 FLEX BNP and
      NT-proBNP assays for both whole blood and plasma in the intended use population.
