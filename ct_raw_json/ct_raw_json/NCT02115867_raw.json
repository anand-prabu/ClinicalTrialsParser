            "textblock": "Diverticulitis is an extremely common digestive disease particularly found in the large\n      intestine in elderly patients and develops from diverticulosis. Diverticulosis is\n      characterized by the formation of pouches (diverticula) that bulge to the outside of the\n      colon, through areas of weakness in the colonic wall. Inflammation (diverticulitis) results\n      if one of these diverticula becomes infected and / or obstructed. It is commonly accompanied\n      by obvious or microscopic perforation, ranging in severity from a single, mild, acute attack\n      of diverticulitis to more severe attacks characterized by abscess formation, occasionally\n      resulting in chronic complications such as obstruction and fistula formation. After an\n      episode of diverticulitis many patients develop changes in bowel openings, from diarrhoea\n      and constipation, and many patients have abdominal pain and a symptom complex that resembles\n      Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).\n\n      According to available guidelines, treatment of symptomatic, but uncomplicated, diverticular\n      disease aims to reduce the frequency and severity of diverticular related symptoms\n      (abdominal pain, bloating, alterations in bowel habit) and to prevent complications.\n      Different agents have been proposed, such as bulking agents, antispasmodics, and nonabsorbed\n      topical antibiotics, 5amino acid preparations but these measures are unproven or\n      controversial. It is thought that intestinal bacteria may play a significant role in the\n      symptoms of post-diverticulitis.\n\n      The investigators have recently shown that a probiotic (Symprove) reduced the symptoms of\n      IBS significantly in comparison with a placebo in a double-blind randomized trial and\n      without side effects (paper in preparation). Because the symptoms in IBS and\n      post-diverticulitis are so similar the investigators propose a double-blind placebo\n      controlled trial of Symprove in patients with problematic diverticulitis. Patients will be\n      recruited from a dedicated diverticulitis clinic using standard exclusion criteria. This is\n      a 90 day symptom based trial using accepted outcome measures. If successful the results will\n      have widespread implications for treatment of diverticular disease."

Eligible patients who meet fulfill the entry criteria will be\n      invited to participate. They will receive a patient information sheet, which they take home\n      with them for reading.

They\n      will also complete a baseline symptoms-based questionnaire. They will then be randomized to\n      treatments A or B, both investigator and patient will be unaware of whether it is the active\n      treatment (Symprove) or placebo. Each patient will complete the symptom-based questionnaire\n      every 30 days while on on the 90 day treatment (Day 30, Day 60, and Day 90). The primary\n      outcome measure will be a change in symptoms score from Day 0 to Day 90.\n\n      Also every 30 days while on treatment, stool tests will be repeated for faecal calprotectin.\n      An additional sample will be frozen for eventual microbiota assessment.  The secondary\n      outcome measure will be change in the faecal microbiota between Day 0 and Day 90.\n\n      Patients will be seen in clinic 30 days after cessation of the trial (Day 120), at which\n      time those patients on placebo will be offered a 90 day free treatment with the active\n      ingredient if they so wish."

In addition to the symptoms based assessment, patients will complete an SF-8 questionnaire. Both questionnaires will be completed prior to treatment initiation (Day 0) and again at the end of treatment (Day 90).
