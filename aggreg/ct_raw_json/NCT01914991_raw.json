Introduction: Physiotherapeutic\n      intervention aiming to restore mobility using different techniques as stretching, hot packs,\n      exercises, therapeutic ultrasound and orthotics. No scientific evidence has been found\n      correlating improved joint mobility and the use of these techniques.  Application techniques\n      of orthoses to reshape the soft tissues have been well detailed, however, no scientific\n      evidence supporting their effectiveness on proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ) lag\n      extension resolution using them as a single treatment has been found.\n\n      Purpose of the Study: The purpose of the study was to test the effectiveness of static and\n      dynamic orthosis in patients with a PIPJ flexion retraction using them as a single treatment\n      compared with traditional combined therapies.\n\n      Method: 63 participants were included in the study. Patients who used splints were compared\n      to a control group who received conventional treatment. Active and passive mobility were\n      measured before the experiment and again three months after. All the patients were measured\n      under the same conditions and treated by the same hand therapist. The relationship between\n      contracture resolution and function was measured using the DASH Spanish Version."
