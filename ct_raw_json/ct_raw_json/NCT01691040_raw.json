Furthermore, this study is intended to\n      provide data needed to correlate plasma concentrations of NOX-H94 with its efficacy and to\n      choose the appropriate dose and dose schedule of subsequent efficacy studies.\n\n      Some chronic diseases, e.g. tumors, inflammation, renal disease, are associated with high\n      hepcidin concentrations in the blood.  These hepcidin concentrations cause a reduction in\n      iron concentrations in the blood and subsequently impair formation of red blood cells.\n      Treatment with NOX-H94 is expected to inhibit this patho-mechanism by binding and\n      inactivating hepcidin."
