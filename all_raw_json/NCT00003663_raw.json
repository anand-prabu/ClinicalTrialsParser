Determine the objective tumor\n      response rate and duration of response at 2 months after initiation of therapy, and the\n      percentage of patients with progressive disease. III. Determine the maximum response,\n      duration of response, and progression free interval for patients who have not progressed\n      after 4 weeks of therapy. IV. Determine the failure-free and overall survival of these\n      patients on this regimen. V. Compare the response rate and survival rates to results for\n      similar patients (historical and concurrent) who have received 4 weeks of rituximab without\n      dexamethasone, and patients who did not receive maintenance rituximab.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive dexamethasone IV followed by rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22\n      for one course. Two months after initiating treatment, patients are evaluated for disease\n      progression. Patients with stable or responding disease may receive monthly dexamethasone\n      and rituximab therapy for up to 10 additional months. Patients are followed every 3 months\n      for 2 years, then every 6 months for years 3-4, and then yearly for up to 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
