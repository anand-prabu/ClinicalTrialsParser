Eligible patients are T790M positive patients who have received only one prior\n      single agent EGFR-directed TKI therapy for advanced/metastatic NSCLC, and have had no\n      intervening chemotherapy between TKI and planned treatment with CO-1686. One line of\n      chemotherapy prior to any TKI treatment is permissible. TIGER-2 will consist of a screening\n      phase to establish study eligibility and document baseline measurements, an open-label\n      treatment phase, in which the patient will receive CO-1686 at 625mg BID to ascertain safety\n      and efficacy until protocol-defined disease progression, and a Follow-up Phase, to monitor\n      survival status and subsequent NSCLC cancer therapy. Each 28 day period of treatment will\n      represent one cycle, with dosing initiated on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1 D1)."
