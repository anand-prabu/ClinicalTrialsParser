Wet or soiled diapers were removed and the affected area was gently\n      cleansed. Vigorous cleaning was avoided. A thin layer of the study topical ointment was\n      applied prior to putting on a new diaper. Packs containing all the materials required were\n      prepared for each patient daily, including the same brand of diapers for all patients, skin\n      cleansing products and materials, and the assigned study ointment. Data were collected each\n      day relating to their IAD using the Kennedy Skin Condition Assessment Scale."

The score is generated by the IAD Skin Condition Assessment Tool developed by Kennedy and Lutz, which requires assessors to attribute scores of 0-3 for three domains: size of area affected, skin redness or  inflammation, and erosion. The sum of these scores is the IAD Severity Score. The size of IAD affected area will be calculated by multiplying the longest portion of the affected area measured in a head to toe orientation by the widest portion of the affected area measured from side to side (in centimeters).
