Blood cardioplegia is used to protect the heart during aortic cross-clamping.\n      However, negative effects of myocardial hypoxia during surgery are often aggravated by\n      ischemia/reperfusion injury. In addition, cardiopulmonary bypass leads to an inflammatory\n      response including endothelial cell activation.\n\n      Comparable to the reperfusion injury following acute myocardial infarction resolved by\n      percutaneous coronary intervention, the microcirculatory impairment observed after cardiac\n      surgery may be caused by endothelin 1 (ET-1). ET-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor peptide\n      upregulated in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.  Short-term administration of the\n      selective ETA receptor blocker BQ-123 was found safe in a pilot study including patients\n      with acute myocardial infarction.\n\n      Hypothesis:  Acute local ETA receptor blockade by intracoronary administered BQ-123 reduces\n      myocardial injury.\n\n      Methods: BQ-123 will be administered in patients undergoing on-pump aorto-coronary bypass\n      grafting to the left anterior descending coronary artery with the use a left inner mammary\n      artery graft and at least one vein graft.
