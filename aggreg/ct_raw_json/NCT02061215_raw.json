Viral\n      load measurements will be performed at baseline prior to transplant (within 1 week),and then\n      at 3, 7 and 10 months after transplant. It is expected that the patient will receive\n      anti-CMV prophylaxis until 6 months post-transplant, so the latter two time points will\n      reflect responses after \"release\" from antiviral suppression. Each patient will serve as\n      their own control, with comparisons made between measurements at baseline and then at each\n      timepoint.\n\n      Blood from 10 patients in each age group will be studied, to collect virologic and immune\n      response data:\n\n        -  CYTOF (broad array of measurements)\n\n        -  Tetramer assays (requires recipient HLA type of A1, A2, B7)\n\n        -  CMV viral load PCR\n\n        -  Response to pneumococcal antigens and inactivated influenza virus\n\n      In addition, clinical data will be collected at the time points indicated,particularly renal\n      function and the presence/absence of acute rejection."
