Patients\n      are stratified by tumor type (primary vs metastatic), treatment (radiotherapy vs\n      radiotherapy and chemotherapy), and Karnofsky performance status (70% or 80% vs 90% or\n      100%). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n      All patients undergo radiotherapy over weeks 1-4.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral d-methylphenidate twice daily on weeks 1-12.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily on weeks 1-12. In both arms, quality\n           of life is assessed at baseline, at the end of radiotherapy, and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks\n           after radiotherapy.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients (100 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 18 months."
