            "textblock": "Unexplained infertility (UI) is a term used to describe infertile couples in whom standard\n      investigations, including semen analysis, tests of ovulation and tubal patency, have failed\n      to detect any gross abnormality (Crosignani et al., 1993). It is a diagnosis of exclusion,\n      almost 30-40% of infertile couples would suffer from this type of subfertility (Simth et\n      al., 2003). A diversity of causes had been hypothesized to explain the condition. Cervical,\n      uterine, ovulatory, peritoneal, immunological, endocrinological, genetic defects and\n      reproductive physiology disturbances had been continuously suggested as potential causative\n      factors (Rov et al., 2005; Shveiky et al., 2006; Bellver et al., 2008; Golubovsky, 2008;\n      Woodson, 2008). Empirically, interventions for managing unexplained infertility had been\n      widely practiced. These interventions include expectant management, intrauterine\n      insemination (IUI) with ovarian stimulation and in vitro fertilization (El-Toukhy & Khalaf,\n      2008; Bhattachary et al., 2010).\n\n      In humans, the uterus becomes receptive during the midsecretory phase of the menstrual cycle\n      (days 19-23), commonly known as the window of implantation (WOI). It is assumed that\n      inadequate uterine receptivity is responsible for approximately two-thirds of implantation\n      failures (Simon et al., 1998). Since an impairment of endometrial receptivity may be a cause\n      of subfertility in a group of couples diagnosed with unexplained infertility (Jasper et al.,\n      2006; Boroujerdnia & Nikbakht, 2008; Konac et  al., 2009). Endometrial scratching may help a\n      group of couples with unexplained infertility."
