HYTOP\u00ae will support\n      haemostasis in the articular cartilage defect, act as a support for cell growth and as a\n      three-dimensional scaffold for cell differentiation. HYTOP\u00ae will protect the underlying\n      tissue after cartilage debridement and/or microfracturing of the subchondral bone.\n\n      The primary working hypothesis is that HYTOP\u00ae is safe and suitable as a cell-free matrix to\n      support haemostasis, as a cover for the cartilage lesion and eventually to enhance cartilage\n      regeneration in a one-step surgical procedure."
