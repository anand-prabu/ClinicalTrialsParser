  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a randomized, double-blind, two-arm trial of pregnenolone and placebo to
      determine the possible analgesic effects in OEF/OIF Veterans with chronic low back pain.
      The total study duration is 6 weeks (followed by two-follow up phone calls). All patients
      will monitor pain symptoms for one week with pain diaries, followed by a 1-week placebo-only
      lead-in period, 90 subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two groups.  Of these
      subjects, 45 subjects will receive pregnenolone, and 45 subjects will receive placebo for 4
      weeks. Patient interview assessments and laboratory studies will be performed at each
      interview time point.  Pregnenolone, allopregnanolone and other neurosteroid metabolites
      will be determined by gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GC/MS), proceeded by high
      performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

    <description>The The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is a self-reported scale that measures the severity of pain and the interference of pain on function. The scores range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as severe as you can imagine). There are 4 questions assessing worst pain, least pain, average pain in the past 24 hours, and the pain right now. The Interference scores range from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes). There are 7 questions assessing the interference of pain in the past 24 hours for general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life.</description>

    <description>Participants will look at two pictures simultaneously. Each picture will show three different colored balls arranged on three pegs, but the balls will be in a unique arrangement in each picture. The patient will give the minimum number of times the balls in one picture would have to be moved in order to make the arrangement of balls identical to that of the other, opposing picture.
Measures: number of correct responses.  20 items administered. 22 items administered if items 1-2 are answered correctly.  Scoring is 0-22 (0 being lowest score-greater impairment, 22 being highest score, no impairment).</description>

    <description>The Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) is a 17-item self-report measure that assesses the 17 DSM-IV symptoms of PTSD. Items are rated on 5-point frequency (0 = &quot;not at all&quot; to 4 = &quot;every day&quot;) and severity scales (0 = &quot;not at all distressing&quot; to 4 = &quot;extremely distressing&quot;). Respondents are asked to identify the trauma that is most disturbing to them and to rate, in the past week, how much trouble they have had with each symptom. The DTS yields a frequency score (ranging from 0 to 68), severity score (ranging from 0 to 68), and total score (ranging from 0 to 136).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. OEF/OIF Veterans, 18-65 years of age, with chronic low back pain.

          2. Based on medical history and medical records, have low back pain (Thoracic Vertebrae
             6 or below) present on most days for the preceding 6 months or longer, and fulfill
             all disease diagnostic criteria (please see disease diagnostic criteria below).

          3. Have a weekly mean of 24-hour average pain score â‰¥ 4 at baseline.

          4. Negative pregnancy test if female.  Sexually active subjects are required to use a

             includes non-hormonal intrauterine devices, surgical sterilization, or double barrier
             methods (e.g., diaphragm with contraceptive jelly, condom with contraceptive foam,
             cervical caps with contraceptive jelly). Sexual abstinence with agreement to continue
             abstinence or to use a medically acceptable method of contraception (as listed above)
             should sexual activity occur is permissible.

          5. No change in medications less than 4 weeks before baseline.

          6. No anticipated need to alter psychotropic or pain medications for the 6-wk study
             duration (as determined by study physician's review of records and/or discussion with
             prescribing physician).

          7. Ability to fully participate in the informed consent process.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unstable medical or neurological illness, including seizures, renal impairment or
             cerebral vascular accident.

          2. Use of oral contraceptives or other hormonal supplements.

          3. Significant suicidal or homicidal ideation requiring intervention.

          4. Daily use of long or short-acting narcotic medications.

          5. Current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) diagnosis of bipolar disorder,
             schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorder, or cognitive disorder due to a general
             medical condition (other than if related to mild TBI).

          6. Female patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding.

          7. Known allergy to study medication.

          8. History of moderate or severe TBI (mild TBI is permissible).

             past three months (excludes caffeine and nicotine).

         10. Have received epidural steroids, facet block, nerve block, or other invasive
             procedures aimed to reduce low back pain within the past 3 months prior to Visit 1.

         11. Completion of daily diaries for less than 70% of days between Visit 1 and Visit 2 and
             between Visit 2 and Visit 3.

         12. Have ongoing or anticipated disability compensation or litigation issues, in the best
             judgment of the investigator.

         13. Have a presence of any factors/conditions, medical or other, that in the judgment of
             the investigator may interfere with performance of study outcome measures, such as
             treatment-refractory history.

         14. Have serious or unstable cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, metabolic, respiratory, or
             hematologic illness, symptomatic peripheral vascular disease, or other medical
             condition or psychiatric conditions that, in the opinion of investigator and study
             physician, would compromise participation or be likely to lead to hospitalization
             during the course of the study.

         15. Are non-ambulatory or require the use of crutches or a walker.

         16. Current suicidal or homicidal ideation necessitating clinical intervention or
