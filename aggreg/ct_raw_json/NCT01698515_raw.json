Determine if oral periodontal parameters are affected by TNF inhibition;\n\n        2. Examine relationships between periodontal variables and RA variables with TNF\n           inhibition;\n\n        3. Determine if there may be potential early response markers of clinical RA response\n           seen using ultrasensitive analysis of oral or serum cytokines."

No patients from outside the\n      clinic will be recruited. No medications will be supplied through the study.\n\n      Study duration and numbers of visits: Patients will be followed through 14-16 weeks after\n      the initiation of TNF inhibitor.  Each patient will be seen for 4 visits: a screening visit,\n      a baseline visit, a follow up visit between 6-8 weeks after TNF inhibitor initiation, and a\n      final visit at weeks 14-16 after TNF inhibitor initiation. At each visit the procedures\n      noted below will be performed.  Should a patient discontinue the TNF inhibitor for any\n      reason, a final assessment at the time of stopping will be requested.\n\n      Rheumatology Assessments: Subjects will complete standard clinical assessment questionnaires\n      with age, race, demographic status, past medical and surgical history, co-morbid diseases,\n      signs and symptoms of arthritis,. Multi-dimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire (MD-HAQ)\n      and SF-36. Baseline joint counts for swollen, tender, and deformed or operated joints will\n      be recorded.  A Schirmer test to measure conjunctival tear production will be performed.\n\n      Oral Health and Periodontal Evaluation: Subjects will have a  comprehensive oral health and\n      periodontal evaluation.  Subjects will complete standardized oral health questionnaires to\n      assess dental health (including caries, tooth loss, periodontitis, dry mouth, and TMD)\n      dental hygiene practices, prior dental procedures, , smoking, and access to dental care.\n      Subjects will undergo a comprehensive dental evaluation including oral mucosal assessment,\n      including plaque, gingivitis, and periodontal indices recorded at 6 sites per tooth, as well\n      as an evaluation for xerostomia and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) function. Gingival\n      crevicular fluid will be collected on paperpoints placed into the periodontal sulcus of the\n      2 most severely affected teeth and 2 sites with the least amount of periodontal\n      inflammation. Unstimulated saliva will be collected over 5 minutes following GCF collection.\n\n      Laboratory Assessments: At each visit we will obtain blood to be assayed for CRP and other\n      biomarkers.  These will include the evaluation of a panel of inflammatory cytokines that\n      will be tested in the blood, saliva, and GCF, to determine how these may change over time in\n      response to TNF antagonist therapy for RA.  .\n\n      Withdrawal Criteria:  Patients may withdraw consent at any time and no longer participate in\n      the oral examinations or other assessments. Patients who discontinue TNF agents for reasons\n      of tolerability or lack of efficacy will be asked to return for a study termination visit\n      for a follow up oral examination."
