  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      General anesthesia and morphine based pain medicine analgesia has been the mainstay of
      practice in breast cancer surgery at Women's College Hospital. There is evidence to suggest
      that patients have a better recovery, with less pain and nausea and vomiting when nerve
      blocks or freezing of nerves are given in addition to a general anesthetic. Specifically for
      breast cancer surgery, evidence has suggested that the use of paravertebral blocks provide
      patients with a better quality of recovery after surgery. The aim of this study is to
      examine whether patients who receive the nerve blocks using an ultrasound machine in
      addition to general anesthesia have a better quality of recovery than patients who receive a
      general anesthetic alone. The hypothesis is that patients receiving ultrasound-guided
      paravertebral blocks (PVB) with propofol-based general anesthesia (GA) will have a better
      quality of recovery than patients receiving general anesthesia-opioid-analgesia. Quality of
      recovery will be assessed using a modification of the QoR-27, a validated instrument to
      assess postoperative recovery in an ambulatory surgical population.
