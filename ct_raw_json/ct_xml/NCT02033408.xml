  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the etiology of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) is closely associated with the gut
      microbiome. The results of previous studies on the effectiveness of antibiotics and fecal
      macrobiota transplantation (FMT) are contradicting.

      Aims:  to evaluate the effectiveness of wide-spectrum antibiotic regimens in acute severe
      colitis in an addition to standard corticosteroid therapy (UC and isolated &quot;UC-like&quot; Crohn's
      colitis). The secondary aim is to assess the outcome of FMT in those not responding to five
      days of therapy (in either arm). As an exploratory aim, any IBD patient with a resistant
      disease to at least two immunosuppressive medications, may be treated with either
      interventions.
