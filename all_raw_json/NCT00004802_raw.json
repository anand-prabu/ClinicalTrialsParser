Patients are stratified by\n      participating institution and diagnosis.\n\n      The weekly attack rate is determined during an 8-week assessment prior to therapy initiation\n      and at crossover.\n\n      Patients are randomly assigned to oral dichlorphenamide (DCP) or placebo for 9 weeks and\n      then cross to the alternate treatment.  Patients on DCP at baseline continue on the same\n      dose; those on acetazolamide (ACZ) at baseline receive a DCP dose equivalent to one fifth of\n      the ACZ dose."
