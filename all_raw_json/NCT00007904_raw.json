Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the\n      number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's\n      immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. Radiation therapy uses\n      high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy together\n      with filgrastim and radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage II or stage IIIA\n      breast cancer."
