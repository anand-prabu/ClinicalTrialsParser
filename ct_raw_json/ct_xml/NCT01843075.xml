  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-month, multicentre randomised double-blind placebo-controlled Phase IIb study
      in patients with mild Alzheimer's dementia (AD). The investigators aim to recruit patients
      with mild Alzheimer's dementia as defined by the National Institute of Neurological and
      Communicative Disorders and Stroke - Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorder Association
      (NINCDS-ADRDA) Criteria for Probable Alzheimer's Dementia or meeting Dubois criteria for
      early AD, with Mini Mental State Evaluation score of at least 22 out of a maximum of 30 and
      a CDR Global score of 0.5 or 1.

      Patients will be randomised on a 1:1 ratio to receive liraglutide or identical matching
      placebo.
