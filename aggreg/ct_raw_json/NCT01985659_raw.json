Compared to thoracotomy the\n      procedure is believed to achieve equal oncologic results and survival, perhaps better.\n\n      Publications have shown that mediastianal lymph node dissection during VATS is similar.\n\n      However, two recent reports have shown potential lower N1 (hilar and intrapulmonary)\n      upstaging in VATS surgery After optimal staging the percentage of unforeseen N+ the\n      percentage of unforeseen positive nodes can reach 15%\n\n      Nodal upstaging at final pathology is dependent on the quality of:\n\n        -  pretreatment staging, the better, the less upstaging\n\n        -  surgery, ie mediastinal, hilar and intrapulmonary lymphadenectomy\n\n        -  pathologic examination If we accept that pretreatment staging and pathologic\n           examination are equal in two comparable surgical cohorts, the finding of unforeseen N+\n           or nodal upstaging is a quality marker of surgery. When surgical techniques are\n           changing, it is important to look at this marker.\n\n      In absence of a randomized trial, we believe a cohort analysis is useful. By including all\n      patients, open or vats, and comparing cohorts instead of the surgical technique used, the\n      selection bias is absent. We compare three cohorts. In the first (20007-2009) almost all\n      patients where operated through a thoracotomy. In a second cohort, (2010-2011) the\n      experience with vats was early.
