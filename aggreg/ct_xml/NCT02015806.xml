  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether adherence to oral maintenance medications
      differs for patients randomized to receive a Take-N-Slide, a RxTimerCap, a PillMinder, or
      none of these devices, with the hypothesis that low-touch devices improve adherence over
      control and that the increase in adherence is agnostic across devices.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given that the Take-N-Slide device only has a Yes/No toggle for each day of the week and can
      therefore only be used once per day, the study population will be stratified into two
      separate trials based on the frequency with which the study participants' medications are
      (or could possibly be) taken. Patients who are on a medication that is used more than once
      daily will be included in Trial 2, which evaluates only the RxTimer Cap and the PillMinder.
      Within each trial, all patients meeting the inclusion criteria within each trial will be
      randomized into two blocks, the first of which will consist of all patients suboptimally
      adherent to all targeted medications excluding antidepressants, and the second of all
      patients whose only targeted medications are for depression and who are suboptimally
      adherent to this therapy.

             major mental health condition); OR

          -  Depression.

          -  Be suboptimally adherent to all of the targeted drug classes, defined as a Medication
             Possession Ratio (see Outcomes and Analysis section below for definition) of 30% to
             less than 80% during the 12 months preceding identification of study eligibility,
             except where noted below;

          -  For patients taking antidepressants in addition to other targeted medications,
             patients need only be suboptimally adherent to their non-antidepressant medications;.

          -  Eligible for pharmacy benefits during the 12 months prior to being identified as
             being eligible for the study and expected to be eligible for pharmacy benefits
             through the end of the evaluation period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Enrolled in Ready Fill at Mail (a pharmacy benefit program whereby members elect to
             have medications shipped automatically to them at the time of refill due date or
             prescription renewal).
