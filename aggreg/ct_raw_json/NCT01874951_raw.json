The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved\n      naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence, but the FDA has\n      not approved naltrexone to treat depression. The investigators hypothesize that patients\n      with breakthrough depression on an antidepressant regimen containing a pro-dopaminergic\n      agent assigned to treatment with low dose naltrexone will demonstrate higher rates of\n      response compared to those patients taking placebo."

Dopaminergic agents here include classical stimulants from the amphetamine or\n                  methylphenidate families; dopamine agonists (e.g. pramipexole); or dopamine\n                  active antidepressants like bupropion.\n\n               2. Additionally, low dose (< 2.5  mg) Abilify, a D2 partial agonist, is believed to\n                  exert pro-dopaminergic effects and will therefore be included as a dopamine\n                  agent.\n\n               3. Sertraline, although classified as an SSRI, has dopamine reuptake inhibiting\n                  properties believed to be relevant at higher doses (> 150 mg of sertraline), and\n                  will also therefore be considered a dopaminergic antidepressant at dose range\n                  above.\n\n               4. Based on the finding that the norepinephrine transporter is the reuptake\n                  inhibitor for dopamine in the prefrontal cortex  and the robust sustained\n                  clinical response of a patient on duloxetine and low dose naltrexone, we include\n                  duloxetine, traditionally classed as an SNRI, among the dopamine acting\n                  antidepressants.)\n\n          -  During the baseline visit, patients must be on a stable dose of antidepressant\n             regimen for the past 4 weeks.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Pregnant women or women of child bearing potential who are not using a medically\n             accepted means of contraception (to include oral contraceptive or implant, condom,\n             diaphragm, spermicide, intrauterine device, tubal ligation, or partner with\n             vasectomy).\n\n          -  Patients who no longer meet DSM-IV criteria for MDD during the baseline visit.\n\n          -  Patients who demonstrate a greater than 25% decrease in depressive symptoms as\n             reflected by the QIDS-SR total score - screen to baseline.\n\n          -  Serious suicide or homicide risk, as assessed by evaluating clinician.\n\n          -  Unstable medical illness including cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory,\n             endocrine, neurological, or hematological disease.\n\n          -  Substance use disorders active within the last six months, any bipolar disorder\n             (current or past), any psychotic disorder (current or past).\n\n          -  History of a seizure disorder or clinical evidence of untreated hypothyroidism.\n\n          -  Patients requiring excluded medications (including but not limited to chronic or\n             episodic use of anorexiants, episodic hormones, episodic benzodiazepines, episodic\n             insulin, episodic and other episodic psychotropic medications).\n\n          -  Psychotic features in the current episode or a history of psychotic features, as\n             assessed by SCID.\n\n          -  History of naltrexone intolerance at any dose.\n\n          -  Patients with a history of antidepressant-induced hypomania.\n\n          -  Inadequate exposure time or dose of current SSRI or Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake\n             inhibitor (SNRI); failure to comply with at least 80% of doses."
