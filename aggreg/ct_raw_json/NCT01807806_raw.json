The\n      purpose of the intervention to be delivered by Soar Technology is to educate families and\n      friends with the ultimate goal of empowering them to have a conversation with the\n      veteran/service member about readjustment issues. The study will assess the safety and\n      effectiveness of the provided game using personal interviews, play testing, and surveys. The\n      game playing experience is hypothesized to be safe and effective with respect to having\n      conversations with veterans/service members following deployment."
