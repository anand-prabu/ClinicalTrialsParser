In this study, it will be used as an MRI\n      contrast.  Contrasts are used by doctors in order to see MRI images more clearly."

About an hour\n      after these 2 scans, you will receive ferumoxytol by vein.  Right after that, you will have\n      your first study MRI.  The study MRI will be performed in the same way that a standard MRI\n      is performed.\n\n      On Day 2, about 24 hours after you receive ferumoxytol, you will have a second study MRI.\n\n      Additional Tests:\n\n      On Days 1 and 3, as well as 4 weeks after the first study MRI:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and/or to check your iron\n           level.\n\n      On Day 2:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  If you have not had one in the last month, you will have a PET-CT scan to check the\n           status of the disease.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You will be on study for about 4 weeks.  You will be taken off study if you have intolerable\n      side effects or you are unable to have the scans for any reason.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Ferumoxytol is commercially available and FDA-approved\n      for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia.\n\n      Up to 20 patients will take part in this study.  All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."

Patients 18 years of age or older with histologically or cytologically confirmed head\n             and neck squamous cell carcinoma\n\n          2. Measurable clinical and/or radiographic poly-nodal disease defined as stage N2b, N2c\n             or N3 disease with multiple involved lymph nodes as defined by the American Joint\n             Committee on Cancer (AJCC) cancer staging criteria\n\n          3. Patients who have received or are dispositioned to receive a Positron emission\n             tomography (PET) and computerized tomography (CT) [PET-CT] scan within two weeks of\n             starting definitive therapy for their HNSCC and their participation in this study.\n             This implies patients must receive a PET-CT to be eligible for the study.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Patients who have undergone definitive resection of their primary or nodal disease as\n             well as any chemotherapy or radiation therapy for their HNSCC.\n\n          2. Patients unable or unwilling to give written, informed consent or to undergo MRI\n             imaging.\n\n          3. Women of childbearing potential (A woman of child-bearing potential is a sexually\n             mature woman who has not undergone a hysterectomy or who has not been naturally\n             postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months [i.e., who has had menses at any\n             time in the preceding 24 consecutive months]). Male partners must practice effective\n             contraception (oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal contraceptive; tubal\n             ligation; intra-uterine device; barrier contraceptive with spermicide; or\n             vasectomized partner) throughout the study.\n\n          4. Patients unable to tolerate DCE-MRI or having an estimated GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m^2.\n\n          5. Contraindications to iron supplementation include hemochromatosis, colitis, history\n             of GI bleeds, alcoholism, or liver disease. Ferumoxytol is contraindicated in\n             patients with evidence of iron overload and/or known hypersensitivity to Feraheme or\n             any of its components. Consequently, we will plan to exclude patients who have\n             symptoms or signs that might be caused by iron overload. These include patients with\n             (unexplained): arthritis (including premature osteoarthritis), congestive heart\n             failure or cardiomyopathy, adult-onset diabetes, secondary hypogonadism, increased\n             skin pigmentation, or patients with persistently elevated serum ferritin not\n             explained by an underlying inflammatory/systemic disease, unless these patients\n             demonstrate a fasting transferrin saturation </= 0.45.\n\n          6. Patients with any evidence of iron overload on pre-imaging laboratory studies.\n\n          7. Patients with any contraindications to gadolinium-based contrast agents.\n\n          8. Patients with claustrophobia."
