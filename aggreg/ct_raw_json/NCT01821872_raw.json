            "textblock": "Despite its use for decades all over the world, the exact mechanism of action of paracetamol\n      is not fully understood and essentially involves a combination of hypotheses.  It is known\n      to have an effect via the central nervous system, and of the many mechanisms proposed, one\n      hypothesis is that it may have indirectly activate CB1 (cannabinoid) receptors, through its\n      novel metabolite AM404.\n\n      This study aims to elucidate cerebrospinal levels of paracetamol and to measure the\n      concentration of its metabolites, including AM404 in CSF.  This may, in turn, give us useful\n      information on the mechanism of action of paracetamol."

This could account for the rapid central analgesic and antipyretic action of\n      intravenous paracetamol however this remains to be studied in adults. AM404 has never before\n      been identified in humans, and its presence in CSF following paracetamol supports the\n      hypothesis of a central mechanism of action of paracetamol via AM404."
