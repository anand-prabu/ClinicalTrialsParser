            "textblock": "Focused Ultrasound Focused ultrasound is an attractive method for non-invasive thermal\n      ablation of soft tissue tumors. Treatment begins by acquiring a series of MR images of the\n      target organ. The physician then identifies a target volume in the MR images and delineates\n      the treatment contours on the images. Therapy planning software calculates the parameters\n      required to effectively treat the defined target volume. During the treatment an ultrasound\n      transducer generates and focuses ultrasound energy to a focal point, called a sonication.\n      The sonication raises the tissue temperature within a well-defined region to a degree, which\n      causes thermal coagulation. MR images acquired during sonication provide a quantitative,\n      real-time temperature map of the target area to confirm the location of the sonication and\n      the size of the coagulated region. The sonication process is repeated at multiple adjacent\n      points to cover the entire prescribed treatment volume."

Oral anticoagulant or thrombocyte aggregation suppression (e.g. ASS) that was not\n             stopped at least 5 days before the intervention.\n\n         10. Contraindication for MR-exams, such as non-MR-compatible implants or cardiac\n             pacemaker.\n\n         11. Clips and other implants in the sonication path or in the target area.\n\n         12.
