Although FL with histologic grade 1 or 2 has\n      relatively good prognosis, continual treatment is needed due to frequent relapse. FL with\n      histologic grade 3 has poor prognosis similar to that of diffuse large B cell lymphoma.\n      Meanwhile, the response rate to systemic chemotherapy in MCL is low, so the treatment of\n      relapsed MCL is challenging. So we investigate the efficacy of radioimmunotherapy using\n      131I-rituximab in refractory or relapsed patients with FL or MCL"
