    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine whether or not addition of the oral medication,
      pioglitazone to standard chemotherapy, results in improvement of blood tests that measure
      the body's ability to utilize sugar (glucose and insulin metabolism). In addition the
      investigators want to determine whether or not treatment with pioglitazone results in (1)
      improvement in the size of the tumor, (2) weight gain, (3) improved ability to function
      during the day and (4) quality of life.
