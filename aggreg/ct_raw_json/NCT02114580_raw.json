            "textblock": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of Alzheimer disease (AD), refers to a\n      transitional state between the cognition of normal aging and dementia such AD. To date,\n      therapeutic approaches to AD are symptomatic and of modest efficacy. Nontheless, recent\n      studies in animal models or healthy subjects, have shown that aerobic exercise affect brain\n      plasticity. The current proposal aims at exploring the brain mechanisms mediating the\n      cognitive benefits of aerobic exercise in patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI),in compare to a\n      control group of subjects with aMCI receiving stretching exercise. More specifically, we aim\n      to perform two fMRI experiments, that will advance our knowledge about the nature of\n      mechanism of the cognitive benefit resulting of aerobic exercise. Our preleminary results\n      suggest that subjects with aMCI show different hierarchy of reliable responses when\n      processing long time scales in auditory task. Therefore, in the first experiment, we will\n      evaluate how these patterns of temporal hierarchy of language processing are affected by\n      aerobic exercise. Next, we will explore whether aerobic exercise affect memory enocoding\n      task, which rely on areas in the medial temporal lobe who bear a heavy neuropathological\n      burden in MCI. The insights gained from the study may have important clinical implications\n      for patients who are at the early stages of Alzheimer's disease"
