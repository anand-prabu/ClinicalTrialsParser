Bortezomib is part\n      of the standard treatment and its effects on multiple myeloma is not being studied here.\n\n      The investigators want to learn whether damage occurs to the heart after taking bortezomib\n      for multiple myeloma, whether it is reversible, and we can predict damage to the heart\n      before it occurs."
