Ambulant visits take place from Day 4 to Day 50. Full PK profiles are\n      obtained for enzalutamide, Major Inactive Carboxylic Acid Metabolite (M1) and Active\n      Metabolite N-desmethyl Enzalutamide (M2) from Day 1 up to Day 50 after intake of\n      enzalutamide.\n\n      In Arm 2 each subject receives a once-daily dose of rifampin on Days 1 to 21. On Day 8, a\n      single oral dose of enzalutamide is administered under fasted conditions concomitantly with\n      rifampin. Full PK profiles are obtained for enzalutamide, M1 and M2 from Day 8 up to Day 57\n      after intake of enzalutamide.\n\n      An End of Study Visit (ESV) takes place between 7 and 10 days after the last PK sample or\n      early withdrawal.\n\n      Safety assessments are performed throughout the study."
