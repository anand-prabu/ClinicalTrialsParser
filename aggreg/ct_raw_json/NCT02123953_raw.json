This study looked at lab results and side effects in people who took TAK-438.\n\n      The study consisted of 5 steps covering dose ranges of TAK-438 from 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 mg\n      once daily for 7 days. The study population for each step included 12 participants. Within\n      each step, 9 participants were randomized to TAK-438 and 3 participants were randomized to\n      placebo. A total of 60 participants were enrolled.\n\n      The dosing groups in this study took place in sequential order.  Therefore, the TAK-438 15\n      mg group did not start until the TAK-439 10 mg group had completed, etc. All participants in\n      each dosing group were asked to take the study drug in the morning, after fasting for at\n      least 10 hours, each day throughout the study.\n\n      This single-centre trial was conducted in the Japan. The overall time to participate in this\n      study was up to 43 days. Participants made 3 visits to the clinic, including one 11-day\n      period of confinement to the clinic, and a final visit 7 days after last dose of study drug\n      for a follow-up assessment."
