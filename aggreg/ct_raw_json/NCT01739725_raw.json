Many\n      surgeons routinely use ureteral stents after the endourologic removal of stones to\n      facilitate in urine passage and facilitate excretion of any left over stones. There is a\n      multitude of literature that reveals that most patients find ureteral stents to be\n      uncomfortable. This discomfort often causes pain severe enough that patients anxiously\n      anticipate stent removal, and often request early stent removal, and/or require use of pain\n      medications that have many side effects and cause further discomfort to these patients."
