Its diagnosis is\n      mainly based on MR imaging, showing MODIC I or II changes in patients with concordant\n      symptomatology. The treatment of discogenic low back pain is nevertheless difficult:\n      intradiscal therapies (corticosteroids, methylene blue, radiofrequency) have a limited\n      efficacy, and surgical procedures (arthrodesis or disc replacement) are a final recourse\n      with notable risk of side-effects.\n\n      In this study, the efficacy of intradiscal injection of gelified ethanol (DiscoGel) in\n      patients with disabling discogenic pain is assessed."
