      This clinical trial studies gene analysis in studying susceptibility to Wilms tumor. Finding
      genetic markers for Wilms tumor may help identify patients who are at risk of relapse

      Study Subtype: Ancillary/Correlative Observational Study Model: Case-control Time
      Perspective: Retrospective Biospecimen Retention: Samples With DNA Biospecimen Description:
      DNA samples Study Population Description: Samples from the National Wilms Tumor Study Group
      (NWTSG) Sampling Method: Non-Probability Sample

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To use a genome-wide association analysis to identify novel genetic variants that confer
      susceptibility to Wilms tumor.

      II. To improve our understanding of the genetic architecture and etiology of Wilms tumor.

      III. To facilitate the identification of genetic markers that are associated with an
      increased risk of developing of Wilms tumor and/or those at risk of aggressive disease,
      relapse, additional tumors and/or cancer in their offspring.

      OUTLINE:

      Samples are analyzed for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiling using real-time
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA).

        We currently have 1300 DNA samples from Wilms tumor cases, primarily from recruitment from
        oncology clinics over the last decade. We are further identifying Wilms tumor survivors &gt;
        1000 for targeted recruitment. However, if there is any shortfall, we will use additional
        US and/or IWTGC cases and we are fully confident that at least 2000 cases for the
        replication will be available.
