One specific questionnaire that has already been developed from social sciences\n           interviews conducted in men who have been treated for localized prostrate cancer, with\n           a good or intermediate prognosis. This questionnaire comprises 11 pairs of scenarios.\n           Each scenario gathers in a random manner, the modalities of 7 possible characteristics\n           of the management strategy for localized prostrate cancer, with a good or intermediate\n           prognosis:\n\n             -  the risk of death at 5 years (modalities: 5%, 15%),\n\n             -  the risk of impotence (modalities: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%),\n\n             -  the presence of urinary leaks (modalities: no protection during the day, one\n                protection pad per day, several protection pads per day),\n\n             -  the duration and frequency of care provided (modalities: 2 days of care in your\n                whole life, 7 days of care in your whole life, 5 half-days of care per week for 8\n                weeks, every 3 months for 2 years then every 6 months for life),\n\n             -  ablation of the prostate (modalities: Yes, No),\n\n             -  the existence of possible treatments in case of aggravation or recurrence\n                (modalities: Yes, No),\n\n             -  the nature of the technology used (modalities: innovative technology, standard\n                technology).\n\n           The objective is to ask each participant of the study for each pair of scenarios, to\n           choose from the two scenarios (binary-choice survey), the scenario he prefers.\n\n        2. The \"Spielberger Inventory Trait\" scale to evaluate stable characteristics in the\n           propensity to anxiety in study participants."
