In the INTERVENTION group ICU Staff will use NIRS to\n      follow a physiologically guided strategy to maintain rSO2 within 90% of baseline values. In\n      the CONTROL group ICU Staff will provide standard of care without the use of NIRS."

            "textblock": "Background and Rationale Cerebral desaturation has previously been shown to be associated\n      with significant morbidity in cardiac surgery postoperatively.  As such, previously reported\n      efforts have been aimed at treating intraoperative desaturation events, with early evidence\n      suggesting that this may reduce the incidence of these adverse events. Our previous study,\n      NIRS ICU (B2011:110) has demonstrated that significant cerebral oxygen desaturation\n      [measured using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) derived cerebral oximetry] frequently\n      occurs in the intensive care unit (ICU) within the first 24 hours following cardiac surgery.\n      To date, no studies have addressed the early postoperative period (i.e. in the ICU) with\n      respect to treating (and/or preventing) these desaturation events.\n\n      Specific Aims and Experimental Design The specific aim of this pilot prospective\n      interventional trial is to determine the feasibility/efficacy of treating cerebral oxygen\n      desaturation in the ICU following cardiac surgery.  Two groups of patients will be studied.\n       Both groups will have cerebral saturation measured continuously both intraoperatively and\n      postoperatively.   The control group however, will have these measurements blinded to the\n      intraoperative and postoperative caregivers.  The interventional group will have the\n      cerebral oximetry measurements available to the intraoperative and postoperative care team\n      allowing them to intervene when a desaturation event occurs.  If a cerebral desaturation\n      occurs, defined as a decline in saturation of 10% from the patient's preoperative baseline,\n      then a previously utilized interventional algorithm, NORMOSAT (B2012:005), will be\n      instituted to reverse the decrease in cerebral saturation, ideally preventing it from\n      becoming a clinically meaningful desaturation (previously defined by others as saturation\n      decline of 25% from the baseline). The algorithm used addresses many of the known causes of\n      desaturation, including low arterial oxygen content (both saturation and hemoglobin) and\n      cardiac output influences on cerebral blood flow.  As such, if a desaturation occurs, the\n      patient will first have the PaO2 increased by increasing the inspired oxygen content. The\n      PaCO2 will also be normalized by adjusting the ventilator settings.  The cardiac output will\n      be optimized and the blood pressure will be increased with standard ICU protocols to\n      administer phenylephrine.  If remaining low, the patients will be transfused to standard of\n      care hemoglobin levels.\n\n      In this pilot trial, a convenience sample of 50 consecutive consenting patients undergoing\n      cardiac surgery employing CPB will be studied. After obtaining consent, bilateral cerebral\n      oximetry sensors will be placed on the forehead of patients prior to the induction of\n      anesthesia.  Baseline (breathing room air) regional cerebral saturation (rSO2) will be\n      recorded.  Following this, induction of anesthesia will occur and continuous NIRS\n      measurements will be collected during the surgical procedure with continued monitoring\n      occurring for the first 24 hours (or until discharge) within the ICU.  In the control group,\n      conventional anesthesia and ICU standards of care will be carried out throughout the study\n      period.  In the interventional group, an algorithm based on the modification of previously\n      defined important physiologic variables will be initiated to reverse the desaturation\n      (beginning when the saturation drops at least 10% from the baseline) that occurs in the OR\n      and ICU."
