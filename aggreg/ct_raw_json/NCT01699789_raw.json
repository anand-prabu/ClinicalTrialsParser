            "textblock": "CPIC is a community initiative and research study funded by the NIH. CPIC was developed and\n      is being run by community and academic partners in Los Angeles underserved communities of\n      color. CPIC compares two ways of supporting diverse health and social programs in\n      under-resourced communities to improve their services to depressed clients. One approach is\n      time-limited expert technical assistance coupled with culturally-competent community\n      outreach to individual programs, on how to use quality improvement toolkits for depression\n      that have already been proven to be effective or helpful in primary care settings, but\n      adapted for this study for use in diverse community-based programs in underserved\n      communities. The other approach brings different types of agencies and members in a\n      community together in a 4 to 6-month planning process, to fit the same depression quality\n      improvement programs to the needs and strengths of the community and to develop a network of\n      programs serving the community to support clients with depression together. The study is\n      designed to determine the added value of community engagement and planning over and above\n      what might be offered through a community-oriented, disease management company. Both\n      intervention models are based on the same quality improvement toolkits that support team\n      leadership, care management, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, medication management, and\n      patient education and activation. Investigators hypothesized that the community engagement\n      approach would increase agency and clinician participation in evidence-based trainings and\n      improve client mental health-related quality of life. In addition, during the design phase,\n      community participants prioritized adding as outcomes indicators of social determinants of\n      mental health, including physical functioning, risk factors for homelessness and employment.\n      Investigators hypothesized by activating community agencies that can address health and\n      social services needs to engage depressed clients, these outcomes would also be improved\n      more in the collaboration condition. Investigators also hypothesized that the collaboration\n      approach would increase use of services."

            "textblock": "Underserved communities of color in low income, largely ethnic-minority neighborhoods face\n      an excessive burden of illness from depression due to higher prevalence of depression and\n      lower access to quality care. Evidence-based quality improvement (QI) programs for\n      depression in primary care settings\u2014where many low-income and minority patients receive\n      their only mental health care\u2014can enhance quality of depression care and improve health\n      outcomes. These programs are under-utilized in community-based health care settings, and\n      have not been adapted for use across diverse agencies (social service, faith based, primary\n      and specialty care) that could partner to support disease management for depression.\n      Partners in Care (PIC)and WE Care are interventions designed to improve access to\n      evidence-based depression treatments (medication management or psychotherapy) for primary\n      care patients and, in WE Care, social service clients. PIC evaluated a services delivery\n      intervention while WE Care was an effectiveness trial with study-provided treatments. Both\n      studies promoted use of the same evidence-based treatments. Both PIC and WE Care programs\n      improved use of evidence-based treatments for depression and health outcomes for African\n      Americans and Latinos.  The PIC interventions reduced health outcome disparities evident in\n      usual care in the first follow-up year and at five-year follow-up.  While these findings\n      offer hope to underserved communities, such communities have poor resources to support\n      implementation of these programs, and may have historical distrust in research and health\n      care settings. There is no evidence-based approach to support agency networks in underserved\n      communities in implementing QI programs for depression.  To address this information gap,\n      investigators created Community Partners in Care (CPIC), a group-level randomized,\n      controlled trial, with randomization at the level of an agency site or \"unit.\" The trial is\n      being fielded in two underserved communities, Hollywood and South Los Angeles, and conducted\n      through a community- participatory, partnered research (CPPR) approach.\n\n      The specific aims of the study are:\n\n        1. To engage two underserved communities in improving safety-net care for depression.\n\n        2. To examine the effects of a community-engagement approach to implementing\n           evidence-based depression quality improvement toolkits (PIC/WE Care) through a\n           community collaborative network across services sectors, compared to technical\n           assistance to individual programs from the same services sectors coupled with\n           culturally-competent outreach to implement the same toolkits.  The outcomes are: a)\n           client access to care, quality of care and health outcomes, with the primary outcome\n           being mental-health related quality of life and additional outcomes reflecting social\n           determinants of mental health of interest to the community (physical health,\n           homelessness risk factors, employment); b) services utilization and costs; c) agency\n           adoption of PIC/WE Care; d) and provider attitudes, knowledge and practice.\n\n        3. To describe the process of implementation of the community engagement intervention.\n\n      CPIC was awarded funds from the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) in 2013\n      to accomplish the following 3 aims:\n\n        1. To compare the long-term (3-year) effectiveness of community engagement and planning\n           versus agency technical assistance to implement depression QI and improve depressed\n           clients' health status and risk for homelessness\n\n        2. To determine how depressed clients in under-resourced communities prioritize diverse\n           health and social outcomes and identify their preferences for services to address\n           priority outcomes\n\n        3. To identify capacities of providers to respond to depressed clients' priorities and to\n           generate recommendations for building capacity to better address clients'priorities.\n\n      We hypothesize that community engagement and planning will be more effective than technical\n      assistance in improving 3-year outcomes and that clients will prioritize quality of life. We\n      expect to find gaps in provider capacities to address client priorities that network\n      strategies could address.\n\n      Our primary outcome for the long-term follow-up is mental health related quality of life and\n      secondary outcomes are use of healthcare and community services for depression and physical\n      functioning and homeless risk factors."
