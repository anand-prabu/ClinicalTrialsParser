  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of overweight and obesity among older adults has reached an all-time high,
      which puts this age group at high risk for associated comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes,
      cardiovascular disease, and certain forms of cancer. Confronted with declining incomes and
      economic uncertainty, many middle-aged and older Americans tried to save on their food
      purchases during the 2007-2009 recession. Grocery coupons, available through newspapers,
      mail, and increasingly online, are one of several promotional tools that supermarkets and
      warehouse clubs use to promote sales. It is estimated that nationally 27% of households are
      frequent grocery coupon users who shop at a variety of retailers. Despite the increasing
      popularity of grocery coupons, little is known about the extent to which they may promote
      obesogenic home food environments and eating behaviors. Many coupons advertise the purchase
      of large quantities of prepackaged and processed foods and often reward shoppers by adding
      'free' products if they purchase certain quantities. Availability and easy accessibility of
      large portions of energy dense foods in the home has been shown to promote increased intake.
      The proposed study seeks to examine the effects of frequent grocery coupon usage on dietary
      intake, weight status, and home food availability among middle-aged and older adults. A
      second aim of this study is to test, in a randomized-controlled trial, the effects of
      incentivizing grocery coupon use for the purchase of healthy foods on 3-month changes in
      dietary intake, body mass index/waist circumference, home food availability, and grocery
      coupon use among frequent coupon users and non-coupon users.
