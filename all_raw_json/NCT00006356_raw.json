Giving a chemotherapy drug before surgery may shrink the tumor\n      so that it can be removed during surgery.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy with or\n      without surgery in treating patients who have recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer."

Patients are stratified according to stage\n      at initial diagnosis (early stage I-IIa vs advanced stage IIb-IV), length of interval from\n      end of prior first line chemotherapy (1-2 years vs more than 2 years), response to first 3\n      courses of second line induction chemotherapy in this study (no change vs partial remission\n      vs complete remission), number of measurable tumor lesions (1 vs more than 1), largest tumor\n      size of recurrence (less than 5 cm vs 5 cm or more), and participating center.\n\n      Patients receive second line induction chemotherapy with either 3 courses of a 3-4 week\n      regimen or 6 courses of a weekly regimen of platinum based (cisplatin or carboplatin)\n      therapy. Patients with no change, partial remission, or complete remission are randomized to\n      one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo secondary cytoreductive surgery within 14 days of\n           randomization. Within 8 weeks after the last preoperative chemotherapy course, patients\n           continue platinum based chemotherapy every 3-4 weeks for at least 3 additional courses\n           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients continue platinum based chemotherapy for at least 3 additional courses\n           as in arm I.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline; before the 4th or 6th course of chemotherapy or 1\n      week before surgery; after the 6th course of chemotherapy in the chemotherapy only arm OR\n      before the 4th or 6th course of chemotherapy in the surgery arm; 2 months after chemotherapy\n      or after the 6th course of chemotherapy in the surgery arm; and then every 6 months for up\n      to 5 years.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 3 years or\n      until disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 700 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years."
