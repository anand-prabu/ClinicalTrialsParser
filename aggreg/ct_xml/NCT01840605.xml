      The objective of this study is to verify the non-inferiority of TAU-284 to ketotifen
      fumarate dry syrup in the change in the severity of pruritus after the treatment period.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group comparative study to demonstrate the
      noninferiority of TAU-284 to ketotifen fumarate in pediatric patients with atopic
      dermatitis, as assessed by the primary endpoint of the change from baseline in pruritus
      score after 2-week treatment with TAU-284 (20 mg/day) or ketotifen fumarate dry syrup (2
      g/day); and to investigate the safety, and plasma concentrations of TAU-284.
