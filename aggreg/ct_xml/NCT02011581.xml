  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn more about how our body produces sugar,
      breaks down fat for fuel, and makes insulin (the major hormone that controls the production
      of blood sugar and fat breakdown) during a 24-hour day and how body fat and muscle are
      involved in these processes.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether there are diurnal differences in
      postprandial beta-cell function and hepatic insulin sensitivity and the factors that
      influence these metabolic functions, including insulin signaling, adipose tissue and
      systemic inflammation, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)-mediated nicotinamide
      adenine dinucleotide(NAD) biosynthesis, and sirtuin (silent mating type information
      regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1)) in overweight human subjects.
