  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, partial-blinded, five-arm, placebo-controlled study of
      human plasma-derived alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha1-PI) in children (ages 6-11 years
      old) and teens/adults (ages 12-35 years old) with new onset Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM).
       The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of four dosing regimens of
      human plasma-derived alpha1-PI in T1DM.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of T1DM according to the ADA criteria.

          -  Current use of injected insulin therapy and one positive result on testing for any of
             the following antibodies (If not currently on insulin therapy, must have positive
             result for at least two of the below antibodies):

               -  Anti-islet-cell antibodies (islet cell antigen 512, insulinoma associated
                  protein 2),

               -  Anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, or

               -  Anti-insulin antibodies (unless received insulin therapy for &gt; 7 days).

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) ≤ 25 kg/m2 for adults (≥ 20 years of age) OR &lt; 85th percentile
             in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control BMI assessment for children and
             teens (2 through 19 years old).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of or current diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, or nephropathy.

          -  Known thrombophilia or history of thrombosis.

             are allowed) within five years of randomization.

          -  Active Hepatitis A virus, Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, or Human
             Immunodeficiency Virus infection.

          -  History of anaphylaxis or severe systemic response to any plasma-derived alpha1-PI
             preparation or other blood product(s).

          -  Known selective or severe Immunoglobulin A deficiency.

          -  Elevated liver enzymes (aspartate transaminase, alanine aminotransferase, and
             alkaline phosphatase) equal to or greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal.

          -  Therapy with exenatide or any other agents that stimulate pancreatic β cell
             regeneration or insulin secretion, or any antidiabetic agents (oral or parenteral)
             other than insulin within three months prior to screening.

          -  Use of omega-3 fatty acid supplements, including fish oil, within seven days prior to
             screening.

          -  Current or planned therapy with inhaled insulin, if it becomes available.

          -  Use of systemic steroids above a stable dose equivalent to 5 mg/day prednisone (e.g.,
             10 mg every 2 days) within the 4 weeks prior to randomization.  It is recommended to
             maintain the same dose throughout the study.

          -  Treatment with immunosuppressants or cytostatic agents within 6 months of
             randomization.
