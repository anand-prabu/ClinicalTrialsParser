Patients with tremor\n             predominant form of PD, quantified as a UPDRS tremor score in any one limb greater\n             than or equal to 3 and UPDRS sum of axial score (speech, posture, gait, balance) less\n             than or equal to 5, who do not reach the 30% threshold, may be included.\n\n          -  Potential participants must have evidence of complications of medication, e.g.,\n             wearing off signs, fluctuating responses and/or dyskinesias, and/or medication\n             refractory tremor, and/or impairment in the quality of life on or off medication.\n\n          -  Potential participants must have the ability to understand instructions in English.\n\n          -  Potential participants are males or females between the ages of 21 and 75.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Individuals who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or are capable of becoming pregnant and\n             not using an acceptable method of birth control. Acceptable methods of birth control\n             include hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine device, abstinence or spermicide and\n             barrier.\n\n          -  Individuals who have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans demonstrating cortical\n             atrophy out of proportion to age.\n\n          -  Individuals who have MRI scans showing focal brain lesions that could indicate a\n             nonidiopathic movement disorder.\n\n          -  Individuals who have major comorbidity increasing the risk of surgery such as prior\n             stroke, severe hypertension, severe diabetes, or need for chronic anticoagulation\n             other than aspirin.\n\n          -  Individuals who have had any prior intracranial surgery.\n\n          -  Individuals who have clinically active depression defined according to the Diagnostic\n             and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria and\n             scored on a validated depression assessment scale.\n\n          -  Individuals who have significant cognitive impairment and/or dementia as determined\n             by a standardized neuropsychological battery.\n\n          -  Individuals who have a history of seizures.\n\n          -  Individuals who are immunocompromised.\n\n          -  Individuals who have an active infection.\n\n          -  Individuals who require diathermy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or transcranial\n             magnetic stimulation (TMS) to treat a chronic condition.\n\n          -  Individuals who have an implanted electronic device such as a neurostimulator,\n             cardiac pacemaker or medication pump.\n\n          -  Individuals who, at the discretion of the research team member, lack the cognitive\n             ability to understand the instructions and fully participate in research tasks.\n\n          -  Unable to understand written and spoken instructions in English. Individuals who\n             carry a concomitant diagnosis that would preclude them from fully participating in\n             the research tasks due to difficulties associated with comprehending instructions,\n             cooperating with research tasks, or otherwise rendering the individuals incapable of\n             participating in the research tasks.
