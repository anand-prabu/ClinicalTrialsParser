  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the histrelin acetate subdermal implant
      (originally versus Lupron Depot-3 Month) in male patients with advanced prostate cancer
      during 52 weeks of treatment with the implant.  After consultation w/ FDA, design was
      modified to eliminate the Lupron arm and continued the study as an open-label non-randomized
      study.

      Primary endpoint was testosterone suppression, as assessed by the percent of patients whose
      testosterone indicated chemical castration levels (&lt;=50 ng/dL) through 52 weeks of treatment
      with an implant.

      Other outcome measures included serum levels of LH, PSA, as well as non-clinical
      assessments, eg, WHO Performance Status, pain level assessment, and quality of life
      questionnaires.  Safety was evaluated via adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory
      outcomes, physical examinations, and ECGs. Local tolerability outcomes were also evaluated.

      An extension period for the study included annual replacement of the implant until the
      implant was approved by the FDA (October 12, 2004).  Efficacy and safety were followed
      during the extension period.
