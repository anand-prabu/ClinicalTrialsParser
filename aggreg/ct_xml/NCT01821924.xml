  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to use retrospective data to assess heart function and structure
      abnormalities through the use of an approved vasodilating agent for stress cardiac MRI
      tests. The investigators are interested in how these MRI findings relate to long-term
      prognosis in people who are at risk for cardiac disease.

    <description>&quot;Myocardial infarction&quot; will be defined as hospital admission for acute coronary syndrome (defined by positive serum troponin level with documented electrocardiographic changes, clinical syndrome, or need for percutaneous or surgical revascularization). &quot;Heart failure hospitalization&quot; will be defined as any hospitalization for signs and symptoms of volume overload or dyspnea requiring diuretic therapy regardless of LV ejection fraction.</description>
