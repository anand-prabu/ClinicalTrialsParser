            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Define the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of monoclonal antibody muJ591\n      in patients with hormone independent prostate cancer. II. Define the pharmacokinetics and\n      biodistribution of monoclonal antibody muJ591 in these patients. III. Define the human\n      antimouse antibody response to this therapy. IV. Define the preliminary efficacy of this\n      therapy in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive a single dose of intravenous\n      iodine I 131-labeled monoclonal antibody muJ591 on day 0, combined with an unlabeled (cold)\n      dose of monoclonal antibody muJ591. Anterior and posterior imaging is obtained 1 hour after\n      labeled muJ591 administration and on days 0, 2, 4, and 6. Subsequent cohorts of 3-6 patients\n      receive fixed iodine-labeled doses with escalating cold doses of monoclonal antibody muJ591\n      until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Patients are followed for a minimum of 8 weeks\n      after muJ591 therapy or until disease progression. Patients with stable or responding\n      disease who are human anti-mouse antibody negative may receive subsequent treatments at the\n      discretion of the principal investigator.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study."
