The terminal effector memory\n      phenotype (CD3+/CD8+/CD57+/CD45RA+/CD62L-) of leukemic LGL suggest a pivotal chronic antigen\n      driven immune response. LGL survival is then promoted by PDGF and IL-15, resulting in global\n      dysregulation of apoptosis and resistance to normal pathways of activation-induced death.\n      These pathogenic features explain why treatment of LGL leukemia is based on\n      immunosuppression therapy. However, no standard therapy has been established due to the\n      absence of large prospective trials.\n\n      Oral low dose MTX has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of neutropenia. However,\n      response to MTX is slow, requiring several months for the neutrophil count to increase above\n      500/mm3. Also, complete clinical remission may not be achieved until after one year of MTX\n      therapy. Oral Cy has been the primary drug used for the treatment of severe\n      transfusion-dependent anemia. Beneficial clinical effects are seen despite this treatment\n      having no apparent effect on the abnormal LGL clone. Normal hematocrits are maintained after\n      cessation of Cy and these results contrast the effects seen with MTX, in which clinical\n      remissions are often associated with the disappearance of the clone.\n\n      This phase II trial undertaken by the Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) was initiated to\n      investigate the mechanism of treatment response in patients with LGL leukemia, who need\n      treatment for anemia or neutropenia."

The response must last for at least four weeks:In patients being treated for severe neutropenia (less than 500 neutrophils/mm3) an improvement to over 500 neutrophils/mm3 will be considered a partial response, as long as that improvement represents at least a 50% impr",
