  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this study is to validate the venous blood oxygenation measurements of the
      Mespere VA Oximeter compared to the saturations measured by venous blood sampling through an
      inserted central vein catheter, which is currently the standard of care for measuring SvO2

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The conventional bedside pulse oximeter has been a standard in clinical care for
      non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring and measures arterial blood oxygenation.  To date, a
      non-invasive bedside monitor for measuring mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) has not
      been developed. The clinical applications of venous oximetry are numerous and include
      management of severe sepsis and septic shock, trauma and hemorrhagic shock, heart failure
      and cardiac arrest.

      The existing method for venous blood oxygenation monitored is either through an invasive
      fiber optic catheter, or intermittently by blood sampling through a central venous catheter
      Oximetry. However, SvO2 measurements using fiber optic catheters are very expensive, and all
      central line insertions include inherent risks. Also, insertion of a central line is in some
      circumstances not feasible (e.g. discomfort/limited experience in central line insertion,
      unavailability of specific monitoring systems etc.) resulting in inappropriate therapy
      usually guided by SvO2.  Therefore, a non-invasive monitor to measure SvO2 at the bedside
      negating the requirement for a central line insertion would be of clinical benefit and allow
      appropriate therapy of many patients listed above at a time when therapy has the most
      benefit.

      The Mespere VA Oximeter is a novel non-invasive medical device for simultaneous monitoring
      of venous blood oxygenation through the internal or external jugular vein.  The Mespere VA
      Oximeter is based upon near infrared spectroscopy. The System consists of a portable monitor
      and probe is placed on the skin overlying the internal or external jugular vein (right or
      left). The monitor displays the oxygenation and plethysmographic waveforms of venous blood
      measured at the level of the neck vein.

      Continuous measurement of SvO2 will be beneficial because it will help the physician better
      understand local ischemia as well as provide better guidance for the physician to be able to
      best treat the patient and decrease their burden of illness.

    <description>Mespere VA oximeter provides non-invasive measurement of the oxygenation of the venous and arterial blood simultaneously. In the measurement, the venous adhesive patch is placed on top of the internal or external jugular vein (right or left) and the pulse oximeter probe is placed on the right index finger. The monitor simultaneously displays the oxygenations and plethysmographic waveforms of venous blood and arterial blood.</description>

        Study subjects will consist of patients admitted either to the Medical Surgical ICU or the
        Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit at University Hospital.  The  four groups will comprise
        patients with the following diagnoses:  i) sepsis +/- septic shock, ii) post cardiac
        surgery low output syndrome requiring inotropic/vasopressor therapy, iii) cardiogenic
        shock post myocardial infarction, and iv) hypoxemic respiratory failure.
