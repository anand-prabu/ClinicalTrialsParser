    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the performance attributes and user progression of  participants
      with motor complete and incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) while utilizing the Ekso robotic
      exoskeleton in an eight week over ground, locomotor program.  We hypothesize an improvement
      in progression and overall health while using Ekso.

                  years of age)

          -  Any medical issue that in the opinion of the Investigator would affect participant
             safety either due to cognitive deficits/impulsivity, intolerance to mild exercise or
             other factors
