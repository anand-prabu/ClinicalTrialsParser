      This is a protocol to obtain blood, urine and/or airway specimens from normal individuals
      and individuals with lung disorders in order to carry out laboratory studies looking at
      genetic expression, gene transfer, infection, proteins, human genes, and to store specimens
      for future genetic studies. Specimens collected may include blood, urine and airway samples
      (nasal, airway brushing, biopsy and/or washings) from consenting subjects. Subjects will
      include both individuals diagnosed with lung disease and healthy control subjects. The
      purpose of this study is to obtain biologic materials from the blood, airways and/or urine
      of normal individuals and individuals with lung disease. The normal are used to establish a
      set of normal ranges for various parameters. These provide control information when compared
      to individuals with various pulmonary diseases, and will help in understanding of the
      etiology and pathogenesis of various lung diseases. The investigators will use bronchoscopy
      (inserting a scope into the lungs) to obtain airway cells by brushing, biopsy and/or
      washings in individuals with lung disease and in healthy controls. By studying those cells,
      the investigators hope to learn more about the specific causes of lung disease, how lung
      disease manifests and progresses, and how lung disease can be treated.
