In obese patients we can observe higher values of lung and chest wall\n      elastance, with reduction in ventilation-perfusion ratio.\n\n      The partitioning between lung and chest wall elastance can improve ventilatory setting and\n      mechanics parameters of ventilation.\n\n      In every patient we will place, after anesthesia induction, a catheter to get esophageal and\n      gastric pressure that represent pleural and abdominal pressure.\n\n      Ventilation will be conducted with a tidal volume of 8-10 ml/kg (IBW) and a respiratory rate\n      adequate to maintain a physiological level of Pa CO2.\n\n      The preemptive strategy involves recruitment maneuver and setting of 10 cmH2O PEEP before\n      induction of pneumoperitoneum and trendelenburg position in the treatment group, while the\n      current procedure provides it afterwards (control group)."
