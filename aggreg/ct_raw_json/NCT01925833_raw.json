However, small polyps (e.g.\n      <1cm) seen during insertion phase are difficult to find during withdrawal phase. Also, colon\n      is in different conformation during insertion and withdrawal phases. We think careful\n      inspection and polypectomy during both insertion and withdrawal can improve adenoma\n      detection rate."
