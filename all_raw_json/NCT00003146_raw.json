Combining chemotherapy with bone marrow or peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by\n      bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients with multiple\n      myeloma."

Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are\n      collected and cryopreserved, or bone marrow is harvested and stored, until infusion on day\n      0. Patients receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -8, -7, and -6. Melphalan is\n      administered by continuous IV infusion over 30 minutes on days -5 and -4. Thiotepa is\n      administered by continuous IV infusion over 2 hours on days -3 and -2. Patients undergo PBSC\n      or bone marrow infusion 36-48 hours following the completion of chemotherapy (day 0).\n      Patients are followed for 100 days posttransplant and every 3 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 30 patients will be accrued."
