During each session, tridimensional kinematics of scapula and\n      humerus and electromyography of serratus anterior and trapezius (upper and lower portions)\n      muscles of dominant shoulder will be evaluated, during scaption and throwing movements,\n      immediately before and immediately after the fatigue protocol.The changes in scapular\n      movements (before versus after the fatigue protocol) will be compared among the sessions."
