      Background: Insufficient nutritional intake, with or without concomitant morbidity, leads to
      weight loss or insufficient weight gain, is related to an increase in morbidity and
      mortality and exposes the child to medical complications. In addition, obesity is also
      related to complications during hospitalization and complications in general, and therefore
      early identification of these children is extremely important. Studies show that
      malnutrition is frequent among children upon hospitalization, where the risk of pediatric
      nutritional deterioration increases, even in the presence of mild stress factors. This risk
      is frequent mainly among children that arrive at the hospital with an initial poor
      nutritional status. Improving the nutritional status as part of the standard of care already
      at the ambulatory setting might improve the prognosis of children when ill. In Israel,
      nutritional screening in not conducted among children since there is no proper validated
      screening tool. Study objectives: To test the accuracy of the STAMP Screening Tool for
      pediatric nutritional risk which is designed to be used by nurses, and to compare it to a
      complete nutritional assessment conducted by a dietician in Clalit Health Care Services
      clinics. In addition, the investigators wish to examine the effects of using a screening
      tool for nutritional risk on the medical staff's attention to the nutritional status; this
      is measured by the collection of nutritional status-related data and their recording in the
      patient file.

      Methods: 100 boys and girls aged 1 to 6, attending Clalit Health Care Services Pediatric
      Centers, will undergo an assessment using the STAMP Tool; a questionnaire including 3
      questions with a summary score, according to which the nutritional risk level shall be
      determined. These children shall also undergo a complete dietician assessment in order to
      examine the validity of the STAMP Tool. In addition, 150 files shall be reviewed in the
      beginning of the research and after 6 months in order to estimate the change in medical
      staff's attention to nutritional status, by way of noting relevant diagnoses, reference to
      nutritional status- related tests and recording of anthropometric measurements.

      A statistical analysis to examine the validity of the STAMP Tool shall be carried out using
      the kappa test (K) (30). The effect of the STAMP Tool use shall be calculated using the chi
      square test.
