Many older adults have heart disease and\n      diabetes, which lead to frequent emergency calls and hospital admissions. To decrease the\n      costs of treating heart disease and diabetes through emergency and hospitalization, improved\n      screening and health education is needed.  Our program will take place in communal areas\n      within housing buildings of older adults and deliver a heart disease, diabetes, and falls\n      risk check-up with health education. This is expected to improve the health of older adults\n      leading to fewer emergency calls and hospital visits."
