            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the safety of recombinant prostate-specific membrane antigen\n      (rPSMA)-pulsed autologous dendritic cells (CaPVax) in patients with metastatic\n      hormone-refractory prostate cancer. II. Determine the potential clinical response in\n      patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine the effect of this treatment regimen on\n      pain, physical function, and quality of life of these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients undergo a delayed\n      hypersensitivity skin test with 3 common recall antigens. Autologous dendritic cells (DC)\n      are pulsed with recombinant prostate-specific membrane antigen (rPSMA). Patients receive\n      rPSMA-pulsed autologous DC (CaPVax) intradermally. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a\n      total of 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts\n      of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CaPVax until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is\n      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients\n      experience dose-limiting toxicity. Quality of life questionnaires are completed five times\n      over the course of the study. Patients are followed at 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study."
