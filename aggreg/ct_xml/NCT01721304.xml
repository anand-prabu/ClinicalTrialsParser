  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if using a computer survey about preferences for
      treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is useful and if it will improve patient
      satisfaction with clinical care and decision making. This study is a two-part study. The
      first pilot tests the computerized tool to ensure it is understood by patients, then the
      second part is a randomized study (computerized tool versus usual care) to see if
      improvements are made in satisfaction and if there are reductions in decision regret.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if using a computer survey about preferences for
      treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is useful and if it will improve patient
      satisfaction with clinical care and decision making. This study was designed to develop and
      test the use of ACA as part of routine clinical care for women diagnosed with AUB.  After
      pilot testing, the ACA survey is administered in this study where patients are assigned to
      receive the ACA or to usual care.
