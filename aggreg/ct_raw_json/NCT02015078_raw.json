This current protocol\n      lays out the specific qualitative activities planned for Phase 1 which include conducting\n      structured interviews with Black Family Reunion organizers (N=8) and a sample of reunion\n      participants (N=40). We describe in broad-brush the larger quantitative study proposed for\n      Phase 2. We will collect information on eating-related behaviors in African American\n      kindreds (N=300). We are also considering Phase 3 activities if we identify clusters of\n      eating-related phenotypes within families. Amended IRB applications will be submitted prior\n      to launching Phases 2 &  3."
