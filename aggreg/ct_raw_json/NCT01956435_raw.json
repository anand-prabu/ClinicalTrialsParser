            "textblock": "Methods: This pilot study will consist of 10 adult subjects with symmetric IGH on the lower\n      legs. After enrollment, 5 lesions of IGH on each leg will be selected by either JG or AA and\n      marked. Subjects will be randomized to which extremity (right or left) will be treated.\n      Treatments with the Xtrac Excimer laser (wavelength of 308nm) will be performed twice weekly\n      for 12 weeks using the typical vitiligo protocol (see Appendix C). Photographs of both\n      extremities will be taken prior to initial treatment and then every 4 weeks. The photographs\n      will be analyzed by two separate, blinded dermatologists and rated on improvement from\n      baseline using the following scale: 1= worsening of IGH; 2= no improvement (IGH remained\n      stable); 3= mild improvement of IGH (some repigmentation on <50% IGH); 4= moderate\n      improvement (some repigmentation on >50% or full repigmentation on <75% IGH); 5= full\n      repigmentation on >75% IGH (see Appendix A). Subjects will also be asked to complete this\n      survey subjectively every 4 weeks. Internal control will be represented by the marked\n      lesions on the non-treated extremity of each patient. Control versus treatment groups will\n      be statistically compared; however, due to the limited number of patient in this pilot\n      study, a descriptive trend analysis will likely be completed.  Subjects will be compensated\n      $10 per visit (totaling $250).  If a subject withdraws early from the study, they will be\n      compensated for every completed visit.  The 25th visit will consist of final photographs and\n      surveys, and will not include treatment.\n\n      Statistical Analysis: The main outcomes to be collected are the improvement of IGH from\n      baseline at weeks 4, 8 and 12 by the blinded dermatologists and by the subjects. Subjects\n      will be stratified by Fitzpatrick skin type for analysis as well."
