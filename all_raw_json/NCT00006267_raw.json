Treatment continues every 7\n      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 2 weeks, then every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months\n      for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 22\n      months."
