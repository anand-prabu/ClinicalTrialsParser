Starting on Day 1, all patients will ingest enzalutamide 160 mg/day at the same time each day without breaks (except as outlined for toxicity), with or without food, for 6 (28 day +/-3 days) cycles. Dose reduction of enzalutamide to 120 mg/day is allowed with the approval of the Medical Monitor. Patients will be instructed to return all unused capsules at each study visit to assess compliance and will receive study drug every 28 days (+/-3 days) for 6 cycles (24 weeks)."

Presently, when\n      participants receive hormonal therapy with radiation therapy for prostate cancer,\n      medications are given to reduce testosterone levels in the blood stream.  This leads to side\n      effects such as loss of sex drive, erectile dysfunction (ED) and decrease in muscle\n      strength.  The purpose of this study is test another form of hormonal therapy with radiation\n      therapy.  The medication called enzalutamide will be used with radiation therapy.  Instead\n      of lowering testosterone, enzalutamide blocks testosterone in cells.  This study will test\n      if enzalutamide when used with radiation will lower the PSA without causing the side effects\n      associated with medications that lower testosterone in the blood stream."

The diary will also\n           include special instructions for taking the enzalutamide.\n\n        -  The participant will also be undergoing external beam radiation therapy during the\n           study, for a duration of 8 \u00bd-10 weeks. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient\n           basis. This part of the study is considered standard of care.\n\n        -  The participant will be required to have fiducial markers placed within the prostate as\n           part of this study. These are very small gold markers that are placed in the prostate.\n           This procedure is similar to the biopsy that the participant had to diagnose their\n           cancer. This procedure is routinely performed to permit imaging and position\n           corrections to improve the precision of the external beam (radiation) delivery (Image\n           Guided Radiation Therapy).  The placement of the three gold markers is performed by an\n           Urologist.  The fiducials are placed under ultrasound guidance.  This is also\n           considered standard of care and is not experimental.\n\n        -  Planned Follow-up: Participants will be followed on study at a 3 month follow-up after\n           treatment (cessation of enzalutamide).  Additional follow-up to assess the status of\n           the participant's cancer will be conducted at the discretion of the treating physicians\n           as part of the participant's routine medical care."
