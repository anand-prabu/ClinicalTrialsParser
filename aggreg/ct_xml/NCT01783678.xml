             HIV-RNA for greater than 8 weeks prior to screening.

          -  Not currently receiving HIV ARVs

          -  Presence or absence of cirrhosis; a liver biopsy may be required.

          -  Healthy according to medical history and physical examination with the exception of
             HCV and HIV diagnosis.

          -  Agree to use two forms of highly effective contraception for the duration of the
             study and 6 months after the last dose of study medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  HCV genotype 1 or 4 with previous HCV treatment

          -  Poor control with HIV ARV regimen requiring a possible dose modification of therapy
             within 4 weeks of study medication dosing

          -  A new AIDS-defining condition diagnosed within 30 days prior to screening

          -  Prior use of any other inhibitor of the HCV NS5B Polymerase.

          -  History of any other clinically significant chronic liver disease.

          -  Evidence of or history of decompensated liver disease.

          -  Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

          -  Clinically-relevant drug or alcohol abuse within 12 months of screening.

          -  History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, laboratory abnormality or
             other circumstance that might confound the results of the study, or interfere with
             the subject's participation for the full duration of the study or not be in the best
             interest of the subject in the opinion of the investigator.
