  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;hardening of the arteries&quot; observed with aging raises blood pressure and contributes to
      poor brain blood flow and loss of cognitive function (i.e. attention, memory, solving
      problems, making decisions). Cognition is the most important determinant of overall health
      status, quality of life, functional ability and independence in older adulthood.
      Nutraceutical strategies have received considerable attention as they may improve
      cardiovascular health with far fewer side effects compared to drugs. In this regard, dairy
      products are particularly attractive. Higher dairy consumption is associated with lower
      blood pressure and improved memory in adults. Milk proteins have natural blood pressure
      lowering effects. Studies conducted in animals have demonstrated that whey protein (a
      component of milk protein) may also increase artery elasticity. This is important given the
      strong association between artery elasticity, brain blood flow, and risk for cognitive
      decline.

      The investigators propose to conduct a randomized double-blind placebo controlled study
      comparing the effects of whey protein supplementation or carbohydrate placebo on measures of
      artery elasticity, brain blood flow, and cognitive function in older adults.  Whey protein
      may be a novel dietary therapy to improve both artery health and brain health in older
      adults.
