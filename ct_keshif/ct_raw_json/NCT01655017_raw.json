            "textblock": "Adipose tissue (AT) has specific alterations in obesity that could link obesity to its\n      comorbidities. In particular increased fibrosis abundance in AT has been observed in obese\n      compared to lean subjects. The investigators  previously observed that the amount of\n      fibrosis in AT measured at baseline could predict surgery-induced weight loss.  Patient with\n      the higher amount of fibrosis at baseline were those who lost less fat mass one year after\n      surgery.\n\n      To date fibrosis can only be measured using by immunohistochemistry after surgical biopsy.\n      To that prospect, non invasive tools need to be validated, in particular device able to\n      measure adipose tissue stiffness. The investigators hypothesis is that this new device is as\n      powerful as IHC-quantified fibrosis to predict surgery induced weight loss.\n\n      To answer that question the investigators  will evaluate adipose tissue stiffness with the\n      device as well as quantify fibrosis using immuno-chemistry on AT biopsy in morbidly obese\n      patients before and during the first year after a bariatric surgery.\n\n      The first objective is to validate the investigators new device by comparing both invasive\n      fibrosis measurement on adipose tissue and non invasive stiffness measure The investigators\n      second objective is to assess whether the investigators device can predict weight loss\n      repose after bariatric surgery.\n\n      This project is based on a clinical protocol performed in massively obese subjects (BMI>40\n      kg/m\u00b2 or BMI>35kg/m\u00b2 with comorbidities). The investigators  will recruit 250 obese patients\n      addressed for bariatric surgery (bypass, sleeve or gastric banding). Clinical phenotype,\n      biochemical analysis, body composition, systemic inflammation, adipose tissue biopsy (to\n      evaluate inflammation and fibrosis) will be assessed at baseline and 3 and 12 months after\n      surgery.  Also at baseline surgical sub cutaneous and omental adipose tissue (to evaluate\n      inflammation and fibrosis) as well as liver biopsy (to score non alcoholic hepatitis) will\n      be analysed. 50 non obese patients will serve as controls. Adipose tissue stiffness measured\n      with the device as well as fibrosis quantification on subcutaneous and omental adipose\n      tissue will be assessed at baseline during programmed non inflammatory abdominal surgery\n      Associations between all clinical and biological parameters will be assessed at the\n      different point of the follow up.\n\n      More generally, this project might lead us to elucidate whether fibrosis in adipose tissue\n      can predict surgery outcome in terms of weight loss and obesity related complications\n      improvement. Also the investigators  want to validate a new non invasive tool to measure\n      adipose tissue fibrosis and check whether it can predict surgery outcomes."
