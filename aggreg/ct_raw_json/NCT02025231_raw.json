Positron emission tomography (PET) using an\n      amino acid tracer, 18-fluoro-ethyltyrosine (18F-FET), is used for target delineation.The\n      study examines, in four sequential treatment groups, the effect of dose, hypofractionation\n      and treatment volume on toxicity. Upon completion of the phase I part, the study progresses\n      to phase II where the best dose- and treatment regimen will be chosen for treatment."
