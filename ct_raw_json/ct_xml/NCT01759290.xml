    <textblock>
      ABSORB FIRST is a prospective, multi-center registry. The objectives of the study are to:

        -  Provide ongoing post-market surveillance for documentation of safety, performance and
           clinical outcomes of the Absorb BVS (Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold) System in daily
           PCI practice per Instructions for Use (IFU, on-label use).

        -  To evaluate the safety and performance of 12 mm or shorter Absorb BVS in single or
           overlapping use (bailout, optimization of long lesion treatment) for the treatment of
           patients with ischemic heart disease caused by de novo native coronary artery lesion(s)

        -  Collect additional information (e.g. acute success) to evaluate handling and
           implantation of Absorb BVS by physicians under a wide range of commercial use
           conditions and following routine clinical practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      the ABSORB FIRST Registry is intended to provide an assessment of the safety and performance
      of the Absorb BVS device in accordance to the IFU in real world use involving more complex
      patients, lesions and use (examples: longer lesions, overlapping use, bailout, patients at
      high risks for cardiac events, etc.).

      The ABSORB FIRST study will register a minimum of 1800 patients in approximately 90 sites
      throughout multiple countries worldwide where Absorb BVS has regulatory approval or is
      commercially available.

    <description>Cardiac Death/TV-MI/ID-TLR at 1 year for the 12 mm or shorter subgroup compared to the 18 mm subgroup.
The formal hypothesis is that the safety and performance of the 12 mm or shorter Absorb BVS is similar to the 18 mm Absorb BVS in single or overlapping use (bailout, optimization of long lesion treatment).
To evaluate this formal hypothesis, the observed Target Lesion Failure (TLF) rates at 1-year will be analyzed by a comparison between the 12 mm or shorter Absorb BVS and 18 mm Absorb BVS subgroups with confidence intervals. The analysis populations will have at least one corresponding size of Absorb BVS implanted but no more than two devices and up to two treated lesions.</description>
