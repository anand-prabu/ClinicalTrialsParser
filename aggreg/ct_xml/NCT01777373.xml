      The purpose of this study is to determine whether extension of the conducting airways into
      the distal lung, or bronchiolization, occurs early in the course of Idiopathic Pulmonary
      Fibrosis, a disease wherein normal lung structures are destroyed and replaced by
      non-functional scar tissue.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse Interstitial Pneumonias are a heterogeneous group of chronic respiratory diseases.
      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, one of such diseases, is characterized by lesions of the
      conducting airways including extension of bronchioles towards the distal lung, or
      bronchiolization of the distal lung. Such lesions are traditionally referred to as &quot;traction
      bronchiectasis&quot; although no evidence supports a cause-and-effect relationship between
      alveolar fibrosis and airway lesions. Another feature of IPF is chronic, invalidating dry
      cough. Our hypothesis is that IPF is characterized by early increases in the volume of
      conducting airways, that such changes correlate with cough, and that airway changes are in
      direct relation with airway fibrosis. The primary aim of this study is to demonstrate
      increased anatomical dead space (VD), a surrogate for conducting airway volume, in patients
      with moderate (or early) IPF, in comparison with subjects without any respiratory disease
      (&quot;non-DIP controls&quot;). The secondary aims are  : To show that VD is increased in patients
      with IPF in comparison with patients with other DIPs (&quot;DIP controls&quot;), to show that in
      patients with IPF increased VD does not correlate with indices of alveolar fibrosis, and to
      show associations between increased VD and cough and other respiratory symptoms in patients
      with IPF.

        IPF will be diagnosed according to ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT 2012 guidelines, either in the
        presence of a typical Usual Interstitial Pneumonia pattern on CT imaging of the lung or in
        the presence of a probable UIP pattern on a pathological lung specimen, and in the absence
        of any identified cause of secondary interstitial pneumonia.

        Patients with non-IPF interstitial pneumonias will be recruited. Due to the case mix at
        Bichat and Pompidou hospitals, patients with idiopathic Non Specific Interstitial
        Pneumonia and interstitial pneumonia associated with sarcoidosis and auto-immune disease
        will be recruited.

        In some patients, a definitive diagnosis of either IPF or non-IPF interstitial pneumonia
        will not be available at the time of inclusion.
