Measurements were taken horizontally at\n      three different levels: axillary, xiphoid and abdominal, taking as references the axillary\n      fold bottom edge of the xiphoid and umbilicus, respectively. Three measurements on each\n      level were performed.\n\n      The maximum values \u200b\u200bof inspiration and expiration were obtained, being considered for\n      analysis, the highest value of the three measurements and subsequently the Index of\n      Amplitude (IA) proposed by Jamami et al. was calculated  in order to mitigate the different\n      dimensions of the chest and abdomen.\n\n      Respiratory muscle strength : They were taken with the subject in a sitting position using a\n      digital manometer (MVD300 - Globalmed\u00ae) calibrated, nose clip, with the nozzle held firmly\n      between his lips.\n\n      The maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) was obtained by a maximal inspiration preceded by a\n      maximal expiration next to the residual volume (RV) , and to measure maximal expiratory\n      pressure (MEP) a maximal inspiration was next performed to capacity total lung (CPT)\n      followed by a maximal expiration.\n\n      The evaluation was considered complete when the individual performed three acceptable\n      measures and, among these, a minimum of two reproducible . The last value found could not be\n      superior to the others. Maneuvers with the support pressure by three seconds, and\n      reproducible measurements with a variation less than or equal to 10% of the highest value\n      were considered acceptable. For analysis was considered the greatest pressure value\n      achieved. MIP and MEP obtained the values \u200b\u200bpredicted by the equations of Neder et al. were\n      compared."
