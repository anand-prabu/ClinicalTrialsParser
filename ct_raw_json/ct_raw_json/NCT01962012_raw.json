Preliminary data\n      showed that the rate of tooth movement may be affected by variables such as age, sex, as\n      well as alveolar bone levels, tooth root length and alveolar bone quality. The purpose of\n      this study is to examine the amount of tooth movement achieved over time between subjects\n      undergoing aligner treatment using a pulsation device known as AcceleDent\u00ae Aura with those\n      not using the device.\n\n      A preliminary validation pilot study will be done to calibrate all staff on study\n      procedures.  The pilot will consist of 3 subjects using the active AcceleDent\u00ae Aura device\n      and 3 using the sham control AcceleDent\u00ae Aura device for 4 weeks. Study staff will be\n      calibrated for all study procedures.\n\n      The primary study will be a prospective, single-center, randomized crossover clinical trial\n      comparing two groups of subjects with 40 participants.  Subjects will be randomized to\n      groups that will receive aligner treatment while using either an active AcceleDent\u00ae Aura\n      device or a sham control AcceleDent\u00ae Aura device for the first 6 weeks of the study.  After\n      6 weeks, groups will cross-over and switch devices, and tooth movement will be followed for\n      another 6 weeks. Patients will be blinded as to which device they are using.  Amount of\n      tooth movement per week, pain perception, and change in gingival crevicular fluid biomarkers\n      will be outcomes assessed.   Device safety evaluation to be performed will include adverse\n      events and clinical examination findings including pulp vitality testing and periodontal\n      probe results."
