There was no\n      interference with respect to the type of assembly to be used in the initial care, leaving\n      the doctor on duty free to use the type of external fixators which he is most used to.\n\n      Patients remained hospitalized and received first-generation cephalosporin and dressing of\n      the wound daily. In the 4th to the 7th postoperative day after the initial procedure, the\n      patient underwent another surgery to reassemble the biplanar external fixation or to convert\n      to the locked intramedullary reamed nail.\n\n      External fixation consists of the biplanar assembly with six Schanz pins of six millimeters.\n      The placement of these follows the sequence: two proximal to the fracture in different\n      planes and two distal similar to the first. The investigators performed reduction and\n      placement of two bars, one medial and one lateral. Assessed by radiography, two more pins\n      were then introduced into the medial rod, ending with the fixation of a tube-to-tube rod at\n      the level of the fracture. For fixation by locked intramedullary reamed nail, the access\n      path of introduction used was through the patellar tendon, with the knee flexed at 100\n      degrees on a radiotransparent table."
