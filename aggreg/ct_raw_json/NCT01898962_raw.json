However, as more advanced systemic\n      therapy continue to improve control of micrometastatic disease, failures at the original\n      sites of disease remain common. Furthermore, some studies have shown locoregional treatment\n      of limited clinical metastases to actually improve survival. Therefore, the investigators\n      hypothesize that aggressive treatment to clinically active sites of disease (alone or in\n      addition to systemic therapy) may improve survival or alter the course of the disease in\n      some patients with limited metastatic disease."
