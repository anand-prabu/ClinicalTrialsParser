  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research study is designed to test how a medication called octreotide affects the
      motility (contraction or squeezing) of the colon (large intestine).  Investigators are
      investigating whether octreotide can increase contraction and movement in the colon.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female and undergoing colonic manometry for a routinely accepted indication

             (Should have had previous diagnostic work up), recurrent fecal impaction, post
             Hirschsprung's disease repair, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, or suspected
             colonic dysmotility of any other cause.

          -  Children aged 12 months or older who are undergoing colonic motility under the
             supervision of Dr. Joseph Croffie at Riley Hospital.
