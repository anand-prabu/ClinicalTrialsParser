(a marketed TIV) after single intramuscular administration in\n      Korean healthy adults.\n\n      The comparator, GC Flu pre-filled syringe inj. is a trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV)\n      including viruses representing 3 influenza strains (one A/HIN1, one A/H3N2, and one B).\n      However, two antigenically distinct lineages of influenza B (Victoria and Yamagata)\n      co-circulate annually in the United States. Predicting which lineage of influenza B will\n      predominate during a season is challenging, and cross-protection by immunization against the\n      other lineage is expected to be low. One proposed alternative is to produce a quadrivalent\n      influenza vaccine (QIV) including an influenza B virus from each of the two circulating\n      lineages. GC3110A is a new quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV), which contains all of 4\n      vaccine components WHO recommends for use in the 2013-14 influenza season (northern\n      hemisphere winter) and includes two influenza B viruses. GC3110A is expected to show the\n      additional public health benefit compared with traditional TIV."
