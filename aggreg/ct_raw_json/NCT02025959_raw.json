The major educational goals\n      of this proposal is to develop and pilot test an online educational program (SIESTA) which\n      aims to train and motivate medical professionals to provide better sleep for hospitalized\n      patients.\n\n      We will utilize data from an ongoing sleep study, performed by the research team at the\n      University of Chicago that looks at how adult patients are able to sleep while they are in\n      the hospital, as a means of education for the participating medical staff."
