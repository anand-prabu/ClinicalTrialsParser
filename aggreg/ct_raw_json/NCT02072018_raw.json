Voluntarily sign and date an informed consent agreement approved by the Institutional\n             Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC). The subject must also sign an\n             authorization form to allow disclosure of his protected health information (PHI). The\n             PHI authorization form and informed consent form may be an integrated form or may be\n             separate forms depending on the institution\n\n          4.

Has an isolated hourglass deformity of the penis (curvature caused by a plaque that\n             is noncontiguous with the hourglass deformity may be treated)\n\n          9.

Has had extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) for the correction of Peyronie's\n             disease within the 6- month period before screening or plans to have ESWT at any time\n             during the study\n\n         13. Has used any mechanical type device for correction of Peyronie's disease within the\n             2-week period before screening or plans to use any these devices at any time during\n             the study\n\n         14.
