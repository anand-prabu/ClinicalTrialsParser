  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to examine the effects of teaching parents to use language support
      strategies on language skills in toddlers with language delays. We hypothesize that children
      whose parents who learn to use language support strategies at home will have greater
      language skills than those children whose parents do not learn the strategies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed project is to conduct an efficacy trial to determine whether
      Enhanced Milieu Teaching (EMT) significantly improves language deficits in young children at
      high risk for persistent language delays. The target population is children ages 24 -36
      months who exhibit significant co-occurring delays in productive and receptive language
      skills, who have cognitive skills within the range of normal development, and who do not
      have other identified disabilities. An empirically based and manualized language
      intervention, Enhanced Milieu Teaching (EMT), implemented by therapists and parents will be
      compared to community based &quot;business as usual&quot; services in a randomized experiment
      enrolling 120 children and their parents. Children assigned to the EMT group will receive
      24, 1-hour sessions of direct intervention at home that will include teaching their parents
      to implement EMT procedures across activities. Children will be assessed at 4 time points
      (before and after intervention, at 6 months and 12 months post-intervention) allowing the
      description and comparison of individual language growth trajectories over a period of 18
      months. In addition, we will examine the relation between language growth and emergent
      problems in behavior and social skill development to determine whether early language
      intervention can prevent these difficulties frequently associated with early language
      delays. Results from this study will determine the efficacy of parent-plus-therapist
      implemented EMT with a new population of children, provide evidence about the potential for
      preventing persistent language delays and secondary social effects of early language delays,
      and expand developmental theory linking persistent language delays to specific risk factors
      and behavioral outcomes. The results of this study will have specific policy implications
      related to early identification and the inclusion of young children with language delays as
      a target population for early intervention.
