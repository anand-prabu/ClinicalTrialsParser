  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether NuCel is effective in promoting spinal
      fusion in degenerative disease of the lumbar spine.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, single center clinical trial to establish the efficacy of NuCel,
      a minimally manipulated allograft tissue, for use in lumbar interbody and intertransverse
      fusion procedures. Subjects will undergo standard interbody fusion surgery as per the signed
      informed consent with NuCel and autograft bone. Patients will be evaluated postoperatively
      at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years (if required).
