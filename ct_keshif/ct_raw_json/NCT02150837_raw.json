The study will describe demographics of this\n      population, along with weight loss, anthropometrics, body composition and effects on\n      available cardiovascular parameters.  Adherence to the plans will also be examined.\n\n      The study hypothesis is that the 5 & 2 & 2 Meal Replacement Plan and the 4 & 2 & 1 Meal\n      Replacement Plan are both effective programs for weight loss in overweight and obese adults."
