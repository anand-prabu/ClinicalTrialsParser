  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that Recorded Home Oximetry (RHO) utilization will not
      increase rates of respiratory-related re-hospitalizations and ED visits, and will not impair
      growth compared to standard oxygen management protocols.

      Evidence-based specific consensus guidelines for home regulated oxygen management do not
      currently exist. Current strategies for infants requiring outpatient supplemental home
      oxygen include brief checks of oxygen status during monthly clinic visits. Although the
      infants stay on monitors, no data in between visits is obtained to ensure that infants can
      maintain oxygen levels after weans are made. Before finally allowing oxygen to be removed,
      many centers also require an overnight sleep study in the hospital, to make sure that the
      infant's oxygen levels stay safe when the infant is in deep sleep.  Because these methods
      rely solely on assumptions rather than individually recorded data, an infant's time on
      supplemental oxygen may be prolonged or insufficient. This study will evaluate both the
      currently used accepted therapy and a method of weaning that involves recording and sending
      oxygen data for analysis in between clinic visits.

      Premature infants who require home oxygen therapy at time of discharge who meet eligibility
      criteria will be randomized into two arms:

      Arm A (&quot;Standard therapy&quot;):  Infants'  oxygen will be increased, decreased, or maintained
      based on brief structured assessments during monthly clinic visits.

      Arm B (Recorded Home Oximetry (RHO)):  Infants will have the same monthly clinic assessments
      as in Arm A, but also will utilize Recorded Home Oximetry (RHO) to potentially increase,
      decrease or maintain oxygen between monthly visits.

      Parents of all infants will be interviewed using structured quality-of-life questionnaires
      at the beginning and ending of the oxygen management process.  Health care utilization
      (emergency department visits and rehospitalizations) and growth will be assessed 6 months
      after discontinuation of oxygen.

      The investigators overall objective is to determine whether Recorded Home Oximetry (RHO) can
      improve caregiver quality of life, and can shorten Home Oxygen Therapy (HOT) duration and
      eliminate need for polysomnogram, without compromising safety. The investigators will
      determine respiratory-related re-hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits, and
      growth parameters to confirm safety of the proposed weaning strategies.

    <description>Infants'  oxygen will be increased, decreased, or maintained based on brief structured assessments during monthly clinic visits.  Polysomnograms will be utilized prior to final discontinuation of oxygen.  RHO will only be utilized on the night prior to and during the polysomnogram to compare these two modalities.</description>
