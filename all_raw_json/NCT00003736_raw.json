Patients\n      undergo a two view screening mammogram within 3 months prior to study entry. Patients\n      undergo an MRI with gadolinium contrast at entry. All lesions identified as suspicious on\n      physical examination, mammography, or MRI undergo a core needle or excisional biopsy.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
