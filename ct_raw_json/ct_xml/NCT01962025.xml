    <textblock>
      The purpose of the pilot study is to determine: 1) Will patients agree to be randomized to
      two different methods of putting needles in their arteriovenous fistula and, 2) if we can
      adequately coordinate all of the sites to get useful multicentre trial data

  <detailed_description>

      To determine the feasibility of 1) randomizing patients to step-ladder versus buttonhole
      cannulation techniques, and 2) coordinating the multiple Canadian sites that are required
      for the definitive study.

      Secondary Objectives: To determine 1) if buttonhole cannulation, compared to step-ladder
      cannulation is associated with reduced training time for high dose home hemodialysis
      patients, 2) if buttonhole cannulation, compared to step-ladder cannulation is associated
      with reduced overall cost, 3) if buttonhole cannulation, compared to step-ladder cannulation
      is associated with reduced complications (infection - local and systemic,
      radiologic/surgical interventions, re-trains for needle insertion difficulties, hematoma
      formation, aneurysm formation, missed insertions), and 4) if buttonhole cannulation,
      compared to step-ladder cannulation is associated with reduced patient discomfort with
      needling for intensive home hemodialysis patients

If we can not reach this target we will not move forward with the definitve study. The pilot study will also allow us to see if we can coordinate mutiple sites in needling techinques and determin if we can move forward with the definitive study.</description>
