Determine whether the change in percent of apoptotic cells on tumor biopsies before and\n      after treatment with BMS-275291 is a valid endpoint in patients with HIV-related Kaposi's\n      sarcoma.\n\n      II. Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the\n      antitumor effects of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the effect of this drug on\n      overall quality of life and tumor-specific symptoms in these patients.\n\n      V. Determine the effect of this drug on CD4 and CD8 cell counts and percentages and HIV\n      viral load in these patients.\n\n      VI.

Determine the peak plasma concentration of this drug in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.\n\n      Patients receive oral BMS-275291 1-2 times daily. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-275291 until the recommended phase II\n      dose (RPTD) is determined.
