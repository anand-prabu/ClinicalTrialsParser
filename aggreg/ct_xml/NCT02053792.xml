  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the long-term safety and efficacy of rIX-FP for the control and
      prevention of bleeding episodes in children and adults with severe hemophilia B.  The study
      will include subjects who previously completed a CSL-sponsored rIX-FP lead-in study and
      subjects requiring major non-emergency surgery who have not previously completed a
      CSL-sponsored rIX-FP lead-in study.

      A surgical prophylaxis substudy will examine the efficacy of rIX-FP in subjects with
      hemophilia B who are undergoing non-emergency major or minor surgery.

    <description>Subjects will administer rIX-FP by intravenous infusion as routine prophylaxis, prevention, and on-demand treatment during a treatment period of approximately 3 years.
During the initial 6 months of the treatment period, subjects will administer rIX-FP as prophylaxis treatment using a treatment interval based on their experience during a previous CSL-sponsored rIX-FP study.  After this initial 6 months, subjects will continue to administer rIX-FP as prophylaxis treatment using either the same treatment interval or a different treatment interval, as determined by the investigator. The treatment interval may be changed at each 6-month follow-up assessment.
On-demand treatment with rIX-FP will be used for all bleeding episodes requiring treatment.
Subjects may participate in a surgical 'substudy' in which rIX-FP may be administered before, during and after surgery.
The dose of rIX-FP administered will be based on the subject's previous rIX-FP use and pharmacokinetic data.</description>

          -  Unwilling to participate in the study for a total of 100 exposure days.

        For subjects requiring major non-emergency surgery who have not previously completed a
        CSL-sponsored rIX-FP lead-in study:

             hamster protein.

          -  Known congenital or acquired coagulation disorder other than congenital FIX
             deficiency.

          -  Currently receiving IV immunomodulating agents such as immunoglobulin or chronic
             systemic corticosteroid treatment.

          -  Low platelet count, kidney or liver disease.
