The first aiming to determine the safety\n      of Topical 3% Amphotericin B Cream when applied three or two times per day for 4 weeks in\n      subjects with un-complicated Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) whilst the second focusing in\n      having and indication of the efficacy of the two above mentioned regimens of Topical 3%\n      Amphotericin B Cream\n\n      For the first step, 30 subjects will be randomly assigned to receive direct observed\n      treatment (DOT) with Topical 3% Amphotericin B Cream applied either three or two times per\n      day for 4 weeks.  Enrolment will be temporarily halted until all 30 subjects (15 in each\n      group) have been enrolled and completed the 28 day treatment course.  An interim analysis of\n      all safety (Adverse Events, including local reactions and lab parameters) and\n      pharmacokinetics collected on subjects who were randomized will be performed by data safety\n      monitoring board.  If no serious adverse events (SAEs) related to the study drug are\n      identified on the first 30 subjects by the end of the treatment course, 50 additional\n      subjects will be randomly allocated to receive Topical 3% Amphotericin B Cream either three\n      or two times per day for 28 days\n\n      Subjects will have a follow-up visit at the end of therapy, on Day 45\u00b1 5 days and on Days\n      90\u00b1 14 days and on Day 180, minus 14d, plus 4 weeks to assess efficacy, as measured by the\n      number of subjects who fulfil the cure criteria: 100% re-epithelialization of the lesion(s)\n      by Day 90 and no relapse by Day 180.  All subjects will be followed up to Day 180 for final\n      analysis of efficacy."
