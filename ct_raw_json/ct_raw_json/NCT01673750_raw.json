As a result of more successful treatment options, HIV/AIDS\n      has transitioned from a terminal illness to one which is treated as a chronic condition. One\n      particular group that has been impacted tremendously by HIV in the United States is the\n      adolescent population. As youth are living longer with HIV/AIDS, clinicians and researchers\n      are beginning to examine ways in which the disease can affect one's physical health, mental\n      health, and other psychosocial factors. Research emerging involving adults with HIV/AIDS has\n      suggested that increased attention to and negative views of one's body image may be found at\n      a higher rate in this group. To our knowledge, very few studies have examined this\n      relationship in adolescents with HIV."

Information regarding the adolescents' medical history,\n      medications, and physical functioning also will be abstracted from his or her medical\n      record.

Descriptive analyses (means and standard deviations of overall scores and means for each subscale) will be reported.\nThe Figure Rating Scale is a culturally relevant measure modeled after Stunkard's widely used nine-figure scale of schematic figures of varying size. Participants will be asked to identify which BI they find most similar to their current body type and which BI would be ideal or preferred. A BI discrepancy (BID) score will be calculated for each subject based on their responses on the Figure Rating Scale: negative BID score indicates the subject's ideal BI is larger than perceived; positive BID score indicates the subject wants to be smaller/thinner than perceived; score of zero indicates the subject prefers his/her perceived BI.",
