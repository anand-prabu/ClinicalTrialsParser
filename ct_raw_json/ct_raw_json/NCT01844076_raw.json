The investigators hypothesize that there will be no toxic interactions at the\n      pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic level, and want to know the feasibility of using\n      quinacrine and capecitabine at their respective recommended single agent doses. Because\n      capecitabine is already regarded as standard treatment for colorectal cancer, the\n      investigators will begin the study with a full dose of capecitabine combined with a slightly\n      lower dose of quinacrine. If the safety-interim analysis does not detect an excess of\n      toxicity, then subsequent patients will be enrolled using the full dose of both drugs."
