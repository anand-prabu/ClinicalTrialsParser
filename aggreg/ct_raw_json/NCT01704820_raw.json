            "textblock": "Colonoscopy is the gold standard screening test for colorectal cancer. Removal of\n      pre-malignant colon polyps during colonoscopy reduces colorectal cancer mortality by over\n      50%. However, while colonoscopy is highly effective at preventing distal (left sided) colon\n      cancers, it provides only limited protection from cancer in the proximal (right side) colon.\n      Our goal is to determine if additional pre-cancerous colon polyps can be identified by\n      looking at the right side of the colon in retroflexion. During retroflexion the tip of the\n      colonoscope is turned 180 degrees; allowing the doctor to view the backs of colonic folds.\n      If additional polyps can be identified in this manner colonoscopy will become a more\n      efficient method of screening for colon cancer.\n\n      In order to evaluate how effective right colon retroflexion is at detecting polyps in the\n      proximal colon we plan on performing a randomized, controlled trial. Patients undergoing\n      screening or follow up colonoscopy will be invited to participate in the study. Those\n      patients who agree to participate will be randomized into one of two groups once the\n      colonoscope is fully inserted. Group one will have the right side of their colon examined\n      for polyps with the endoscope looking forward (traditional form of examination) followed by\n      repeat examination of the right side of the colon with the colonosocpe in retroflexion\n      (looking backwards). Polyps seen during each section of the exam will be removed and manner\n      in which the polyps were found/ removed will be recorded. Following the two exams of the\n      right side of the colon the colonoscopy will be completed in the usual manner. The duration\n      of each portion of colonoscopy will be recorded. After the procedure is completed the\n      physician performing the colonoscopy will rate difficulty of the procedure and confidence\n      with quality of the examination. Pathology results for each polyp will be recorded once\n      available. There will be no study related follow up after the pathology results are\n      recorded."
