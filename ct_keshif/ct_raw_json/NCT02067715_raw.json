For sample size calculation was considered\n      80% of test power, significance level of 5%, the presence of tooth sensitivity of 90% at\n      control intervention and 40% at experimental intervention. These levels of sensitivity were\n      based in pilot study. Thus the sample size for a proportions test (SigmaStat 3.5 (Systat\n      Software, Point Richmond, USA) was 17 participants for each intervention.\n\n      Randomization Previously to beginning of study, a blocked randomisation list will be created\n      using the website www.sealedenvelope.com, using block size of 4, by an operator different\n      from those who will be perform the bleaching procedures. The bleaching protocol for each\n      participant will be placed into a sealed envelope, while this only will be opened in the\n      moment of bleaching procedure.\n\n      Evaluations During the permanence of bleaching agent, the tooth sensitivity will be\n      monitored and the scores (VAS and verbal scale) will be recorded at 20th and 40th minute.\n      The score also will be recorded immediately after the bleaching agent removal. In the after\n      day, the participants will be argued (only verbal scale) about the maximum level of\n      sensitivity during the first 24 hours after bleaching procedure and in 24th hour after this.\n      A week after the bleaching procedure, the scores based on shade guides will be recorded\n      again. For CIE L*a*b* measurement, \u0394E will be calculated by the following equation: \u2206E=\n      [(\u2206L)2 + (\u2206a)2 + (\u2206b)2]1/2, while \u2206L = L1 - L0; \u2206a = a1 - a0; e \u2206b = b1 - b0. After the\n      shade evaluation, a new bleaching procedure, using the same protocol, will be performed in\n      this second appointment and the same measurements of tooth sensitivity will be performed\n      similarly to first one. After a week of second session, only the shade will be evaluated.\n\n      Blinding Once that it is not possible to blind the operators responsible by bleaching\n      procedures and the participants, only the operators responsible by evaluations and by\n      statistical analysis will be blinded.\n\n      Analysis of data The average of scores corresponding to shade guides will be calculated for\n      each participant in the three moments of evaluation. Data will be submitted to Friedman and\n      Man-Whitney tests. The average of \u2206E will be calculated for each participant in the two\n      moments of re-evaluation, while the data will be submitted to two-way ANOVA (protocol x\n      moment of evaluation). Data for tooth sensitivity scores will be submitted to Friedman and\n      Man-Whitney tests. The multiple-comparison test of Tukey will be used when necessary. The\n      number of participants presenting any sensitivity during each session of bleaching will be\n      calculated, while the percentage of these participants for each protocol will be calculated\n      using Chi-square test. All statistical analysis will be performed with significant level of\n      5%."
