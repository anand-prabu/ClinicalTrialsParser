Patients will be randomized into one of two trial arms: mirabegron 25mg for two\n      weeks, with escalation to 50mg for the remaining 8 weeks, or matched placebo capsule for two\n      weeks, with placebo escalation for the remaining 8 weeks. The study will treat a total of 72\n      patients (36 with placebo, 36 with mirabegron).  The study hypothesis is that mirabegron\n      will result in a statistically superior (increased) urodynamic bladder capacity.\n\n      The study duration is 12 weeks, with a 1-4 week run in period where no active or placebo\n      treatment will be administered. The primary outcome is urodynamic bladder capacity. The\n      study hypothesis is that treatment with mirabegron will increase urodynamic bladder\n      capacity. Secondary outcome measures will be additional urodynamic parameters, urinary\n      symptom scales, urinary quality of life indices, and voiding diary results.\n\n      Patients who are over 18 years of age with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis or spinal cord\n      injury will be eligible to participate. All eligible patients will have urodynamic studies\n      performed within 4 weeks of trial enrollment, and at the end of study (week 9-10). Adverse\n      events and study outcomes will be assessed at predefined study time points."
