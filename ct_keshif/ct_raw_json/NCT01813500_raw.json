            "textblock": "The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are\n      chronic conditions affecting approximately 1.4 million Americans.  The burden of Clostridium\n      difficile infection (CDI),  a frequent cause of infectious diarrhea is mediated by toxins A\n      and B and is increasing faster in IBD patients, than the general population.  Clinically,\n      CDI in patients with IBD leads to a range of clinical syndromes from symptomless carriage,\n      to severe life threatening colitis, colectomy and death.\n\n      This pilot study will look at the relationship between IBD and this variable host immune\n      response.  Clostridium difficile colonization (asymptomatic carrier state) is lower in the\n      IBD population than in the general population.  In the general population, high antitoxin\n      titers have been linked with colonization and low antitoxin titers with recurrent disease.\n      The investigators hypothesize that patients with IBD will have a lower Clostridium difficile\n      colonization and will have lower antibody titers than the control group.  Additionally those\n      with lower titers will have an increased risk of developing CDI.\n\n      In Aim 1 the investigators will determine Clostridium colonization in IBD subjects by stool\n      study (including CD, UC and UC patients after IPAA) compared to non-IBD subjects (controls).\n       In Aim 2 the investigators will compare antitoxin titers in these IBD subjects compared to\n      controls.  In Aim 3 the investigators will follow these subjects for 12 months and calculate\n      the incidence of CDI in patients with IBD compared to controls and associations with\n      anti-toxin titers."
