      Background The purpose of the present controlled clinical trial was to assess the effect of
      a single 60 min application of transcutaneous electrical nervous stimulation (TENS) at
      sensory stimulation threshold (STS), compared to the application of motor stimulation
      threshold (MTS) as well as to untreatment, on the surface electromyographic (sEMG) and
      kinesiographic activity of patients with temporomandibular disorder (TMD). Methods Sixty
      female subjects, selected according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, suffering from
      unilateral TMD in remission were assigned to MTS, STS or untreatment. Pre- and
      post-treatment differences in the sEMG activity of temporalis anterior (TA), masseter (MM),
      digastric (DA) and sternocleidomastoid muscles (SCM), as well in the interocclusal distance
      (ID), within group were tested using the Wilcoxon test, while differences among groups were
      assessed by Kruskal-Wallis test; the level of significance was set at p â‰¤ 0.01.
