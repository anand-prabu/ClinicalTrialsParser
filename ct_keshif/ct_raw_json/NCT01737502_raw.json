To assess the overall survival in this population in comparison to recent historical\n      controls (exemplified by survival of the squamous histology cohort of the Scagliotti et al\n      trial of cisplatin with pemetrexed or gemcitabine for advanced NSCLC).\n\n      II. To determine the adverse events (AE) profile and safety of the regimen. III. To\n      determine the overall response rate, per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors\n      (RECIST) criteria, and duration of tumor response in this population in patients with\n      measurable disease.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To assess the relationship between molecular correlates and progression free survival\n      (PFS), overall survival (OS), response and toxicity.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive auranofin and sirolimus orally (PO) on days 1-28 of each cycle. Courses\n      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months for up to 2\n      years."
