Patients are stratified by disease (low\n      risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) vs. high risk MDS vs. chronic myelomonocytic leukemia).\n      Patients receive decitabine as a 4 hour infusion every 8 hours on days 1-3. Treatment\n      continues every 6-8 weeks for 4-6 courses. Patients are followed at 6 and 12 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 75 patients will be accrued for this study over 1 year."
