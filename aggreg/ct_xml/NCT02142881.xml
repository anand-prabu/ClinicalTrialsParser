  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, most observational and all intervention studies have defined hypertension on the
      basis of clinic blood pressure (BP). Measurement of BP outside the clinic with home or
      ambulatory BP provides a better estimate of the risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause
      mortality. Using clinic and ambulatory BPs, patients can be categorized as normotensive
      (normal clinic and ambulatory BPs), white-coat hypertension (elevated clinic BP with normal
      ambulatory BP), masked hypertension (normal clinic BP with elevated ambulatory BP), and
      sustained hypertension (elevated clinic and ambulatory BP). Approximately one third of
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with normal clinic BP have elevated ambulatory BP
      (masked hypertension). We demonstrated that, among participants from the Chronic Renal
      Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study, low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and
      elevated proteinuria are associated with increased odds of masked hypertension.
      Additionally, participants with masked hypertension had increased risk for target organ
      damage as assessed by left ventricular mass and pulse wave velocity. These results in
      participants with CKD are consistent with prior studies in patients with normal renal
      function that demonstrated a two-fold increased risk for cardiovascular events in patients
      with masked hypertension compared to patients with normal clinic and ambulatory BP. Despite
      this elevated risk for adverse outcomes, patients with masked hypertension have been
      excluded from hypertension trials because of their normal clinic BP. Therefore, it is
      unknown whether the reduction in target organ damage and adverse cardiovascular outcomes
      associated with treatment of hypertension extends to patients with masked hypertension. To
      address this important gap in knowledge, we are planning a randomized, controlled trial to
      evaluate whether antihypertensive treatment can modify BP patterns in patients with masked
      hypertension, that is, convert them to controlled clinic and ambulatory BP. We will also
      evaluate the effect antihypertensive treatment on target organ damage in patients with
      masked hypertension. The current study is a pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate
      the feasibility of the planned trial and the effect of antihypertensive therapy on clinic
      and ambulatory BP, proteinuria, and target organ damage in patients with masked
      hypertension.
