            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      The HBsAg clearance rate in interferon-treated responders is significantly higher than that\n      in lamivudine-treated responders, implying immune control is the key to HBsAg clearance.\n      There is a good chance to further increase the cure rate if the investigators can enhance\n      the HBV-specific immune response when the HBsAg level already comes to a low level.\n\n      Hypothesis: HBsAg-based vaccine can enhance HBsAg clearance in chronic hepatitis B patients\n      whose HBsAg already <=2000 IU/ml.\n\n      Patients and methods:\n\n      This pilot study will enroll 20 chronic hepatitis B patients with HBsAg \u22662000 IU/ml, no\n      hepatic decompensation, no HIV coinfection, nor clinical immunodeficiency. Engerix-B vaccine\n      (20\u03bcg for <20 years old and 40 \u03bcg for \u2265 20 years old) will be given every 2 months for one\n      year. HBsAg quantification, anti-HBs, and HBV DNA will be surveyed regularly before each\n      dose during the treatment period and every 3 months for another year following the last\n      dose. Viral and cellular factors will be studied to discover determinants affecting HBsAg\n      clearance.\n\n      Aims\n\n        1. To elucidate whether HBsAg-based vaccine can reactivate host immunity to eliminate\n           chronic HBV infection in patients with low titer HBsAg.\n\n        2. To delineate the doses to response (HBsAg clearance or decline rate) correlation so as\n           to design a feasible schedule for future clinical trials in a larger group of patients.\n\n        3. To discover viral and host factors which can be used as biomarkers for personalized\n           vaccine therapy."
