To determine the degree to\n      which antiretroviral therapy alters HIV replication in LT.\n\n      Clinical objectives: To gain insight into the degree of correlation between immunologic\n      surrogate markers for HIV disease (e.g., CD4, beta-2 microglobulin) as compared to measures\n      of HIV replication in PB and LT. To assess changes in PB and LT viral burden after\n      antiretroviral therapy and to determine its ability to predict an antiviral response.\n\n      One of the major problems in defining the immunopathogenic changes in HIV infections has\n      been the inability to correlate the extent of loss of immunologic function with the number\n      of HIV-infected CD4+ cells in the peripheral blood. Few studies exist that measure viral\n      burden in lymph nodes of HIV-infected individuals. Researchers hope to find out whether the\n      amount of HIV virus or markers for the virus in the body's lymph tissue is a better measure\n      of disease progression than the amount of virus or markers for the virus in the blood."
