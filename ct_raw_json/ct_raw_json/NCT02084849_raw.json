PKD patients at risk for\n      progression to renal failure (dialysis or transplantation) have been identified and include\n      those who have been diagnosed with high blood pressure early, the presence of the PKD1 gene\n      (the inherited abnormality responsible for the majority of PKD), men as opposed to women,\n      those with episodes of visible blood or increased protein in their urine, and women who have\n      experience more than three pregnancies. Individuals who are diagnosed with PKD in the first\n      year of life or in utero (before birth) are also at high risk for progression to renal\n      failure.\n\n      This study will also facilitate understanding of human diseases at the cellular and\n      molecular level. We will be identifying genetic factors that may influence the severity of\n      polycystic kidney disease (PKD). You are being asked to provide a sample of blood for the\n      purpose of DNA or other biochemical analyses."
