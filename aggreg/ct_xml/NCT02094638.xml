    <textblock>
      Tanreqing Injection is widely used in respiratory disease with Chinese medicine syndrome of
      retention of phlegm and heat in Fei. This study record clinical use of Tanreqing Injection
      in the real world, observe the adverse drug reactions/ adverse drug events during treatment,
      and figure out why Tanreqing induced severe allergic reaction happens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a compound traditional Chinese medicine, Tanreqing Injection was approved by China Food
      and Drug Administration(CFDA) in 2003, and widely used respiratory disease, such as biofilm
      related upper respiratory infections, pneumonia and bronchitis. During its 11 years
      marketing in China, there was hardly any serious adverse drug reactions except for a few
      cases reported as severe allergic reaction. In this study, clinical pharmacists in selected
      hospitals will not only record the clinical use and the adverse drug reactions/ adverse drug
      events of this injection, but also try to figure out why drug-induced severe allergic
      reaction happens through a nested case-control study. This real world study for Tanreqing
      Injection with 30400 patients will be conducted from January.2014 to June.2016.
