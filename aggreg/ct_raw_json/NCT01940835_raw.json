However, to the best of our knowledge there is no definitive evidence to date\n      conclusively demonstrating a link. The only way to test this hypothesis is to have access to\n      the intestinal tissue of T1D patients at very early stages when beta-islet cell destruction\n      is still ongoing. Furthermore, to prepare for large prospective studies it is critical to\n      determine whether there is a peripheral blood signature for intestinal inflammation.\n      Finally, because enteroviral infections have been implicated in T1D pathogenesis, this study\n      provides a unique opportunity to determine whether there is a dysregulated response to\n      innate stimuli associated with viral infections and whether evidence of transcriptional\n      signatures indicative of viral infections in the gut is correlated with disease. Finally, we\n      will take advantage of this pilot study to collect samples that can be used for microbiome,\n      virome and metabolic studies."
