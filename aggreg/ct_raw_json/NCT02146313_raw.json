Once a q3w recommended phase\n      II dose (RP2D) is identified, two expan sion cohorts (one in platinum-resistant ovarian\n      cancer and another in unresectab le pancreatic cancer) may be evaluated to further\n      characterize the safety and ac tivity in these patient populations. Time on treatment is\n      expected to last appro ximately 1 year."
