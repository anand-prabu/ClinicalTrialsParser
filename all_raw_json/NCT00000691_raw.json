Because of the seriousness of\n      sight-threatening CMV retinitis in AIDS patients and a lack of other available treatments\n      for those patients who cannot be treated with ganciclovir (DHPG) (because of its toxic\n      effect on the body's blood-forming cells, because it did not control the disease, or because\n      patient's blood cell or platelet counts are too low to begin with), it is worthwhile to try\n      an immediate trial with foscarnet. AMENDED: ACTG 093 was originally designed as a randomized\n      dose-ranging study of foscarnet maintenance therapy. Patients enrolled between March 17,\n      1989, and January 1, 1990, received either 60 mg/kg/day or 90/mg/kg day as maintenance\n      therapy following the 2 week induction period. Based on the preliminary results of ACTG\n      015/915, which studied maintenance doses of foscarnet of 60 mg/kg/day, 90 mg/kg/day and 120\n      mg/kg/day, the 60-mg/kg/day and 90/mg/kg/day arms of this study have been closed. All\n      patients entering the study beginning January 2, 1990 will receive foscarnet maintenance\n      therapy on a 120/mg/kg/day algorithm following induction."

All patients who wish to\n      continue foscarnet therapy should be referred to Astra Protocol 90-FOS-14 at telephone\n      number 800-292-5775. Original design: Patients are placed into two groups: (1) patients who\n      have a sight-threatening lesion in the retina of an eye with vision that can be saved\n      (corrected vision of 20/100 or better) and who cannot be treated with DHPG, and (2) patients\n      whose retinitis has quickly gotten worse and/or has shown resistance to DHPG treatment. Both\n      groups will receive a beginning (induction) dose of foscarnet by vein (IV) for 2 weeks,\n      followed by a maintenance dose for 8 weeks with an option to continue up to 24 weeks.\n      AMENDED: Patients entering the study on or after 01/02/90 receive the standard two week\n      course of foscarnet induction therapy and receive maintenance therapy. Treatment is given\n      for a ten week study period or until progression occurs or toxicity endpoints are reached.\n      If retinitis is stable and foscarnet well-tolerated, maintenance therapy may be extended for\n      a period not to exceed 1 year."
