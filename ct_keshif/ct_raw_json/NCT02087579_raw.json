The total number of enrolled participants\n      in this study will be at least 265. Seventy-five participants will be enrolled for the\n      aripiprazole, olanzapine and quetiapine cohorts (groups) each, and 20 participants will be\n      enrolled for the paliperidone and risperidone cohorts each. In aripiprazole, olanzapine and\n      quetiapine cohorts there will be two subgroups. Subgroup one, 20 participants for\n      fingerstick capillary + venous blood sampling and subgroup two, 55 participants for only\n      venous sampling. Paliperidone and risperidone cohorts will be subjected only to capillary +\n      venous blood sampling.\n\n      The study will consist of a screening phase (within 21 days before Day 1) followed by a\n      3-day observation phase (Day 1 to Day 3). Participants will be admitted to the study center\n      in the evening of Day -1 and will remain in the study center until discharged on Day 3 after\n      completion of the last study-related procedure. During the observation phase, the\n      administration of the prior antipsychotic medication will continue at a participant's usual\n      dose and dosing schedule, under direct observation of the study staff. There will be no\n      modification of the participant's medication during the study. Safety will be evaluated\n      throughout the study and a mandatory pharmacogenomic blood sample will be collected for\n      analysis of genes that may influence exposure of the APS studied."
