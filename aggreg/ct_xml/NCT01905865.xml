      Background:

      - Parents of a child with an undiagnosed medical condition face a lot of uncertainty. They
      may not know how to take care of their child or how the illness will affect their family
      life. Researchers want to study how these parents cope with and adapt to their child   s
      condition in light of this uncertainty. Being uncertain can make it hard for parents to
      adapt. But it also might give them hope. Researchers want to study how uncertain the parents
      think their situation is and how that affects the way they think they can cope. Personality
      traits, like being able to handle uncertainty and being resilient, might also affect coping.

      Objectives:

      - To understand how having a child with an undiagnosed illness affects the way their parents
      think they can cope.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults with a child who has a medical condition that has not been diagnosed for at least 2
      years and involves at least 2 parts of the body.

      Design:

        -  Participants will answer survey questions for about 30 minutes. The questions are about
           their thoughts and feelings about having a child with an undisclosed illness.

        -  Participants can take the survey on paper or online.

    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to test the effect of the degree of perceived uncertainty on coping
      efficacy among parents of children with undiagnosed medical conditions. There are many
      dimensions to uncertainty when there is no identified cause for a condition that affects one
        s child. They include illness identity, management, longevity and life planning, the
      meaning of the child   s condition for the family and both the child   s and the family   s
      social connections. How parents of children with undiagnosed medical conditions appraise,
      cope and ultimately adapt to their child   s condition in light of this uncertainty is
      largely unexplored. While high levels of perceived uncertainty may be seen as a threat to
      adaptation, there is evidence that parents find hope and opportunity in the uncertainty. The
      literature suggests that many factors affect how uncertainty is appraised, and higher levels
      of coping self-efficacy are associated with more effective coping and ultimately better
      adaptation. There is no research that systematically assesses the dimensions of uncertainty
      perceived by parents and whether overall perceptions of uncertainty or particular subsets
      are associated with coping efficacy. Further, personality traits, such as tolerance of
      uncertainty and resilience, may moderate these unexplored relationships. This study   s
      conceptual framework is based on Lazarus and Folkman   s Transactional Model of Stress and
      Coping and Mishel   s Perceived Uncertainty in Illness Theory. A cross-sectional survey
      design will be used to quantitatively assess the relationships between dimensions of
      uncertainty and coping efficacy. Participants will be recruited through online support
      groups, website postings, and listservs. They will have the option of completing either a
      paper or online version of the survey.

        -  Participants for this study will be English speaking men and women ages 18 years or
             older who have a child with an undiagnosed medical condition that affects at least
             two different parts of their body and has remained undiagnosed for at least two
             years.

        The participant may be the adoptive or biological parent.

        Parents may decide between themselves who will complete the survey as only one survey per
        household will be allowed.

        Participants must speak English because the scales and surveys used in this study have not
        been validated in other languages.

        Participants will be asked to self-report their child   s anomalies and health problems
        but no clinical evaluation will be required.
