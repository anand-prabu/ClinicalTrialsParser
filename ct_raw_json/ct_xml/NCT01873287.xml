  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Concussion, a mild traumatic injury common in children and adolescents, is a complex
      pathophysiological process affecting the brain. The lay press is inundated with reports of
      tragic consequences of concussion, and children are not immune.

      Persistent postconcussive symptoms (PCS) is defined as the persistence of somatic,
      cognitive, physical, psychological or behavioural changes lasting more than one month
      following injury. PCS significantly impacts children and their family's quality of life
      through school absenteeism, depressed mood and loss of activities.

      Validated, easy-to-use prognosticators do not exist for clinicians to identify children at
      highest risk for PCS. As a result,physicians cannot accurately inform children and parents
      whether they should expect longer symptoms, nor initiate pharmacotherapy or other management
      to reduce the occurrence or severity of PCS.

      The investigators objective is to derive and validate a clinical prediction rule for the
      development of PCS in children and adolescents presenting to the emergency department (ED)
      following acute head injury. The investigators have three aims: (1) determine PCS incidence
      at one-month follow-up in children aged 5-17 who sustain a concussion; (2) derive a rule to
      predict PCS from variables present in the history and physical examination; and, (3) assess
      the accuracy, reliability and acceptability of the prediction rule in a subsequent cohort.
      Using a prospective, multicentre study at nine large Canadian pediatric EDs, the
      investigators will recruit the largest prospective epidemiological cohort of children with
      concussions in the literature.

      This work will provide rigorous evidence to determine PCS incidence in children and its
      impact on quality of life. The results will enable clinicians to identify children at
      highest risk for PCS, optimize treatment and provide families with realistic anticipatory
      guidance. This study will also establish a strong and vital evidence base to advance
      concussion research.

    <description>The primary outcome is the proportion of children aged 5 - 17 years who have PCS at one-month follow-up.  A PCS case is defined as an increase from pre-concussion baseline of three or more symptoms on the validated PCSI at one-month (consistent with the ICD-10 definition of PCS).</description>

    <description>The PedsQL™ is a reliable and valid measure of health-related quality of life in healthy children and adolescents and those with acute and/or chronic health conditions.  Parent versions exist for children aged 2 to 18 years (in 4 age groups) and child versions for those aged 5 and over.  The inventory covers four domains: physical, emotional, social and school.  This secondary outcome measure will be used to determine the impact of PCS on quality of life on patients and families.</description>

This battery includes measures of intelligence, language, visual-spatial/motor functions, attention, memory/working memory, executive functioning, academic achievement, as well as behavioural/socioemotional functioning.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects presenting to one of the study hospital EDs after sustaining a head injury will
        be eligible if they:

          -  are aged 5 to 17 years;

          -  have a concussion, defined by Zurich consensus statement;22

          -  suffered the initial injury in the previous 48 hours;

          -  are proficient in English or French.

        Exclusion Criteria:  Patients will be excluded if they present with traumatic head
        injuries with any of the following:

          -  GCS ≤13; any abnormality on standard neuroimaging studies, including any positive
             head CT findings (Note: neuroimaging is not required, but may be performed by the
             clinician if thought to be clinically indicated);

          -  neurosurgical operative intervention, intubation or PICU care required;

          -  multi-system injuries with treatment requiring admission to hospital, operating room
             or procedural sedation in the ED (Note: admission to hospital for observation or
             management of ongoing concussion symptoms is not an exclusion criteria);

          -  severe chronic neurological developmental delay resulting in communication
             difficulties;

          -  intoxication at the time of ED presentation as per clinician judgment;

          -  no clear history of trauma as primary event (e.g., seizure, syncope or migraine as
             primary event);

          -  previously enrolled in this same study.
