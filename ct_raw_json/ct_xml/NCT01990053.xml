    <textblock>
      Standard treatments for depression in specialty care settings are effective but resources
      for delivering empirically supported psychotherapies are often limited. Computerized
      cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) is an effective and highly scalable treatment for
      depression that might help expand services in psychiatric settings, however, little is known
      about its efficacy in this population. The present study aims to establish the efficacy of a
      internet-delivered cCBT program (&quot;Beating the Blues&quot;) plus email and telephone support for
      depression in a psychiatric outpatient clinic setting. The secondary aim is to pilot an
      assessment procedure designed to identify moderators of treatment effectiveness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, outpatient psychiatric settings are plagued by long wait times and are often
      unable to accommodate all individuals seeking services. Furthermore, a lack of trained
      therapists in these settings means that many treatment seekers do not have access to
      empirically supported psychotherapeutic treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy.
      &quot;Beating the Blues&quot; (BtB) is a computerized, internet-delivered, cognitive behavioral
      treatment for depression. BtB is highly scalable and might enable a larger proportion of
      individuals to receive cognitive behavioral therapy in a psychiatric setting while also
      reducing therapist time. Although computerized CBT interventions have proven effective in
      primary care settings, there is no research demonstrating the effectiveness of cCBT in
      secondary care settings in the United States. Thus the primary goal of the proposed research
      is to test the efficacy of BtB in a specialty care sample.

      Patients presenting to these settings tend to have more severe and complex psychopathology
      than those presenting to primary care. Although BtB is likely effective, computerized
      treatments do carry a higher risk of dropout and non-response. Therefore, reliable and valid
      predictors of response are needed to determine who is most likely to respond to the
      treatment, versus who is likely to fail or drop out.  Thus the second aim of the current
      proposal is to pilot an assessment procedure containing a number of potential predictors of
      cCBT response and investigate these predictors for inclusion in a larger validation study.

      The current trial is a pilot study with a randomized waitlist control design with optional
      delayed treatment for individuals randomized to the waitlist condition. We will enroll 90
      treatment-seeking adults 18 or older recruited from a pool of individuals seeking outpatient
      psychiatric services at a hospital clinic.  Sixty (n=60) individuals will be assigned
      immediate treatment group with BtB plus telephone and email support, and n=30 to the
      waitlist/delayed BtB plus telephone and email support group.  Efficacy will be assessed over
      8 weeks using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (pre to post treatment) and the PHQ9
      (measured at weeks 1, 3, 5 and 8). There will also be a 1-month follow-up. Potential
      predictors of outcome include demographics, CBT skills, personality measures, cognitive
      functioning, measures of attitudes and beliefs, social functioning, psychiatric comorbidity
      and depression illness characteristics, and psychophysiological measures.
