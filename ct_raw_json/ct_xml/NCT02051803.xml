  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this program of research is to develop and disseminate an efficacious
      intervention for weight concern that will significantly increase smoking cessation rates
      among women. The overall objective of this project is to develop this intervention, modify
      it based on piloting and feedback to ensure its feasibility and acceptability, and obtain
      preliminary data supporting its efficacy. These objectives will be accomplished by pursuing
      the following specific aims: 1) develop a group-based distress tolerance treatment for
      weight concern (DT-W) in female smokers and a comparison health education (HE) program and
      pilot both treatments with three groups of 10 (total N = 30) female weight-concerned smokers
      (2 DT-W groups, 1 HE group), 2) conduct a preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT) (N =
      60) comparing DT-W to a Health Education (HE) comparison intervention, in which both groups
      also receive standard behavioral smoking cessation treatment (ST) including counseling and
      transdermal nicotine patch (TNP), and 3) examine potential mechanisms that may underlie the
      efficacy of DT-W in improving smoking outcomes at 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-ups.
