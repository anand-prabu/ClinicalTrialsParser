To determine if Nplate (romiplostim) is capable of increasing platelet counts to > 50 x\n      10^9/L for greater than 2 weeks in myeloma patients with chemotherapy induced\n      thrombocytopenia.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To evaluate the toxicity of romiplostim in this patient population by standard Common\n      Toxicity Criteria (CTC).\n\n      II. To determine any increase in thrombosis or marrow fibrosis.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive romiplostim subcutaneously (SC) once weekly for up to 6 weeks. Patients\n      achieving a platelet count > 50 x 10^9 then receive romiplostim once weekly during 1 course\n      of chemotherapy and may continue for as long as benefit is seen.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year."
