By blocking a substance that helps\n      tumours grow and spread, Xilonix therapy may not only slow tumour growth, but also may\n      improve symptoms of muscle loss, fatigue, appetite loss, and pain in patients with\n      colorectal cancer. The effectiveness of the therapy will be measured by assessing the change\n      in these symptoms for patients treated with Xilonix versus those treated with placebo.\n      Reversal of muscle loss will be assessed with a type of X-ray called a DEXA scanner.\n      Improvement in pain, appetite loss, and fatigue will be measured with a questionnaire that\n      is completed by patients enrolled on the trial."

Subjects with pathologically confirmed colorectal carcinoma that is metastatic or\n             unresectable and which is refractory to standard therapy.  To be considered\n             refractory, a subject must have failed both an oxaliplatin (oxaliplatin may have been\n             in the adjuvant setting) and an irinotecan based regimen.\n\n          2. Symptomatic Disease:  One symptom from each domain (metabolic and functional) must be\n             present.\n\n               -  Evidence of metabolic dysfunction, defined as the presence of one or more of the\n                  following:\n\n               -  Any degree (up to 20%) of unintentional total body weight loss in the previous 6\n                  months\n\n               -  Serum Interleukin 6 levels \u226510 pg/ml\n\n               -  Evidence of reduced function or presence of cancer related symptoms as\n                  determined by EORTC QLQ-C30.\n\n               -  Appetite reduction, with a score of >10\n\n               -  Presence of fatigue, with a score of >10\n\n               -  Presence of Pain, with a score of >10\n\n               -  Decreased Role, Emotional and Social function, with a score of < 90.\n\n          3.

Subjects who have received extensive prior radiation therapy to the bone marrow.\n             Extensive radiation therapy is defined as treatment of more than one axial bony\n             metastasis.
