According to\n      our preliminary experience, water immersion could be beneficial while scoping these\n      patients. As far as the investigators know, water-aided colonoscopy has never been studied\n      in this indication. Results of our trial might support use of water-aided colonoscopy in\n      common practice and decrease associated discomfort in IBD patients."
