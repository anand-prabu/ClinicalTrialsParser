  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thirty (30) patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction secondary to MI
      scheduled to undergo cardiac catheterization will be enrolled in the study.This is a phase
      II study intended to gain additional safety and efficacy assessments among two dose levels
      previously studied in a phase I setting.  In this study, a 20 million total hMSC dose and a
      100 million total hMSC dose will be randomly allocated administered via the Biocardia
      Helical infusion system in a blinded manner.

      The technique of transplanting progenitor cells into a region of damaged myocardium, termed
      cellular cardiomyoplasty1, is a potentially new therapeutic modality designed to replace or
      repair necrotic, scarred, or dysfunctional myocardium2-4.  Ideally, graft cells should be
      readily available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and
      able to survive in host myocardium, which is often a hostile environment of limited blood
      supply and immunorejection.  Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that
      administered cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically
      with the surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial and recent evidence suggests
      that this may not be required for effective cardiac repair.  Most importantly,
      transplantation of graft cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse
      ventricular remodeling.  To date, a number of candidate cells have been transplanted in
      experimental models, including fetal and neonatal cardiomyocytes5, 6, embryonic stem
      cell-derived myocytes5, 7, 8, tissue engineered contractile grafts9, skeletal myoblasts10,
      11, several cell types derived from adult bone marrow12-20, and cardiac precursors residing
      within the heart itself21-23. There has been substantial clinical development in the use of
      whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both
      post-infarction patients and patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and
      heart failure. The effects of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also
      been studied clinically24, 25.

      Currently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent a highly promising modality
      for cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone
      marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this
      approach.  In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority
      of the trials.

      Chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction is a common and problematic condition;
      definitive therapy in the form of heart transplantation is available to only a tiny minority
      of eligible patients.  Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart failure has been studied
      less than for acute MI, but represents a potentially important alternative for this disease.
