    <textblock>
      Walking Meditation  training would yield more favorable adaptations than walking alone in
      improving glycemic control and vascular function in patients with type 2 diabetes.

    <description>The glycemic control will be quantified using blood samples. Fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, and insulin  will be measured with standard procedures at the clinical laboratory (Bria Lab, Bangkok, Thailand).Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), the parameter for insulin resistance, will be calculated by using equation of [Fasting glucose (mg/dL) × Insulin level (uU/mL) / 405].</description>

    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Vascular reactivity or brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) will be assessed with the ultrasound equipment (CX50, Philips, USA), using the blood occlusion technique on the right forearm. The brachial artery will be imaged above the antecubital fossa in the longitudinal plane. Baseline data will be  monitored and the cuff placed around the right forearm will be inflated to 50 mmHg above systolic blood pressure for 5 minutes and then deflated for 5 minutes of recovery. FMD will be  calculated from the formula FMD=(D2-D1)x100/D1 when D1 is the brachial artery diameter at baseline, D2 is the maximal post-occlusion brachial artery diameter</description>

    <description>Ankle-brachial index will be evaluated with a manual MD6 bidirectional transcutaneous Doppler probe (Hokanson, Bellevue, WA, USA) and will be calculated by dividing the highest ankle systolic blood pressure by the highest brachial systolic blood pressure.</description>

    <description>Walking Meditation training program will be based on aerobic walking exercise combined with Buddhist meditation. The subjects will perform walking on the treadmill while concentrated on foot stepping by voiced &quot;Budd&quot; and &quot;Dha&quot; with each foot step that contacted the floor to practice mindfulness while walking. Walking Meditation will be conducted at mild to moderate intensity (50-60% maximum heart rate) and in phase 2 (week 7-12), the training intensity will be increased to moderate intensity (60-70% maximum heart rate). In both phases the training will be performed for 30 minutes, 3 times per week.</description>
