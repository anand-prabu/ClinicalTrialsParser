Use of the patch may benefit brain tumor patients by increasing\n      compliance.\n\n      All eligible adult malignant glioma subjects should receive a planned total dose of 54-60 GY\n      of radiation and 75 mg/m2 of daily TMZ for a total of six weeks.

The granisetron transdermal delivery system (supplied as a 52\n      cm^2  patch containing 34.3 mg of granisetron - 3.1 mg/day) is applied once per week 24\n      hours before the weekly radiation and chemotherapy, while the ondansetron 8 mg oral tablet\n      is taken once a day 30-60 minutes prior to each dose of chemotherapy. Subjects will fill out\n      questionnaires regarding the effectiveness of the medication and their satisfaction, and\n      which anti-emetic they prefer.\n\n      Safety will be assessed throughout the six weeks of radiation by the clinical research nurse\n      using the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0.

Subjects will be randomized to receive\n      one of two treatment sequences of antiemetic therapy for the prevention of nausea and\n      vomiting associated with RT and concomitant TMZ. Sequence #1 involves administration of\n      ondansetron for 3 weeks followed by the use of granisetron patch for 3 weeks; whereas\n      sequence #2 involves the use of the granisetron patch for 3 weeks followed by 3 weeks of\n      ondansetron. Toxicity will be assessed each week of radiation therapy based on the Common\n      Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. The subject will be asked to\n      complete the modified MASCC Antiemesis Tool (MAT) questionnaire at baseline, and on days 2,\n      4, and 7 of each week of radiation therapy, as well as to record the use of all study\n      medication and any antiemetic rescue medication taken daily.  At the end of the weeks 3 & 6,\n      the subject will be asked to fill out a Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication\n      and will be asked at the end of week 6 to choose which antiemetic they prefer."
