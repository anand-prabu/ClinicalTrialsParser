    <textblock>
      The UltraHeal Study is a randomized controlled trial to compare healing response of low
      frequency contact ultrasonic-assisted debridement in addition to best practice wound care to
      best practice wound care alone in a Vascular Surgery Clinic patient population with wounds
      of the lower extremity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will also investigate the bacterial tissue burden and protease activity to provide
      further insight into the infection and inflammation aspects of healing barriers in a
      challenging population.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Persons with lower extremity wound referred to vascular surgery service.

          -  Full thickness wound below the knee with surface area of at least 1cm2.

          -  Age &gt;18 years

          -  English speaking

          -  Ulcer of known etiology including diabetic foot wounds, and arterial or venous leg
             ulcers

          -  Willing and able to adhere to 12 week study protocol that includes attending weekly
             clinic appointments, and wearing prescribed footwear or compression therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Leg wounds due to inflammatory conditions (e.g.  pyoderma gangrenosum, vasculitis),
             malignancy, or other unknown etiologies.

          -  Severe arterial insufficiency: Absence of pedal pulses combined with     Ankle
             Brachial Index   ≤ 0.3,  Toe Pressure  ≤20, or Trans Cutaneous Oxygen Measure ≤20

          -  Presence of acute limb threatening infection

          -  Vascular surgery planned within next 3 months

          -  Exposed vascular graft or blood vessel, bone or tendon in the base of the wound.

          -  Currently receiving advanced wound therapy treatments: Hyperbaric therapy, biological
             dressings [collagen or extracellular matrix dressings].

          -  Increased likelihood of an adverse reaction to ultrasonic debridement due to:

          -  Excessive wound pain (&gt;5 VAS scale) or patient described intolerable

          -  Allergy to topical anesthetic (lidocaine)

          -  Individuals who have factors/circumstances that are known to limit their ability to
             demonstrate healing in 4 weeks.

        For example:

          -  medically unstable or palliative medical status

          -  poor nutritional status (low serum albumin &lt; 15),

          -  anemia (Hb &lt; 75 mg/dl),

          -  taking immunosuppressant medication (prednisone, chemotherapy; transplant
             anti-rejection medication),

          -  Individuals with medical conditions that contraindicate the use of ultrasound energy

          -  Cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator

          -  Excessive bleeding tendency (&gt; 5 mins post debridement) or identified coagulopathic
             disorders

          -  Exposed bone in the wound base

          -  Untreated osteomyelitis
