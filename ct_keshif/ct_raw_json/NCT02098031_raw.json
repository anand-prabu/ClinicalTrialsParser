The etiology of inadequate nutrient supply to infants may relate to lack of\n      resources or knowledge or a combination of both. Poor nutrient intake and impaired growth\n      may affect brain and cognitive development.\n\n      This study aims to evaluate nutrient intake, growth and cognitive function among children\n      between 6 and 36 months living in the fertile Kabale and Kisoro region in south-western\n      Uganda.  The investigators hypothesize that nutrition education to mothers can bring about\n      improved dietary intake and nutritional status among children aged 6-36 months."
