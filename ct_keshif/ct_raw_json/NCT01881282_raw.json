Participants will be\n      randomly assigned to either of the two treatment groups that are carraghenates cream\n      (Titanoreine) group or Mayinglong musk hemorrhoid ointment group. The total duration of the\n      study will be 1 Week (7 days). In carraghenates cream group, 3-4 gram (g) cream will be\n      administered each time through anal canal, twice a day, once in the morning and once in the\n      evening for consecutive 6 days and in the Mayinglong musk hemorrhoid ointment group, 2 g\n      ointment will be administered each time through anal canal, twice a day, once in the morning\n      and once in the evening for consecutive 6 days. Efficacy will be assessed by using Numeric\n      Rating Scale (NRS) and participants' safety will be monitored throughout the trial."
