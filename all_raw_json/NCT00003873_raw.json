Patients are stratified according to performance status\n      (0 vs 1-2) and measurable disease (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to one of two\n      treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I: Patients receive fluorouracil IV as a continuous infusion for 28 days.\n\n      ARM II: Patients receive eniluracil/fluorouracil orally twice a day for 28 days.\n\n      Treatment continues every 35 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at least every 10 weeks for 1 year."
