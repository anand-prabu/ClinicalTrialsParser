In the control group there are no parenteral nutrition (PN)\n      restrictions. In the experimental group, an Enhanced Recovery Oral Nutrition Protocol\n      (ERONP) will be introduced and PN can be initiated if oral intake is still insufficient\n      after five days.

Oral intake is increased progressively with oral fluids and easily digestible food, independent of clinical bowel movements. The oral energy sips used are Fortimel Juicy\u00ae (Nutricia) 200 ml containing 300 kcal. This provides supplementary energy and essential nutrients. Supplementary fluid, approximately up to two liter, is given intravenously. If the patient is unable to produce stools on the third day post-surgery,  neostigmine (Prostigmin\u00ae 0.5 mg subcutaneous, maximum 4 times a day), an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor promoting the movement of intestinal contents by augmenting motor activity of the small and large bowel, can be administered. Only if oral intake is still insufficient after five days, PN (Oliclinomel N7) can be initiated.",
