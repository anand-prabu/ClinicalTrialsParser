            "textblock": "Asthma is a disease that affects more than 12% of Americans under the age of 18 for over 14\n      million missed school days per year, and is the number one cause of school absences in\n      America. Elementary school children spend 6 to 10 hours a day in school, and most of that\n      time is spent in one classroom. The goals of this project are to provide an understanding of\n      exposure risk factors specific to the classroom. This is critical, because the classroom\n      environment could potentially be considered as an effective target for prevention of\n      inner-city asthma morbidity by reducing exposures to many symptomatic children through an\n      intervention in the school classrooms."
