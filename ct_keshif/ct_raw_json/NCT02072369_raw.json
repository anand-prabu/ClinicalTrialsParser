            "textblock": "Stroke survivors with chronic hemiparesis of the upper extremity undertook 18 one-hour\n      training sessions over a 6-week period. Participants received occupational therapy focusing\n      on grasp-and-release using a task-oriented protocol developed at the Rehabilitation\n      Institute of Chicago by Dr. Mary Ellen Stoykov. Over 90% of  all repetitions performed\n      during each session were focused on functional activities, as opposed to active exercise.\n      The skills and strategies developed in therapy were then implemented into activities\n      identified as goals by the participant, such as donning socks. Difficulty of the task,\n      activity, or exercise was progressed for each participant to provide optimal challenge to\n      enhance skill.\n\n      Subjects were assigned to one of two groups by casting lots. One group (J-Glove) performed\n      all tasks while wearing a custom motor-driven glove, the J-Glove. The other group (No-Glove)\n      performed the same types of tasks without use of the J-Glove. The J-Glove is a portable\n      active-assistance device, designed to assist digit extension in order to allow repeated\n      practice of specified tasks.  The glove contains cables traversing the dorsal side of the\n      digits in order to provide extension and resist flexion.  Forces are transmitted through the\n      cables from a servomotor located remotely to the digits.  The servomotor controls torque or\n      displacement in the cable. Along the digits, the cables traverse through custom plastic\n      blocks, which serve both to guide the cable and to prevent joint hyperextension.\n\n      The J-Glove can be controlled with up to 3 channels of electromyography (EMG).  For this\n      study, electrodes were placed above flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and extensor\n      digitorum communis (EDC).  The group using the J-Glove could receive assistance during hand\n      opening, but only if appropriate EMG activity was detected.  The EDC EMG activity had to\n      reach a prescribed threshold before extension assistance would be provided.  Similarly, FDS\n      EMG activity had to surpass a threshold level during hand closing before the user was\n      allowed to flex the digits.  Feedback of muscle activity was available to the user through a\n      custom graphical user interface."
