Based\n      upon pre-clinical data, SBG has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis and probably enhance\n      immune function, leading to shrinkage of tumor size in athymic nude mice injected by\n      hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) and cervical cancer cells. Therefore, the\n      investigators expect to see the safety and anti-cancer property of SBG in patients with\n      advanced cancer whom no available therapy can be offered."
