  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy for treating patients with
      melanoma that involves taking white blood cells from the patient, growing them in the
      laboratory in large numbers, genetically modifying them, and then giving the cells back to
      the patient. In a previous study, the NCI Surgery Branch used the anti-ESO-1 gene and a type
      of virus (retrovirus) to make these tumor-fighting cells (anti-ESO-1 cells). About half of
      the patients who received this treatment experienced shrinking of their tumors.  In this
      study, we are using a slightly different method of producing the anti-ESO-1 cells, which we
      hope, will be better in making the tumors shrink.

      Objectives:

      The purpose of this study is to see if these tumor fighting cells (genetically modified
      cells) that express the receptor for the ESO-1 molecule on their surface can cause melanoma
      tumors to shrink and to see if this treatment is safe.

      Eligibility:

      -Adults 18 and older with cancer that has the ESO-1 molecule on tumor surfaces

      Design:

        -  Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and
           undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests
           as needed

        -  Leukapheresis: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will
           undergo leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti ESO-1 cells.
           {Leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells from the
           patient.}

        -  Treatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital
           for the conditioning chemotherapy, the anti-ESO 1 cells and aldesleukin.  They will
           stay in the hospital for about 1-2 weeks to recover from the treatment.

        -  Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab
           tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to
           1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking.

      Background:

        -  A T cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes the NY-ESO-1 (ESO) tumor/testes antigen has
           been cloned into a retrovirus and can be used to genetically modify human peripheral
           blood lymphocytes (PBL) so they recognize HLA-A2+, ESO+ tumors

        -  PBL expressing the anti-ESO TCR have been administered with aldesleukin with or without
           ALVAC vaccine to 21 patients with melanoma following lymphodepleting chemotherapy at
           the Surgery Branch, resulting in objective tumor regression (complete or partial
           regression) in ten patients (47%).

        -  In animal models using murine cells and in experiments with human T cells in vitro, T
           cell subsets expressing the lymphoid homing and differentiation marker CD62L, including
           na(SqrRoot) ve T cells (TNaive), stem cell memory T cells (TSCM), and central memory T
           cells (TCM), were shown to have superior attributes compared to whole PBL and CD62L-
           PBL for adoptive cell therapy, including superior persistence following transfer in
           vivo.

      Objectives:

      Primary objective:

      - To determine whether the administration of anti-ESO TCR engineered CD62L+-derived
      lymphocytes plus high-dose aldesleukin following a non-myeloablative lymphodepleting
      preparative regimen can result in an objective regression rate (PR + CR) of melanoma tumors.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Determine the persistence of genetically engineered, adoptively transferred CD62L+
           derived lymphocytes.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen.

      Eligibility:

      Patients who are:

        -  HLA-A*0201 positive

        -  18 years of age or older

        -  Have metastatic melanoma that expresses the ESO antigen

      Patients may not have:

      - Contraindications for high dose aldesleukin administration.

      Design:

        -  PBMC will be obtained by leukapheresis and will undergo positive selection for CD62L
           using a CliniMACS magnetic cell separation apparatus to enrich for the less
           differentiated TNaive, TSCM, and TCM subsets.

        -  The enriched CD62L+ lymphocytes will be cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 (OKT3) and
           aldesleukin in order to stimulate T-cell growth, then transduced with the anti-ESO TCR.

        -  All patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen
           of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.

        -  On day 0 patients will receive anti-ESO TCR gene-transduced CD62L+ -derived lymphocytes
           and then begin high dose aldesleukin.

        -  A complete evaluation of evaluable lesions will be conducted 6 weeks (+/- 2 weeks)
           following the administration of the cell product.

        -  The primary objective will be efficacy. The study will be conducted using a phase II
           optimal design (Simon R, Controlled Clinical Trials 10:1-10, 1989) in order to rule out
           an unacceptably low 40% overall response rate (p0=0.40) in favor of an improved
           response rate of 65% (p1=0.65). This study will initially enroll 11 evaluable patients,
           and if 0 to 5 of the 11 have a response, then no further patients will be accrued. If 6
           or more of the first 11 patients have a response, then accrual would continue until a
           total of 20 patients have been enrolled. If there were 11 or more responses in 20
           patients (55%), this would be sufficiently interesting to warrant further study in
           later trials. To allow for a very small number of inevaluable patients, the accrual
           ceiling will be set at 22 patients.

               -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
                  this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV
                  seropositive can have decreased immune-competence and thus be less responsive to
                  the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)

                  If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patient must be tested for the
                  presence of antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.

         12. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus.

             Note: Patients may have undergone minor surgical procedures within the past 3 weeks,
             as long as all toxicities have recovered to grade 1 or less or as specified in the
             eligibility criteria in Section 2.1.

         16. Six weeks must have elapsed from the time of any antibody therapy that could affect

        Note: Patients who have previously received ipilimumab and have documented GI toxicity
        must have a normal colonoscopy with normal colonic biopsies.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus or infant.

          2. Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency
