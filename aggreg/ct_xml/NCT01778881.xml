      Introduction: Bruxism is an oral parafunctional habit of clenching and / or grinding of
      teeth, which can occur during daytime (diurnal bruxism) and / or during sleep (nocturnal
      bruxism), whose prevalence in adults is 20% and 8% respectively. The peripheral,
      psychosocial and centers factors are associated with the origin of bruxism, which can
      trigger masticatory muscle pain, neck pain, headache, low threshold of pain sensitivity,
      limited jaw opening, negatively influence sleep quality and oral health and be related to
      affective disorders (anxiety, stress and depression). The objective of this study is to
      compare two physiotherapy interventions with dental treatment in pain, limited jaw opening,
      sleep quality, anxiety, stress and depression and oral health quality in individuals with
      bruxism. Methods: Participants will be randomly assigned to three groups: Group 1 (n = 20)
      will perform massage techniques and muscle stretching exercises, Group 2 (n = 20) relaxation
      therapy and imagination and Group 3 (n = 20)dental treatment. All participants will perform
      the same assessment procedures (pre, post and two months after intervention). The intensity
      of the pain will be assessed by visual analog scale (VAS), pain  threshold by algometer,
      mandibular depression by paquimeter, sleep quality by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index,
      anxiety by State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, stress by Perceived Stress Scale, depression by
      Beck Depression Inventory and  oral health quality by Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14).
      Significance is considered 5%.

      Objetive: To compare two interventions  of physical therapy with dental treatment in
      individuals with bruxism.

      Design: Sixty individuals will be randomized into three group: Group 1 (n=20) massage
      therapy and muscle stretching exercises, Group 2 (n=20) relaxation therapy and imagination
      and Group 3 (n=20) dental treatment. The primary clinical outcomes will be pain, assessed
      with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Algometer (pain threshold) and mandibular
      depression asseded with paquimeter. Secondary outcomes will be sleep quality (Pittsburgh
      Sleep Quality Index -PSQI), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - STAI), stress(Perceived
      Stress Scale -PSS), depression (Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and oral health quality
      (Oral Health Impact Profile -OHIP-14). Evaluations will be performed before(baseline), after
      (6 weeks) and with a follow-up 2 months after treatment. Data will be collected by a blinded
      examiner. Individuals of physiotherapy intervention groups will hold 12 individual sessions,
      lasting 40 minutes each, twice a week, by the same therapist, duly qualified. Will be
      requested to carry out specific exercises at home. Individuals of dental treatment group
      will be two sessions of individual restoration, with an interval of one week and will last
      two hours. Participants will be reassessed 30, 60 and 90 days after treatment ended.
      Significance level is established at 5%.
