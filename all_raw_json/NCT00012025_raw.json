Courses repeat approximately\n      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years or until disease progression. After disease\n      progression, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3\n      years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 41-94 patients will be accrued for this study within 10\n      months."
