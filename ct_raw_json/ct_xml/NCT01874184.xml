  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a feasibility study of a diet and exercise
      intervention in measuring the impact of this intervention on (a) changes in percent
      adiposity and (b) on estrogen metabolites.  We hypothesize that the intervention group will
      have reduced percent adiposity and that this change will be associated with estrogen
      metabolites.

      Women between the ages of 35-65 years of age, who are at high-risk of breast cancer will be
      enrolled into the study and randomized into two groups: control and intervention groups.
      Both groups will provide biologic specimens, undergo Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)
      scans, complete questionnaires and dietary recall interviews.
