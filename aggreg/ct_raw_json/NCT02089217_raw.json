            "textblock": "Prevention of stroke involves managing and treating risk factors. Most strokes are caused\n      when blood flow to a portion of the brain is blocked. One place this often happens is in the\n      carotid artery. This blockage is called atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries.\n\n      The purpose of this trial is to determine the best way to prevent strokes in people who have\n      a high amount of blockage of their carotid artery but no stroke symptoms related to that\n      blockage. Each eligible participant will be evaluated to determine which procedure(s) is\n      best for him/her. All participants will receive intensive medical treatment.  In addition,\n      participants will be randomized to receive the selected procedure or not.\n\n      The trial will be conducted in the United States and Canada by physicians carefully selected\n      on their ability to perform the procedures at low risk. Another key component of the trial\n      is that important stroke risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol,\n      cigarette smoking, physical activity, and diet will be managed intensively.  Participants\n      will remain in the study for 4 years."

Contra-lateral common or internal carotid artery occlusion.\n\n        Specific carotid endarterectomy exclusion criteria\n\n        Patients who are being considered for revascularization by CEA must not have any of the\n        following criteria:\n\n          1. Serious adverse reaction to anesthesia not able to be overcome by pre-medication.\n\n          2. Coronary artery disease with two or more proximal or major diseased coronary arteries\n             with greater than or equal to 70% stenosis that have not, or cannot, be\n             revascularized prior to CEA.\n\n          3. Any of the following anatomical exclusions for CEA: radical neck dissection;\n             surgically inaccessible lesions (e.g. above cervical spine level 2 (C2)); adverse\n             neck anatomy that limits surgical exposure (e.g. spinal immobility - inability to\n             flex neck beyond neutral or kyphotic deformity, or short obese neck); presence of\n             tracheostomy stoma; laryngeal nerve palsy contralateral to target vessel; or previous\n             extracranial-intracranial or subclavian bypass procedure ipsilateral to the target\n             vessel.\n\n          4. Known allergy to heparin or bivalirudin.\n\n          5. For age < 50 years, CAS is the favored procedure. However, the CREST results for\n             asymptomatic patients showed wide confidence intervals about the point estimates\n             comparing CAS and CEA.  Accordingly, choice of CEA or CAS cannot be mandated;\n             individual patient characteristics and preferences may supersede guidelines based\n             upon patient age. (See Section 8.1.3 for more details)\n\n        Specific Carotid Artery Stenting Exclusion Criteria\n\n        Patients who are being considered for revascularization by CAS must not have any of the\n        following criteria:\n\n          1. Allergy to intravascular contrast dye not amenable to pre-medication.\n\n          2. Occlusive or critical ilio-femoral disease including severe tortuosity or stenosis\n             that necessitates additional endovascular procedures to facilitate access to the\n             aortic arch or that prevents safe and expeditious femoral access to the aortic arch.\n\n          3. Angiographic, CT, MR or ultrasound evidence of severe atherosclerosis of the aortic\n             arch or origin of the innominate or common carotid arteries.\n\n          4. Type III, calcified aortic arch anatomy.\n\n          5. Qualitative characteristics of stenosis and stenosis-length of the carotid\n             bifurcation (common carotid) and/or ipsilateral external carotid artery, in\n             combination with elements of the exclusions # 3 and 4 that preclude safe sheath\n             placement.\n\n          6. Angulation or tortuosity (\u2265 90 degree) of the innominate and common carotid artery\n             that precludes safe, expeditious sheath placement or that will transmit a severe loop\n             to the internal carotid after sheath placement.\n\n          7. Severe angulation or tortuosity of the internal carotid artery (including calyceal\n             origin from the carotid bifurcation) that precludes safe deployment of embolic\n             protection device or stent.  Severe tortuosity is defined as 2 or more \u2265 90 degree\n             angles within 4 cm of the target stenosis.\n\n          8. Excessive circumferential calcification of the stenotic lesion defined as > 3mm\n             thickness of calcification seen in orthogonal views on fluoroscopy.\n\n          9. Anatomic considerations such as tortuosity, arch anatomy, and calcification must be\n             evaluated even more carefully in elderly subjects (\u2265 70 years).\n\n         10. \"String sign\" of the ipsilateral common or internal carotid artery.\n\n         11. Lesions > 20 mm in length.\n\n         12. Target ICA vessel reference diameter < 4.0 mm or > 9.0 mm. Target ICA measurements\n             may be made from angiography of the contralateral artery. The reference diameter must\n             be appropriate for the devices to be used.\n\n         13. Inability to deploy or utilize an FDA-approved Embolic Protection Device (EPD).\n\n         14. For age > 74 years, CEA is the favored procedure. However, the CREST results for\n             asymptomatic patients showed wide confidence intervals about the point estimates\n             comparing CAS and CEA.  Accordingly, choice of CEA or CAS cannot be mandated;\n             individual patient characteristics and preferences may supersede guidelines based\n             upon patient age)"
