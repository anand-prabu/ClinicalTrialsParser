Several PI3K inhibitors are being tested in\n      the clinical trials for cancer treatment but not for the head and neck cancer yet. BYL719 is\n      an alpha specific I PI3K inhibitor. It showed significant, concentration dependent cell\n      growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis. We suggest multicenter single arm phase II\n      study to determine anti-tumor effects of BYL719 in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic\n      SCCHN who failed to prior chemotherapy regimens. Enrollment will be done in 5 or more\n      clinical trial centers in Korea. Primary objective is to evaluate disease control rate (DCR)\n      at 8 weeks of BYL719, and the efficacy will be evaluated by the investigators analysis based\n      on RECIST version 1.1."
