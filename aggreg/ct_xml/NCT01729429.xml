  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial is designed to evaluate whether a behavioral intervention
      that includes three components: 1) reminder letters and education materials delivered before
      the clinic visit, 2) telephone recalls after the visit for those who originally decline the
      vaccine, and 3) telephone reminders for those who miss the 2nd and/or 3rd doses, increases 1
      and 3 dose coverage of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine series among adolescent girls
      attending four Parkland primary care clinics in Dallas county.

      Hypothesis 1: Investigators expect higher 1 dose HPV vaccine coverage among patients in the
      Intervention group than those in the General Adolescent Vaccine Brochure group.

      Hypothesis 2: Investigators expect significantly higher 1 dose HPV vaccine coverage among
      patients in the Intervention group who initially declined the vaccine than those in the
      General Adolescent Vaccine Brochure group who initially declined.

      Hypothesis 3: Investigators expect significantly higher 3 dose HPV vaccine coverage among
      the Intervention group than those in the General Adolescent Vaccine Brochure group.

      The primary research goal is to implement and evaluate evidence-based intervention
      strategies targeted to adolescent girls and their parents that stimulate patient demand for
      the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and compliment provider-directed strategies already
      employed by Parkland clinics.

      The project has three specific aims:

        -  Aim 1. Determine if a mailed packet with a reminder and educational material delivered
           prior to clinic visit, increases 1 dose coverage of the HPV vaccine series.

        -  Aim 2. Determine if a telephone recall delivered 2 weeks after the clinic visit,
           increases 1 dose coverage among patients who decline the vaccine during the clinic
           visit.

        -  Aim 3. Determine if telephone recalls to those who miss appointments for 2nd or 3rd
           doses of the HPV vaccine series, increase 3 dose coverage of the series.

      Phase 1 - Cognitive interviews: To ensure the usability and cultural appropriateness of all
      project materials, investigators will conduct 40 in-person, cognitive interviews with
      parents of female patients ages 11-18 attending Parkland clinics.

      Phase 2 - Randomized controlled trial. Investigators will select and invite 1200 families
      whose daughter has an upcoming appointment at one of four Parkland clinic sites. Eligible
      patients will be randomized to either the Intervention group or the General Adolescent
      Vaccine Brochure group.  The Intervention group participants will be mailed a packet
      containing an invitation letter to join the study and HPV vaccine-specific educational
      materials; General Adolescent Vaccine Brochure group participants will be mailed a packet
      with educational materials on all four of the recommended adolescent vaccines (HPV,
      meningococcal, TDAP, and influenza). A few days after the packet has been sent, a research
      assistant will call participants to verify that the letter was received and assess interest
      in completing a pre-clinic visit survey.

      Participants who agree to fill out the in-clinic survey will be asked to come to their
      clinic appointment 40 minutes early to obtain verbal informed consent from the parent and
      verbal assent from the adolescent female patient. Then, the parent will complete a 20-30
      minute survey about the HPV vaccine and interactions with their daughter's provider. The
      daughter will complete a short survey that asks about use of social media and health
      concerns.

      Intervention group participants who complete the in-clinic survey are also eligible to
      receive telephone recalls and reminders.  If the Intervention group parent refused the
      vaccine during the initial clinic visit, a telephone recall will be delivered after 2 weeks
      offering to schedule an immunization-only appointment. If the Intervention group participant
      misses the 2nd and/or 3rd doses, telephone reminders will be delivered. For participants who
      complete the in-clinic survey and are randomized to the General Adolescent Vaccine Brochure
      group, parents who refused will be contacted after 2 weeks to assess attitudes and
      intentions toward the HPV vaccine.

      Participants in both the Intervention and General Adolescent Vaccine Brochure group will
      have their medical record reviewed to assess HPV vaccine outcomes, receipt of the other
      three recommended adolescent vaccines, and contact with the clinic during the 12 months
      following randomization.
