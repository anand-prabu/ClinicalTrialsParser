            "textblock": "AAs in South Carolina bear an unequal burden of cancer incidence and mortality compared to\n      their European American counterparts. The Research Program (RP) is committed to\n      investigating and eliminating this burden through the careful conduct of research studies in\n      partnership with their AA community partners. The overall aim of the RP is to support the\n      SCCDCN-II in its mission to reduce, and ultimately eliminate, cancer health disparities\n      using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to design and conduct\n      research projects in AA communities in South Carolina. The goals of the research program are\n      to: support the SCCDCN by serving as a research liaison/consultant for all community-based\n      activities; foster and support meaningful partnerships between academic researchers and\n      community leaders and representatives; conduct a two-arm physical activity and dietary\n      intervention trial for breast cancer prevention among African-American women in the\n      investigators target communities of faith; conduct a pilot study to determine\n      African-American men's and women's knowledge about prostate cancer screening and their\n      knowledge and attitudes regarding participation in prostate cancer research, including\n      National Cancer Institute (NCI) sponsored clinical trials; support additional research in\n      cancer disparities through a Pilot Study post-transition year and to develop and implement\n      an SCCDCN-II internal pilot grants program in years 4 and 5; and partner with community\n      representatives to disseminate program findings and to work with colleagues in the AC, and\n      Community Outreach and Training Programs to develop community capacity aimed at sustaining\n      programs to improve health The two-arm intervention trial will be aimed at testing the\n      effectiveness of a community-designed, family-based dietary and PA behavioral intervention\n      on modifying biomarkers of inflammation and decreasing breast density with a randomized\n      controlled design. The prostate cancer pilot will be aimed at assessing current knowledge\n      and attitudes regarding prostate cancer prevention and screening, and participation in\n      prostate cancer research; changes in knowledge and attitudes about research participation\n      following a pilot education program; and culturally appropriate strategies for promoting\n      cancer research among AAs in a faith-based community. All activities of the research program\n      will be conducted in partnership with identified SCCDCN II community partners, the State\n      Baptist YWA of the Women's BEMC, SCPHCA, CCBHSN, and Insights Consulting. It is anticipated\n      that research activities will be conducted in all 5 years of the granting period with\n      opportunities for research partnerships in all State Baptist YWA regions throughout the\n      state."
