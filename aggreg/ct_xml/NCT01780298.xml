  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common inflammatory disease of the airway
      affecting approximately 10% of individuals aged 40 years or more with a smoking history. The
      disease is characterized by an increase in numbers of airway white blood cells (neutrophils,
      lymphocytes and monocytes). Stimulation of white blood cells results in the release of
      different agents of inflammation. Some of these agents give an indication of the presence or
      severity of a disease when measured. These are called biomarkers.

      This study will be conducted in the UK and will (a) identify existing and new biomarkers and
      (b) compare these amongst the 4 groups of subjects recruited for the study. The groups will
      consist of 60 COPD subjects, 60 non-smokers (never smoked), 60 ex-smokers and 60 current
      smokers, all aged 40-70 years. COPD subjects will be matched to the non-COPD subjects by
      gender, age and ethnicity.

      Severe COPD is associated with elevated sputum neutrophil counts therefore sputum samples
      will be obtained. In order to identify other biomarkers, nasal samples collected by 3
      different methods (scraping the inside of the nose with a plastic probe, washing the nostril
      with salty water and placing strips of filter paper in the nostril for 2 minutes), and blood
      samples will be also obtained. Other tests to determine the quantity and quality of
      proteins, a substance called ribonucleic acid (RNA and to extract deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA) will be performed on some of the collected samples. Other tests such as a chest CT
      scan, full lung function assessment and cardio-pulmonary exercise tolerance test will be
      also performed.

      The study consists of 4 visits in total, plus the follow-up call, and can take a minimum of
      14 days to a maximum of 66 days for each subject to fully complete the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A case control study with three matched control groups. At the screening visit, subject
      consent will be obtained prior to conducting any study related procedures. Informed consent
      may be obtained on registration/review visit at the Centre which is conducted prior to visit
      1.

      The screening visit will involve obtaining demographic data and medical history information
      as well as performing safety assessments such as vital signs measurements, electrocardiogram
      (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests. An induced sputum sample will be obtained to ensure
      that subjects can produce an adequate sputum sample. Smokers will receive information on
      smoking cessation at the screening visit and follow-up telephone call.

      Subjects will attend the center on up to four further occasions if they meet the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria at screening.  An additional visit (Visit 1a) may be scheduled
      for subjects who are unable to produce an adequate sputum sample at Visit 1.  This will be
      at the discretion of the Investigator (or suitably qualified designee).

      The subject will return for visit 2 (4 to 21 days after screening) once it is determined
      that the subject is eligible for the study. Visit 3 will be conducted within 3-14 days of
      the completion of visit 2. Visit 4 will be scheduled 3-14 days post visit 3. A follow up
      telephone call will be conducted 3-10 days post visit 4.

      Subjects will undergo measurements of full lung function including lung volumes and transfer
      factors, differential exhaled nitric oxide (Differential FENO), impulse oscillatory (IOS),
      multichannel lung sound analysis, cardio-pulmonary exercise test with measurement of
      ventilator oxygen capacity (VO2 max) and oxygen saturation levels (SpO2),  exhaled breath
      temperature, nasal sampling and sputum induction. All subjects will complete quality of life
      questionnaires (SF36 and QOL) and the Modified Medical Council (MMRC) Dyspnea Scale.

      All subjects will undergo high resolution CT scan at visit 3 for the quantitative assessment
      of airway thickness and radiological evidence of emphysema. The staging of COPD will also be
      determined in subjects with COPD.

      Blood samples will be obtained for clinical biochemistry and hematology. The measurement of
      biomarkers of inflammation will be performed on blood, sputum and nasal fluid samples.
      Additional biological material (blood and nasal respiratory epithelia obtained from nasal
      scrapes) will be collected for transcriptomics (mRNA and miRNA gene expression analyses).
      Proteomic evaluation will be conducted on blood, sputum and nasal fluid samples. Blood
      samples will be collected for future genome sequencing (genomics) and lipidomics sampling.
