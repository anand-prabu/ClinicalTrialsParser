  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The occurrence of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (SBO) after allogeneic hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is considered to be a chronic pulmonary graft versus host
      disease (GVHD) that is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. The reported
      incidence of SBO varies from 6 to 26% of allogeneic HSC recipients and is usually diagnosed
      within 2 years after transplantation. The diagnosis of SBO relies on the occurrence of a new
      airflow obstruction identified during pulmonary function testing, and the definition differs
      between studies. Currently, no curative immunosuppressive treatment is available, and recent
      data suggest that the use of these treatments, especially corticosteroids, should be limited
      because of their toxicity. The impairment of lung function parameters is likely caused by
      fibrous small airway lesions. Few data on the pathogenesis of SBO after allogeneic HSCT are
      available. Several hypotheses are based on the occurrence of SBO during chronic graft
      rejection after lung transplantation, which shares many clinical and histopathological
      similarities with SBO after allogeneic HSCT. One hypothesis is that the first step leading
      to SBO is lung epithelium injury. SBO is then identified as an alloimmune reaction with only
      one clearly identified risk factor: extrathoracic chronic GVHD. Due to their
      anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, recent data suggest that low-dose
      macrolides may be effective at preventing SBO after lung transplants. This well-tolerated
      treatment may be useful for preventing SBO after allogeneic HSCT.

      The objective of this Phase 3 multicentre randomized, double-blinded, clinical trial is to
      evaluate the efficacy of azithromycin in preventing BO syndrome after allogeneic HSCT in
      patients with malignant hematological diseases.
