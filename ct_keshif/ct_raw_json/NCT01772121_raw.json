Characterization of HCV and HBV viral genotypes and sub-types across\n      different geographic regions will allow for an exploration of associations between host and\n      viral genotypes. Another objective of this study is to identify co-morbid illness and\n      metabolic factors that are associated with chronic liver disease due to viral hepatitis.\n      Finally, this survey will explore patient awareness of their disease, risk factors for\n      disease progression, and their treatment options"
