Preliminary data\n      from the only investigators who regularly provide clinical care to children who\n      lived/attended school near the WTC site identified decrements in spirometry associated with\n      dust cloud exposure, and a remarkably high frequency of cardiometabolic risk factors.\n      Findings from this clinically, self-selected population cannot be extrapolated to the entire\n      population of children who were exposed to the disaster but nonetheless suggest that further\n      study is warranted of the possible metabolic and cardiovascular consequences of WTC\n      exposures. If associated with WTC exposures in a larger, more representative sample, two new\n      and innovative techniques, oscillometry and pulse wave velocity assessment, hold great\n      promise for earlier detection of WTC-related pulmonary and cardiometabolic disease, for whom\n      dietary, environmental and medication interventions may prevent disease progression in later\n      life.\n\n      The study will recruit 225 adolescents who respond to the WTC Health Registry (WTCHR), the\n      most representative pediatric population and best-characterized from an environmental\n      exposure standpoint.  Connecting the study to the WTCHR also presents efficiency of federal\n      resource utilization, providing more objective clinical data to support self-reported\n      findings of increased persistent respiratory symptoms captured by the WTCHR, thereby\n      improving reliability of the registry data.  We will compare pulmonary and cardiometabolic\n      outcomes to carefully matched (age, race/ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status) and\n      unexposed control (not resident/attending school south of Houston Street on September 11,\n      2001) populations from NYU School of Medicine affiliated primary care (private and public\n      clinics)."
