For some\n      patients with > grade 2 toxicity, it may be necessary to hold the thalidomide dose until\n      improvement of the side effect with subsequent resumption of the dose after dose reduction\n      as outlined above.\n\n      Dexamethasone 20mg/m2 each morning after breakfast on days 1-4, 9-12, 17-20, with a repeat\n      cycle after a 1-2 week rest period.  In case of partial remission, maintenance treatment\n      with thalidomide alone will be continued for as long as remission is sustained at a dose\n      free of side effects.\n\n      For patients achieving CR, consolidation with thalidomide-dexamethasone for 4-6 months\n      followed by follow-up without maintenance treatment.  No maximum trial period is planned.\n\n      At relapse patients may be reinitiated on the original thalidomide-pulse dexamethasone\n      program and responding patients may be maintained on thalidomide alone (CR) or daily\n      thalidomide and dexamethasone (days 1-4) until relapse.\n\n      Patients who experience significant toxicity (grade 2 or more) at any time during therapy\n      will receive a lower dose after treatment is interrupted.\n\n      In  an attempt to avoid deep venous thrombosis, all patients for whom anticoagulation is not\n      contraindicated will be offered therapeutic anticoagulation (INR 1.5-2.5) with coumadin or\n      therapeutic doses of low molecular weight heparin.\n\n      Patients must be willing to return for evaluation every 4 weeks since thalidomide may only\n      be prescribed for 28 day intervals."
