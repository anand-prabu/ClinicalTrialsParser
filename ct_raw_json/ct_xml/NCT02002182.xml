  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Squamous cell carcinoma is the most frequently occurring malignant tumor of the head and
      neck and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.  More than 90% of HNSCCs
      originate from the mucosal linings of the oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx.

      Currently 60-80% of oropharyngeal cancer is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV),
      particularly the so-called &quot;high-risk&quot; oncogenic HPV16 and HPV18 genotypes. While patients
      with HPV+ tumors typically have an excellent response to surgical or radiation-based
      therapy6,7, treatment can be associated with significant short- and long-term toxicity, and
      it is not yet known whether patients with HPV+ OPSCCA have better long-term control. Thus,
      approaches which target the unique biology of HPV-infected cancer cells, such as therapeutic
      vaccination, are attractive strategies for potentially de-escalating XRT and chemo/XRT
      regimens (and thus decreasing toxicity) and enhancing long-term disease control.

      Preventive and therapeutic vaccines targeting HPV have been developed in an effort to tip
      the immunologic balance towards beneficial immune activation.  This is an
      investigator-initiated prospective clinical study of patients with stage II-IV squamous cell
      carcinoma of the oropharynx (OPSCC) who are to undergo ablative transoral robotic surgery
      (TORS). We propose to test the hypothesis that the listeria-based HPV vaccine ADX11-001
      induces circulating and tumor-infiltrating antigen-specific T cells in HPV16+ oropharyngeal
      cancer patients undergoing TORS resection. The results of this trial will assess the ability
      of ADX11-001 vaccination to induce a robust HPV-specific cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) response
      in the blood and tumor.

      This is an investigator-initiated prospective clinical study of patients with stage I-IV
      squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (OPSCC) who are to undergo ablative transoral
      robotic surgery (TORS). The investigators propose to test the hypothesis that the
      listeria-based HPV vaccine ADX11-001 induces circulating and tumor-infiltrating
      antigen-specific T cells in HPV16+ oropharyngeal cancer patients undergoing TORS resection.
      The results of this trial will assess the ability of ADX11-001 vaccination to induce a
      robust HPV-specific cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) response in the blood and tumor.

      ADXS11-001 (ADXS-HPV) is a live attenuated Listeria monocytogenes (Lm)-LLO immunotherapy
      developed for the treatment of HPV-associated dysplasia and malignancy. ADXS11-001 is
      bioengineered to secrete an antigen-adjuvant fusion (tLLO-E7) protein consisting of a
      truncated fragment of the listeriolysin (tLLO) fused to HPV16 E7. The proposed mechanism of
      action for ADXS11-001 is stimulation of the immune system to specifically target tumors or
      dysplastic cells that express the tumor associated antigen (HPV 16-E7) or homologous
      antigens (such as HPV18 E7).

      The use of live attenuated, bioengineered, bacteria is a different way to approach cancer
      immunotherapy than those based upon synthetic chemistry, cellular therapy, or antibody based
      agents. Using this novel platform technology, the activation of an immune response to live
      bacteria appears to be more complex and comprehensive. Lm-LLO immunotherapies generate a
      strong innate and adaptive cellular immune response and invoke pathogen associated immune
      mechanisms [7-10]. Advaxis Lm-LLO immunotherapies are comprised of highly attenuated strains
      of Lm bioengineered to secrete tumor associated antigen(s) of interest fused to a truncated
      and inactive fragment of the Lm protein listeriolysin O (tLLO). ADXS11-001 exhibits an
      estimated 4 log reduction in virulence when compared to wt-Lm.

      The mechanism of attenuation for ADXS-HPV is partly due to incorporation of a defective prfA
      virulence gene transcription activator, with allogeneic complementation and potential
      metabolic burden due to the expression of fusion protein tLLO-E7. LLO appears to have
      evolved as an innate target of the immune system, stimulates many potentially therapeutic
      immune responses by itself and can act as an adjuvant independent of the microbe. By using
      truncated LLO as part of the fusion protein along with an antigen, the bioengineered Lm
      construct secretes combined antigen-adjuvant directly within the phagolysosome and cytoplasm
      of APC.

      Lm is actively phagocytosed by APCs, and unlike other intracellular bacteria, can escape
      into the cytoplasm of the host cell by disrupting the phagosomal membrane via LLO (Figure
      1). Since Lm is a Gram-positive organism it does not contain/express LPS endotoxin. Humoral
      immunity does not play a major role in combating Lm infections as Lm quickly leaves the
      circulation and becomes an intracellular infection. Consequently, Lm predominantly
      stimulates a cellular immune response, and does not stimulate much antibody formation.
      Peptides derived from Lm in the phagolysosome and the cytosol can be presented by both the
      MHC Class I and Class II pathways, inducing both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. Further
      details about the design and production of ADXS11-001 are found in the Investigator's
      Brochure.

      ADXS11-001 is currently being evaluated in a number of HPV-induced cancers and precancers,
      including: cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/3, recurrent/refractory cervical
      cancer, anal cancer, and HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer. In nonclinical studies,
      ADXS11-001 was found to cause the therapeutic regression of tumors that express the HPV16-E7
      antigen. The reduction in tumor growth with ADXS11-001 treatment was directly associated
      with the induction of E7 specific immune responses. Both CD4 and CD8 T cell responses
      elicited by ADXS11-001 treatment were found to be essential for tumor regression. Additional
      mechanistic studies show that treatment with Lm-LLO immunotherapies cause both an
      infiltration of T cells and a reduction in suppressive cells such as regulatory T cells
      (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in the tumor microenvironment. These
      effects are localized to the tumor as there is no effect on immune suppressive cells in the
      peripheral organs such as spleen or lymph nodes.

      TRANSORAL ROBOTIC SURGERY (TORS) - A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO PROFILE THE TUMOR IMMUNE
      MICROENVIRONMENT (TIME) Increasing evidence suggests that the tumor immune microenvironment
      (TIME) of head and neck cancer is immunosuppressive, and that tumor-mediated
      immunosuppression may play a unique role in HPV-associated head and neck cancer. The TIME
      includes both anti-tumor effector cells (CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, CD4+ helper T cells,
      natural killer [NK] cells) and regulatory/suppressive immunocytes such as regulatory T cells
      (Treg) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). Other factors, such as local
      concentrations of cytokines and chemokines also play a role in determining the TIME. The
      balance of effector and regulatory cells determines whether an individual TIME is associated
      with productive anti-tumor immunity or localized immunosuppression and unrestrained tumor
      growth. While the majority of tumor vaccine studies examine circulating antigen-specific T
      cell responses, these responses do not always correlate with infiltration of
      antigen-specific T cells into the tumor and objective tumor responses,

      Robotic resection of oropharyngeal cancer is a treatment modality, pioneered at the Mount
      Sinai School of Medicine and other institutions. Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) is
      intended to minimize or avoid morbidity of radiation therapy or chemo-radiation by
      completely removing the tumor in three dimensions with negative histological margins, thus
      allowing de-escalation of adjuvant therapy in some patients and sparing adjuvant therapy
      altogether in others. When clinically indicated, a neck dissection is performed
      simultaneously. TORS is FDA approved for head and neck cancer, and considered standard of
      care therapy of OPSCC in appropriate patients.

      An important distinction between TORS and definitive chemoradiation as treatment for
      oropharyngeal tumors is that only TORS yields a pathological specimen which can be used to
      provide postoperative risk-stratification and guide the use of adjuvant therapy. The
      pathological specimen also permits evaluation of the response of tumor biomarkers and the
      TIME following a course of preoperative (also described as &quot;neoadjuvant&quot;) treatment. TORS
      resection of oropharyngeal cancer provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the ability of
      vaccination to induce an immune response in the tumor and draining lymph nodes.
