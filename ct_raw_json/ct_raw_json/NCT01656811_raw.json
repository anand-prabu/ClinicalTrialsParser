During the single-blind period, rescue medication\n      consisted of racemic albuterol MDI (90 mcg per actuation) for all subjects.  During the\n      double-blind period, rescue medication consisted of double-blind levalbuterol MDI (45 mcg\n      per actuation) for all subjects in the levalbuterol treatment groups or double-blind racemic\n      albuterol MDI (90 mcg per actuation) for all subjects in the racemic albuterol and placebo\n      treatment groups.The study consisted of two periods, an optional follow-up visit, and a\n      final telephone evaluation. This study was previously conducted by Sepracor Inc. In October\n      2009, Sepracor Inc. was acquired by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010,\n      Sepracor Inc's name was changed to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc."
