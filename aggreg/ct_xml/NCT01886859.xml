      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when given
      together with ibrutinib in treating patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may
      stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Ibrutinib
      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Giving lenalidomide together with ibrutinib may be an effective treatment for chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenalidomide when
      used in combination with ibrutinib in adults with relapsed and refractory chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the response rate and response duration in relapsed and refractory CLL/SLL
      patients with ibrutinib and lenalidomide.

      II. To characterize the plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction between ibrutinib and
      lenalidomide.

      III. To explore whether pharmacogenetic studies can predict response, resistance or toxicity
      to ibrutinib and lenalidomide.

      IV. To explore the ability of ibrutinib to occupy its targets (Bruton's tyrosine kinase
      [BTK] in B-cells and interleukin-2 inducible kinase [ITK] in T-cells), and whether
      co-administration with lenalidomide influences this binding.

      V. To explore the early and late immunologic consequences of combining ibrutinib with
      lenalidomide in relapsed and refractory CLL.

      VI. To explore the impact of ibrutinib and lenalidomide on ras homolog family member H
      (RhoH) expression and whether baseline RhoH expression predicts outcomes with this regimen.

      VII. To explore mechanisms of resistance to ibrutinib and lenalidomide. VIII. To explore the
      influence of traditional and new CLL/SLL clinical and laboratory prognostic factors on
      response to ibrutinib and lenalidomide.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide.

      Patients receive a run-up course of ibrutinib orally (PO) daily on days 1-28. Patients then
      receive ibrutinib and lenalidomide orally (PO) daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 12 courses,
      patients who have achieved complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi),
      nodular partial remission (PR), partial remission or who have stable disease will
      discontinue lenalidomide and continue ibrutinib.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
