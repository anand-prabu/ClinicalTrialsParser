            "textblock": "The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has specific rules generic drug\n      companies must follow to get a generic copy of a seizure medication approved. Currently, the\n      FDA approves generic drugs by requiring studies on normal volunteers who don't have epilepsy\n      and who take just one dose of the generic drug followed by a series of blood tests. Some\n      people with epilepsy and their physicians have complained about side effects or loss of\n      seizure control when taking generic drugs, but no one knows if these complaints are truly\n      because of problems with the generic drugs.\n\n      When the FDA tests generic copies of lamotrigine (LTG), the blood levels measured after\n      volunteers receive the generic lamotrigine tablets are allowed to fall within a specific\n      range. This research will test whether two different manufacturer's generic lamotrigine,\n      that fall in different parts of that range, perform in a similar way when given to people\n      with epilepsy every day over a several week period. The two products will be called GENERIC\n      A and  GENERIC B.\n\n      The generic forms of the study drug  lamotrigine to be tested in this study are approved by\n      the FDA for the treatment of seizures."

Subjects will be randomized according to a sealed allocation list that\n      will be balanced for sequence and provided to each site prior to the first subject\n      enrollment. Subjects that withdraw prior to completing the second period will be replaced in\n      a randomized manner.  The randomization list will be generated by the study statistical\n      group. There are four test periods in two sequences for a sequence-randomized study. During\n      two test periods subjects will receive twice daily dosing of the \"low\" generic product and\n      during the other two periods subjects will receive twice daily dosing of the \"high\" generic\n      product. Each subject will return at the end of the 14+/-1 day stable dosing period for an\n      in-facility 12-hour pharmacokinetic (PK) session to collect samples to determine Cmax and\n      AUCs (area under curve). Each in-facility pharmacokinetic testing will be separated by a\n      14+/-1 day stable dosing period. A final follow-up phone evaluation will be conducted 12-16\n      days (target 14 days) after the last dose of study medication. A single make-up period will\n      be permitted if there are issues during any single period. During the study the subjects\n      will continue their usual concomitant medications, including AEDs (anti epilepsy drugs),\n      without change.\n\n      Investigators will compare the AED levels as measured by Cmax and AUC in each group using\n      average bioequivalence (ABE) and individual bioequivalence (IBE) criteria. Average\n      bioequivalence will be established if the 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean of\n      Cmax and AUCs for the most disparate generic products compared to each other are entirely\n      within the 80%-125% range (the FDA criteria for bioequivalence) using the two one-sided\n      standard analyses. Otherwise the products will be considered to not be bioequivalent.\n\n      Study Population: Approximately 36 subjects (30 subjects to completion).\n\n      Number of centers: 3 sites enrolling approximately 12 subjects each.\n\n      Duration of study: Approximately 1 year."

Subjects will be\n             responsible to supply all of their concomitant medications (except for the study\n             medication, lamotrigine).\n\n         10. Willing to stay approximately 14 hours in the research facility on four separate\n             occasions for pharmacokinetic testing.\n\n         11.

In\n             the event of difficulty with the catheter or by subject preference, samples may be\n             drawn by venipuncture. The outpatient portion consists of morning trough levels\n             within +/-1 hour of the morning scheduled dose time on the 2 days prior to each\n             research facility PK admission drawn by venipuncture for each of the 4 periods. The\n             total amount of blood during each PK session will be equal to about 12 teaspoons\n             (58.5 milliliters). The total amount of blood drawn throughout the entire study will\n             be about 62 teaspoons (309.5 milliliters) or less. For reference, this amount is\n             approximately two-thirds of the quantity of blood drawn during a standard blood\n             donation by the Red Cross.\n\n         13.
