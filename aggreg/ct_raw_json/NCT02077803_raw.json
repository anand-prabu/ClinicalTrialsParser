The tablets will be of the same strength (50 mg CANA/1,000 mg MET XR) and will be\n      compared with equal doses of the individual drugs: canagliflozin (1 x 100 mg tablet) and\n      metformin XR (4 x 500 mg tablets). Thus, there will be 3 treatment periods in the study:\n      Treatment A: \"Reference\" treatment of individual components. Treatment B: CANA/MET XR FDC,\n      formulation 1; and Treatment C: CANA/MET XR FDC, formulation 2. Approximately 42 healthy\n      adult participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments groups, and then each\n      group will receive all three treatments in different sequences (3-way crossover). The study\n      will consist of 3 phases: a Screening Phase of approximately 3 weeks (Days -22 to -2), an\n      Open-Label Treatment Phase consisting of 3 single-dose Treatment Periods of 5 days each\n      (Days -1 through 4) separated by a washout of 10 to 14 days between Day 1 of each Treatment\n      Period, and a Follow-up Phase occurring 7 to 10 days after the last study-related procedure\n      on Day 4 of Treatment Period 3. The total duration of the study will be about 70 days for\n      each participant."
