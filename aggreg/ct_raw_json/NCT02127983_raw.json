Data for impact evaluation were obtained from routine patient registers in all the\n      health facilities and patients were blindly allocated to the respective clusters based on\n      residential address. Treatment initiation rates (expressed as incidence rate ratios) for TB\n      and Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) over the 12 months period were the primary outcome\n      measures for each of the studied conditions. Poisson regression models with robust standard\n      errors were used to assess the effectiveness of the intervention."
