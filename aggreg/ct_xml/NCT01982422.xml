  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study evaluating the relationship between prenatal nutrition and neural
      development in infants born to mothers with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
      We are hypothesizing that women randomized to a whole food, nutrient-dense diet during their
      3rd trimester of pregnancy will have infants with more advanced neural development as
      compared to infants born to mothers receiving standard-of-care treatment.

    <textblock>
      Pregnant women with ADHD will be recruited from the patient population at Oregon Health &amp;
      Science University (OHSU). They will be recruited during their 1st or 2nd trimester. After
      consent, baseline measures will be collected including height, weight, body composition
      measurements using calipers, 24-hour dietary recalls, and blood and urine samples. Women
      will also complete questionnaires regarding ADHD symptoms, stress, depression, and
      lifestyle. Women will be given a one-week food diary to fill out at home, which will be
      mailed in upon completion. Upon receipt of the food diary, women will be randomized into
      either a nutrition intervention group or a standard-of-care group. Women who are randomized
      to the intervention group will receive individual nutritional counseling every 2 weeks
      during their 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Before delivery, the baseline measures described
      above will again be collected. At delivery, placenta and cord blood samples will be taken.
      After birth, the infant will undergo an MRI between 2 and 5 weeks of age. The scan is
      completed while the baby sleeps, and special ear protection is worn to limit sleep
      disruption from the noise of the MRI. When the infant is 3 months old, mothers will complete
      questionnaires about infant feeding, sleep and behavior.
