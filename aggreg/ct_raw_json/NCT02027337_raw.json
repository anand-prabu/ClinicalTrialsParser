Half of\n      the women of each arm (group) receive only combined oral contraceptives (COC), other women\n      receive combined oral contraceptives and antioxidant complex Selmevit.\n\n      The blood tests conduct on 19-21 days of the menstrual cycle before COC use (control group)\n      or on 19-21 days of COC use after 1, 3, 6 and 12 cycles.\n\n      Also we investigate subjective tolerability, therapeutic effects, menstrual cycle control\n      and adverse effects of COCs in women that have or have no antioxidant complex Selmevit"
