Treating physicians will opt on which exogenous gonadotropins should be used\n      according to the patient's profile and preference and can include either recombinant\n      follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) or highly purified urinary human menopausal gonadotropin\n      (HP-HMG). Ovarian stimulation will commence after it is confirmed that the patient is not\n      pregnant and has basal levels of oestradiol, progesterone, FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH).\n      The stimulation will be monitored simultaneously by pelvic ultrasound and hormonal analysis\n      (oestradiol, progesterone), starting on day 6 of stimulation and then every 1 to 3 days,\n      according to the individual endocrine profile and follicular development.\n\n      Final oocyte maturation will be triggered with either 5000/10000 IU of human menopausal\n      human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or 150 IU of recombinant hCG when more than 2 follicles\n      of \u226517 mm are present. Oocyte retrieval will be performed 36 hours after hCG administration\n      under either local anaesthesia with analgesic premedication or general anaesthesia,\n      according to patient preference.\n\n      IVF or IVF/intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI) will be performed, using the specimen\n      of sperm made available by the male progenitor on the day of oocyte retrieval. According to\n      embryo quality, embryo transfer to the uterine cavity will be performed on either the 3rd or\n      5th day of development under ultrasound guidance whenever possible. Following embryo\n      transfer, luteal support will be provided with vaginally administered progesterone 200 mg\n      tid.\n\n      For clarity, cycle cancelation is defined as any interruption of the ART process that occurs\n      before fresh embryo transfer. Cycle cancelation will occur a) upon patient request, b) if\n      inadequate follicular development occurs, c) if no embryo is available for transfer."
