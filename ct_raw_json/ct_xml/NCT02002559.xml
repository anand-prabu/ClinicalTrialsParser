      This study aimed to compare Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) against Lugol chromoendoscopy for
      diagnosis of early esophageal cancers among high risk patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators recruited consecutive patients with head and neck cancers, history of
      squamous esophageal cancers treated by chemoradiotherapy or endoscopic resection. Endoscopic
      surveillance first started with NBI for detection and characterization of early esophageal
      cancers through observation of abnormal intrapapillary capillary loops (IPCL). Superficial
      esophageal neoplasia were diagnosed by IPCL Type IV, V1,V2 and Vn. Lugol chromoendoscopy
      would be performed subsequently and suspicious neoplasia were classified as understain or
      unstain lesions. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of NBI were compared
      to Lugol chromoendoscopy with histology serving as a gold standard.
