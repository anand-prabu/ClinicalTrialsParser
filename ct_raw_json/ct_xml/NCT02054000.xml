      The goal of this study was to evaluate the acute effect of intracoronary administration of
      tirofiban on no-reflow phenomenon in patients with STEMI and occurrence of no-reflow
      phenomenon undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The no-reflow phenomenon is one of the most common causes of adverse cardiovascular events
      in patients with ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI). Re-canalization of infarct
      related arterial (IRA) flow related to better ventricular performance and lower mortality
      rate in patients with STEMI. In addition, no-reflow phenomena may limit the benefits of
      re-canalization of the IRA.

      In recent years, many mechanical or pharmacological treatment strategies including
      adjunctive administration of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPI) have been proposed in
      patients with STEMI. Although current guidelines recommend that small molecule GPI should be
      administered as an upstream bolus followed by a continuous infusion in patients with STEMI,
      changes in clinical practice may obviate the need for GPI dosage or routes in current
      practice. Previous studies have shown that intravenous and intracoronary administration of
      GPI improve the prognosis and significantly reduce mortality in patients with STEMI.
      Recently, the Ongoing Tirofiban in Myocardial infarction Evaluation-2 (ON-TIME 2) trial
      found that the use of tirofiban started during the pre-hospital phase as upstream therapy
      for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and continued for up to 18 hours
      infusion after the procedure showed an improvement in the markers of reperfusion.
      Additionally, a reduction was demonstrated in the death in recurrent myocardial infarction
      in urgent target vessel revascularization and thrombotic bailout. However, in the current
      literature there are insufficient data regarding the role of intracoronary administration of
      GPI inhibitors in patients with STEMI who developed the no-reflow phenomenon. The goal of
      this study was to evaluate the acute effect of intracoronary administration of tirofiban on
      no-reflow phenomenon in patients with STEMI and occurrence of no-reflow phenomenon
      undergoing primary PCI.
