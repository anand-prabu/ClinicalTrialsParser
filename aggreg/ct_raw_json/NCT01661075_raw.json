The participants will also answer questionnaires about their daily lives\n      and cognitive tests. If the participant has had a mTBI they will complete questionnaires\n      about symptoms from their injury and may perform an additional IMPACT test which is a\n      computerized cognitive tests used by coaches, athletic trainers and managing physicians.\n\n      Along with the clinical balance tests and questionnaires, the project will use a small\n      sensor placed on the waist to detect sway during quiet stance. An automatic analysis will\n      occur which will provide us with immediate feedback on how stable the participant is during\n      testing."
