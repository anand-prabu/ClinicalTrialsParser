            "textblock": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been established as an important\n      therapeutic option for patients with a variety of inherited metabolic disorders (IMD). The\n      potential life-threatening complications of conventional myeloablative HSCT have limited its\n      application.  Additionally, conventional HSCT is only available to the small minority of\n      medically suitable candidates who have histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical\n      siblings to donate bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood stem cells.\n\n      Donor mobilized peripheral blood stem cells or bone marrow will be processed via a novel\n      technology to deplete mature immune cells while retaining hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and\n      graft facilitating cells (FC).\n\n      A now-standard reduced intensity, nonmyeloablative recipient conditioning regimen will be\n      used to promote mixed allogeneic chimerism, thereby significantly reducing morbidity and\n      mortality.\n\n      These two enhancements are intended to significantly improve the benefit:risk ratio of HSCT\n      for patients with IMDs. If successful, transplantation will become a more feasible option\n      for patients without HLA-identical siblings to donate stem cells, and could be offered to\n      patients early in disease progression.\n\n      The objective for the study is to establish chimerism following reduced intensity\n      conditioning with no grade III/IV graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The primary endpoint we\n      will follow is production of the missing enzyme at \u2265 10% of the normal level at day 180\n      post-transplant as for investigational new drug (IND) 14070. This expanded access protocol\n      details the approach to providing a second dose of the product."

Patient, and parent, or legal guardian must have given written informed consent\n             according to FDA guidelines.\n\n          3. Patient must have a minimum life expectancy of at least 6 months.\n\n          4. Female patients of childbearing potential cannot be pregnant or\n             lactating/breast-feeding and must be either surgically sterile, postmenopausal (no\n             menses for the previous 12 months), or must be practicing an effective method of\n             birth control as determined by the investigator (e.g., oral contraceptives, double\n             barrier methods, hormonal injectable or implanted contraceptives, tubal ligation, or\n             partner with vasectomy).\n\n          5. Recipient screening to include glomerular filtration rate (GFR), chest X-ray (CXR),\n             hepatic and renal chemistries, coagulation studies, pulmonary function testing, and\n             ECHO if clinically relevant, chimerism testing, type and screen, and enzyme levels\n             within 30 days of retransplant.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Uncontrolled seizures, apnea, evidence of recurrent or uncontrolled aspiration, or\n             need for chronic mechanical ventilation.\n\n          2. Subject must not have had previous radiation therapy that would preclude total body\n             irradiation (TBI) (as determined by radiation therapist)\n\n          3. Uncontrolled infection or severe concomitant diseases, which in the judgment of the\n             Principal Investigator, could not tolerate reduced intensity transplantation.\n\n          4. Subject with a positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody test result\n\n          5. Subject who are pregnant, as indicated by a positive serum human chorionic\n             gonadotropin (HCG) test\n\n          6. Subject whose only donor is pregnant at the time of intended transplant\n\n          7.

Patient that have any comorbid condition which, in the view of the Principal\n             Investigators, renders the patient at too high a risk from treatment complications\n             and regimen related morbidity/mortality.\n\n         10.
