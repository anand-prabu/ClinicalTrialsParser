  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the Study of Women, Infant Feeding and Type 2 Diabetes after GDM pregnancy
      (SWIFT) is to determine whether exposure to prolonged, intensive lactation, as compared to
      formula feeding, reduces the 2-year incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus among 1,035 women
      with a recent GDM pregnancy. The study will also examine whether lactation intensity and
      duration have persistent favorable effects on blood glucose, insulin resistance, weight
      gain, change in waist circumference, and adiposity during the two-year postpartum period.
      SWIFT is a prospective, longitudinal observational study in women at high risk for
      conversion to diabetes and prediabetes during midlife.

    <textblock>
      SWIFT is a prospective, observational, longitudinal cohort study of 1,035 women diagnosed
      with GDM during pregnancy who delivered a singleton, live born infant of at least 35 weeks
      gestation at a Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospital from 2008 to 2011, and were
      enrolled into the study within 6-9 weeks postpartum.  The SWIFT cohort is racially and
      ethnically diverse with 35% Asian, 9% Black, 31% Hispanic, 23% White, and 2% other race
      groups.  Study enrollment began in mid 2008 and was completed in December 2011, although
      annual follow up exams will continue through December 2013.  Women enrolled into the study
      met eligibility criteria, and  provided written, informed consent for all study procedures
      prior to the assessments at the in-person exam at 6-9 weeks postpartum (study baseline).
      Participants were screened for type 2 diabetes at enrollment and thereafter at annual exams
      during the subsequent two years using the 2-hour 75 gram Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT).
      The primary outcome is progression to glucose intolerance, defined as incident diabetes by
      ADA criteria within 2 years post-delivery based on the 2-hour 75 gram OGTT results at one
      year and two years postpartum.  The primary exposure is lactation intensity and duration
      assessed from in-patient hospital delivery records, at annual postpartum in-person exams,
      telephone calls at 1 month postpartum, and via self-administered monthly mailed surveys
      (from 3 to 11 months postpartum).  Data collection after GDM diagnosis started in late
      gestation throughout the two-year postpartum period, and it was accomplished via electronic
      medical records for perinatal course (e.g., GDM severity and treatment, gestational weight
      gain) and for maternal and newborn outcomes, telephone contacts, mailed infant feeding
      diaries and surveys, self- and interviewer-administered questionaires at in-person exams.
      Maternal characteristics assessed for this study included breastfeeding intensity and
      duration, infant feeding practices, sociodemographics, medical and reproductive history,
      medication use, recurrence of GDM, lifestyle behaviors, depression, and sleep habits. SWIFT
      also collected these data prospectively via monthly mailings and during annual in-person
      exams.  In addition, trained research assistants measured anthropometry and body composition
      via bioelectrical impedance according to standardized protocols, processed and stored
      biospecimens, and collected other data via self- and interviewer-administered questionnaires
      at each in-person exam.

    <description>The study cohort includes women who had gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in their index pregnancy for study enrollment. There are two pre-defined groups: 1) women who breastfeed intensively during the first 4 months postpartum, and 2) women who mostly fed formula during the first 4 months postpartum. The study enrolled women into these pre-defined groups, but some women transitioned into mixed feeding groups after enrollment.</description>

        SWIFT participants were recruited from 13 Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC)
        medical facilities throughout the region. Participating field sites for data collection
        were located within the three primary areas including:

        North area: Sacramento, South Sacramento, and Roseville Medical Centers, and Rancho
        Cordova, Elk Grove, Point West, and Folsom Medical Offices; East area: Division of
