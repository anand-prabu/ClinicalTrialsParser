OCT endpoints are:\n      (1) Subclinical intra-stent thrombus, defined as a mass protruding to the lumen with\n      significant attenuation, and respectively (2) endothelial coverage, expressed as % of struts\n      without coverage and % of stent length containing non-covered struts. The study is powered\n      for OCT endpoints, which are likely to reach significance at the level P < 0.05 even at a\n      follow-up drop-out rate up to 10%."
