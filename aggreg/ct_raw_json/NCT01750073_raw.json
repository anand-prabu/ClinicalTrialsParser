Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as\n      paclitaxel and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,\n      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such\n      as trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor\n      cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing\n      substances to them. Giving combination chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab before\n      surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be\n      removed"

To evaluate the toxicities and tolerability of a neoadjuvant dose-dense regimen\n      cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab/radiation therapy (as clinically\n      indicated) in patients with newly diagnosed stage T1cN0 and II-III breast cancer; followed\n      by maintenance trastuzumab in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive OR\n      Adriamycin (doxorubicin hydrochloride) followed by radiation therapy (RT) in stage II-III\n      triple negative HER2 (-), estrogen receptor (ER) (-), progesterone receptor (PR) (-) stage\n      T1cN0 and II-III breast cancer patients.\n\n      II. To determine the pathological complete response rate (pCR) of this treatment regimen.\n\n      III. To identify possible gene expression profile signatures from whole genome array\n      analysis that correlate with clinical response/resistance to chemotherapy as measured by\n      pathologic complete response rate (pCR).\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      NEOADJUVANT THERAPY: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and\n      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 1. Patients with HER2-positive cancer also receive\n      trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 6 courses\n      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients without metastasis\n      undergo mastectomy or breast conserving surgery 4-8 weeks later.\n\n      POST-SURGERY/SYSTEMIC THERAPY:\n\n      HER2-POSITIVE PATIENTS: Patients receive standard radiation therapy. Patients also receive\n      trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 13\n      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      ER/PR POSITIVE PATIENTS: Patients receive standard adjuvant hormonal or endocrine therapy.\n\n      STAGE T1cN0 TRIPLE NEGATIVE PATIENTS: Patients receive standard radiation therapy.\n\n      STAGE II-III TRIPLE NEGATIVE PATIENTS: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15\n      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive standard radiation\n      therapy.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years."
