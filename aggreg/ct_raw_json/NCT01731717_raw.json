The study compares the SCM condition\n      (intervention group) to a control group receiving treatment as usual (cluster randomization\n      on the level of participating general practitioners). It is expected that the SCM condition\n      will show better results regarding reduction of mental symptoms, improvement of quality of\n      life, more efficient access to care and better cost-benefit ratio."
