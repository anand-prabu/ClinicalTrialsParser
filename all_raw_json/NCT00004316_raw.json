Patients with interstitial cystitis are\n      randomly assigned to 1 of 3 pain control therapies.\n\n      The first group is treated with capsaicin.  A second group is given individually titrated\n      doses of capsaicin:  the dose is increased as tolerated or until symptomatic response is\n      acceptable.  A control group receives a placebo.  Therapy for all groups is administered\n      intravesically every week for 5 weeks.\n\n      Patients with vulvar vestibulitis are randomly assigned to 1 of 2 pain control therapies.\n      One group applies topical capsaicin cream to the painful area 4 times a day for 6 weeks.\n      The dose is individually titrated if burning discomfort persists and the patient is\n      compliant with the application schedule.  The control group applies a placebo.\n\n      Patients with vulvar vestibulitis may continue or cross to capsaicin for 6 additional weeks."
