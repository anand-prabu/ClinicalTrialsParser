  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether a  program where a health coach works with participants on
      heart healthy behaviors and treatment of risk factors is coordinated with primary care can
      reduce overall heart disease risk in people with serious mental illness.

      The objective of this study is to perform a randomized clinical trial (IDEAL) to test a
      comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction program for persons with serious mental illness.
      This trial will enroll adult mental health consumers with at least one cardiovascular risk
      factor and randomize them to the 18-month IDEAL intervention or control. Intervention
      participants will receive individual cardiovascular risk reduction counseling, coordination
      with primary care providers to ensure appropriate management of risk factors, and
      collaboration with mental health staff and social supports to encourage and motivate
      participants to reach goals. All participants will be offered group exercise classes, and
      programs will be provided with instruction to provide more healthy meals. The primary
      outcome will be the change in estimated cardiovascular risk from the global Framingham Risk
      Score.
