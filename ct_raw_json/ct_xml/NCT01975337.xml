    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of kidney disease on the absorption,
      distribution, metabolism, and elimination of a single dose of alisporivir. The safety and
      tolerability of administering a single dose of alisporivir to patients with end stage renal
      disease will also be evaluated. Kidney disease is not expected to have a significant effect
      on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination, safety, or tolerability of
      alisporivir.
