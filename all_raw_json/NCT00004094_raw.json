Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus\n      radiation therapy in treating patients who have previously untreated advanced cancer of the\n      mouth, pharynx, or larynx."

Treatment repeats every 4\n      weeks for 2 courses.\n\n      At 1-2 weeks after completion of induction chemotherapy, patients receive oral hydroxyurea\n      every 12 hours on days 1-6, fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-5, radiotherapy twice\n      daily on days 1-5, and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 2. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks\n      for 5 courses.\n\n      Patients with residual nodal disease or initially staged nodal disease in the absence of\n      macroscopic residual disease undergo neck dissection after completion of chemoradiotherapy.\n      Patients with residual disease at the primary site undergo complete excision of disease.\n      Patients with disease progression or disease recurrence are considered for conventional\n      surgical management.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed every 3 months for 6 months, every 6 months for 1.5 years, and\n      then annually thereafter.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 2 months for 1 year, and then every 3 months\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
