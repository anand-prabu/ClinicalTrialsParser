Joint contractures limit the function of an elbow and are a\n      recognized complication that occurs often after a traumatic injury. The benefits of early\n      motion after injury has helped in preventing joint contractures but there are still several\n      patients that develop debilitating joint contractures. Current research suggests that mast\n      cells, which are found in the joint, are key in causing joint contractures. Research has\n      been done using a medication called Ketotifen. Ketotifen has been linked to stabilizing mast\n      cells and preventing the joint contracture. It is hoped that short-term use of this\n      medication after an injury will prevent the contracture from occurring."

Patients will\n      be required to take Ketotifen 5mg by mouth twice a day for 6 weeks or placebo twice a day by\n      mouth for 6 weeks. Neither the patient nor the physician caring for you will know if they\n      are taking Ketotifen or placebo. Sometimes this type of injury requires surgery. This study\n      will be inviting both patients that do and do not require surgery to participate.\n\n      A blood sample will be taken to measure complete blood count. This is to determine that the\n      patient does not have thrombocytopenia. If this condition is present, the patient will not\n      be invited to participate in the study. The treating physician will discuss this condition\n      with the patient. Also, at this time we will take a sample of blood to measure tryptase\n      (normally found in your body). We predict people with high levels of tryptase are more\n      likely to develop stiffening in the joint.\n\n      Patients will be asked to return for follow up visits 2, 6, 12, 24, and 52 weeks after\n      surgery or date of initial injury if surgery is not required. These visits are part of\n      normal care for this type of injury.\n\n      At the visit patients will be asked to do the following, some of which is not part of normal\n      care.\n\n      At each visit: Range of motion of the elbow will be assessed, DASH score will be completed-\n      form helping the research group understand the level of disability from this injury, X-rays\n      until the fracture is considered healed (this is normal treatment), SF12 - questionnaire\n      about how the patient is feeling and coping with their injury, Additional information will\n      be collected about how the injury is healing.\n\n      The patient will be required to have physiotherapy which is normal treatment for this\n      injury."
