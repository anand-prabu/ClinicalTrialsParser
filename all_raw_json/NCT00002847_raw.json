Patients are assessed for response approximately 2 months after initiating\n      therapy. Patients with stable or responding disease undergo a second course; those who\n      continue to respond may receive additional therapy provided toxicity is limited.\n\n      Patients are followed for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 14 patients will be entered."
