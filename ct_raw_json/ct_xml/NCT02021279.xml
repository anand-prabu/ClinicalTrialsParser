    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of MatriStem
      Pelvic Floor Matrix as compared to native tissue repair for the treatment of pelvic organ
      prolapse.  Patients are evaluated throughout a 3 year follow-up period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject's leading edge of POP is at or beyond the hymen.  At or beyond the hymen is
             defined as POP-Q scores of Ba ≥ 0 or Bp ≥ 0 or C ≥ 0 (for prolapse of the apical
             compartment alone) or C ≥ -½ total vaginal length (for a multi-compartment prolapse
             that includes the apical compartment).

          -  Subject is seeking surgical intervention for symptomatic POP, which is defined as
             experiencing symptoms of vaginal bulging or pelvic heaviness.  Vaginal bulge or
             pelvic heaviness will be considered present if a subject responds &quot;yes&quot; (≥1) to
             PFDI-20, question 3.

          -  Subject or subject's legally authorized representative is willing to provide written
             informed consent.

          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with the follow-up regimen.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a known hypersensitivity to porcine-based materials (relevant to subjects
             in MatriStem Pelvic Floor Matrix Group only).

          -  Subject is pregnant or plans to become pregnant during the study.

          -  Subject has an active or chronic systemic infection including any gynecologic
             infection, urinary tract infection (UTI), or tissue necrosis.

          -  Subject has a known neurologic or medical condition affecting bladder function (e.g.
             multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, or stroke with residual neurologic deficit).

          -  Subject has chronic systemic pain syndrome (e.g. fibromyalgia, painful bladder
             syndrome).

          -  Subject has a systemic connective tissue disease (e.g., scleroderma, systemic lupus
             erythematous (SLE), Marfans syndrome, Ehlers Danhlos, collagenosis, polymyositis or
             polymyalgia rheumatica).

          -  Subject has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM).

          -  Subject has a history of pelvic organ cancer (e.g. uterine, ovarian, bladder, or
             cervical).

          -  Subject has had prior or is currently undergoing radiation, laser therapy, or
             chemotherapy in the pelvic area.

          -  Subject has taken systemic steroids (within the last month), immunosuppressive or
             immunomodulatory treatment (within the last 3 months).

          -  Subject is seeking obliterative vaginal surgery as treatment for POP (colpoclesis).

          -  Subject is not able to conform to the modified dorsal lithotomy position.

          -  Subject is currently participating in or plans to participate in another device or
             drug study during this study.

          -  Subject is to planning to undergo concurrent surgical treatment of prolapse using
             mesh other than the MatriStem Pelvic Floor Matrix.
