            "textblock": "Bathing patients with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate-impregnated cloths (CHG) is an established\n      practice at Baycrest. Our previous studies have demonstrated strong MRSA-preventive\n      properties of CHG bathing practice - the rate of MRSA transmission on intervention units\n      dropped from 4.99 to 0.88 cases per 1,000 patient days - an overall rate reduction of 82%.\n\n      Although CHG will continue to be used as part of an established clinical practice in our\n      hospital, its impact on MRSA prevention merits further evaluation in complex continuing care\n      (CCC) settings endemic for MRSA. Investigators propose a cluster-randomized, prospective,\n      open-label, two-arm clinical trial (RCT) on three geographically separate, but otherwise\n      comparable, CCC units - one intervention unit using CHG, and two control units using\n      non-antiseptic cleanser. The RCT is expected to conclusively answer whether daily bathing\n      with CHG significantly reduces incidence of MRSA colonization.\n\n      By cluster randomization investigators imply randomly assigning interventions to the three\n      patient care units. Investigators propose randomization of the units as it is not feasible\n      to randomly assign the individual participants to intervention vs control arms.\n\n      For a meaningful interpretation of the RCT findings, patient populations on the three floors\n      will be compared at the beginning, during, and at the end of the study. The following\n      variables will be used to compare patient populations:\n\n        -  Colonization pressure (CP) is a measure of the MRSA reservoir on the unit. CP will be\n           calculated at the onset of the RCT and then bi-weekly (Number of MRSA patient-days \u00d7\n           100 \u00f7 Total Number of Patient Days).\n\n        -  Average Braden scale score (BSS) for patients on each unit is measured to predict a\n           pressure ulcer risk. It is one of the measures of patient's clinical complexity. It is\n           calculated by examining six patient criteria (sensory perception, skin moisture,\n           physical activity, mobility, nutrition, friction and shear). BSS will be calculated at\n           the onset of the RCT and then monthly.\n\n        -  Average Case Mix Index (CMI) is a value reflecting the daily relative weight of\n           resources used by an individual patient compared to a base resource level (the average\n           resource use of the patient population). The CMI value is not a dollar amount; rather\n           it is a relative value and an indirect marker of patient's clinical complexity. CMI\n           will be calculated at the onset of the RCT and then quarterly.\n\n      Patient information will be de-identified for privacy reasons, before analysis of the study\n      data - logistic regression, to compare the rates of MRSA incidence and time to MRSA\n      conversion on intervention and control units."
