Patients with no evidence of tumor\n      progression may receive additional courses of therapy.\n\n      Patients are followed for 2 weeks from the last dose or for a minimum of 30 days if they\n      withdraw due to an adverse event.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 13-37 patients will be accrued for this study."
