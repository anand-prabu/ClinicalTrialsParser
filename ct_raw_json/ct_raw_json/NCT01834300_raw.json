We will ensure participants are physically able to\n           embark on this by taking their medical history, physical examination and validated\n           questionnaire (PARQ). This program is for the benefit on the patients' long term\n           health.\n\n        2. MR imaging to assess fat: occassionally these may pick up anomalies which require\n           further investigation. A radiologist will screen the abdominal images and GP will be\n           informed on anything requiring further investigation.\n\n           No radiation is received during MR imaging.\n\n        3. Physiological studies: Patients will be asked to attend for 2 non-consecutive days\n           before and after the exercise intervention. Regular blood samples will be required as\n           apart of these investigations."
