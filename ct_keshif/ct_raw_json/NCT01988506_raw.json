Extensive biological- and\n      immune-monitoring pre- and post-IL2 will contribute (i) to define the common or distinct\n      processes responsible for the breakdown of immunological tolerance in these pathologies and\n      (ii) to discover potential biomarkers of the IL2 response."

            "textblock": "Protocol: TRANSREG is a multicentric, uncontrolled, open-label study, comparing biological\n      and clinical responses to the administration of low doses IL2 across 11 selected\n      pathologies: rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus,\n      psoriasis, Behcet's disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, Takayasu's disease, Crohn's disease,\n      ulcerative colitis, autoimmune hepatitis, and sclerosing cholangitis.Methods: Each patient\n      will receive 1MUI /day of IL2 from Day-1 to Day-5 (the induction period), and then every 2\n      weeks from Day-15 to Day-180 (the maintenance period). Patients will thereafter be followed\n      up for 2 months (Day-181-Day-240). For each pathology, 6 patients will be included at\n      Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re, Cochin and Saint Antoine hospitals in Paris. An interim analysis will be\n      performed in each pathology group when the first six patients have received at least 3\n      months of treatment. In those pathology groups in which a Treg response will be documented,\n      six additional patients will be included. In total, a minimum of 66 patients and up to 132\n      patients will be enrolled in this study. Primary efficacy endpoint is the Treg response at\n      Day-8. Secondary endpoints are:- the Treg response during the maintenance period,- the\n      changes in markers of inflammation - the clinical response, evaluated by means of global\n      generic scales [Clinical Global Impression severity scale (CGI-sev) and Clinical Global\n      Impression efficacy index (CGI-eff)] as well as specific clinical and biological evaluations\n      for each disease, - the frequency of relapses, - the assessment of quality of life (scale\n      EuroQL-5).Expected Results: TRANSREG will define which patients respond to IL2, whether per\n      pathology or according to pre-treatment phenomics, allowing to guide further clinical\n      development of low dose IL2 in autoimmune and auto-inflammatory diseases."
