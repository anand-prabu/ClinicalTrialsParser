It is not yet known whether\n      filgrastim or pegfilgrastim is more effective than standard treatment in preventing\n      neutropenia in women who are receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase IV trial to compare the effectiveness of filgrastim or\n      pegfilgrastim with that of standard treatment in preventing neutropenia in women who are\n      receiving chemotherapy after undergoing surgery for breast cancer."

Patients are stratified according to age\n      (60 and under vs over 60) and participating center.\n\n      Patients receive chemotherapy as per local practice. After the first neutropenic event,\n      patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) for 7 days beginning 2\n           days after the final dose in a course of adjuvant chemotherapy (e.g., beginning on day\n           3 for a course of chemotherapy administered on day 1 only OR beginning on day 10 for a\n           course of chemotherapy administered on days 1 and 8) OR a single dose of pegfilgrastim\n           SC administered approximately 24 hours after chemotherapy that is administered on day 1\n           only.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive standard conservative management. Patients are followed for up\n           to 10 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients will be accrued for this study within 7 years."
