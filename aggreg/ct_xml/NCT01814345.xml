  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer remains a major health  issue and a  leading cause of cancer death worldwide,
      although  the prevalence and mortality of  the disease have gradually decreased. The
      investigators have very few options for patients with advanced disease.

      The trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer (ToGA) trial, a pivotal randomized clinical trial of
      patients with HER-2 positive advanced, mostly metastatic, gastric cancer, proved the
      efficacy of  trastuzumab  (anti-Her 2 therapy)  in combination with chemotherapy.  The
      median overall  survival was  significantly prolonged   in  the  trastuzumab-containing arm
      (13.8 vs. 11.1 months; HR 0.74; p=0.0046) without unexpected  toxicity including cardiac
      events. The survival benefit was most pronounced in the subgroup of high HER-2/neu protein
      overexpression  (median overall  survival of 16 months). Only 20% of the patients screened
      and subsequently enrolled for this study were found to be HER2-positive when utilizing both
      immunohistochemistry and FISH. Her2 testing is recommended for all patients with advanced
      gastric cancers and type III oesophageal adenocarcinomas.

      Data on Indian patients is lacking. Hence, the investigators plan to test for Her 2 in 100
      patients with IHC and FISH in 2+ and 3+ patients.

      1. Study Objective/ Aims Aim: - Rate of Her 2 positivity in 100 consecutive gastric cancer
           patients Primary Objective

           Test for Her 2 in 100 consecutive gastric cancer patients Immuno-histochemistry will be
           done in all patients. Patients with 2 and 3+ IHC will also have FISH done.

        2. Study Design&amp; Methodology

           Patients will have the Her2 tested in 100 consecutive gastric cancer samples by
           immunohistochemistry and patients with 2+ and 3+ result will also have FISH done. This
           will not affect patient management

        3. Overview of Data collection Dr.Bhawna Sirohi the principal investigators will maintain
           and supervise data collection and maintaining records. The patient will be
           de-identified.

        4. Selection of Study Population

      Inclusion Criteria:

      100 consecutive  patients with gastric cancer who have a pathology specimen at TMH

      Exclusion Criteria:

      If histopathology blocks were not available

      5) Sample size 100 to be enrolled. Patient consent waiver applied for as this does not
      affect patient care 6) Statistical Analysis It is an Observational study so Results will be
      given as %age of total population.
