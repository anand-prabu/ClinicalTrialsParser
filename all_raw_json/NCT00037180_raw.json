The standard and approved treatment for patients\n      with metastatic colorectal cancer is repeated cycles of chemotherapy consisting of a\n      combination of irinotecan (also known as CPT-11, Camptosar), 5-fluorouracil (also known as\n      5FU), and leucovorin (also known as LV). Preclinical data from animal models suggest that\n      the investigational drug may offer an effective means for preventing CPT-11/5FU/LV-induced\n      diarrhea. It is also hypothesized that the investigational drug-mediated anti-angiogenesis\n      could induce a favorable tumor response."
