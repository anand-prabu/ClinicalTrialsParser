The investigators will\n           also obtain preliminary information about the efficacy of this treatment.\n\n        -  The participant will receive the study drug buparlisib once daily, by mouth, for 45\n           days. The participant will be given a study drug-dosing diary for each cycle.  It will\n           include special instructions for taking the study drug at home.\n\n        -  The investigators are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be\n           administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects, not everyone who\n           participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the study drug.  The\n           dose given will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the\n           study before and how well they have tolerated their doses.\n\n        -  All participants will receive weekly cisplatin injection. Cisplatin will be given\n           intra-venously (IV) on days: (1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36 and 43) at DFCI.\n\n        -  All participants will receive daily radiotherapy with intensity-modulated radiotherapy\n           (IMRT) for 7 weeks, delivered at DFCI. IMRT is a type of 3-dimensional radiation\n           therapy that uses computer-generated images to show the size and shape of the tumor.\n           Thin beams of radiation of different intensities are aimed at the tumor from many\n           angles. This type of radiation therapy reduces the damage to healthy tissue near the\n           tumor.\n\n        -  The investigators would like to keep track of  the participant's medical condition.\n           Follow-up will continue every 4 to 12 weeks after the end of treatment for the first\n           year and at the investigator's discretion thereafter."
