The existing restoration will not be removed. The surface of the existing restoration will be roughened with a Brasseler 8856 bur without extending to the surrounding enamel (except is the defect being repaired is adjacent to enamel). No accessory groves/pits for retention will be prepared. To repair the restoration, the surface will be etched using 35% phosphoric acid, and then 3M ESPE Scotchbond Universal Adhesive System followed by 3M ESPE Filtek Supreme Ultra Universal Restorative composite will be used as per the manufacturer's instructions."

The existing composite restoration will then be removed and the peripheral enamel beveled if not already beveled. To restore the tooth, the surface will be etched using 35% phosphoric acid, and then 3M ESPE Scotchbond Universal Adhesive System followed by 3M ESPE Filtek Supreme Ultra Universal Restorative composite will be used as per the manufacturer's instructions."
