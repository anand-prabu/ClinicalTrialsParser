      This is a 4 part study:

      Phase 1a. -fMRI (24 IU vs. 0 IU) -U54 HD079124-01, Phase 1b-eye-tracking(24 IU vs. 0 IU),
      Phase 2a. fMRI (8 IU vs. 40IU), Phase 2b. -eye-tracking (8IU vs. 40IU). Time course of
      effect will also be assessed within session.

      We hypothesize that intranasal oxytocin treatment of individuals with an autism spectrum
      disorder (ASD) will:

      Hypothesis 1a. will produce greater increases in VTA and NAc activation during social reward
      anticipation compared to placebo, providing evidence that OT increases activation in brain
      regions critical for social motivation. (NICHD funding for this section/aim- Dr. Gabriel
      Dichter -U54 HD079124-01)

      Hypothesis 1b. will spend proportionally more time attending to the social image on a screen
      vs. the non-social image compared to placebo.

      Hypothesis 2a.  will produce differential effects in VTA and NAc activation during social
      reward anticipation compared in 8 IU vs. 40 IU dose, providing evidence that OT
      dose-dependently increases activation in brain regions critical for social motivation.

      Hypothesis 2b. will deferentially attend to the social image on a screen vs. the non-social
      image compared in the 8 IU vs. 40 IU dose of oxytocin, providing evidence that OT
      dose-dependently changes the value of social stimuli.

    <description>Activation data will be analyzed using FEAT within FSL (Oxford University, U.K.).   Onset times of events will be used to model BOLD signal responses containing a regressor for each response type convolved with a double-γ function.  A priority region of interest will be the VTA and NAc which will be analyzed via anatomically defined ROI's.
Connectivity Analysis:Time series will be extracted from ROIs using FSL Featquery for each participant and averaged separately for each Treatment (OT, placebo) and Trial Type (rewarded, unrewarded) condition (seed and target regions will be functionally defined on the basis of task response).  Correlation coefficients will be transformed using a Fisher r-to z transformation. Mean z-transformed values will then be computed across participants and ROI pairs, and then converted back to correlation coefficients.</description>

    <description>The eye tracking task involves the participant looking at a series of images in which a person's face occupies ½ the screen and a complex object occupies the other half of the screen that are presented for ~20 seconds each on a computer monitor.  The participant is only told to look at the screen and sits approximately 18-24 inches in front of a computer monitor with built in cameras and lights to track eye movement. This is referred to as competitive attention task to social and nonsocial stimuli.  Eye tracking will be assessed via a Tobii 1750 eye tracker or via mobile eye tracking, immediately after the fMRI scan, participants will participate in a 10 min lab-based eye tracking task in which a series of paired social and nonsocial stimuli are displayed for 10 seconds.</description>

    <description>We plan to collect salivary at times that coincide with the administration of the fMRI task.

          -  Have a clinical diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder confirmed according to the
             Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS, Lord et al., 1989). Diagnosis may also be
             confirmed using the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R).

          -  Male or female of any race or ethnicity

          -  Ambulatory status (outpatient) at time of assent/consent

          -  Estimated IQ greater than or equal to 70 and capable of making an informed decision
             based on assessment of their understanding and judgment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of neurological injury: head trauma, poorly-controlled seizure disorder (i.e.
             seizure within the preceding six month period), stroke, prior neurosurgery, or under
             the care of a neurologist or neurosurgeon as determined by interview

          -  History of claustrophobia

          -  Implanted medical devices, implanted metal debris, shrapnel, certain tattoos, or
             permanent makeup that is contraindicated for MRI. Participants fill out a detailed
             questionnaire on the day of scanning to identify potential MRI risks

          -  Subjects with a medical condition that might interfere with the conduct of the study,
             confound interpretation of the study results, or endanger their own well-being. This
             includes, but is not limited to: Rett Syndrome, impairment of renal function,
             evidence or history of malignancy or any significant hematological, endocrine,
             cardiovascular (including any rhythm disorder or uncontrolled hypertension),
             respiratory, hepatic, or gastrointestinal disease

          -  Marked sensory impairment such as deafness or blindness that would interfere with the
             conduct of the study

          -  Pregnant or nursing because of the unknown effects of oxytocin to unborn babies
             and/or nursing infants. All females of child-bearing potential will be administered a
             serum pregnancy test at screening and at any point during the study at physician
             discretion. Refusal to undergo a pregnancy test will result in exclusion from the
             study. We will share results of a pregnancy test with the subject's legal guardian.

          -  Refusal to do pregnancy testing with understanding that guardian will be informed of
             positive test results

          -  Inability or refusal of sexually active female subjects (who have begun menses) to
             utilize two medically accepted barrier forms of birth control

          -  Use of hormonal birth control

          -  Subjects who have a history of an anaphylactic reaction from prior treatment with
             oxytocin (nasal spray)

          -  Inability of caretakers to speak English

          -  Absence of a consistent caretaker to report on symptoms

          -  Subjects who, in the Investigator's opinion, might not be suitable for the study
