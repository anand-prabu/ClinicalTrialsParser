Assess the safety of this gene therapy in these patients.\n\n      III. Assess the in vivo gene transfer of this vector in these patients.\n\n      IV.  Assess the CFTR gene expression and physiologic activity following gene transfer in\n      these patients.\n\n      V.

Patients then receive AAV-CFTR vector intranasally to the right or left\n      inferior turbinates and placebo to the other side of the nose.  The next day, patients\n      receive an endobronchial dose of AAV-CFTR vector to the superior segment of the right lower\n      lobe.\n\n      Cohorts of 2-4 patients each receive escalating doses of AAV-CFTR vector until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.  The MTD is defined as the dose level immediately\n      preceding the dose at which at least 2 subjects develop dose limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at day 10, then at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months."
