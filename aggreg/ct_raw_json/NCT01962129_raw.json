These results will make it possible, from patients who have been clearly\n      identified from a clinical, cytogenetic and molecular point of view, to determine a study\n      strategy in such patients. The data obtained will be used to guide clinical geneticists in\n      genetic counselling for patients and their families.\n\n      Identification of the molecular bases of the different OFD syndromes will make it possible\n      to determine whether or not they belong to the group of ciliopathies like type I OFD and to\n      understand their physiopathological bases.\n\n      This study will also make it possible to better characterise the phenotype of boys with\n      syndromic mental retardation related to the OFD1 gene and thus to define the clinical\n      criteria of the study of this gene in boys with mental retardation.\n\n      The complete absence of knowledge concerning the genetic bases of OFD syndromes, apart from\n      type I, the presence of a large collection of samples from patients with OFD syndrome at\n      Dijon CHU, the recognition of the diagnostic laboratory for syndromic OFD at the\n      international level as well as the technical platform and expertise in molecular cytogenetic\n      methods including CGH-array and molecular genetics (sequencing, quantitative PCR, fragment\n      analysis) at the Cytogenetics and Molecular Biology laboratories at Dijon CHU justify the\n      implementation of such a study in 2010."

Indeed, the blood samples of 65 patients have\n        been sent to us since 2002 for the study of the OFD l gene thanks to national and\n        international recruitment: 35 presented clinical signs more or less associated with a mode\n        of transmission suggesting OFD l syndrome and 30 presented other forms of OFD (OFDII,\n        OFDVI, OFDVII, OFDVIII and OFDIX) or a polymalformative syndrome with OFD involvement\n        (OFD+). We therefore constituted a second collection of DNA samples from 33 patients with\n        OFD syndrome or a polymalformative syndrome with OFD involvement, who presented neither a\n        mutation nor a rearrangement of the OFD1 gene.\n\n        The clinical data are already available from Doctor Christel Thauvin-Robinet, who is\n        responsible for this collection. These patients have signed a non-opposition form allowing\n        the use of their blood samples for research on OFD syndromes. These patients will\n        therefore be included in this new study without the need for new consent. Only an\n        information letter will be sent to them (annexe 4A)\n\n        Newly-included patients The inclusion criteria for patients are principally clinical\n        and/or paraclinical, based on the clinical investigation usually conducted in the\n        follow-up of these patients. Every index case must present an OFD syndrome with normal\n        results for the study of the OFD1 gene by direct sequencing of genomic DNA and a search\n        for major rearrangements using quantitative PCR. The index cases could be children (from\n        birth onwards) or adults, male or female with sporadic or familial syndromes.\n\n        Patients will be recruited by the clinical investigators of this study. These patients\n        could be:\n\n          -  patients already known by the investigator, who will contact the patient to invite\n             them to take part in the research,\n\n          -  or new patients seen during a consultation in the first year of the study (inclusion\n             period) The clinical dossier that accompanies each sample will include a case report\n             form, a family tree, photographs of the patient a signed written informed consent\n             form Symptomatic and asymptomatic relatives may also be included in our study, once\n             their written informed consent has been provided, so as to exclude polymorphism using\n             CGH-array or molecular biology, or to confirm the segregation of a mutation.\n\n        Minors will only be included in our study if they are symptomatic.

All of the index cases will be males who must present: (1)\n        Joubert syndrome with normal results for the genes responsible for Joubert syndrome or (3)\n        syndromic mental retardation more or less associated with polydactyly, obesity,\n        macrocephaly, pigmentary retinopathy, recurrent infections and/or the \"molar tooth\" sign\n        on cerebral MRI. Index cases could be infants (from birth onwards) or adults, sporadic or\n        familial cases with a mode of transmission compatible with X-linked inheritance.\n\n        Patients will be recruited by the clinical investigators of this study. These patients\n        could be:\n\n          -  patients already known by the investigator, who will contact the patient to invite\n             them to take part in the research,\n\n          -  or new patients seen during a consultation in the first year of the study (inclusion\n             period) The clinical dossier that accompanies each sample will include a case report\n             form, a family tree, photographs of the patient a signed written informed consent\n             form Symptomatic and asymptomatic relatives may also be included in our study, once\n             their written informed consent has been provided, so as to exclude polymorphism using\n             CGH-array or molecular biology, or to confirm the segregation of a mutation.\n\n        Minors will only be included in our study if they are symptomatic.
