            "textblock": "Herpes zoster (HZ), also known as \"shingles\", is caused by reactivation and multiplication\n      of the ubiquitous varicella zoster virus (VZV) that remains latent in everyone's sensory\n      neurons following varicella, or \"chickenpox\".  Among individuals who live to age 85, the\n      lifetime risk for HZ is 50%, and more than one in five individuals affected by zoster\n      develop post-herpetic neuralgia, resulting in chronic pain. Other serious complications\n      include encephalitis, permanent vision loss, or more rarely, dissemination and death.\n      Fortunately, a live attenuated vaccine is available and can reduce HZ risk by up to 70%.\n      For patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), this vaccine has great potential to provide\n      improved quality of life by reducing the incidence and complications associated with zoster.\n      Due to the underlying disease and/or treatments (e.g. steroids) for rheumatoid arthritis\n      (RA), the risk of herpes zoster in RA patients is approximately double that in the general\n      population. This increased risk should make prevention of zoster and therefore vaccination\n      exceedingly important for RA patients. In fact, because of a higher overall absolute risk\n      for zoster in RA, the vaccine yields a comparable or even greater absolute risk reduction to\n      reduce the risk of shingles and post-herpetic neuralgia in an RA population as it does in\n      the general population. However, the use of the zoster vaccine in RA patients is very low (<\n      5%), and less frequently used than for the general population.\n\n      National guidelines from the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)\n      recommend a single dose of the zoster vaccine for all individuals age 60 or older, with the\n      vaccine more recently gaining FDA-approval for administration to persons age 50 and older.\n      While a large number of RA patients would otherwise be recommended to receive this vaccine\n      on the basis of age, theoretical safety concerns related to vaccination likely explain the\n      very low vaccination rates observed. Currently, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA), the\n      ACIP, and the ACR consider the live zoster vaccine contraindicated in patients receiving\n      immunosuppressive medications, such as biologic therapies. Such contraindication stems from\n      the theoretical safety concern that these individuals could develop a disseminated\n      varicella-like infection from the vaccine virus strain. However, the investigators\n      hypothesize that this vaccine can safely be given in this setting, as there are no published\n      data to suggest that these safety concerns are warranted, and a growing body of\n      observational data suggest that vaccinating RA patients receiving biologic therapies with\n      this vaccine may in fact be safe. Moreover, and similarly with little or no evidence, the\n      ACIP considers the vaccine safe and acceptable for patients using methotrexate at doses\n      commonly used to treat RA (e.g. <= 25mg/week) and for patients using glucocorticoids at\n      prednisone-equivalent doses of \u2264 20 mg/day.\n\n      In light of 1) a substantial elevated HZ risk among RA patients; 2) national data showing\n      most RA patients are not vaccinated for HZ; and 3) the high effectiveness of this vaccine in\n      the general population, the investigators propose to conduct the Varicella zostER VaccinE\n      (VERVE) trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety,\n      tolerability, and long-term effectiveness of the live herpes zoster vaccine. This pilot\n      study will recruit the first 125 patients of the needed 4,000 individuals age 50 years or\n      older currently receiving anti-TNF therapy for RA or other inflammatory arthritis. Within a\n      relevant 6 week safety window, the investigators will collect serious adverse events\n      (satisfying a regulatory definition of a SAE) including non-serious events of vaccine-strain\n      varicella-like infection or herpes zoster. Beyond the key public health importance of the\n      clinical question being addressed, clinical trial methodological innovations proposed for\n      this unique large pragmatic trial. Additionally, the investigators will study vaccine\n      tolerability and long term effectiveness through a linkage to health plan data to allow for\n      cost-effective follow-up while minimizing participant and study-site burden."
