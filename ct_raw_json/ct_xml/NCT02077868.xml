      The purpose of this this trial is to prove the efficacy and safety of MGN1703 as a
      maintenance therapy after first-line chemotherapeutic treatment of metastatic colorectal
      cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the toxicity of chemotherapeutic medications treatment breaks are common practice in
      the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. During these treatment breaks a variety of
      maintenance treatments are available.

      MGN1703 is developed not only to help the Patient to recover from chemotherapy but also to
      boost the patient's immune System and thus help him to effectively fight the Tumor himself.

      After the concept has already been proved in a previous study this Trial is conducted to
      further evaluate the safety and efficacy of MGN1703 Treatment.
