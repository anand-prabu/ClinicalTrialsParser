Response rates with chemotherapy have been so\n      low that best supportive care has been the standard of care for most patients. In recent\n      phase I and phase II clinical studies, dovitinib has shown activity as a single agent in\n      solid tumors. Therefore, we will conduct a phase II, single-arm trial to determine the\n      efficacy of dovitinib in radioactive iodine-refractory recurrent or metastatic thyroid\n      cancer."
