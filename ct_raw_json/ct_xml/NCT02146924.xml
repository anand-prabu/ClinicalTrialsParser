      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of cellular immunotherapy after
      cyclophosphamide in treating patients with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Placing a
      modified gene into white blood cells may help the body build an immune response to kill
      cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and toxicity of adoptive therapy using ex vivo expanded autologous
      central memory T cells (TCM) that are enriched and genetically-modified to express a cluster
      of differentiation (CD)19-specific, hinge optimized, CD28-costimulatory chimeric antigen
      receptor (CAR) as well as a truncated human epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR)
      (CD19R(EQ)28zeta/truncated human EGFR [EGFRt]+ central memory T cells [TCM]) shortly
      following a lymphodepleting preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide (CY) for adults with
      poor prognosis CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

      II. To determine the Phase II recommended dose (RP2D).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study antitumor activity of adoptive therapy. II. To explore the efficacy of
      infusional cetuximab to eliminate transferred CD19R(EQ)CD2:zeta/EGFRt+ TCM.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing
      Tcm-enriched T cells (T-cell infusion).

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) 2-7 days before the T-cell infusion.
      Patients receive autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tcm-enriched T cells IV
      over 15 minutes on day 0. Patients with progressive disease may receive an optional second
      infusion of autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tcm-enriched T cells after 28
      days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24 hours, weekly for 1
      month, monthly for 1 year, and then yearly for at least 15 years.
