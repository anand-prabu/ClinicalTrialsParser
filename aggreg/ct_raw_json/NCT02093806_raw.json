Measured scans: one taken in an orbito-meatal plane\n\n        2. Chosen slices: where both  the round window niche and the external ear canal are seen\n           on the same slice\n\n        3. Distances measured:\n\n             1. Distance 1: between the anterior edge of the round window niche and the cortex of\n                the mastoid, with a minimal distance of 0.5mm to the posterior wall of the\n                external ear canal\n\n             2. Distance 2: between the posterior edge of the round window niche and the cortex of\n                the mastoid, with a minimal distance of 0.3mm to the anterior edge of the mastoid\n                segment of the facial nerve.\n\n             3. Distance 3: the size of the round window niche (from its anterior to posterior\n                edges)\n\n             4. Distance 4: between the anterior (most medial) edge of the round window membrane\n                to a point at least 0.3mm anterior to the mastoid segment of the facial nerve.\n\n             5. Distance 5: between the posterior (most lateral) edge of the round window membrane\n                to a point at least 0.3mm anterior to the mastoid segment of the facial nerve\n\n             6. Distance 6: size of round window membrane (anterior/medial to posterior/lateral)\n\n             7. Distance 7: between the lateral edges of distance 1 and 2 marking the cortical\n                size of the \"working channel\" created between the lines (from the cortex to the\n                round window).\n\n        4. Angles measured:\n\n             1. Between distance 1 and 7 - marking the angle of the \"working channel\" relatively\n                to the cortex\n\n             2. Between distance 1, passing in the middle of distance 3 to the middle of distance\n                6 - marking the angle of possible insertion from the working channel into the\n                cochlea"
