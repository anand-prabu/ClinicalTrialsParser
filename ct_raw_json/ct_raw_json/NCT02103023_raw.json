            "textblock": "Influenza poses a heavy burden to our health service. Seasonal, zoonotic and pandemic\n      influenza are constant global threats.  The WHO estimates that seasonal influenza causes\n      250,000-500,000 deaths worldwide each year, with an even higher mortality during the\n      pandemic periods. Moreover zoonotic influenza such as the avian-origin H5N1 and more\n      recently the H7N9 influenza are associated with a much higher mortality than seasonal\n      influenza. Vaccine immunogenicity among elderly individuals is also suboptimal due to\n      immunosenescence. Various strategies including intradermal vaccination and new vaccine\n      adjuvants have been shown to improve immunogenicity.\n\n      Recently, imiquimod, a synthetic Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist useful for the\n      treatment of DNA virus infection, have been shown to improve vaccine immunogenicity against\n      influenza virus in both mouse model. The objective of this prospective double-blind\n      randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effect and safety of topical treatment with\n      imiquimod immediately before intradermal influenza vaccination. Our a priori hypothesis is\n      that imiquimod pretreatment would expedite and augment the immunogenicity of influenza\n      vaccination."
