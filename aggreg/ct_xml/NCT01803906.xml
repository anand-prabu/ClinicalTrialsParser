  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying patients with undefined mitochondrial diseases to identify
      genetic mutations in nuclear or mitochondrial Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA).  Most patients
      with suspected or known mitochondrial diseases have no genetic confirmation.  The
      investigators expect that evaluating tissue samples from patients with mitochondrial
      disorders will lead us to discover mutations in new or known genes causing mitochondrial
      dysfunction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Presently, the investigators know of about 200 mitochondrial disorders.   The investigators
      know that there are about 1,300 genes responsible for mitochondrial function.  Thus, there
      are a lot of mutated genes to be discovered out there.  Currently, most patients with
      suspected or known mitochondrial disorders do not have genetic confirmation of the disease.

      The goal of this project is to perform biochemical and DNA analysis on tissue samples of
      patients with mitochondrial disorders to find new genes that might be involved in
      mitochondrial dysfunction.

      Leftover patient tissue samples will be obtained for analysis from within the Columbia
      Presbyterian Medical Center.  Left over patient samples may also be sent from outside the
      institution.   This is not a &quot;first-step&quot; in the diagnostic process, but rather an option
      for evaluation in patient samples for which no known diagnosis or genetic confirmation has
      been made.

      The research laboratory does not guarantee that a sample will be analyzed.  Sample analysis
      is performed according to research interest.   If they choose, patients can be contacted
      should laboratory findings provide insight into their disease.
