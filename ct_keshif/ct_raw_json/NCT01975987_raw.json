With the tip of the Bonfils in satisfactory position, the endotracheal tube will be advanced into the trachea using gentle rotary motions.

            "textblock": "Endotracheal intubation is an important act in the practice of anesthesiology. Direct\n      laryngoscopy is the most commonly used technique to accomplish this task. Airway\n      characteristics predicting difficult intubation with direct laryngoscopy are well defined.\n      Physical findings, such as Mallampati classification or measurements of the thyromental\n      distance, mouth opening, and neck extension have been validated to help anticipate difficult\n      situations. When direct laryngoscopy is strenuous, early conversion to an alternative\n      technique might reduce the risk of airway compromise and associated morbidity.\n\n      Many intubation devices are now available and part of the anesthesiologist's task is to\n      select the alternative approach best suited to each patient's specific features.   Despite\n      its use for both elective and unexpectedly difficult intubation, predictive criteria for\n      successful airway management  with the Bonfils fiberscope have not been proposed.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to identify patients' features, if any,  that could predict\n      successful intubation when using the Bonfils fiberscope for perioperative orotracheal\n      intubation in an elective surgical population."
