Effects include biomarker changes, progression-free\n      survival and safety.  Dovitinib will be taken by mouth for 5 days out of every week for up\n      to 2 years."

Patients will continue to take dovitinib until they demonstrate progression of\n      disease using standard RECIST criteria, withdraw consent, or experience unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      Blood and urine Biomarker studies will be performed on all patients in all cohorts. Samples\n      will be collected at baseline and every 8 weeks for the first 6 months and then every 3\n      months thereafter, while patients are on study. Blood and urine will be collected and banked\n      for protein, miRNA and metabolomic analysis.  Tumor specimens will be taken from patients in\n      maintenance cohorts before and 2 weeks after initiation of dovitinib.  All of these samples\n      will be analyzed to determine if biomarkers of benefit and progression can be determined."
