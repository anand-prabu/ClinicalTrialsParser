Based on available research, the investigators\n      predict that in patients with social anxiety disorder, oxytocin will improve social\n      cooperation during an online ball-tossing game called Cyberball, reduce attention toward\n      socially threatening cues during a dot-probe task, and lead to greater willingness to work\n      for monetary rewards for others rather than themselves during an effort expenditure task."
