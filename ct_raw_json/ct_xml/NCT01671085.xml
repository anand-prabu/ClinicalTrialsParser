  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study in healthy participants with high levels of &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol who are
      already taking a popular type of cholesterol-lowering medication called statins.  Following
      multiple doses of LY3015014, investigators will study the safety and tolerability of the
      drug, how the body handles the drug, and the drug's effect on the body.  Participants will
      remain in the study for about 3 months, not including screening.  Screening is required
      within 28 days before the study starts.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must be healthy males or females without childbearing potential as
             determined by medical history and physical examination

          -  Have body mass indexes of 18 to 35 kilograms per square meter (kg/m^2), inclusive, at
             screening

          -  Have screening LDL-Cs of between 100 and 180 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL),
             inclusive while having taken a stable dose of statin

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have known allergies to compounds related to LY3015014 or any components of the
             formulation or known clinically significant hypersensitivity to biologic agents

          -  Have a history of atopy, significant allergies to humanized monoclonal antibodies,
             clinically significant multiple or severe drug allergies, intolerance to topical
             corticosteroids, or severe posttreatment hypersensitivity reactions (including but
             not limited to erythema multiforme major, linear immunoglobulin A [IgA] dermatosis,
             toxic epidermal necrolysis, or exfoliative dermatitis)

          -  Have significant history of or current cardiovascular (excluding controlled
             hypertension), respiratory, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine,
             hematological, or neurological disorders capable of significantly altering the
             absorption, metabolism, or elimination of drugs, of constituting a risk when taking
             the study medication, or of interfering with the interpretation of data

          -  Have received any vaccine(s) within 1 month of LY3015014 dosing or intend to do so
             during the study

          -  Have received treatment with biologic agents (such as monoclonal antibodies) within 3
             months or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to dosing
