  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, the effect of a low and a high dose AN-PEP will be investigated in gluten
      sensitive individuals. Volunteers receive a breakfast with background (0.5 g) gluten.
      Capsules are taken in the morning within 5 min after start of breakfast. Gastrointestinal
      fluid will be sampled over 3 hours to measure gluten degradation. After 5 volunteers have
      completed 3 test days, a blind interim analysis is performed by a third party based on which
      it is decided whether to proceed with the low AN-PEP dose.
