A Computerized Tomography (CT) will also be performed along with both of\n      these procedures to help the researchers see clearly where your cancer or your healthy lung\n      is located. The researchers also perform blood tests in this study to look for markers in\n      your blood to see if it helps them determine your risk of developing side effects from\n      radiation to the lungs.  The researchers hope that this study will help them in the future\n      to design radiation treatment plans that provide the best treatment for each individual\n      patient."

            "textblock": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States.  Although surgery\n      provides the best chance of cure, the majority of lung cancers require radiation for\n      treatment.  The current radiation recommendation, using modern techniques and a uniform dose\n      of prescription, generates an overall cure rate of less than 10-15%, and moderate toxicity\n      in 10-30% of treated patients.  Who can be cured and who will develop side effects?\n      Computed tomography (CT) is a useful monitoring tool, but has limited power to predict both\n      tumor control and lung toxicity.  Using [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission\n      tomography (FDG-PET) and ventilation/perfusion single photon emission computed tomography\n      (V/Q SPECT), we have recently shown heterogeneous changes in tumor activity and regional\n      lung function during the course of radiation, which may be associated with long-term\n      outcome.  Data have also shown that radiation up-regulates the expression of cytokines, such\n      as transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF\u00df1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6).  We hypothesize that\n      radiation-induced functional changes and plasma cytokines are associated with long-term\n      tumor control and radiation lung damage.  The general strategy of this protocol is to\n      perform functional imaging and blood testing during the course of radiation and correlate\n      the results with long-term outcomes."
