Nocturnal disturbances in sleep and breathing are common\n      in COPD, although the impact of these disturbances on COPD morbidity remains largely\n      unknown. The hypothesis is that COPD induces specific sleep and breathing disturbances that\n      remain a substantial source of morbidity in this disorder.\n\n      Current therapy for treating nocturnal disturbances in sleep and breathing in COPD including\n      nocturnal oxygen has failed to improve morning fatigue and pulmonary function. This study\n      promises to significantly alter our approach to the diagnosis and management of sleep\n      disordered breathing in COPD."
