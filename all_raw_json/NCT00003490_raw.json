GM-CSF may make cancer cells more sensitive to the effects of\n      chemotherapy. Combining more than one drug with GM-CSF may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy, consisting\n      of cyclophosphamide plus vincristine, following GM-CSF in treating patients with multiple\n      myeloma that has not responded to previous treatment."

Determine the response rate of multiple myeloma patients when treated with\n      cyclophosphamide and vincristine after cycling myeloma cells with sargramostim (GM-CSF). II.\n      Evaluate whether Labelling Index (LI) changes influenced by GM-CSF would predict a group of\n      patients that will respond to this particular course specific design. III. Determine the\n      toxicity of GM-CSF in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive subcutaneous injections of sargramostim (GM-CSF) once a day for 5\n      days. Two to 3 days later, patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 30-45 minutes on day 1,\n      vincristine IV bolus on day 8, and oral prednisone 4 times a day on days 1-4. Patients also\n      receive subcutaneous injections of GM-CSF starting on day 2 and continuing for 10 days or\n      until neutrophil count is at least 1000/mm3. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for a minimum\n      of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who\n      achieve at least stable response receive GM-CSF 3 times a week for up to 2 years. Patients\n      are followed every 3-6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued."
