  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelet activation is an important factor in the pathogenesis of microvascular thrombosis
      characteristic of infections. Microthrombosis may be related to the progression of
      dysfunction during sepsis. Several drugs were tested in order to directly regulate blood
      clotting. However, there is a lack of studies on aspirin use in sepsis. Observational
      studies have demonstrated a decreased morbidity and mortality of sepsis with previous use of
      aspirin. However, no prospective randomized studies regarding this intervention were done.
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the impact of the use of aspirin in reducing
      organ dysfunction measured by SOFA score on the seventh day, and assess its effect on the
      duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital stay, as well as platelet activity,
      inflammatory and prothrombotic activity. Thus, adult patients with severe sepsis and / or
      septic shock with less than 48 hours will be randomly allocated into two groups. Group 1
      (ASA) will receive aspirin 200 mg and  Group 2, placebo either once daily for 14 days. The
      inflammatory status and coagulation will be collected either in the D0 and D3, with
      measurements of interleukin 6, interleukin 10 and interleukin-8. The coagulation profile
      will be analyzed by measuring thrombin-antithrombin complex, thrombin time, d-dimer and
      tissue factor. The platelet activity will be evaluated by testing platelet function (PFA)
      and by measurement of urinary metabolites and thromboxane.
