Patients are stratified by\n      the extent of weight loss (2-5 percent or greater than 5 percent in the past month).\n\n      Patients receive omega-3 fatty acids orally in two equal doses with/after breakfast and\n      lunch for 4 months or until weight loss is observed.\n\n      Dose is escalated in cohorts of two patients, although dose escalation is allowed in\n      individual patients. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the highest dose level\n      at which no greater than one-third of the patients treated, including escalated patients\n      from a lower dose, experience grade 3 or worse toxicity (phase I completed 12/1999).\n\n      Patients are evaluated for cachexia response every 2 weeks, and tumor response every 4 weeks\n      for a maximum of 4 months. If no response of cachexia or tumor after a 2 month period,\n      patients will be discontinued from study. Patients will be followed for survival\n      post-treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 57-63 patients will be enrolled in the Phase I and II study."
