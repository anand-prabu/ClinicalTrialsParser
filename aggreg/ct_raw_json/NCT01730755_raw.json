Currently, there are no therapies that have proven effective for CP. Recent\n      studies have demonstrated that VHL regulates the activity of JAK2. In mouse models,\n      inhibition of JAK2 reverses the CP phenotype. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that\n      JAK2 inhibition may have significant clinical benefits for CP patients."
