It contributes to an improvement in the quality of life\n      and to a decrease in the current treatment side-effects and mortality. Stroke in association\n      with an inactive lifestyle lead to a decrease in physical capability and causes problems in\n      daily activities. The physical capacity and the tolerance for exercise fall simultaneously\n      leading to vicious circle of less and less mobility. Therefore, physical activity for the\n      health is a valid and relevant way to improve the quality of life and to recover functional\n      capacity. The aim of the study is the assessment of the effects of a incentive program for\n      physical activity on people following/with  stroke."
