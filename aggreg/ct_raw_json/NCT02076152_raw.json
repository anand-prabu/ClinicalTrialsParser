            "textblock": "In this research study, the investigators are using FMISO-PET and MRI scans to explore the\n      delivery of bevacizumab to the blood vessels in  patient's with recurrent glioblastoma\n      before and after treatment.\n\n      Bevacizumab is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in patients with\n      recurrent glioblastoma . It works by targeting a specific protein called VEGF, which plays a\n      role in promoting the growth or spreading of tumor blood vessels. Since anti-VEGF agents\n      also affect normal blood vessels in the brain, they can inhibit the way other drugs used in\n      combination with bevacizumab are delivered to the tumor.\n\n      In PET scans, a radioactive substance is injected into the body. The scanning machine finds\n      the radioactive substance, which tends to go to cancer cells.  For the PET scans in this\n      research study, the investigators are using an investigational radioactive substance called\n      FMISO. \"Investigational\" means that the role of FMISO-PET scans is still being studied and\n      that research doctors are trying to find out more about it.  FMISO goes to areas with low\n      oxygenation so parts of the tumor that do not have enough oxygen can be seen.\n\n      In addition, a vascular MRI will be used to evaluate the changes in tumor blood flow, blood\n      volume, and how receptive blood vessels are. This scan will be performed at the same time of\n      the FMISO-PET scan."

The participant will be injected with two separate intravenous (IV) injections\n           (listed below). Intravenous means a need will be injected into a vein in the\n           participant's arm.\n\n             -  FMISO for PET scan and a contrast dye for the MRI scan\n\n             -  Drawing blood to assess the radioactivity of FMISO\n\n        -  The PET scan will take approximately 60-75 minutes. The participant will receive one\n           injection of FMISO. Following the injection of the radiotracer, blood samples will be\n           taken from the second IV line.  The tracer is given through a vein (IV) and travels\n           through the participant's blood and collects in organs and tissues. The participant\n           will need to wait nearby as the tracer is absorbed by the their body. This takes about\n           90 minutes. Then, the participant will lie on a narrow table that slides into a large\n           tunnel-shaped scanner. The PET will pick up signals from the tracer and a computer will\n           change the signals into 3D pictures that will be displayed on a monitor for the\n           participant's study doctor to read.\n\n      MRI Scan:\n\n        -  MRI scans will last about 60-75 minutes. This will occur at the same time as the PET\n           scan. The participant will be injected with contrast dye twice during the MRI scan. The\n           participant will have 3 MRI scans (prior to starting treatment, day 1 of treatment and\n           day 14 of treatment) that would not have routinely been performed if the participant\n           were not participating in this study.\n\n        -  Blood samples will be collected during both scans in order to measure how the\n           participant blood vessels are processing the radiotracer FMISO and how well it is being\n           delivered to the tumor tissue.\n\n        -  The participant will be assessed for side effects via clinic visit or phone call about\n           24 hours after each of the visits above.\n\n      Planned Follow-up:  The investigators would like to call the participant every 3 months for\n      three years after the 28 day visit to see how they are doing and if the participant is\n      experiencing any side effects. If the participant is removed from the study due to an\n      unacceptable side effect, the participant will be followed until it has been resolved."

Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on\n             the use of FMISO in participants <18 years of age, children are excluded from this\n             study but will be eligible for future pediatric trials.\n\n          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.\n\n          -  Karnofsky performance status > 60 (see Appendix A).\n\n          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n               -  Leukocytes > 3,000/mcL\n\n               -  Absolute neutrophil count > 1,500/mcL\n\n               -  Platelets > 100,000/mcL\n\n               -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits\n\n               -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) < 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal\n\n               -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits or creatinine clearance > 60\n                  mL/min/1.73 m2 for subjects with creatinine levels about institutional normal.\n\n          -  Patient must be able to undergo MRI and PET scans.\n\n          -  Patients must be maintained on a stable corticosteroid regimen for 5 days prior each\n             MR-PET scan.\n\n          -  The effects of FMISO on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and\n             because radiopharmaceuticals agents are known to be teratogenic, women of\n             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or\n             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the\n             duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is\n             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician\n             immediately.\n\n          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent\n             document.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be\n             eligible for admission into the study.\n\n          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic\n             composition to temozolomide or FMISO.\n\n          -  Participants who have already received anti-VEGF or experimental anti-angiogenic\n             therapy for glioblastoma.\n\n          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active\n             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac\n             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with\n             study requirements.\n\n          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because FMISO is a radiopharmaceutical\n             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is\n             an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to\n             treatment of the mother with radiopharmaceutical agents, breastfeeding should be\n             discontinued if the mother is treated with radiopharmaceutical agents. These\n             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.\n\n          -  HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because\n             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with FMISO.
