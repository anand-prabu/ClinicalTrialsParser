Since Aspirin 325mg twice daily has been\n      recently included as a nationally approved venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in the\n      Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) protocols for low risk total knee arthroplasty\n      (TKA) patients, it is necessary to optimize multimodal prophylaxis methods. These include\n      reduced tourniquet time, early mobilization, and mechanical compression devices (MCDs).\n      MCDs are commonly used as part of the in-hospital VTE prophylaxis measures; however, it has\n      not been demonstrated in clinical trials that optimal prophylaxis methods would be enhanced\n      by prolonged use of a MCD after discharge. In order to achieve this, a potentially valuable\n      solution has recently been made available to the outpatient population.  The Cothera\n      VPulse(tm) is a MCD that combines rapid intermittent sequential compression with cold\n      therapy.  It is designed for single patient use in the home and includes technology to track\n      patient compliance. The purpose of this study is to examine if there is a difference in DVT\n      occurrence over 3 weeks after tourniquet-less TKA and multimodal prophylaxis with or without\n      extended MCD use in a cooling device/MCD system."
