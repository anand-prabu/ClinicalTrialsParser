You will not be able to take any medication\n      for your pain other than Acetominophen (like Tylenol) for the duration of this study.\n\n      You are being asked to be in this study, because you have knee pain.\n\n      All of the tests and procedures in this study are being done solely for research purposes.\n\n      Up to 100 people will be in this study at UVA.\n\n      How long will this study take?\n\n      Your participation in this study will require 4 study visits over 6 months.  Each visit will\n      last about 1 hour.\n\n      What will happen if you are in the study?\n\n      SCREENING (will take approximately 60 minutes to complete):\n\n      Visit 1-2 (Week 1)\n\n      If you agree to participate, you will sign this consent form before any study related\n      procedures take place.  Before you can start in the study, there will be a screening period.\n       You will have tests and procedures during this time to make sure you are eligible and it is\n      safe for you to participate.  These include the following:\n\n        -  Review of your medical history\n\n        -  Physical exam of your knee\n\n        -  An x-ray of your knee\n\n        -  Completion of 5 brief questionnaires\n\n        -  Thigh muscle strength test: you will contract your thigh muscle as hard as you can when\n           an electrical stimulus will be delivered directly to the muscles at the front of your\n           thigh.  This stimulus will cause your thigh muscles to twitch quickly.  This stimulus\n           may cause you some minor discomfort.  If it causes you an intolerable amount of\n           discomfort, you do not have to continue with this portion of data collection.  The\n           stimulus in this experiment feels similar to the static electricity shock that is\n           sometimes felt when you touch a doorknob or something else metal.  The intensity of a\n           static electricity shock usually ranges from 2000-4000 volts.  The maximum voltage that\n           will be delivered in this experiment is 125 volts. You will be enrolled only if you\n           have evidence of muscle weakness.\n\n      If these tests show you are eligible, you can proceed immediately with study procedures or\n      return to the clinic (within 7 days) to begin study treatment.\n\n      STUDY PROCEDURES/ RANDOMIZATION (each visit will last about 60 minutes):\n\n      You will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study treatment groups.\n      You have an equal chance of being assigned to any one of the groups.  Neither you nor your\n      doctor can choose which treatment you are assigned.  Neither you nor your doctor will know\n      which study treatment you will get until the study is done. But if your doctor needs to\n      know, the people doing this study can find out.\n\n      GROUP 1: Synvisc-One\u00ae injection:  You will receive a single injection to your knee.  We may\n      numb your skin with a cold spray prior to the injection to the front of your knee joint.\n\n      GROUP 2: Sham Injection:  This is similar to a placebo injection. A placebo is defined as a\n      harmless substance that looks like the study device, but which should have no effect.  We\n      may numb your skin with a cold spray prior to the injection to the front of your knee joint.\n      In this case, a needle will be placed in your joint as if you were having an injection but,\n      nothing will be injected.\n\n      You will not be able to find out which treatment you got until the study is done.  If your\n      doctor needs to know, the people doing this study can find out.  If you are randomized to\n      this group, you will be eligible for an injection of Synvisc-One\u00ae during your last study\n      visit (at 6 months) if it is needed depending on the amount of pain you are experiencing.\n      You will sign a separate consent form for this portion of the study.\n\n      You will be prescribed a standardized home-based leg strengthening program including simple\n      and low-intensity exercises for your thigh muscles.  We will review these exercises with you\n      so that you understand how to do them correctly.  We will also tell you how long and how\n      often you should do these exercises and you will be provided an exercise diary that will\n      provide exercise descriptions and reminders. You will be asked to return exercise books at\n      each visit\n\n      During this study, you will be asked to fill out some questionnaires.  These questionnaires\n      ask about:\n\n        -  how you are feeling\n\n        -  your lifestyle habit and functions\n\n        -  daily activities\n\n        -  medicine use\n\n      These questionnaires will take about 15 minutes to complete.\n\n      FOLLOW UP: Visit 3-5; Weeks 4, 12 and 26)\n\n      You will return for follow up testing and evaluation 1 month, 3 months and 6 months\n      following your injection.\n\n      During each follow up visit we will collect the following:\n\n        -  Knee joint examination\n\n        -  Completion of 5 brief questionnaires\n\n        -  Thigh muscle strength test\n\n        -  Questions about your medication usage and problems you may be having with your knee.\n\n        -  Return exercise book What are the risks of being in this study?\n\n      Risks and side effects related to the device (Synvisc-one\u00ae) include:\n\n      Less Likely  (about 2 of every 100 subjects may experience)\n\n        -  Arthralgia (pain in your knee joint)\n\n        -  Arthritis (degeneration of your knee joint cartilage)\n\n        -  Arthropathy (injury to your knee joint)\n\n        -  Pain at the site of your injection\n\n        -  Swelling inside your knee joint\n\n      Risks and side effects related to the procedures (thigh muscle testing and knee joint\n      evaluations) in this study include:\n\n      Less Likely\n\n        -  Thigh Muscle discomfort\n\n        -  Thigh muscle soreness\n\n        -  Knee Pain\n\n      Risks of having radiation of the knee:\n\n      This study involves radiation exposure from an X-ray of your knee. As part of everyday\n      living, everyone is exposed to a small amount of background radiation that comes from soil,\n      rocks, outer space and within the body itself. The radiation dose you will receive in this\n      study is about the amount that you receive over 101 days from background radiation. The risk\n      from this dose is small. This radiation exposure is not necessary for your medical care but\n      is necessary to obtain the research information desired\n\n      Risks for women:\n\n      If you are pregnant now, or get pregnant during the course of your study participation,\n      please tell us. Being in this study might hurt your unborn baby, so you will not be able to\n      join or stay in the study.  Use an effective method of birth control during this time. If\n      you have questions about birth control, please ask the study doctor or your primary care\n      physician..\n\n      Other unexpected risks:\n\n      You may have side effects that we do not expect or know to watch for now.  You may also\n      experience possible unknown chronic effects in the future that may occur many years after\n      your injection.  Call the study leader if you have any symptoms or problems.\n\n      Will you be paid for being in this study? You will be paid $ 100 for finishing this study by\n      a check sent to you in the mail. You should get your payment about 4 weeks after finishing\n      the study.  The income may be reported to the IRS as income.\n\n      You will not be paid at all if you decide not to finish this study. If the study leader says\n      you cannot continue after you have been enrolled, you will be paid the full amount for the\n      study.\n\n      If you owe money to any Virginia state agency, the state can use the money you earn in this\n      study to pay those debts.  These state agencies include the UVa Medical Center, VCU Medical\n      Center or a college or university.  The money may be withheld to pay back debt for such\n      things as unpaid medical bills, taxes, fines, child support. Even if this happens, the money\n      you earn may be reported to the IRS as taxable income.\n\n      Will being in this study cost you any money? Participation in this study will not cost you\n      any money.  The study covers the cost of the physician visits, knee x-ray and injections.\n\n      You or your insurance company must pay for any tests or care given beyond what is required\n      in this study.  In addition, you and your health plan may also have to pay for other drugs\n      or treatments that are given to help you control any side effects.  You will have to pay for\n      any costs not covered by your health plan."
