            "textblock": "When a patient receives a kidney transplant particularly if the kidney is from an older\n      donor or one who has had the kidney removed after their heart has stopped, there is a risk\n      that the newly transplanted kidney may not function immediately. If the delay in function\n      means that dialysis is needed in the first 7 days after the transplantation then this is\n      known as delayed graft function or DGF. This problem is often due to an excessive\n      inflammatory reaction to not having had a blood supply between the time of donation and\n      transplant.\n\n      OPN-305 is a monoclonal antibody that blocks Toll-like Receptor 2 which is thought to be\n      partly responsible for increasing the risk of this inflammation. It is hoped that the\n      effects of the inflammation will be reduced and therefore prevent DGF from occurring.\n\n      The purpose of the study is to explore how effective OPN-305 is in preventing DGF as well as\n      improving other measures of kidney function and the overall safety of the antibody.  In the\n      first part of the study, each patient will receive an Infusion of one of three possible\n      doses of OPN-305 or a placebo and in the second part the most suitable dose of OPN-305 and a\n      placebo will be used.\n\n      Protocol OPN305-103 follows out to 12 months post-transplant the clinical status and graft\n      function of patients who have completed the 6-month post-transplant period under Part A or\n      Part B of OPN305-102."
