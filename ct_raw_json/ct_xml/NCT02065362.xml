  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients have nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This study is a gene transfer research study
      using special immune cells.

      Most patients with NPC show evidence of infection with the virus that causes infectious
      mononucleosis Epstein Barr virus (EBV) before or at the time of their diagnosis. EBV is
      found in the cancer cells of almost all patients with advanced stage NPC, suggesting that it
      may play a role in causing the disease. The cancer cells infected by EBV are able to hide
      from the body's immune system and escape destruction. We want to see if special white blood
      cells, called T cells, that have been trained to recognize and kill special parts of EBV
      infected cells can survive in patient's blood and affect the tumor.

      We already have given EBV-specific cytotoxic T cells to 30 patients with active NPC and have
      seen anti-tumor activity in 14 of 30 patients. We are now trying to find out if we can
      improve this treatment.

      First, we want to give T cells where more of the cells recognize at least two of the four
      EBV proteins expressed on NPC cells. We call these cells NPC-specific cytotoxic T cells
      (NPC-specific CTLs).

      Second, we found that T cells work better if we add a receptor to the T cells called DNR
      (Dominant Negative Receptor). DNR makes T cells resistant to TGFbeta, a factor secreted by
      cancer cells that helps them escape being killed by the immune system. In this study we will
      therefore place the DNR gene into NPC-specific CTLs (DNR.NPC-specific CTLs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood will be collected from the patient to make LMP/BARF1/EBNA1 (NPC)-specific CTLs. To
      grow NPC-specific CTLs we have to use special cells called antigen-presenting cells, which
      train the patient's T cells to be NPC specific. Antigen presenting cells, so called
      monocytes or dendritic cells, will be grown/isolated from the patient's blood. In addition,
      we use a cell line called K562 as antigen-presenting cells that has had genes put inside it,
      which encourage the patient's T cells to grow. K562 cells are cancer cells. As such, if
      injected they could cause cancer. The cells have been treated with radiation so they cannot
      grow.

      These antigen-presenting cells are coated with a specially produced mixture of LMP, EBNA1
      and BARF protein fragments called peptides. These coated antigen-presenting cells are then
      used to generate the patient's NPC-specific CTLs in the presence of growth factors. To get
      the DNR to attach to the surface of these NPC-specific CTLs, we also inserted the DNR gene
      into the NPC-specific CTL (DNR.NPC-specific CTLs). This is done with a virus called a
      retrovirus that has been made for this study. This virus will carry the DNR gene into the
      cells.

      Once we have made sufficient numbers of DNR.NPC-specific CTLs we will freeze the cells and
      test them to make sure they recognize EBV proteins present in NPC.

      Patients will get treated with two doses of DNR.NPC-specific CTLs. The second dose will be
      given 2 weeks after the first dose.

      The CTLs will be thawed and injected through a central line, or through a vein in the
      patient's arm over 1 to 10 minutes. Patients will be followed in the clinic after the
      injection for 1 to 4 hours.

      All of the treatments will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas
      Children's Hospital or Houston Methodist Hospital.

      Medical tests before treatment:

      Before being treated, the patient will receive a series of standard medical tests:

      Physical exam Imaging Study Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function
      Measurements of the tumor by routine imaging studies. We will use the imaging study that was
      used before to follow the patient's tumor: Computer Tomogram (CT), Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (MRI), or Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT)

      Medical tests during and after treatment:

      The patient will receive standard medical tests when they are getting the infusions and
      after:

      Physical exams Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function Imaging study 8
      weeks after the 1st CTL infusion

      To learn more about the way the DNR.NPC-specific CTL are working and how long they last in
      the body, an extra 60ml or 3ml/kg of body weight of blood (whichever is less) will be taken
      on the day of the T-cell infusion (before and at the end of the T-cell infusion), 1, 2, 3,
      4. 6, and 8 weeks after the T-cell infusion and every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months
      for 4 years, then yearly for a total of 15 years. One additional blood sample might be drawn
      3 to 4 days post the 1st T-cell infusion; this is optional. This volume is considered safe,
      but may be decreased if the patient is anemic. In addition to the blood tests, the patient
      will receive 2 imaging studies as stated above.
