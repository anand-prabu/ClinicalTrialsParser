  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Isolation of an nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) from sputa of cystic fibrosis (CF)
      patients is relatively common, and of uncertain significance. At the request of the CF
      Foundation (CFF), the Investigators have designed a standardized diagnostic protocol based
      on current recommendations for the diagnosis of NTM by the American Thoracic Society, as
      well as forthcoming recommendations by the CFF and the European CF Society. The study is
      observational in nature, and is not intended to change the current diagnostic approach to
      the infection, but rather standardized the collection of data to facilitate the decision
      making process. When validated, this protocol will be easily assessable to the entire CFF
      Care Center Network.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects with confirmed diagnosis of CF, defined as: a sweat chloride
             value â‰¥60 mmol/L by quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis, OR 2 CF causing mutations
             (all as documented in the subject's medical record), AND chronic sinopulmonary
             disease OR gastrointestinal/nutritional abnormalities

          2. Age 7 years or greater.

          3. Able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, restrictions, and
             instructions and likely to complete the study as planned, as judged by the
             investigator.

          4. Signed ICF, and where appropriate, signed assent form.

          5. Recent positive sputum culture or BAL for NTM.

          6. Previous signed ICF to allow medical records to be entered into the CF Foundation
             Patient Registry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of a condition or abnormality that in the opinion of the investigator would
             compromise the safety of the subject or the quality of the data.

          2. Pregnant.

          3. History of solid organ or hematological transplantation.

          4. Currently undergoing treatment for NTM infection.

          5. Patient with treatment failure for current NTM species, as defined by positive sputum
             cultures within 12 months of discontinuation of antibiotic treatment.
