It will specifically look\n      at short gynecologic procedures such as D&C (dilation and curettage), hysteroscopies and\n      LEEP procedures and the need to perform intraoperative catheterization.  If a patient\n      urinates immediately before a short operation then there is no need to drain the bladder\n      with a catheter during the procedure.  The investigators hypothesize that eliminating\n      catheterization during these short procedures may decrease postoperative urinary tract\n      infections. The hope is that this study would provide evidence to support a change in\n      practice."

If patients are asked to void immediately\n      before their procedure it would eliminate the need for intra-operative catheterization and\n      eliminate a potential source of infection.\n\n      The study is designed to determine whether routine catheterization prior to a minor OB/GYN\n      procedure causes symptomatic or asymptomatic bacteria in the urine. Current practice is\n      one-time catheterization of patients undergoing minor OB/GYN procedures prior to the\n      beginning of the procedure.
