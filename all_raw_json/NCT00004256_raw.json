Patients are randomly allocated\n      to one of two treatment arms before scheduled radiotherapy begins.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC daily for 14 days beginning on day 14\n           of the course of radiotherapy.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients do not receive GM-CSF. Patients are followed weekly until mucositis is\n           healed, as well as at weeks 2 and 6 following the end of radiotherapy.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 34 patients (17 per arm) will be accrued for this study."
