Primarily, to compare the rates of invasive infections by C.\n      neoformans, endemic mycoses, and Candida. To compare the mortality rates due to fungal\n      infections between two antifungal prophylactic treatments. Secondarily, to assess the effect\n      of prophylaxis on the incidence of severe fungal infections, defined as invasive infections\n      and esophageal candidiasis and less severe mucocutaneous infection.\n\n      Serious fungal infections are significant complicating and life-threatening occurrences in\n      patients with advanced HIV infection. Oropharyngeal candidiasis is found in almost all such\n      patients, and causes pain, difficulty in swallowing, and loss of appetite. Similarly,\n      esophageal candidiasis causes illness in the population. Cryptococcosis, endemic mycoses,\n      and coccidioidomycosis also cause significant illness and death in AIDS patients. Once\n      established, fungal infections in AIDS patients generally require continuous suppressive\n      therapy because attempts at curing these infections are usually unsuccessful. Fluconazole\n      has a number of characteristics that would make it a logical candidate to examine as a\n      prophylactic agent in patients with advanced HIV infection. Animal studies have shown it to\n      be prophylactic in models of candidiasis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, and\n      coccidioidomycosis. Initial experience in patients with active cryptococcal meningitis\n      appears favorable, and studies of oropharyngeal candidiasis show it to be effective."

Enrollment will\n      continue until all eligible and interested 081 patients are enrolled. Fungal prophylaxis\n      will begin at the time of enrollment into the nested study and will continue until an\n      efficacy or safety end point is reached, until withdrawal from the nested study, or until\n      death.\n\n      Original design: Patients included are those already enrolled in ACTG 081. Patients are\n      enrolled from all centers at either week 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, or 32 of participation in\n      the parent study. They are randomized to receive either oral fluconazole or clotrimazole\n      troches. Prophylaxis continues until a serious fungal infection develops, the end of the\n      parent study is reached (which is expected to be December 1991), the patient withdraws from\n      either the nested or parent study, or the patient dies. Clinical examination is performed at\n      2 weeks and then monthly (or more if clinically indicated) for the duration of antifungal\n      prophylaxis; the schedule of evaluation is the same as for the parent study. There is a\n      1-month postprophylaxis follow-up after discontinuation of prophylaxis for any reason."
