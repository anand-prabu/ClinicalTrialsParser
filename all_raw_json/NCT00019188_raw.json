Determine the antitumor activity of IL-12 in these patients. III.  Determine the effect\n      of IL-12 on angiogenic factors, including basic fibroblast growth factor, vascular\n      endothelial growth factor, and interferon-inducible protein 10 in these patients.\n\n      IV.  Determine the immunologic and virologic effects of IL-12 in these patients.\n\n      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive interleukin-12 (IL-12)\n      subcutaneously twice a week (at least 3 days apart) for 6 months.  Patients with stable or\n      better disease continue IL-12 treatment in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of IL-12 until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined.  The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients\n      experience dose limiting toxicity.  Ten additional patients are treated at the MTD.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:\n\n      Up to 55 patients will be entered over approximately 4.0 years."
