    <description>The 10-item Barthel Index was published in 1965 as a simple index of functional independence, particularly in personal and domestic activities of daily living. This instrument consists of 10 items on activities of daily living (grooming, dressing, bathing, and bowel and bladder status), each with 2 or 4 response categories (0-3 points).Total score range from 0 to 100.

    <description>Provides a standardized neurological assessment of cognitive and motor function in stroke patients (alert or drowsy). Used to assess alertness in stroke patients. Includes the following assessments: Level of consciousness, Orientation, Aphasia and Motor strength. Assessments of motor function are separated into two sections: A1: administered if patient is able to understand and follow instructions, and A2: administered in the presence of comprehension deficits.

    <description>A brief screening tool to provide a quantitative assessment of cognitive impairment and to record cognitive changes over time. The MMSE consists of 11 simple questions or tasks grouped into 7 cognitive domains. Levels of impairment have been classified as (Tombaugh &amp; McIntyre 1992): None: score = 24-30; Mild: score = 18-24 and Severe: score = 0-17.

    <description>Provides a uniform system of measurement for disability based on the International Classification of Impairment, Disabilities and Handicaps; measures the level of a patient's disability and indicates how much assistance is required for the individual to carry out activities of daily living. Contains 18 items composed of 13 motor tasks and 5 cognitive tasks (considered basic activities of daily living. Tasks are rated on a 7 point ordinal scale that ranges from total assistance (or complete dependence) to complete independence.

    <description>MRHS categorizes level of functional independence with reference to pre-stroke activities. Assessment is carried out by asking the patient about their activities of daily living, including outdoor activities. Information about the patient's neurological deficits on examination, including aphasia and intellectual deficits, should be obtained.
