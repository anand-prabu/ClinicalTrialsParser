Combining gemtuzumab ozogamicin with chemotherapy may kill more cancer\n      cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gemtuzumab ozogamicin with or without\n      chemotherapy in treating older patients who have acute myeloid leukemia."

Determine the feasibility, toxicity, and antileukemic activity of gemtuzumab\n      ozogamicin (CMA-676) with or without mitoxantrone, etoposide, cytarabine, and idarubicin in\n      elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to risk (standard\n      risk, defined as age 61-75 and WHO performance status 0-1 vs poor risk, defined as over 75\n      years and WHO performance status 0-2 OR under 76 years and WHO performance status 2).\n      Frontline therapy: Patients receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 15.\n      Stratum I (Standard risk patients): Patients with disease progression at any time during\n      frontline therapy may begin induction therapy immediately. Induction therapy begins 7-10\n      days after response assessment regardless of response and in the absence of unacceptable\n      toxicity. Stratum II (Poor risk patients): Patients experiencing complete remission with or\n      without platelet recovery will begin consolidation therapy within 4-8 weeks of response\n      assessment in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Stratum I Induction therapy: Patients\n      receive mitoxantrone IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 3 and 5; etoposide IV over 1 hour on days\n      1-3; and cytarabine IV continuously on days 1-7. Patients experiencing partial response are\n      given a second induction therapy course. Patients experiencing complete remission with or\n      without platelet recovery after 1 or 2 induction courses begin consolidation therapy within\n      4-8 weeks of response assessment in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Consolidation\n      therapy: Patients receive idarubicin IV on days 1, 3 and 5; etoposide IV over 1 hour on days\n      1-3; and cytarabine IV continuously on days 1-5. Stratum II Consolidation therapy: Patients\n      receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and then 1-3 months later. Patients\n      are followed monthly for 1 year, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45-82 (28-49 for stratum I, and 17-33 for stratum II) patients\n      will be accrued for this study."
