  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are studying patients' abilities to correctly identify the prescription medications they
      are taking.  We are interested in understanding what tools will help patients correctly
      identify their medications. People participating in this study will be asked to either
      review a paper printout of their medication list or a computer program with their
      medications.  The program will show the names and pictures of the medications.  In either
      situation, participants will be asked to indicate if they are taking the medications as
      prescribed. We will then compare reported adherence between each medication review process.
      Participation may help the program developers improve the product.

      The trial compares a paper-based medication adherence questionnaire to an electronic
      medication adherence questionnaire.  Results from each arm will be compared to the
      ambulatory medication list on file with the clinic and a separate medication review
      interview conducted by a trained clinician.  We intend to compare adherence patterns and
      medication use discrepancy rates between each approach.  This data will help us to determine
      what strategies work best to solicit an accurate medication history from the patient.
