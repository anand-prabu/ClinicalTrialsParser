Treatment repeats every 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete response or stable disease continue\n      treatment for 2 courses past best response. Patients who demonstrate a persistent partial\n      response continue treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-35 patients will be accrued for this study."
