  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of
      MK-1293 compared with a basal insulin (Lantus™) in participants with Type 1 Diabetes. The
      primary hypotheses are that the duration of action, pharmacodynamic profile, and
      pharmacokinetic profile of MK-1293 and the comparator basal insulin are similar.
