  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal is to prospectively estimate the median radiographic PFS of African
      American and Caucasian men with mCRPC to abiraterone acetate and prednisone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-comparative pilot open-label, parallel arm, multicenter study of abiraterone
      acetate in African American and Caucasian men with mCRPC. Patients will self-report on race
      and 50 patients will be enrolled into each group.  Patients will be treated on open-label
      treatment until evidence of disease progression as defined by Prostate Cancer Working Group
      Two (PCWG2) definition or until two years at which point they will roll over to the standard
      of care at that time.  The study agent abiraterone acetate will be administered by the
      patient at a dose of 1000mg orally once daily with prednisone 5 mg BID in 4-week cycles
      throughout the treatment period.

          -  Willing to take abiraterone acetate on an empty stomach; no food should be consumed
             at least two hours before and for at least one hour after the dose of abiraterone
             acetate is taken, and should be able to swallow tablets whole, without
             crushing/chewing tablets

          -  Patients who have partners of childbearing potential must be willing to use a method
             of birth control with adequate barrier protection as determined to be acceptable by
             the principal investigator and sponsor during the study and for 1 week after last
             dose of abiraterone acetate

          -  Adequate laboratory parameters
