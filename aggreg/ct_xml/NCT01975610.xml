      CC-292 is an oral agent that is under clinical development for the treatment of rheumatoid
      arthritis an autoimmune inflammatory disorder.

      This study will test the clinical effectiveness and safety of an orally (PO) administered
      dose of CC-292 compared to placebo in US female patients currently on background
      Methotrexate (MTX) with active Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      proof-of-concept study to determine the efficacy and safety of CC-292 (375 mg PO daily) on a
      stable background of MTX therapy in female subjects with active RA.

      Approximately 80 female subjects with active RA will be randomized 1:1 into two dose groups:
      active CC-292 (375 mg PO daily) or identically-appearing placebo capsules for 4 weeks
