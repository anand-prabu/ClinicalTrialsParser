            "textblock": "In women with diabetes, hyperglycemia is associated with increased rates of numerous\n      maternal and fetal adverse outcomes.  Mothers are at increased risk of preeclampsia,\n      polyhydramnios, and caesarean sections.  Infants of mothers with diabetes have increased\n      rates of congenital anomalies, premature delivery, macrosomia, stillbirth and NICU\n      admissions. Macrosomia itself is associated with numerous adverse fetal outcomes including\n      shoulder dystocia, birth injury, neonatal hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, respiratory\n      distress syndrome and NICU admissions, asphyxia and death.  Postprandial blood sugars in\n      particular have been associated with increased macrosomia rates.\n\n      Numerous studies have shown that pregnancy outcomes can be reduced with improved glycemic\n      control. In particular, pre-pregnancy care has been shown to assist women improve glucose\n      control during the crucial period of organogenesis, and is associated with reduced rates of\n      adverse pregnancy outcome including major congenital malformation, stillbirth and neonatal\n      death.\n\n      Technological advances aimed at reducing glycemic excursions and improving glucose control\n      in patients with diabetes include the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. We\n      hypothesize that real-time CGM will assist women with type 1 diabetes to improve their\n      glycemic control before and during pregnancy."

Subjects using premixed fixed\n             doses of insulin at the time of enrolment will not be eligible. Insulin regimen must\n             be stable for at least 4 weeks (i.e. on multiple insulin injections or on insulin\n             pump) prior to randomization.\n\n          -  No expectation that subject will be moving out of the area of the clinical center\n             during the next year, unless the move will be to an area served by another study\n             center\n\n          -  Informed Consent Form signed by the subject\n\n        In addition, specific eligibility criteria apply to the respective groups:\n\n        Pre-pregnancy Group:\n\n          -  Patients who are planning pregnancy and wish to optimise glycemic control before\n             conception\n\n        Pregnancy Group:\n\n          -  Pregnancy gestation \u226413 weeks, 6 days at time of randomization\n\n          -  Live singleton fetus\n\n          -  Dating ultrasound (US) done to confirm gestational age, viability and rule out\n             multiples. Gestational age will be based on the last menstrual period (LMP) provided\n             there is a \u22645 day discrepancy with US dates in the first trimester and \u226410 day\n             discrepancy with US dates in the second trimester.  If the dates from LMP are outside\n             these limits, the US dates will be used as the best estimate of gestational age.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Type 2 diabetes\n\n          -  Gestational diabetes\n\n          -  Regular home user of RT-CGM in the previous 3 months\n\n          -  Previous participation in the study\n\n          -  Estimated GFR <60 ml/min/1.73\n\n          -  The presence of a significant medical disorder or use of a medication such as oral\n             glucocorticoids that in the judgment of the investigator will affect the wearing of\n             the sensors or the completion of any aspect of the protocol.\n\n        If the investigator is uncertain whether the patient would be eligible; i.e. if the\n        medical disorder would constitute an exclusion, the Steering Committee will be asked to\n        make the decision.\n\n          -  Inpatient psychiatric treatment in the past 6 months\n\n          -  Subjects using premixed fixed doses of insulin at the time of enrolment\n\n        In addition, specific exclusion criteria apply to the respective groups:\n\n        Pre-pregnancy Group:\n\n          -  HbA1c <7.0% or >10.0%\n\n        Pregnancy Group:\n\n          -  HbA1c <6.5% or >10.0%\n\n          -  Known current higher order pregnancies (twins, triplets, etc.) These women will be\n             excluded as they have a higher rate of adverse outcomes and could lead to\n             inequalities if they are unequally distributed between the groups.\n\n          -  Known potentially major fetal anomaly (as per EUROCAT criteria)."
