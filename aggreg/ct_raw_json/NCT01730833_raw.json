Monoclonal antibodies,\n      such as pertuzumab and trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the\n      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or\n      carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel\n      albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, work in different ways to kill tumor cells or\n      stop them from growing. Giving pertuzumab and trastuzumab together with paclitaxel\n      albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation may be a better way to block tumor growth."

To determine efficacy of administration of pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab\n      with nab-paclitaxel (paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation) in subjects\n      with stage IV human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2 overexpressing metastatic\n      breast cancer (MBC) as measured by progression free survival (PFS).\n\n      II. To determine the efficacy as neoadjuvant treatment of the regimen in HER2+ locally\n      advanced breast cancer (LABC) as defined by pathologic complete response (pCR).\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To evaluate the safety of pertuzumab when added to trastuzumab and nab-paclitaxel in\n      HER-2 overexpressing MBC and LABC cancer as assessed by the frequency and severity of\n      adverse events (AEs), abnormal findings on physical examination, laboratory tests, and vital\n      signs.\n\n      II. To evaluate the objective response rate (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors\n      [RECIST] 1.1) and duration of response in MBC.\n\n      III. To evaluate the efficacy of the regimen by assessing tumor response including\n      assessment of residual cancer burden (RCB) scores in LABC.\n\n      IV. To assess the progression free survival (MBC), relapse-free survival (LABC) and overall\n      survival in all patients.\n\n      V. To perform exploratory circulatory gene, micro-ribonucleic acid (RNA), and exosome\n      profiling as well as protein and glycomic profiling.\n\n      VI. To assess the feasibility of molecular profiling in both primary and metastatic tumor\n      samples.\n\n      VII. To assess numerical and qualitative aspects of circulating tumor cells and circulating\n      tumor-derived deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive pertuzumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1,\n      trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation\n      IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (patients with MBC) or for 6 courses in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (patients with LABC).\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 4 years and\n      then every 6 months for 1 year."
