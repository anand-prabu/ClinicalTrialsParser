A number of reports suggest that gemcitabine combined with other chemotherapy\n      drugs has good application prospect in the treatment of lymphomas. Dexamethasone is used in\n      combination with other agents for the treatment of lymphomas which may be implicated in the\n      development or growth of some cancers. So we explored to evaluate the efficacy and safety of\n      High dose of methotrexate combined with gemcitabine, pegaspargase and dexamethasone (GAD-M\n      regimen) as first-line treatment in patients with untreated extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma."
