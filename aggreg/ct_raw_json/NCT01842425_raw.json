They are,\n      as all our patients, treated during four weeks with LCD to achieve a decrease in liver size.\n      During this period they are examined on day 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28 after commencing LCD.\n\n      At each evaluation, body composition is assessed through bioelectric impedance analysis\n      (BIA), liver volume and intrahepatic fat through magnetic resonance imaging. A questionnaire\n      regarding quality of life and LCD-related symptoms is administered as well. At surgery two\n      samples of subcutaneous fat and one sample of omental fat is taken.\n\n      We do not assign patients to different treatments, instead all are treated similarly\n      according to our routine preoperative regimen."
