Methods: This is a study of\n      cross-over. The study investigated 14 patients with mild to moderate PD. The subjects\n      performed the technique Breath-Stacking, incentive spirometry volume and participated in a\n      phase control according to randomization. The volunteers were evaluated by opto-electronic\n      plethysmography in four stages: before, immediately after fifteen and thirty minutes after\n      the completion of the techniques. The investigators used a repeated measures ANOVA with\n      post-hoc Tukey test for parametric variables, and the Friedman test with post-hoc Dunns for\n      nonparametric variables. The level of significance was set at 5%, p <0.05."
