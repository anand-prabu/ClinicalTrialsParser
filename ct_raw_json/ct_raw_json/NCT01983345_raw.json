A surgical prenatal repair of the\n      defect will be planed at 19-25+6 weeks gestation following maternal laparotomy and\n      hysterotomy under maternal general anesthesia. The delivery will be planed at 36 weeks'.\n      Postnatal evaluation of the neonates will be scheduled  at birth, 1 month and 12 months od\n      age. Those data will be matched to controls who have underwent a conventional postnatal\n      repair of the SB"
