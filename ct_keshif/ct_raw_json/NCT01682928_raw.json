This will be measured utilizing the Amniotic Fluid Volume\n      (AFV) as the primary outcome.  Secondary outcomes will be measured using Fetal Doppler\n      Studies, Maternal vital signs (Blood Pressure, Pulse Pressure, Weight, Pulse) and\n      input/output.\n\n      HYPOTHESIS: Oligohydramnios, secondary to depleted maternal intravascular volume, can be\n      reversed by improving feto- and uteroplacental perfusion with subtotal immersion therapy."

            "textblock": "BACKGROUND: The volume of amniotic fluid is relevant clinically as derangements that\n      decrease volume result in a condition known as oligohydramnios, which can have profound\n      implications on perinatal outcome. The incidence of oligohydramnios is 2.3%1,2,3 and\n      measurements of amniotic fluid volume (AFV) has become a standard in fetal surveillance in\n      the evaluation of high risk pregnancies as oligohydramnios is associated with intrauterine\n      growth restriction, respiratory distress syndrome, post-maturity syndrome, and chronic fetal\n      hypoxia.  Oligohydramnios may also play a role in fetal malpresentation, umbilical cord\n      compression, meconium staining, and increased operative delivery.3,4, 5,6 Oligohydramnios is\n      commonly defined as an AFV of 5 cm or less.  An AFV of 8 cm represents the fifth percentile\n      of normal AFV values.7  It has been observed that delivery in the setting of isolated\n      oligohydramnios, irrespective of an otherwise uncomplicated term gestation free of maternal\n      disease, has become routine thereby increasing maternal morbidity particularly in context of\n      operative delivery or failed inductions. 3\n\n      In order to understand oligohydramnios it is first important to understand intrauterine\n      water and progressive changes that occur with normal human gestation.   At term, it is\n      reported that total water accumulation is approximately 3.5L, with 2400 mL in the fetus, 400\n      mL in the placenta, and 700 mL in the amniotic fluid.8 In 1989, Brace and colleagues\n      determined amniotic fluid volume (AFV) as a function of gestational age.  They reported an\n      increase in mean values from 30mL at 10weeks to 190mL at 16wks to 780mL at 32-35wks after\n      which time AFV decreases, especially in post-term pregnancies.  It is important to realize;\n      however, that the pattern of volume fluctuation as a function of gestational age may vary\n      considerably between individuals.  As a general rule AFV increases at a rate of 10ml/wk at\n      the beginning of the fetal period, this rate of expansion increases to 50-60ml/wk from 19 to\n      25wks at which time a gradual decrease begins to take place until the rate of exchange is\n      zero around 34wks.\n\n      The pathophysiology of amniotic fluid regulation is not entirely understood at this current\n      date, but it is safe to state that AFV is the integrated sums of the inflow and outflow\n      tracts of the amniotic space.8 Because fluid can move with relative ease between fetal and\n      maternal blood across the placenta and amniotic membranes it stands to reason that a\n      maternal hypovolemia secondary to dehydration would lead to the development of\n      oligohydramnios.  This was indeed shown to be the case by Sherer, et al in their 1990\n      publication.  Furthermore, both oral and serum hydration as a way to increase maternal\n      volume have been shown to be effective treatments for oligohydramnios.3,11-16"
