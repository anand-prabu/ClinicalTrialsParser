Treatment continues for at\n      least 3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Concurrently,\n      patients continue hormonal therapy with flutamide, leuprolide, or bicalutamide at the same\n      dose as before beginning antineoplaston therapy.\n\n      Tumors are measured every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then\n      annually for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study."
