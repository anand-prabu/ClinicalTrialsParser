  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effect of packing and non-packing on the healing
      rate of perianal abscess cavities.  Secondary objectives are to assess quality of life, cost
      effectiveness and rate of abscess recurrence and fistula-in-ano formation.   If there is no
      difference in time to healing and non-packing is shown to be safe, acceptable to the patient
      and cost effective, this approach may become more widely accepted.
