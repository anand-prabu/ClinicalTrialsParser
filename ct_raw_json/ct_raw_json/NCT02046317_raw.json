            "textblock": "For bone fracture injuries, particularly femur fractures, the femoral nerve block (FNB) can\n      provide a fast and effective means to control pain. However, this method is not always\n      employed due to the fact that positioning the needle and therefore the block can be time\n      consuming and challenging, and if not precisely placed, the nerve block results in poor pain\n      control.  Traditional methods for nerve blockade include the blind technique and use of a\n      peripheral nerve stimulator (PNS). Unfortunately, neither of these methods provide a\n      reliable guide for needle placement and can lead to intraneural placement and/or failed\n      attempts.\n\n      Hypothesis: When ultrasound technology is implemented in this procedure it may improve the\n      success rate when compared to other techniques by providing real-time visual guidance. This\n      may result in a faster and prolonged pain relief reducing the amount of analgesics needed."

More so, there is even less information regarding\n      ultrasound guided nerve blocks using echogenic versus standard of care needles.\n\n      This study hopes to add to the general knowledge of pain management in the ED setting and\n      provide a unique perspective on ultrasound guided techniques using echogenic needles to\n      enhance accuracy and success rate of nerve blocks in ED patients. Results from this study\n      will be compared to the results of other similar studies to see if these findings are\n      comparative to relevant factors.\n\n      The study design will have two comparative arms; in both arms we use the same local\n      anesthetic which is Bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine; in all cases a total of 15 ml will\n      be injected around the femoral nerve. Once identified with ultrasound 5 ml will be injected\n      at lateral, medial and posterior aspect of the nerve.  The experimental arm, will receive a\n      FNB using an echogenic needle; and the control group will receive a FNB using standard of\n      care needles."
