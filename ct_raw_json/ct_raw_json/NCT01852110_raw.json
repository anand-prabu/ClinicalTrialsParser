The trial consists of two\n      stages: Stage 1 and Stage 2. Participants in Stage 1 will be randomized to receive either\n      placebo or MK-7622 45 mg once daily. In Stage 2, participants will be randomized to receive\n      either placebo, or MK-7622 5, 15 or 45 mg once daily. Participants will be enrolled in only\n      one stage. Interim analyses will be performed in both Stage 1 and Stage 2 to determine\n      whether the trial should continue. Duration of each stage is approximately 26 weeks; all\n      participants receive placebo at some time during the trial. The primary study hypotheses are\n      the following: Stage 1 - MK-7622 45 mg once daily is superior to placebo in improving\n      cognition in participants with mild to moderate AD as assessed by mean change from baseline\n      in the 11-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog11) at Week\n      12; Stage 2 - At least one of the top two doses of MK-7622 (15 mg once daily, 45 mg once\n      daily) is superior to placebo in improving cognition in participants with mild to moderate\n      AD as assessed by mean change from baseline in ADAS-Cog11 at Week 12."
