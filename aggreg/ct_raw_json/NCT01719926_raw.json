Recent preclinical\n      research has shown that in response to platinum-based chemotherapy, MSCs secrete two\n      specific platinum-induced fatty acids (PIFAs) which induce resistance to a broad spectrum of\n      chemotherapies. The secreted PIFAs are the fatty acid oxo-heptadecatetraenoic acid (KHT) and\n      the omega-3 fatty acid hexadecatetraenoic acid (16:4). These PIFAs are produced via the\n      COX-1 pathway. COX inhibitors, including indomethacin. This phase 1 study explores the\n      safety of combining indomethacin with platinum containing chemotherapy."
