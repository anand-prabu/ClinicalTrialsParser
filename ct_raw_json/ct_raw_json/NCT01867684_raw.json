Psychological distress is\n      common following brain injury, but the evidence base for specific psychotherapeutic methods\n      in this population is limited, and standard treatment approaches may not be suitable.\n      Recently there has been a growing interest in positive psychology - the study of wellbeing,\n      positive emotions and characteristics, and personal growth. The investigators believe that\n      positive psychotherapy interventions may be beneficial after acquired brain injury, to\n      reduce psychological morbidity. Because such interventions have not previously been applied\n      in this population, the investigators propose to conduct a pilot randomised controlled trial\n      to examine the feasibility of a brief positive psychotherapy intervention in an out-patient\n      setting. This project will produce essential information to allow us to plan future\n      full-scale clinical trials in this area."
