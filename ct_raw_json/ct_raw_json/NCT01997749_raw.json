Feeding the brain\n      ketone bodies  can potentially benefit a stroke patient's brain in several ways:\n\n      Stroke is characterized by impaired blood and oxygen supply to brain cells. This can cause\n      glucose to convert to lactate which is toxic for the brain. Decreasing glucose availability\n      to brain cells may thus potentially decrease the area of damage in the ischemic penumbra\n      (perifephery of the stroke). Compared with sugar, burning ketone bodies requires less oxygen\n      to produce the same amount of energy, suggesting that brain cells could have a potential\n      greater chance of surviving during circumstances of reduced oxygen supply. By decreasing\n      mitochondria activity, ROS synthesis is also decreased, which can help decrease the necrotic\n      area around the ischemic penumbra. Furthermore, the ketogenic diet does not induce an\n      increase in blood sugar which could be an advantage since many stroke patients are admitted\n      with hyperglycemia associated with a worse outcome."
