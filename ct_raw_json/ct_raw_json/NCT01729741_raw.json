Seung et al found that the (following thyroidectomy) time to discharge\n      after thyroidectomy was significantly shorter in the no drain group compared to the drain\n      group. Similar results were recorded in a study conducted by Davari et al. Hyoung et al\n      reported the incidence of hematoma formation post- thyroidectomy to be varying between\n      0.3%-4.3%. Tahsin et al reported that post-thyroidectomy bleeding is as rare as 0.3%-1.0%.\n      The fear of an hematoma enlarging and obstructing the airway and causing difficulty in\n      breathing, prompts many surgeons to use drains routinely after any type of thyroid surgery.\n      The main reason is to drain off a possible postoperative hemorrhage, which may compress the\n      airway and produce respiratory fail"
