  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity of natalizumab
      (BG00002) 300 mg subcutaneous (SC) administered to subjects with relapsing multiple
      sclerosis (RMS).  The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety of
      natalizumab SC injections and to evaluate the efficacy of natalizumab SC injections on
      relapses and on new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions.
