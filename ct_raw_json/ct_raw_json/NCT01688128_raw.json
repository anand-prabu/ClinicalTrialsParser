The Ubiquitous SMART (U-SMART) by\n      transforming the current SMART to a self-administered program using an application working\n      on IPAD was developed, and showed its feasibility and efficacy in the elderly individuals\n      with mild cognitive impairment in the preliminary study. (ClinicalTrials.gov ID:\n      NCT01628653) To validate the efficacy of the U-SMART, an open-label, controlled, crossover\n      design of clinical trial were planned in this study."
