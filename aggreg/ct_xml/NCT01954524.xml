    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Subjects will be eligible for the study if they meet the following inclusion criteria:

          1. Cirrhosis. Diagnosis of cirrhosis will be based on either liver biopsy OR clinical
             characteristics (e.g. history of ascites or encephalopathy or esophageal varices or
             gastric varices or splenomegaly or spider angioma or any clinical sign of portal
             hypertension/cirrhosis), laboratory (e.g. history of thrombocytopenia or history of
             APRI (Reference: Wai CT, Greenson JK, Fontana RJ, Kalbfleisch JD, Marrero JA,
             Conjeevaram HS, Lok AS. A simple noninvasive index can predict both significant
             fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Hepatology

             consistent with cirrhosis or history of abnormal liver function tests) and abdominal
             imaging (Magnetic Resonance Imaging or Computed Tomography or ultrasound of the
             abdomen) data

             modification of diet in renal disease study equation for estimating glomerular
             filtration rate. Ann Intern Med 2006;145:247-54)]

          4. Hypersensitivity or allergy to Sildenafil or any component of Sildenafil

          5. Previous reaction to PDE-5 inhibitors including, but not limited to  Sildenafil,
             Vardenafil,  Tadalafil, Avanafil (Myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmia,
             sudden cardiac death, cerebrovascular hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack, stroke,
             transient global amnesia, subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhages, seizure,
             recurrence in seizures, pulmonary hemorrhage, sudden decrease of hearing, loss of
             hearing, anxiety, prolonged erection, priapism, ocular redness, ocular burning,
