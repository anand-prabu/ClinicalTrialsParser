Ultrasound screening for developmental dysplasia of the\n      hip in the neonate: the effect on treatment rate and prevalence of late cases. Pediatrics\n      1994;94:47-52.\n\n      A sample of the initial RCT was invited for a maturity review/follow-up at skeletal\n      maturity.\n\n      The follow-up at skeletal maturity is called:\n\n      Radiological indices of hip dysplasia and osteoarthritis at skeletal maturity in the Bergen\n      Birth Cohort. Associations with neonatal hip dysplasia, childhood growth and genetic\n      predisposition\n\n      and is included in the approval by the Regional Ethical Committee for Medical and Health\n      Research (No 3.2006.144). All participants of the follow-up study gave written informed\n      consent according to the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n      The follow-up had the following main aims:\n\n      1) estimate the prevalence of radiologically defined hip dysplasia, femoroacetabular\n      impingement and osteoarthritis assessed at skeletal maturity 2)report the frequency of 4\n      longitudinal dysplasia phenotypes based on sonographic assessments in the newborn and\n      radiological assessments at skeletal maturity 3)investigate associations of dysplasia as\n      defined in 1 and 2 above in univariate and multivariate models with clinically assessed hip\n      joint mobility/joint hypermobility, weight, height and body mass index (BMI) at age 18/19\n      years, prepubertal weight, height and BMI trajectories using data from child health records,\n      first degree family history of hip dysplasia with or without hip arthroplasty, perinatal\n      factors, measures of OA including minimum joint space, acetabular depth ratio and reported\n      hip pain 5) establish a genetic resource by obtaining and archiving salivary DNA samples."
