The trapezius muscle is a wide, flat, superficial muscle that covers\n      most of the upper back and the posterior of the neck.The hypothesis is that the ultrasound\n      device will lower the reported daily pain level of subjects suffering from trapezius muscle\n      pain in their upper back.\n\n      Subjects who participate in the study will self-administer the ultrasound device beginning\n      at the onset of trapezius muscle pain, which is defined as a score of 3.0 or higher on a\n      scale of 1-10.  Subjects will be required to visit the clinical site at enrollment and weeks\n      2 and 4 for a total of 3 visits. Subjects will report their daily pain levels in a diary.\n\n      The wearable ultrasound device, Sam\u00ae, has been cleared by the FDA for pain relief, relief of\n      joint contracture, relief of muscle spasm, and increased circulation."

The research\n      coordinator will be blinded to the assignment of devices to each group.\n\n      The daily pain scores reported by patients who receive active devices will be compared to\n      those who receive placebo devices.\n\n      Background:\n\n      Approximately 50 to 80 million people in the United States suffer from some form of chronic\n      pain. Back pain is the most common neurological disorder in the United States after\n      headaches and costs consumers nearly $50 billion annually. Pharmaceuticals currently\n      dominate the treatment options despite a myriad of public health problems including cost,\n      untoward side effects, and addiction to widely available opioid analgesics.\n      Non-pharmaceutical treatments, such as the one under test, provide a safer and potentially\n      lower cost alternative to traditional analgesic use."
