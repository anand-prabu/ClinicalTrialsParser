Determine the efficacy of a 5-day continuous infusion of carboplatin and\n      topotecan in patients with relapsed and refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). II.\n      Assess the toxic effects of this treatment in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive continuous intravenous infusions of topotecan and carboplatin for\n      5 days. Treatment repeats every 3-4 weeks during induction (two courses) and every 6-10\n      weeks during consolidation. No more than four courses of treatment are given. Patients are\n      followed every 6 months for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 38 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5 years."
