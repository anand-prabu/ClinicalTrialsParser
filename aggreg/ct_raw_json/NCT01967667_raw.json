In this study we will\n      evaluate a liposomal formulation of glutathione for tolerability and to examine if this\n      formulation serves the function of increasing glutathione in the brain and body."

Glutathione protects the\n           brain and other organs from oxidative stress.\n\n        -  Low glutathione is associated with high oxidative stress, which has been linked to\n           aging and many illnesses. Schizophrenia is a mental illness that doctors still do not\n           fully understand. Individuals with schizophrenia often have low levels of glutathione.\n\n        -  Glutathione can be supplied through dietary supplement. However, if taken plainly, it\n           easily breaks down in our gut.\n\n        -  Scientists have now found a way to wrap glutathione in tiny drops of oil particles\n           called liposomes. That way, the gut cannot break it down so it is absorbed into our\n           body. Once inside the body, our cells can take in the liposomes and use the glutathione\n           to reduce oxidative stress.\n\n        -  Liposome-wrapped glutathione is not a drug or medicine."
