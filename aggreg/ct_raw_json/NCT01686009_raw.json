However, significant\n      barriers exist to the provision of timely analgesia by the IV route.\n\n      The use of the IN route for medication delivery provides an efficient and relatively\n      painless mode of analgesia delivery. As well, ketamine is well-known to be an effective\n      analgesic and to preserve cardiorespiratory function thus removing the necessity of\n      physiologic monitoring that is obligatory when using opioids.  The use of ketamine by the IN\n      route provides a rapid, easy-administered and well-tolerated method for providing analgesia\n      in the ED setting."
