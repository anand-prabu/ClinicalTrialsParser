Determine the response rate in patients with low-grade, mantle cell, or\n      follicular B-cell lymphoma treated with a combination of rituximab and low-dose\n      interleukin-2 (IL-2). II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of IL-2 when given in\n      conjunction with rituximab in this patient population. III. Assess whether antibody\n      dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is enhanced by in vivo exposure to IL-2 and whether\n      ADCC activity correlates with clinical response in these patients. IV. Assess the incidence\n      of antirituximab antibody formation in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) subcutaneously on days 1-5 and rituximab IV\n      on day 3. Courses repeat weekly for up to 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed weekly for 4 weeks and then every 3 months for\n      1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-29 patients with low-grade/follicular lymphoma and 14-29\n      patients with mantle cell lymphoma will be accrued for this study within 2-5 years."
