            "textblock": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum of diseases ranging from\n      simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the progressive form of liver\n      disease that can lead to cirrhosis and liver-related mortality in persons who drink little\n      or no alcohol. NAFLD is defined as the presence of hepatic steatosis with no evidence of\n      hepatocellular injury in the form of ballooning of the hepatocytes. NASH is defined as the\n      presence of hepatic steatosis and inflammation with hepatocyte injury (ballooning) with or\n      without fibrosis. NASH is benign in many affected individuals but can cause progressive\n      liver injury and, indeed, may be the major cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis1. Currently, there\n      is no FDA approved treatment for NAFLD. Weight loss and exercise are the recommended but\n      often difficult maintain these lifestyle changes in the long term and therefore therapeutic\n      agents have been investigated. In this study, we propose to treat 50 patients with NAFLD and\n      diabetes with either sitagliptin or placebo for 24 weeks. After an initial evaluation for\n      insulin sensitivity and MRI liver fat distribution, patients will receive either 100 mg/day\n      of sitagliptin or placebo. Patients will be monitored at regular intervals for symptoms of\n      liver disease, side effects of sitagliptin and serum biochemical and metabolic indices. At\n      the end of 24-weeks, patients will have a repeat medical evaluation, liver MRI and an\n      optional liver biopsy. Pre and post treatment MRI-derived liver fat content and insulin\n      sensitivity will be compared. The primary end point of successful therapy will be\n      improvement in hepatic steatosis measured by MRI. Secondary end points will be improvement\n      in insulin sensitivity and liver biochemistry."
