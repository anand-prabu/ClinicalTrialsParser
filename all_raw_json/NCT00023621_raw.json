The use of celecoxib may be an effective way to prevent the\n      development of basal cell carcinoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to determine the effectiveness of celecoxib in preventing\n      basal cell carcinoma in patients who have basal cell nevus syndrome."

Patients\n      are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. Treatment continues for 2 years in\n           the absence of unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per arm) will be accrued for this study."
