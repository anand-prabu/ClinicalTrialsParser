Patients are\n      stratified according to time since prior radiotherapy. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2\n      arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract three times\n           daily for 6 months.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive an oral placebo three times daily for 6 months. Patients are\n           followed at 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients (48 for arm I and 24 for arm II) will be accrued\n      for this study."
