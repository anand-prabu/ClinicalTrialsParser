  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to develop and test an intervention for the simultaneous treatment of
      cannabis use disorders and tobacco smoking. This is important because over 50% of adults
      seeking treatment to help stop cannabis use also smoke tobacco regularly, which decreases
      their chance for a successful treatment outcome and increases adverse acute and long-term
      psychosocial and health consequences. The proposed treatment will integrate existing
      computer-based behavioral interventions for cannabis and tobacco and use nicotine
      replacement medications to improve outcomes in this difficult to treat clinical population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 50% of persons seeking treatment for cannabis-use disorders (CUDs) regularly
      smoke tobacco. Combining tobacco with cannabis has become a common method of smoking
      cannabis. Similarities of use, and using together, can make quitting difficult.  Stopping
      tobacco simultaneously with cannabis may be beneficial. Little scientific information
      currently addresses how to best target tobacco smoking during treatment for CUDs. Our
      long-term goal is to develop an effective protocol for intervening in tobacco smoking
      without changing cannabis outcomes.  A two-phase, Stage 1 therapy development project will
      accomplish the following: First, a treatment protocol and manual will be developed that
      integrates a tailored intervention for tobacco smoking  with an intervention for CUD (Aim
      1). Utilization of web-based counseling programs will standardize delivery of the
      intervention and foster eventual dissemination. A pilot study will provide an initial test
      of acceptability and feasibility.  Second, a Stage 1, proof-of-concept study will compare
      this intervention to one that targets CUD only (Aim 2). The hypotheses assert that the
      intervention (1) will be accepted by the majority of eligible participants (2) will result
      in more tobacco quit attempts and rates than the CUD-only treatment; and (3) will not
      adversely affect cannabis outcomes. Last, the project will evaluate the potential of
      specific moderators of outcomes to predict outcomes and inform subsequent treatment
      development efforts (Aim 3). If the hypotheses were confirmed, dissemination of this
      protocol would reduce adverse psychosocial and health consequences of tobacco or cannabis
      dependence. Findings will inform future development of prevention and intervention
      strategies.
