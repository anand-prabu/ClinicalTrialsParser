            "textblock": "The main purpose of this study is to assess conception, pregnancy, childbirth, and pain\n      experiences among women who have been diagnosed with vulvodynia. Specifically, this study\n      aims to examine the following among women who have been diagnosed with vulvodynia: 1) rates\n      of pregnancy/childbirth and desire for children; 2) fear of pregnancy and childbirth; 3)\n      potential difficulties experienced while attempting to become pregnant and during\n      pregnancy/childbirth; 4) methods used to become pregnant and deliver; 5) methods used to\n      manage vulvodynia symptoms during pregnancy; and 6) pain outcomes associated with pregnancy.\n\n      Very little research has examined pregnancy/childbirth experiences among women with\n      vulvodynia, or the natural history of vulvodynia. As such this is a preliminary\n      investigation that will provide descriptive information regarding many of the proposed\n      research questions. Based on the clinical experience of the investigators, it is expected\n      that women with vulvodynia will report lower rates of pregnancy and higher levels of fear\n      about pregnancy and childbirth in comparison to women without such pain. It is also expected\n      that women with vulvodynia will report more difficulties becoming pregnant as compared to\n      women without such pain, and that women with vulvodynia will report more elective nonvaginal\n      births in comparison to vaginal births."
