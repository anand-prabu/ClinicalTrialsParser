  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this first-in-human study is to assess the local ocular and systemic safety
      and tolerability of LHA510 eye drops when administered at various concentrations and dosing
      frequencies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This first-in-human study will be conducted in two parts. Part 1 is a single ascending dose
      (SAD) design to assess the local ocular and systemic safety and tolerability of a single
      topical eye drop of LHA510 administered at various concentrations. Four separate cohorts of
      unique elderly subjects (55 to 80 years) will be utilized, with each cohort randomized to
      receive either topical LHA510 or vehicle in a 3:1 ratio as a single dose. A disposition
      evaluation will be performed 7 days later. Part 2 is a multiple ascending dose (MAD) design
      to assess the local ocular and systemic safety and tolerability of LHA510 administered at
      various concentrations and dosing frequencies. Six separate cohorts of unique AMD subjects
      will be utilized, with each cohort randomized to receive either topical LHA510 or vehicle in
      a 3:1 ratio for 7 days. A disposition evaluation will be performed 14 days after the first
      dose of study drug. A review of all available safety data will be conducted by the Sponsor
      and the PI(s) prior to dose escalation (cohort progression).
