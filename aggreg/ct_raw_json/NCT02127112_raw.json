The examiner will be blinded to the treatment and will\n      not have access to information indicating treatment assignment.  The examiner will never see\n      the patient between the time of grafting and complete healing at 4 months.  The surgical\n      procedure will consist of the reflection of a split-thickness flap to expose the alveolar\n      ridge.  Following complete exposure of the surgical site, vertical measurements will be\n      taken with the acrylic occlusal stent in place, and horizontal measurements with a specially\n      designed digital caliper.  After initial surgical measurements, numerous cortical\n      perforations will be performed with a round bur in the area of the augmentation.  The\n      control group will receive a block graft and bone screw for stabilization, with voids being\n      filled by the Optecure+CCC\u00ae.  The test group therapy will include graft with the\n      Optecure+CCC\u00ae and the use of Bone Pin\u00ae for space maintenance.  Horizontal dimension will be\n      established by graft dimensions, bone screws, or bone pins when necessary, for each planned\n      implant area.  Longer span edentulous spaces will be divided into individual sites as\n      follows: 5 mm from natural teeth to future mid-implant sites and 7 mm between two future\n      mid-implant sites. The bone pins and bone blocks with bone screws will be placed to allow\n      enough exposure for augmentation to achieve 9 mm horizontal width available for implant\n      placement. Vertical and horizontal measurements will again be taken with the acrylic\n      occlusal stent and calipers prior to flap closure.  An resorbable membrane will cover both\n      test and control groups. A monofilament suture material will be used.  The surgical\n      procedures will be documented with clinical photographs."
