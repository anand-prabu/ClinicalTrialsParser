    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of dabrafenib in treating
      patients with solid tumors and kidney or liver dysfunction. Dabrafenib may stop the growth
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicity profile and the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) of dabrafenib in
      patients with v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF)^V600X mutations and
      renal or hepatic dysfunction.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess for tumor response and various times to clinical event. II. To provide dosing
      recommendations for dabrafenib in patients with varying degrees of hepatic and renal
      dysfunction for possible inclusion in the label.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic profile of dabrafenib and active
      metabolites.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 (once daily [QD] on
      day 1 of course 1). Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
