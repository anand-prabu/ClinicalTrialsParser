            "textblock": "Higher coronary in-stent thromboses and bleeding complications on anti-platelet agents are\n      more common in Chronic Kidney Disease vs. non-Chronic Kidney Disease patients. Poor\n      inhibition of platelet aggregation by anti-platelet agents predicts future cardiovascular\n      events. Clinical practice guidelines are ambiguous about the use of these agents in Chronic\n      Kidney Disease due to lack of controlled studies. The investigators hypothesize that\n      patients with Chronic Kidney Disease compared with non-Chronic Kidney Disease have reduced\n      platelet aggregation and poor platelet inhibitory response to aspirin. The aims are to 1)\n      define the range of whole blood platelet aggregation in stages 3-5 Chronic Kidney Disease\n      patients; 2) investigate whether patients with stages 4-5 Chronic Kidney Disease vs.\n      non-Chronic Kidney Disease have lower platelet aggregation or impaired von Willebrand Factor\n      activity; and 3) compare inhibition of platelet aggregation from baseline after 2 weeks of\n      aspirin therapy and another 2 weeks of clopidogrel therapy added to aspirin in Chronic\n      Kidney Disease vs. non-Chronic Kidney Disease patients. Accomplishing these aims will\n      provide pilot data to power future studies of targeted anti-platelet agent treatments in\n      Chronic Kidney Disease in order to improve cardiovascular outcomes."

After meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria during the screening visit, those\n      patients on aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events will be asked to stop it\n      for 2 weeks prior to blood collection for baseline data. Normal controls will be chosen\n      after frequency matching for decade of age, gender, diabetes mellitus and interval of body\n      mass index (5 kg/m2). Dietary supplements (Vitamin E and fish oil) known to affect platelet\n      function will be assessed and patients on those will be asked to discontinue these.\n      Participants with also be asked to not eat foods known to affect platelet function (coffee,\n      chocolate, grapes, and alcohol) 48 hours prior to sample collection on visit 1. An\n      interviewer-administered assessment of diet and exercise with a modified 24-hour dietary\n      recall and the Stanford 7-day Physical activity Recall will be performed to ensure dietary\n      consistency which may affect platelet aggregability on visit 1. Blood will be drawn via\n      venopuncture for laboratory studies (whole blood platelet aggregation, von Willebrand Factor\n      antigen levels and activity). Participants will be administered aspirin 81 mg for 2 weeks\n      and asked to return in 2 weeks. On visit 2, whole blood platelet aggregation will be\n      re-measured and questionnaires filled out. Two oral swabs will be taken from those\n      participants who consented for genetic testing and samples will be stored at Dallas Veterans\n      Affairs Medical Center for short term until shipped to  Diagnostics Laboratory for genetic\n      testing of clopidogrel cytochrome P450 polymorphisms. All participants will be administered\n      clopidogrel 75 mg daily on top of aspirin 81 mg for 2 weeks and asked to return in 2 weeks.\n      On visit 3, whole blood platelet aggregation will be re-measured and questionnaires filled\n      out. At the completion of the study, participants will be placed back on their original\n      antiplatelet agent if applicable and referred back to the primary care provider."
