      Purpose: To study the feasibility of a larger study by determining the tolerability of
      measuring blood pressure (BP) and intraocular pressure (IOP) over 24 hours in an ambulatory
      fashion with automatic devices.

      Participants: 20 patients with moderate to severe normal tension glaucoma and 20
      non-glaucomatous patients.

      Procedures (methods): Both BP and IOP will be measured automatically in each participant in
      an ambulatory fashion during a 24-hour period. BP will be monitored using an appropriately
      sized cuff Oscar 2 (Suntech Medical, Morrisville, NC), which will be placed by a person
      trained in ambulatory BP monitoring devices. The device will be set up to automatically
      inflate every 30 minutes during the day and every hour during the night to measure and
      record the BP. IOP will be measured using Sensimed Triggerfish contact lens (Sensimed AG,
      Lausanne, Switzerland); the measurements will be taken and recorded every 10 minutes. The
      contact lens will be inserted by eye doctors (investigators).  Both monitoring devices will
      be removed the following day.

      Chart review will be performed to select potential glaucoma participants. These potential
      participants will be invited to participate in the study, either by phone or face-to-face
      during scheduled visits.

      Control participants will be invited from a registry that contains names of prior research
      participants who have agreed to be contacted about future studies (participants have worn
      ambulatory blood pressure monitor or ABPM in the past).

      Invited persons who agree to participate in the study will be scheduled for a screening
      visit at the eye clinic, during which they will learn more about the study. On the day of
      the screening visit, they will be provided with detailed information about the study, after
      which they will decide whether or not to participate. If they agree, they will sign the
      consent form. The screening visit will then be conducted by the research personnel and will
      take place at the eye clinic in a designated closed office and will include measurement of
      visual acuity, assessment of the anterior and posterior segments of the eye, measurement of
      IOP by Goldmann applanation tonometry. If after the screening exam it is determined that
      they do not qualify for the study, they will be told why they are being excluded. Healthy
      controls as well as glaucomatous patients not on treatment will be fitted with the BP and
      IOP monitoring devices. Those who are on glaucoma medication will be asked to stop their
      medication starting the day following the screening visit for the duration detailed in the
      inclusion criteria, and be given an appointment for the for IOP and BP measurement. On the
      appointment day, they will be fitted the BP and IOP monitoring devices. The BP monitor will
      be set up to take the measurements automatically every 30 min during the day and every hour
      at night until the next morning. The IOP monitor will take measurements every 10 minutes
      during the 24-hour period. Both devices are computerized and record all the measurements and
      reading times. Patients will be required to return to the clinic the next morning for
      removal of the devices, after which there will be no further visits.

        1. This study will provide for the first time information on the safety, tolerance, and
           acceptability of the two devices used together. It will also provide preliminary
           information on the reasons why people may drop out of the study, and information about
           the relationship between IOP, BP, and OPP in patients with normal tension glaucoma and
           in healthy controls.

        2. IOP will be measured with the Sensimed Triggerfish, which is a disposable silicone
           contact lens embedded with a wireless sensor. The sensing resistive gauge in the device
           is circular around the center of the lens and is placed over a circumference of 11.5 mm
           in diameter. This corresponds to the corneoscleral junction position, where maximum
           corneal deformation occurs as a result of changes in IOP. A soft patch containing the
           receiving antenna will be applied around the eye and transmits the information via wire
           to the recorder that the patient will wear around the waist. The patient can continue
           to wear  spectacles during monitoring. The device records a total of 144 measurements
           over a 24-hour period. Measurements are taken every 10 min for a total duration of 1
           min. The results obtained are presented in an arbitrary unit and not mm Hg.  In this
           study, tonometry will be performed using radiofrequency waves at 27 MHz from the
           external antenna, which is embedded in the patch applied around the patient's eye.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1) Patients with normal tension glaucoma

               -  Age minimum: 18 years

               -  Willingness to participate in the study and to sign the informed consent form.

               -  Willingness to complete a screening visit and a study visit, both at the UNC eye
                  clinic.

               -  Established diagnosis of untreated or medically treated normal tension glaucoma
                  irrespective of blood pressure level. Those currently treated with topical drops
                  will only be included in the study if they accept to stop their medication
                  according to the following plan: 1) Those treated with Alphagan, Combigan or
                  Cosopt (or Trusopt, Azopt, Diamox, Neptazane) will be asked to stop their
                  medication for a week, do the study for 24 hours, and then resume with their
                  medication. 2) Those treated with Timolol or Xalatan (or Travatan, Lumigan) will
                  be asked to stop their drops for one month, do the study for 24 hours, and then
                  resume the medication regimen. The reason for this is that the study aims at
                  investigating the relationship between blood pressure and intraocular pressure
                  in untreated patients either for glaucoma or high blood pressure. The difference
                  in duration of time during which patients will be off their glaucoma medication
                  depends on the time it takes to clear the drug in the system. In both cases,
                  glaucoma medication will be stopped from the day following the screening visit.

                  2) Non-glaucomatous healthy controls

               -  Age minimum: 18 years

               -  Willingness to participate in the study and to sign a consent form

               -  Willingness to complete a screening visit at UNC eye clinic

               -  Normal eye examination

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1) Patients with normal tension glaucoma

               -  Age less than 18 years or greater than 80 years.

               -  Patients with uveitis

               -  Ocular abnormalities preventing measurement of intraocular pressure by
                  applanation

               -  Patients on medication to treat high blood pressure will not be included in the
                  study.

               -  Patients with hyperthyroidism

               -  Patients on medication that may raise blood pressure: i.e. systemic or topical
                  steroids taken for 3 or more years for other chronic conditions; cholesterol
                  lowering medications, specifically cholestyramine (Prevalite or Questran) or
