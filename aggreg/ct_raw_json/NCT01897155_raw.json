Patients received a phenylephrine infusion to maintain systolic blood pressure (SBP) 20% to 30% under baseline. The lower limit of SBP was 75 mmHg. In the recovery room, morphine was administered routinely at doses of 3 mg IV every 15 minutes until pain was less than 4 estimated by visual analog scale (VAS). VAS and pain threshold with von Frey filaments were assessed at 2, 6, 12 and 24 postoperative hours. All patients, received ketorolac 30 mg IV every 8 hours and intravenous morphine administered by patient controlled analgesia system (PCA) during the first 24 hours."
