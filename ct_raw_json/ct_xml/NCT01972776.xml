      baseline period of 1 day, 13 days of bid dosing with study treatment, morning only treatment
      on day 14, follow up visits on days 15 - 17, followed by a study completion evaluation.

      Part 2 is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, non-confirmatory study in Gold
      I-III chronic bronchitis COPD patients. 90 patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio. The
      study will consist of up to 18 days of screening period, a 9 day run in period, one baseline
      period of 1 day, 55 days of bid dosing, morning only dosing on day 56, a follow up visit on
      day 57, followed by study completion evaluation.

    <measure>Change in Lung clearance Index (LCI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (day -1) and 56 days</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>LCI as measured by multiple breath nitrogen washout is the time taken to wash out nitrogen whilst breathing 100% oxygen. LCI will be measured at baseline and day 14. LCI will be analyzed using a Bayesian model for repeated measurements. The model may investigate effects for pre-dose baseline, treatment, time, age, COPD class, treatment by time interaction, and baseline by time interaction.</description>

    <measure>Questionnaire TDI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (day -1) and 56 days</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) captures changes from baseline. The TDI score is based on three domains with each domain scored from -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement), to give an overall score of -9 to +9, a negative score indicating a deterioration from baseline. A TDI focal score of 1 is considered to be a clinically significant improvement from baseline. Mixed model uses baseline TDI, baseline inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use, FEV1 prior to inhalation of short acting beta-agonist (SABA), and FEV1 45 minutes post-inhalation of SABA as covariates.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (day -1) and 56 days</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is the amount of air that can be exhaled in one second. FEV1 will be measured by spirometry performed at approximately the same time of day on each visit to avoid diurnal variation. All spirometry calibrations and evaluations will follow the recommendations of the American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society guidelines for acceptability. A positive change from baseline in FEV1 will indicate improvement in lung function.</description>
