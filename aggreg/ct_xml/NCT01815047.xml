  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to characterize the function and efficacy of the bioactive
      nutrient, vitamin D, in relation to infection and inflammatory status across pregnancy.  The
      three specific aims of this study are 1) To address the impact of maternal vitamin D status
      on inflammation and infections across pregnancy using retrospective data, 2) To address the
      impact of vitamin D supplementation on maternal vitamin D status, inflammation and
      infections across pregnancy using prospective data and 3) To assess the impact of maternal
      vitamin D status during pregnancy on inflammatory mediators at the level of the placenta.

      Archived serum collected from 171 adolescents at mid-gestation (approximately 26 weeks) and
      delivery will be analyzed for inflammatory cytokines. The impact of these inflammatory
      markers will be assessed by comparing the data to measures of vitamin D (25(OH)D, calcitriol
      and parathyroid hormone) and infections and inflammatory complications abstracted from
      medical charts. Placental samples were collected from a subset (n=132) of these pregnant
      teens and these tissues will be analyzed using genome wide microarray of messenger
      ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) related to inflammatory processes. A separate
      group of pregnant adolescents (n=140) will be recruited at entry into prenatal care for a
      vitamin D supplementation trial. Teens will be randomly assigned to one of two supplements
      (200 IU D3/d vs. 2000 IU D3/d). Similar to the retrospective analysis, maternal calciotropic
      hormones and inflammatory cytokines will be assessed at entry into the study, mid-gestation
      (23-28 weeks) and at delivery. Inflammatory processes and infections reported across
      pregnancy will be evaluated in relation to vitamin D status and inflammatory markers.

    <description>Maternal calciotropic hormones (25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D and PTH) and inflammatory cytokines (CRP, interleukin [IL]-6 and IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) will be measured at entry into the study and again at 23-28 weeks gestation and delivery after treatment with 200 IU or 2000 IU D3/d. These measures will be compared to inflammatory processes and infections reported in medical records across pregnancy.</description>

    <description>In a retrospective analysis, inflammatory cytokines (CRP, IL- 6 and IL-10 and TNF-alpha) in archived serum collected from a cohort of 168 adolescents that were longitudinally followed across pregnancy both at mid-gestation and at delivery will be related to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) and medically treated infections and inflammatory conditions abstracted from medical records.</description>
