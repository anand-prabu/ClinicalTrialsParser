  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of multiple doses of Dysport
      used in the treatment of upper limb spasticity (altered skeletal muscle performance) in
      children with cerebral palsy (CP).

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6 (Treatment 1)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The MAS is a 6-point scale which measures the amount of muscle tone by measuring the resistance of the muscle to passive lengthening or stretching. Score on MAS range from 0 (no increase in tone) to 4 (affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension).</description>

    <measure>Mean Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score of the Treatment Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6 (Treatment 1)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>PGA of treatment response assessed on a 9-point rating scale. Score on PGA scale range from -4 (markedly worse) to +4 (markedly improved).</description>

    <measure>Mean Goal Attainment Scale (GAS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6 (Treatment 1)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The GAS is a functional 5-point scale used to measure progress towards individual therapy goals. Individual goals defined for each subject by the Investigator and the child's parents/guardians/caregivers prior to treatment. Score on GAS range from +2 (Much more than expected outcome) to -2 (Much less than expected outcome).</description>
