After inclusion in the study, drugs for for very high blood pressure,\n      according to randomization(captopril and clonidine)will be used. clonidine and captopril are\n      administered at a dose of 25mg and 0.1mg respectively. If there is no control of blood\n      pressure in 20 minutes new hypotensive doses will be administered until a total of 150mg/day\n      (six tablets) and Captopril 0.6 mg / day (six tablets) clonidine. After exceeded the allowed\n      dose, other drugs may be associated. Initially, nifedipine (30mg/day to 60mg/day) according\n      to the service routine. The goal of intervention is to maintain a systolic blood pressure\n      below 170mmHg and diastolic pressure below 110mmHg, with the lowest possible dose. Thus,\n      these medications will be increased should the need arise, according to measurements taken\n      daily by the attending physician and the nursing staff."
