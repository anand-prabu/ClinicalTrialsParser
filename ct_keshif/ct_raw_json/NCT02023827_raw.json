            "textblock": "Juvenile crime imposes enormous costs on victims, on society, and on juvenile offenders\n      themselves. However, research assessing the efficacy of interventions for young offenders\n      show, on average, only small effects on recidivism, substance abuse, and other behavioral\n      outcomes. A major problem with existing interventions is that they tend to neglect\n      individual differences in motivation and readiness to make positive changes. In earlier\n      research, we used an empirically validated model of behavior change, the Transtheoretical\n      Model (TTM, the \"stage\" model), and expert system technology to develop the Rise Above Your\n      Situation program (RAYS), a prototype of a multimedia computerized tailored intervention\n      designed as an adjunct to traditional juvenile justice programs. The intervention delivers\n      assessments and individualized feedback matched to readiness to stay out of trouble with the\n      law and quit alcohol and drugs. At the end each session the program also generates a\n      counselor report that summarizes the youth's feedback and presents concrete,\n      easy-to-implement strategies counselors can use to reinforce stage-matched concepts. In the\n      current research, the goals are to complete development of the computerized tailored\n      intervention; develop training and other support materials for counselors; and assess the\n      efficacy of the intervention package in a randomized clinical trial involving 1,000\n      court-involved juveniles aged 13-17. Primary outcomes will be criminal recidivism and\n      substance abuse abstinence at 6 and 12 months follow-up."
