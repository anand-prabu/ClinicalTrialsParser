Researchers want see if cabozantinib can be a safe and effective\n      treatment for urothelial cancer.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To test the safety and effectiveness of cabozantinib for advanced urothelial cancer.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced urothelial cancer that has not\n      responded to standard treatments.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine\n           samples will be collected. Tumor tissue samples will also be collected. Imaging studies\n           will also be performed.\n\n        -  Participants will take cabozantinib by mouth once per day on each day of a 28-day\n           cycle.\n\n        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.\n\n        -  Participants will continue to take the study drug for as long as their cancer does not\n           worsen and side effects are not too severe."

For this reason and\n             because tyrosine kinase inhibitors agents are known to be teratogenic, women of\n             childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception  prior to\n             study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become\n\n        pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this\n        study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

Postmenopause is\n             defined as amenorrhea greater than or equal to 12 consecutive months. Note: women who\n             have been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of\n             childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy,\n             antiestrogens, ovarian suppression or any other reversible reason.\n\n        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n          -  The subject has received cytotoxic chemotherapy (including investigational cytotoxic\n             chemotherapy) or biologic agents (eg, cytokines or antibodies) within 3 weeks, or\n             nitrosoureas or mitomycin within 6 weeks before the first dose of study treatment.\n\n          -  Prior treatment with cabozantinib\n\n          -  Prior treatment with other small molecule inhibitors of VEGFR within less than or\n             equal to 2 years of study enrollment.\n\n          -  The subject has received radiation therapy:\n\n          -  to the thoracic cavity or gastrointestinal tract within 3 months  before the first\n             dose of study treatment\n\n          -  to bone or brain metastasis within 14 days before the first dose of study treatment\n\n          -  to any other site(s) within 28 days before the first dose of study treatment\n\n          -  The subject has received radionuclide treatment within 6 weeks before the first dose\n             of study treatment\n\n          -  The subject has received prior treatment with a small molecule kinase inhibitor or a\n             hormonal therapy (including investigational kinase inhibitors or hormones) within 14\n             days or five half-lives of the compound or active metabolites, whichever is longer,\n             before the first dose of study treatment.\n\n          -  The subject has received any other type of investigational agent within 28 days\n             before the first dose of study treatment.\n\n          -  The subject has not recovered to baseline or CTCAE .
