Combining more than one drug and combining chemotherapy with\n      surgery may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well irinotecan and cisplatin followed by\n      surgery, floxuridine, and cisplatin work in treating patients with stomach cancer."

This\n      course is repeated 2 weeks later.\n\n      Patients who achieve complete or partial remission or stable disease undergo resection 4\n      weeks after the last chemotherapy dose.\n\n      Patients with no residual macroscopic disease begin adjuvant intraperitoneal (IP)\n      chemotherapy 1 week after surgery. Chemotherapy consists of floxuridine IP over 30 minutes\n      on days 1-3 and days 22-24 and cisplatin IP on days 3 and 24.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-33 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
