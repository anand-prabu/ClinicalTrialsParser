      This trial will test the effectiveness of an enhanced web-based smoking cessation
      intervention for student smokers at 2-year Community Colleges. Young adults continue to be
      understudied, so more studies of cessation interventions are needed to generate an
      acceptable level of strength of evidence regarding quit rates, particularly so for Community
      College students for whom little data on cessation are available. Students (research
      subjects) will be directed to one of two intervention websites with various levels of novel
      interactive and social network features, including a variety of better-practice features
      recommended by recent literature, and technologically advanced proactive features (e-mails,
      SMS texting, and social networking).

      Our study hypothesizes that students with access to an enhanced website will have higher
      rates of self-reported intention to quit, a higher number of quit attempts at 6-months
      compared to those in in a non-enhanced website. Overall, this study will evaluate evidence
      for a novel enhanced cessation intervention model and will add to our understanding of
      successful intervention with an understudied population of primarily young adult Community
      College smokers. The intervention components will be replicable and, if effective, the
      methodology is applicable across populations, and has the potential for broad public health
      impact through improved delivery of effective stop smoking interventions via the internet.

      Purpose of the study. This group randomized controlled trial will test the effectiveness of
      an enhanced web-based cessation intervention for student smokers at 2-year Community
      Colleges (CC). Compared to the smoking rates of the general population (18%), smoking rates
      among CC students varies but remains substantially higher (28-30%). Evaluations of
      Web-Assisted Tobacco Interventions (WATI) for smoking cessation treatment with young adults
      in more traditional 4-year college settings have yielded encouraging preliminary data
      regarding intervention effectiveness. Young adults continue to be understudied, so
      additional randomized designed studies of cessation interventions are needed to generate an
      acceptable level of strength of evidence regarding quit rates, particularly so for CC
      students for whom little data on cessation are available. This critical population is likely
      to be increasing for several reasons, including President Obama's American Graduation
      Initiative, which provides resources to increase Community College enrollment by 5 million
      additional graduates by 2020. In the proposed trial, subjects on campuses randomized to the
      basic intervention arm will be directed to a minimally interactive website standardized to
      comply with 2008 DHHS Clinical Practice Guidelines for adult smokers. Those at campuses in
      the enhanced intervention arm will be directed to an enhanced site that adds novel
      interactive and social network features, including a variety of better-practice features
      recommended by WATI workshops, recent literature, and technologically advanced proactive
      features (e-mails, SMS texting, and social networking).  Our study has the following
      Specific Aims:

      Primary Aims Aim 1:To test the effectiveness of an Enhanced interactive WATI (E-WATI) vs. a
      Basic WATI (B-WATI) among Community College students (primarily young adults). The online
      methodology will maximize population access and, if effective, can be recommended as a
      feasible cessation option.

      Aim 2:To evaluate both WATI options for overall usability, as well as for the usability and
      perceived helpfulness of key features (i.e., basic, novel, high-tech, proactive and
      interactive components), and their relationship to cessation.

      Secondary Aim Aim 3:To develop and evaluate strategies to recruit and retain an understudied
      population of Community College smokers using WATI interventions. Evaluation of recruitment
      strategies will be useful to the current trial, as well as well as to future trials with
      this population.

      This study will be conducted in three phases, using a mixed methods approach.  Phase 1
      qualitative research in Year 01 will help guide and refine recruitment and retention and
      delivery strategies. In Phase 2, a group randomized trial in Years 02-04 will randomize 16
      Community Colleges (8 matched pairs; 1,440 smokers) to one of two interventions: 1) B-WATI -
      a basic website for cessation comparable to those for general adult populations, including
      established evidence-based cessation information and features; or 2) E-WATI - an enhanced
      and highly interactive website for cessation. Phase 3 dissemination in Year 05 will involve
      interpretation of study results, guidance for further research, and dissemination of study
      findings, including recommendations for including WATI cessation for campus-based referral
      strategies. To address the Specific Aims, our study has these Primary Hypotheses:

      H1.0:  Smokers in E-WATI will have higher biochemically verified point-prevalence abstinence
      at 6-months compared to those in the B-WATI group. Secondary hypotheses for smoking-related
      outcomes explore: (H1.1) higher rates of self-reported intention to quit; (H1.2), a higher
      number of quit attempts at 6-months in the E-WATI group compared to those in B-WATI and
      higher quit rates at 12 months for the subsample available for follow-up; (H1.3) higher
      number of prolonged abstinence participants at 6-months, and (H1.4), greater movement
      through Stages of Change.

      H2.0:  Smokers in the E-WATI group, compared to those in B-WATI, will demonstrate more
      interactivity and engagement with web-based features and interventions as measured by
      website usability analysis and higher self-report of the number and type of selected online
      strategies at 6-month follow-up.

      H3.0:  Web-based features will be perceived as more helpful for smoking cessation by those
      in E-WATI compared to those in B-WATI as measured by the 6-month follow-up questionnaire.

      Overall, this study will evaluate evidence for a novel enhanced cessation intervention model
      and will add to our understanding of successful intervention with an understudied population
      of primarily young adult Community College smokers. The intervention components will be
      replicable and, if effective, the WATI methodology is applicable across heterogeneous
      populations and geographic areas, and has the potential for broad public health impact
      through improved delivery of effective cessation interventions via the internet.

    <description>Our primary outcome is biochemically-verified point-prevalence abstinence at 6 months, defined as no cigarettes in the past 7 days (not even a puff) and no other tobacco use. Biochemical verification will measure salivary cotinine (&lt;10ng/ml confirms abstinence). Using Intent-to-Treat analysis, subjects who drop out or refuse biochemical verification will be considered smokers.  We will also assess prolonged abstinence, defined as no smoking or other tobacco use following a grace period for cessation (defined for the current trial as 1 month).</description>
