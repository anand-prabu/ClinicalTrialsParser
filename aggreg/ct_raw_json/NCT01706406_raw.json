            "textblock": "Sexual arousal difficulties are common among women, affecting approximately 22% of women\n      between the ages of 18 and 59 (Laumann, Paik & Rosen, 1999). Although there are\n      evidence-based psychological treatments available for women with orgasmic and pain\n      disorders, there are currently no empirically-supported treatments for women with acquired\n      Sexual Arousal Disorder (FSAD). Moreover, there have been numerous attempts to find evidence\n      for a pharmacological agent effective at treating women's sexual arousal complaints;\n      however, to date these studies have been inconclusive. Given the significant role that\n      sexual health plays in quality of life, the fact that effective psychological treatments for\n      women's sexual dysfunction are not widely available, and the fact that wait-lists to see\n      health care professionals with expertise in the area of sexual dysfunction are often\n      unwieldy, there is a need to establish brief, evidence-based approaches to treat women's\n      acquired FSAD. Psychological therapy in a group format is a standard practice at the BC\n      Centre for Sexual Medicine. However, in this study we would like to collect information from\n      participants that would help us in determining the specific efficacy of the PED as well as\n      identifying demographic or participant variables that might predict a positive response to\n      the PED. Because we are using this information to determine the treatment's efficacy and\n      because we will use this information as the basis for a publication, we deem this to be a\n      research trial in which ethics review is necessary.\n\n      OBJECTIVES: We have recently developed and tested a new psychoeducational treatment (PED)\n      for the treatment of FSAD due to early-stage gynecologic cancer treatment, and for healthy\n      women with FSAD. Our data show this PED to significantly improve self-reported sexual\n      desire, arousal, mood, relationship distress, and quality of life. We are currently testing\n      the efficacy of this PED in a larger sample of cancer survivors with FSAD. The goal for this\n      study is to determine the efficacy of the group PED for currently seeking treatment at the\n      BC Centre for Sexual Medicine for FSAD. By using a waitlist control group, we can determine\n      if any improvement in sexual function is due to treatment or the passage of time."
