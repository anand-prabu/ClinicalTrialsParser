Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune\n      disease characterized by a chronic inflammatory state which is associated with the disease\u00b4s\n      clinical symptoms. Thus, we hypothesized that EPA and DHA supplementation may beneficially\n      affect the inflammatory cytokine profile and clinical features of LES patients."
