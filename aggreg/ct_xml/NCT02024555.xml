    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of oral
      antimycobacterial therapy in patients with confirmed progressive pulmonary sarcoidosis.  We
      suspect that the CLEAR regimen will improve the absolute FVC percent predicted in chronic
      pulmonary sarcoidosis participants.

      Primary Objective:  To assess the efficacy and safety of oral CLEAR therapy in patients with
      confirmed progressive pulmonary sarcoidosis.

      Hypothesis: The CLEAR regimen will improve the absolute FVC percent predicted in chronic
      pulmonary sarcoidosis participants by augmenting T cell responses through the normalization
      of p56Lck expression and IL-2 production.

             defined by the clinical presentation consistent with sarcoidosis, as well as biopsy
             demonstrating granulomas, and no alternative for the cause of the granulomas, such as
             tuberculosis for at least one year prior to randomization.  Tuberculosis must be
             ruled out by negative histology and culture.

          -  Diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis was made at least 1 year prior to consent date.

          -  Evidence of disease progression as defined by at least two of the following four
             criteria:

               1. Decline of absolute percent predicted of FVC (FVC&gt;45% and &lt;=90% of predicted
                  value) or DLCO of at least 5% on serial measurements (DLCO range &gt;35%, if
                  measured);

               2. Radiographic progression in chest imaging on side by side comparison;

               3. Change in dyspnea score, as measured by Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI);

             regimen.

                  treating infection, within 14 days of baseline. Minocycline and doxycycline are
                  not considered antibiotics when used to treat sarcoidosis.

               -  Any significant finding in the patient's medical history or physical or
                  psychiatric exam prior to or after randomization that, in the opinion of the
