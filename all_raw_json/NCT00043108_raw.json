Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Giving combination chemotherapy with radiation therapy before and after surgery may\n      shrink the tumor so it can be removed during surgery and may kill any remaining tumor cells\n      following surgery.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining paclitaxel and carboplatin\n      with radiation therapy and surgery in treating patients who have newly diagnosed locally\n      advanced non-small cell lung cancer."

Patients\n      with resectable disease undergo surgical resection within 4-8 weeks after induction therapy.\n      Patients with unresectable disease undergo additional radiotherapy 5 days a week for 3 weeks\n      and receive paclitaxel and carboplatin as in induction therapy on days 1, 8, and 15.\n\n      Within 4-12 weeks after surgery or additional chemoradiotherapy, patients receive adjuvant\n      therapy comprising paclitaxel and carboplatin as in induction therapy on day 1. Adjuvant\n      treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 3 courses.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 57 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years."
