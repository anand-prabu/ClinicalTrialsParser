  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The field of neuroeconomics has begun to elucidate neural mechanisms underlying
      self-control; however, researchers have not yet harnessed neuroeconomics findings to develop
      interventions for improving self-control ability. The investigators are currently developing
      such an intervention. The investigators' approach involves using a brain-computer interface
      with audiovisual feedback to show people what is happening in their own brains, in real
      time. Through this interface, individuals are trained to increase levels of neural activity
      that may facilitate self-control, which, in turn, may improve the ability to exhibit
      self-controlled behaviors. This may increase the ability to engage in heath behaviors for
      which self-control is required (eg, dieting and exercising). The investigators' long-term
      goal is to create a tool that will help people develop the self-control needed to achieve
      lasting improvements in health behaviors.
