      This is a subject-masked, dispensing study designed to evaluate the clinical performance and
      subjective acceptance when comparing two different daily disposable limbal ring lenses.
      Limbal ring lenses, which as well as correcting vision, have a colored ring which enhance
      the wearer's iris and are particularly popular in East Asian countries.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will only be eligible for the study if:

          -  They are 18 years of age and above.

          -  They understand their rights as a research subject and are willing and able to sign a
             Statement of Informed Consent.

          -  They are willing and able to follow the protocol.

          -  They agree not to participate in other clinical research for the duration of this
             study.

          -  They can attain at least 6/9 in each eye with the study lenses within the available
             power range.

          -  They can be fitted with study lenses within the available power range.

          -  The currently use soft contact lenses, or have done so within the last six months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will not be able to take part in the study if:

          -  They have an ocular disorder which would normally contraindicate contact lens wear.

          -  They have a systemic disorder which would normally contraindicate contact lens wear.

          -  They are using any topical medication such as eye drops or ointment.

          -  They have had cataract surgery.

          -  They have had corneal refractive surgery.

          -  They have any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid lens wear or
             have keratoconus.

          -  They are pregnant or lactating.

          -  They have any ocular abnormality which would, in the opinion of the investigator,
             normally contraindicate contact lens wear.

          -  They have any infectious disease which would normally contraindicate contact lens
             wear, or may, in the opinion of the investigator, pose a risk to study personnel; or
             any immunosuppressive disease (e.g. HIV), or a history of anaphylaxis or severe
             allergic reactions.

          -  They have taken part in any other clinical trial or research, within two weeks prior
             to starting this study.
