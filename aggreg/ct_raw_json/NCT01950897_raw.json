            "textblock": "Muscular dystrophies are caused by mutations in more than 30 genes, some of them remaining\n      to be identified. Phenotypically, it is known that one specific mutation can affect the\n      expression of several other proteins, causing difficulty in diagnosis. Correct genotyping is\n      essential for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment, and relies on a complexed analysis of\n      muscle tissues for phenotype profiles. Our research aims to understand how different gene\n      mutations affect expression of other genes via muscle biopsy samples and establishment of\n      phenotypic profiles for correct diagnosis of individual patients.  Establishment of such\n      information will be critical for understanding the progression of different muscular\n      dystrophies and to devise new experimental therapies.  The research will also provide vital\n      clues for finding new genes involved in the disease process. Muscle samples may also be used\n      to establish cell cultures for testing drugs and new therapies relevant to the treatment of\n      the muscular dystrophies."
