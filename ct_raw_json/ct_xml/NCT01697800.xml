  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a lethal solid malignancy with 5 year
      survival estimates of approximately 50%, and is associated with a high rate of systemic
      immune impairment as well as evasion of a tumor specific immune response. Preclinical and
      clinical data have shown that PDE5 inhibitors (tadalafil) can be used to augment immune
      function in HNSCC patients through inhibition of the cancer-induced myeloid derived
      suppressor cells (MDSCs).

      A multi site phase II, randomized, prospective, biomarker endpoint trial to determine
      optimum timing and design of PDE5 antitumor immunotherapy (tadalafil) in conjunction with
      conventional therapy for HNSCC.

      40 patients with biopsy proven HNSCC will be randomized to receive tadalafil (n=25) or
      placebo (n=15) for at least 10-14 days before starting conventional therapy and continuing
      until 90 days after completion of conventional therapy.  Tumor-specific T cell responses
      will be assessed using HNSCC cell lines, in blood collected before initiation of
      tadalafil/placebo and at 60 and 90 days after completion of conventional therapy. Number and
      function of MDSC and Treg cells will be assessed before and at 60 and 90 days after
      completion of conventional therapy.  Prevnar 13® vaccine will be administered 10-14 days
      after commencing tadalafil/placebo (before conventional therapy begins) and again at 60 days
      after completion of conventional therapy. Vaccine-specific responses assessed at 60 and 90
      days post-conventional therapy will be used to measure the ability of tadalafil to augment
      immune response to vaccine.

             treatment for primary disease or last recurrence).  Patients may have local Stage I
             or II, or locoregionally advanced HNSCC Stage III or IV of the oral cavity,
             oropharynx, larynx, hypopharynx, or unknown primary, but no metastatic disease;
             Intent to treat with primary radiotherapy +/-chemotherapy

          3. Disease location amenable to biopsy in outpatient clinical setting or operative
             biopsy within routine accepted schedule and practice of clinical care

          4. ECOG performance status 0-1

          5. Required laboratory data (to be obtained within 2 weeks of initiation):
