Giving\n      low doses of chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor stem cell transplant\n      helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also the patient's immune system from\n      rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune\n      cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the\n      transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal\n      cells. Giving a bortezomib at the time of transplant may stop this from happening.\n      Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different\n      ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Giving lenalidomide after donor stem cell\n      transplant may be an effective treatment for multiple myeloma."
