    <textblock>
      Trial to optimize neoadjuvant therapy for HER overexpression and co-expressing of hormone
      receptors(ER and/or PR) breast cancer (HEr2+/HR+).

      A new high potential trastuzumab conjugate T-DM1(trastuzumab was linked with the cytotxic
      agent mertansine DM1)was tested with endocrine therapy and without against a standard arm
      with trastuzumab and endocrine therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      the neoadjuvant therapy Patients with HER2+/HR+ (HER2+ and ER+ and/or PR+) tumor will
      receive single agent T-DM1 for 12 weeks (3,6 mg/kg q3w) with or without standard endocrine
      therapy (tamoxifen in premenopausal women and an aromatase inhibitor in postmenopausal
      women, if not contraindications are present, in a standard daily dosage). The control group
      will receive trastuzumab in 3-weekly schedule (8 mg/kg as loading dose and then 6 mg/kg q3w)
      in combination with the same standard endocrine therapy, if no contraindications are
      existent.
