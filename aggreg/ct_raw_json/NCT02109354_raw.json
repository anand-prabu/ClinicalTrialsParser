HIV is the virus that\n      causes AIDS. Tetanus is an infection that causes muscular spasms. Hepatitis B is a virus\n      that can cause liver failure.\n\n      About 100 people will take part in this study at multiple sites. The US National Institutes\n      of Health (NIH) is paying for the study.\n\n      We are doing this study to answer several questions.\n\n        -  Are the HIV study vaccines safe to give to people?\n\n        -  Are people able to take the HIV study vaccines without becoming too uncomfortable?\n\n        -  How do people's immune systems respond to the HIV study vaccines? (Your immune system\n           protects you from disease.)\n\n        -  Can people's immune responses to a tetanus or hepatitis B vaccines help us understand\n           how their immune systems might respond to the HIV study vaccines?\n\n        -  Is there a common immune response to licensed vaccines like the tetanus and hepatitis B\n           vaccines?"
