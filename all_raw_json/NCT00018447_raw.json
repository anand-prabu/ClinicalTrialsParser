PTH will be administered\n      subcutaneously by injection 600 units daily for 28 days the first month of each 3-month\n      cycle.  Fluoride will be administered orally one 76mg tablet twice daily (providing 20 mg\n      fluoride/day), during the last 2 months of each cycle.  Calcium will be provided 800mg/day\n      during month 1 and 1500-2000mg for months 2 and 3 of each cycle."
