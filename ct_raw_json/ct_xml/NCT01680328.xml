  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to assess and describe the pain
      in relation to subcutaneous (under the skin) injection of different combinations of
      injection speed and volume with respect to acceptance of the injection pain and back flow.

    <description>Subjects will receive 19 injections in randomised order of which 13 will be in the abdomen and 6 in the thighs. Out of these 19 injections two are needle insertions only. The remaining 17 injections represent different combinations of injection speed and volume of sodium chloride 0.9% solution for injection. The order of the injection speed and volume combinations will be blinded for the subject and the pain will be evaluated by the subject on a VAS (Visual Analogue Scale).</description>
