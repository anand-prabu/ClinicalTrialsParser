It is not yet known whether\n      immunosuppressive therapy is more effective than supportive care in treating myelodysplastic\n      syndrome.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of antithymocyte globulin\n      with that of supportive care in treating patients who have myelodysplastic syndrome."

Patients are stratified\n      according to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) subtype (refractory anemia (RA) vs RA with\n      excess blasts or hypocellular MDS). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) IV over at least 8-12\n           hours on days 1-4.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive standard supportive therapy for 6 months. At the end of 6\n           months, patients may receive ATG as in arm I.\n\n      Patients are followed for 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients (48 in arm I and 24 in arm II) will be accrued\n      within a minimum of 6 months."
