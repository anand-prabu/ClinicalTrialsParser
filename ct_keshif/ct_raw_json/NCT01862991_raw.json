            "textblock": "This research study investigates the use of a drug, mifepristone, given before second\n      trimester abortion. Mifepristone is a medication that is approved for medical abortion\n      during the first trimester. It also has been used prior to abortion in the early seconds\n      trimester (14-16 weeks gestation) and for medication abortion in the second trimester (also\n      called induction abortion). This medication has effects on the uterus that may help dilate,\n      or open, the cervix. Abortion requires opening of the cervix to safely remove the pregnancy.\n      Cervical dilation, or opening, is essential to both ease of completion of procedure and\n      reducing complications that can occur. These complications include laceration, or tearing,\n      of the cervix and perforation of the uterus (a hole made unintentionally in the muscle wall\n      of the uterus) and are not expected to be increased in the study. Dilation of the cervix is\n      usually achieved by placing thin rods (cervical dilators) through the cervix. These rods\n      then absorb the moisture of the vagina and slowly expand, opening the cervix. The standard\n      method of dilation is performed at the clinic and involves the placement of cervical\n      dilators the day before the procedure. This procedure can be uncomfortable. A prior study\n      showed that mifepristone reduces the number of osmotic dilators that need to be placed prior\n      to the procedure after 19 weeks gestation. We aim to investigate mifepristone as a potential\n      adjunct to cervical dilation or used alone, without dilators, as method of cervical\n      preparation with the hopes of reducing barriers imposed by painful procedures and time in\n      clinic and away from work/home that the current approach involving dilators requires."
