  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program - Education (SNAP-Ed) is a national initiative
      with the goal of improving the health and wellbeing of low income families. University of
      Minnesota Extension every year offers nearly 4000 educational events, serving approximately
      70,000 Minnesotans through the program. Extension is conducting an impact study to determine
      program effectiveness and assess sustained changes of participants and their families that
      can be directly attributed to programming on a larger and methodically sound scale.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess changes in adiposity level among the program participants indicated by BMI measurements.</measure>
    <time_frame>We will assess BMI in the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 12th month</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>We assess BMI of participants by using standardized stadiometers and weighing scales to attain weights and heights. Birthdates and sex of program participants were also acquired. Then, using the information of their birthdates, weight and heights, BMI percentile and BMI will be computed and analyzed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess changes of fruit and vegetable intake and among program participants.</measure>
    <time_frame>We will measure the changes of fruits and vegetable intakes in the 1st month (baseline), 3rd month, 7th month, and 12th month</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>We use fruits and vegetables frequency retrospective questions and &quot;A day in the life&quot; survey to assess the fruits and vegetable intake. Composite values of these two measures will decide the levels of changes in intakes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess changes of physical activity levels among program participants.</measure>
    <time_frame>We will measure the changes of physical activity level in the 1st month (baseline), 3rd month, 7th month, and 12th month</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>We use Yamax Digiwalker (SW700) pedometer, physical activity questions, and parent proxy surveys to assess the physical activity levels. Composite values of all measures will be computed to determine the levels of change.</description>
