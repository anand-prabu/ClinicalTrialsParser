The CG underwent a sham protocol\n      (light touch), with same sets and time of interval.\n\n      Outcome measures: The groups were evaluated using spirometry, manovacuometry and\n      optoelectronic plethysmography (OEP), in that order, before and immediately after the\n      intervention."

Positioned behind the head of the volunteer, the therapist performed manual contact (pisiform, ulnar edge and the last three fingers) with the underside of the costal cartilage of the 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th rib, and guiding forearms toward the shoulders of the corresponding side. In the inspiratory phase, the therapist gently pulled the points of contact with both hands, in the direction of the head, yet slightly lateral, accompanying the elevation movement of the ribs. During exhalation, the therapist deepened contact toward the inner costal, maintaining resistance throughout the inspiratory phase. In the breaths following, the therapist sought to gain traction and smooth increase in the deepening of contacts. This maneuver was performed in two sets of ten deep breaths, with a one minute interval between them.",
