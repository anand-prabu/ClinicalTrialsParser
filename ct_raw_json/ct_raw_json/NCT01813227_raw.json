            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an investigational\n      study drug called carfilzomib.  The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or\n      bad, it has on patients and their cancer if treatment continues beyond previous carfilzomib\n      treatment study.\n\n      Carfilzomib (KyprolisTM) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be\n      used only in certain U.S. patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma that have\n      tried and failed other therapies. It has not been approved to be used for any other disease\n      or condition.\n\n      In this study, carfilzomib is referred to as an investigational study drug because it is not\n      approved for use in all patients with multiple myeloma in the United States, and it is not\n      approved by some regulatory authorities (the agencies that are responsible for approving the\n      use of a medicine in a country such as Health Canada).\n\n      Carfilzomib is a type of drug called a proteasome inhibitor.  A proteasome is a protein\n      found within cells that has the important role of identifying and marking damaged proteins\n      that are needed to be destroyed by the cell for survival.  The inhibition of the proteasome\n      allows for damaged protein to accumulate within cells.  This accumulation of damaged protein\n      causes the cell to die."

There is a higher incidence in males\n      compared to females (3.4 vs 1.7 cases per 1 million person-years at risk) and WM is nearly\n      twice as common among whites compared to blacks.[1] A familial form of the disease is also\n      recognized. WM is an indolent disease with an overall median survival of 5 years although\n      more recent data suggest a disease-specific median survival of 11.2 years, given the\n      frequently older age (median 63 years) and accompanying co-morbidities at diagnosis(1). WM\n      is characterized by infiltration of lymphoplasmacytic cells and bone marrow and by serum\n      immunoglobulin M (IgM) monoclonal gammopathy. B-cell origin and some clinical cellular and\n      epidemiological features are shared among WM arises from intermediately mature B cells\n      (somatically mutated post germinal center the lymphocytes that have not yet undergone\n      isotype switching), as opposed to immature B cells from which chronic lymphocytic leukemia\n      arises in the fully mature, somatically mutated, from which cells multiple myeloma arises.\n\n      There is no standard of care for WM (2). Therefore, involving the patient's in clinical\n      trials is strongly recommended whenever possible."
