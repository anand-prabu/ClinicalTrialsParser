The\n      second group will continue to receive conventional medical therapy as prescribed by their\n      doctor and will not be implanted with a pacemaker. Clinical histories, physical exams, and\n      external device testing will be collected both at the time of enrollment in the trial and\n      during follow-up study visits.

Relevant event history, cardiac medications, physical assessment, device\n      interrogation/programming status and adverse events will be collected at each follow-up\n      visit. At the 6-month visit, a repeat echocardiogram and a 12-lead ECG will be obtained.\n      Subjects will be followed through the 6 month visit. After that, subjects will have a safety\n      follow up contact at the end of the study. The study will end when the last randomized\n      subject reaches the 6 months visit."
