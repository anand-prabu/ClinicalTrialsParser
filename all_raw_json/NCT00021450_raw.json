Bicalutamide and\n      goserelin may fight prostate cancer by reducing the production of testosterone. It is not\n      yet known if radiation therapy is more effective with or without bicalutamide and goserelin\n      in treating prostate cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy with\n      or without bicalutamide and goserelin in treating patients who have localized prostate\n      cancer."

Patients are stratified according to tumor\n      class (T1b-c vs T2a), initial prostate-specific antigen level (10 ng/mL vs 10-20 ng/mL vs\n      greater than 20 ng/mL), Gleason score (2-6 vs 7-10) and participating center. Patients are\n      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy or intensity-modulated\n           radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 7-7.5 weeks.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive adjuvant oral bicalutamide once daily on days 1-30 and\n           goserelin subcutaneously on days 8 and 98. Beginning on day 8, patients undergo\n           radiotherapy as in arm I.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then at months 6, 12, 24, and 36.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 800 patients (400 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 5 years."
