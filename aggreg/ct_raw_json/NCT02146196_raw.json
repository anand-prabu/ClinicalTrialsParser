            "textblock": "Rehabilitation in heart failure medicine is limited due to many comorbidities and reduced\n      exercise capacity in this patient group. In patients after cardiac surgery rehabilitation is\n      sometimes difficult especially due to ICU- acquired weakness following a prolonged intensive\n      care course.  To tackle these problems and enable recovery and rehabilitation many of the\n      conventional methods are lacking feasibility. During the next decades increasing numbers of\n      older and more frail patients in the field of advanced heart failure are expected. To\n      establish a new method for rehabilitation we use technology well established in other\n      divisions of medicine. Robotic assisted gait therapy is well established in neurology in\n      paraplegic and tetraplegic patients, patients after stroke and traumatic injured patients.\n      Gait therapy is used to re-establish the normal course of motion. The Lokomat \u00ae (Hocoma AG)\n      is therefore used in over 25 countries worldwide. The combination of different training\n      modes (interval training, endurance training and strength training) is one of the\n      advantages. The most important benefit is the possibility to extend or relieve the robotic\n      assistance up to a point without support on the one hand and full support from the Lokomat \u00ae\n      on the other hand and relieve the patient partly or complete from his bodyweight. This\n      enables the therapist to plan the most possible individual training almost independent from\n      his  exercise capacity for each patient. Up to now heart failure is a contraindication for\n      training with the Lokomat \u00ae. Therefore a clinical trial is necessary to establish this\n      method in the field of heart failure medicine.  In our prospective trial we investigate two\n      points after a feasibility trial first, were healthy persons and  patients with NYHA 1 or\n      less are trained for safety reasons, to establish possible protocols and get familiar with\n      the robotic assisted gait therapy.  In the prospective trial we train patients with stable\n      heart failure (NYHA 2 or NYHA 3) and a left ventricular ejection fraction  less than 45% for\n      4 weeks with 3 trainings per week.\n\n      Timeframe for heart failure Patients: Screening day0; Baseline/Start of the training day0\n      +(0-5days); training period day0+ (0-5days) up to 4 Weeks, 28 days of training with the\n      Lokomat\u00ae. Each week three training periods;  End of Study Visit after 4 to 5 Weeks from\n      baseline.\n\n      Timeframe for patients after cardiac surgery: Screening day0; baseline/start of the training\n      day0 +(0-2days); training period one week with the Lokomat\u00ae with three training sessions;\n      end of study visit after one week, telephone follow up six weeks after end of study visit.\n      Due to the character as a pilot trial, there are no end points, but stress test\n      (spiroergometry), blood sample (interleukin 6, CRP, BNP) , strength measurement of the Musc.\n      quadriceps  and a quality of life questionnaire (SF 36) are taken at baseline (day0) and\n      after the 4 week training period at end of study visit. Patients after cardiac surgery are\n      trained with another strategy. There the safety aspect is the most important in this pilot\n      trial. Patients after cardiac surgery are trained with the Lokomat\u00ae during initial\n      hospitalization for one week with three sessions. A six minute walking test is done at at\n      baseline/start of the training day0, expected at day 3 to 10 after surgery, and after one\n      week of training at end of study visit day seven. A follow up of this patients six weeks\n      after hospital discharge is done for possible deep sternal wound infection, telephone follow\n      up.\n\n      Each training in each group lasts 30-45minutes.  Each group should contain 5-6 patients."
