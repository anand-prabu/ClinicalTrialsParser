  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is designed to test the hypothesis that targeted electrical stimulation
      will result in upper limb tremor reduction in ET and PD patients.

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of Rainbow Medical's stimulation procedure methodology
      that will be applied temporarily to patients suffering of tremor.

      This will be evaluated by assessment of reduction of tremor using accelerometer
      measurements, patient tremor evaluation diary, tremor rating scale, and the Unified
      Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPRDS) part III.In addition,tasks for patient with tremor
      will be conducted before during and after the treatment. The above measurements will provide
      data on the stimulation procedure effect as compared to baseline.
