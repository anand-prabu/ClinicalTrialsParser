            "textblock": "The serious doubts about the nutritional adequacy of vegetarian diets in the past were\n      essentially put to rest by recent studies that suggested that plant-based diets are healthy\n      and associated with lower risk of several chronic diseases. Nevertheless, various\n      nutritional deficiencies have been identified, and it has been shown that individuals who\n      follow different types of vegetarian/vegan diets may not experience the same effects on\n      their health.\n\n      Working Hypothesis\n\n        1. Vegetarian/vegan diets will promote protection against cardiovascular risk factors if\n           supplemented with possibly deficient nutrients.\n\n        2. There will a further protective effect and a greater number of differences between\n           subjects following a vegetarian diet compared to those following a vegan diet.\n\n        3. Higher energy expenditure and lower and different caloric intake will promote a\n           favorable difference in body composition (lower body fat) via a different substrate\n           utilization expressed in the measured respiratory quotient (RQ).\n\n        4. Extra- and intracellular free radicals will be higher in subjects who adhere to\n           vegetarian/vegan diets compared to omnivores.\n\n      Aims of the study\n\n        1. To study the effect of vegetarian/vegan diets on endothelial functions after correcting\n           for modifying factors.\n\n        2. To study the effect of the above-mentioned plant-based diets on carotid intima-media\n           thickness.\n\n        3. To study the differences in body composition, resting energy expenditure and over-night\n           substrate utilization between the different diets.\n\n        4. To study the intracellular ROS of subjects following different diets."
