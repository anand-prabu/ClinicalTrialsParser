This study will support the\n      establishment of scientifically based standards for evaluating drugs which act locally\n      within the gastrointestinal tract.  Specific objectives of this study are to: (1) quantify\n      how the plasma concentrations of mesalamine, an agent used to treat inflammatory bowel\n      disease, are correlated with the concentrations in gastrointestinal fluids; and (2) improve\n      the physiologically based models for drug absorption from the intestine.  Information from\n      this study in concert with in vitro dissolution data will be used to evaluate in vivo-in\n      vitro correlation (IVIVC) for concentrations in plasma and intestinal lumen and dissolution\n      of mesalamine products."
