            "textblock": "A Cochrane systematic review of 5 randomized controlled trials showed that screening for\n      prostate cancer, using digital rectal examination and dosage of prostate specific antigen\n      (PSA), did not significantly decrease prostate cancer specific mortality. Rather, screening\n      for prostate cancer often led to over-diagnosis by detecting tumors that would not otherwise\n      have become symptomatic or by producing false positive results. It could therefore result in\n      unnecessary supplementary testing (including prostate biopsies), inadequate and/or harmful\n      treatment, and negative psychological outcomes among patients.\n\n      Although the growing number of recommendations against PSA testing for screening of prostate\n      cancer, 70% of patients still request testing prior to any information because they\n      overestimate the benefits and are unaware of the limitations. As a result, about 55% of\n      patients between 50 and 74 years old, undergo prostate cancer screening in the USA every\n      year, despite recommendations against it.\n\n      To help patients understand the complexities about PSA testing for prostate cancer\n      screening, professional organizations encourage physicians and patients to use decision aids\n      to make informed decisions.\n\n      The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a decision aid, usable in daily practice\n      by general practitioners, presenting harms and benefits of prostate cancer screening on\n      patients' intent to undergo screening."
