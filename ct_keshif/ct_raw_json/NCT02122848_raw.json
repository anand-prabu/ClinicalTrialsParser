Objective: to evaluate the effectiveness of the bilevel positive airway pressure\n      (BILEVEL) in the increase of exercise tolerance in patients with decompensated heart\n      failure. Method: this is a cross-over randomized clinical trial, with individuals who will\n      undergo a submaximal progressive exercise test of the lower limbs with a cycle-ergometer\n      using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and BILEVEL in a random order. Patients\n      will also be evaluated using a health related quality of life questionnaire, pulmonary\n      function test, inspiratory muscle and peripheral muscle strength tests. Hypothesis: The\n      increase in exercise tolerance might be greater during the use of BILEVEL."
