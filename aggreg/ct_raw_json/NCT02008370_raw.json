The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of\n      EXPAREL when delivered into the thoracotomy and chest tube sites to provide prolonged\n      postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing minimally invasive cardiac surgery. Efficacy\n      will be assessed by: the effectiveness of analgesia as measured by the subject's overall\n      postoperative pain scores and postsurgical analgesic use. The safety of EXPAREL will be\n      assessed by the occurrence of all postsurgical adverse events and serious adverse event\n      through Day 30.\n\n      Methodology: This is a prospective, open-label, non-randomized study evaluating the\n      effectiveness of analgesia when using 266 mg EXPAREL delivered into the thoracotomy and\n      chest tube sites by wide local infiltration. All patients in the study will undergo\n      minimally invasive cardiac surgery. The total dose of EXPAREL for the thoracotomy and chest\n      tube sites  will be the same for up to 20 study subjects.: 266 mg of EXPAREL (13.3 mg/mL\n      bupivacaine base). EXPAREL will be administered to each site. This total dose of Exparel is\n      not to be exceeded in any subject. The thoracotomy and chest tube sites in this study will\n      be performed immediately following surgery. Fentanyl will be the only opioid permitted\n      intraoperatively. Post-operatively pain medications will be administered per standard of\n      care by the anesthesia care team as needed to control the patient's pain. Patients will have\n      access to a variety of rescue analgesics with appropriate routes of administration for\n      breakthrough pain (e.g. opioids, acetaminophen, ketorolac, other nonsteroidal\n      antiinflammatory drugs) in accordance with hospital standing orders for postsurgical pain\n      management.\n\n      Subject reported pain will be recorded before surgery and at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96,\n      and 120 hours after the thoracotomy and chest tube site infiltration), and at a generally\n      standard scheduled post-hospital discharge visit  approximately 10\u00b15 days after surgery.\n      (Subjects discharged from the hospital will be contacted by telephone to record the\n      scheduled pain assessments). Physician/healthcare professional assessed pain will be\n      recorded when the patient is intubated and unable to communicate.  Pain will also be\n      assessed at the time of hospital discharge and at the last assessment (10\u00b15 days) subjects\n      also will be asked about their overall satisfaction with postsurgical analgesia Patients\n      will also be asked to report any possible adverse events experienced since hospital\n      discharge. If after Day 10\u00b15 and through Day 30, the investigator is made aware of an\n      adverse evevts that occurred during this period of time, this should also be recorded on the\n      case report form if the investigator feels the event may be related to the study drug."
