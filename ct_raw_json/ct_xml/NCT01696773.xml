  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eating a diet rich in tomatoes has been associated with decreased risk for a variety of
      diseases.  Tomatoes contain red-colored lycopene (one type of pigment in the class of
      pigments called carotenoids), which has been associated with the decreased risk of disease
      in those consuming tomato products; however, tomatoes also contain flavonoids, which may
      also have health promoting effects.  The Tangerine tomato, a unique tomato variety, contains
      lycopene in a different form that in red tomatoes and this contributes to their
      characteristic orange color.  This &quot;orange lycopene&quot; is more similar to the most common form
      of lycopene found in the blood and tissue of people who eat a tomato-rich diet, and may be
      more easily absorbed by the body.

      The objectives of this study are to determine if carotenoids and flavonoids from Tangerine
      tomatoes are more easily absorbed by the body than red tomatoes, and to examine if eating
      Tangerine versus red tomatoes impacts markers of inflammation (response to harmful
      substances by the body).

      The primary goal of this research is to determine if a processed Tangerine tomato product
      has enhanced bioavailability of carotenoids and flavonoids compared to a commercially
      available processed red tomato product in humans.  This primary objective will be
      accomplished by quantifying carotenoids from post-prandial triglyceride-rich lipoprotein
      (TRL) fractions of plasma and flavonoids from whole plasma and urine, after subjects consume
      a meal containing Tangerine or red tomato juice.  A secondary goal is to examine if
      short-term delivery of bioactives from Tangerine and red tomatoes impact markers of
      inflammation in humans.  This secondary objective will be accomplished by analyzing plasma
      for both interleukin-6 (IL-6), a marker for inflammation, and RNA to assess alterations in
      transcription of genes that regulate inflammation.

    <description>The primary goal of this research is to determine if a processed Tangerine tomato product has enhanced bioavailability of carotenoids and flavonoids compared to a commercially available processed red tomato product in humans.   An area under the curve for concentration of carotenoids (from triglyceride rich lipoprotein (TRL) fraction of plasma) and flavonoids (from plasma) over time will be determined to quantify absorption, after subjects consume a meal containing Tangerine or red tomato juice.  Urine will be used measure absorption/excreting of flavonoids over a 24 hour period.</description>
