  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the accuracy of Night Shift in the detection of
      supine sleep and efficacy of vibro-tactile feedback in restricting supine sleep.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The protocol is designed to first evaluate the accuracy of supine vs. non-supine detection
      in 15 subjects (hereafter referred to as study 1).   In study 2, patients who had completed
      a baseline PSG with a minimum of four hours of sleep time were to wear the Night Shift for
      two nights without feedback to confirm their willingness to continue with the study,
      followed by 28 nights of vibro-tactile position therapy.  A follow-up PSG was to be
      conducted as soon as possible to the completion of the 28-nights of treatment.  During
      enrollment subjects were to complete pre-treatment questionnaires designed to measure
      daytime sleepiness, insomnia severity, depression, anxiety, and quality of life.  The same
      instruments were completed post-treatment on the morning after the 28th night of treatment.
      Subjects completed daily logs to confirm device utilization and identify potential
      non-device related factors that could influence study completion.
