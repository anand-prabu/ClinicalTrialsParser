            "textblock": "Many older adults rely on a manual wheelchair (MWC) for community mobility, but are not\n      provided with the skills for independent and effective use of their wheelchair. Suboptimal\n      use of the wheelchair results in substantial social costs such as reduced engagement in\n      meaningful activity, social isolation, and higher caregiver burden. This is a poor use of\n      financial resources, including the cost of wheelchair acquisition and requirements for\n      attendant care. Access to skills training is constrained by the expense and limited\n      availability of skilled therapists; demands of patient and/or clinician travel; and lack of\n      training programs designed specifically for older adults.\n\n      Enhancing Participation In the Community by improving Wheelchair Skills (EPIC WheelS) is an\n      individualized home-training program that optimizes learning for older adults while limiting\n      the time demands of expert trainers. Using an affordable mainstream computer tablet device,\n      EPIC WheelS provides a structured training program that can be customized for specific users\n      needs. The tablet is mobile, for in-chair or tabletop use, in home and community locations.\n      A touch screen operated audio-visual display features interactive training and practice\n      activities as well as video-recording capability. Wireless Internet enables user-trainer\n      communication and remote program monitoring and updating by the trainer. A monitored home\n      program that is effective and efficient for older adults has the potential for application\n      to other target groups, particularly those in rural and remote locations with limited access\n      to rehabilitation.\n\n      PURPOSE: The purpose is to evaluate the feasibility and effect size estimate of a 1-month\n      customized home training program (EPIC WheelS) for improving wheelchair mobility skills\n      among novice older adult manual wheelchair users compared to usual care. Despite the\n      pervasive use of wheelchairs as an intervention in rehabilitation, the evidence for training\n      in effective wheelchair use is still underdeveloped. Structured training has demonstrated\n      excellent potential, but the most effective and efficient means of providing that training\n      remains unclear. Larger multi-site clinical trials are required to establish evidence to\n      inform and direct clinical practice. The investigators propose that this 2-year feasibility\n      trial is not only critical, but also prudent, prior to moving forward with an expensive\n      large multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT). Specifically the results of this study\n      will address 1) feasibility outcomes (i.e., recruitment and retention; trainer and subject\n      burden; safety; intervention administration and adherence; perceived benefit) and 2)\n      clinical outcomes (i.e., effect size calculations for the primary and secondary measures).\n      Although the principal intent is feasibility, the sample size calculation is based on the\n      primary clinical outcome to provide a reasonable estimate of an effect size for planning the\n      subsequent large scale RCT.\n\n      HYPOTHESES: The investigators expect that the feasibility outcomes will be sufficiently\n      robust to support conducting a subsequent multi-site RCT. The investigators also expect the\n      EPIC WheelS training program will have a significant treatment effect with improvement in\n      wheelchair mobility, compared to a control group. The primary clinical endpoint will be\n      wheelchair skill capacity, as measured by the Wheelchair Skills Test (WST). Secondary\n      clinical outcomes will include wheelchair skill safety; confidence with wheelchair use;\n      mobility; and user evaluation of performance in participation-oriented activities."
