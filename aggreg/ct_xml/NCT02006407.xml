    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to assess the changes in white matter, in the brain, in response to
      radiation therapy and correlate these changes with later declines in cognitive function.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the change from baseline in Perpendicular Diffusivity of Water as measured by Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) at 3 weeks and at 6 weeks post radiation therapy.</measure>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Descriptive statistics and plots will be used to determine Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) parameters for various regions in the brain.  The mean (across subject) change in DTI parameter for a given region, at a given time, will be used to assess white matter injury.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the correlation between global COGState scores and the Perpendicular Diffusivity of water by Diffusion Tensor Imaging at baseline, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks into treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Determine the change in cognitive test scores from baseline to time-points early during radiation therapy (3 and 6 weeks) using CogState (a computerized software testing system that offers various cognitive assessments based on expansive neurocognitive tests).  Correlate test scores from COGState with changes in Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) at the same timepoints using scatter plots with Pearson and Spearman's correlation coefficients.  As a pilot study multiple comparisons will be assessed; however, the working hypothesis is that DTI changes as measured by an increase in diffusivity of water perpendicular to the direction of axonal transport will be measurable even in this acute setting and will correlate with global response as measured on COGState with the sub-domains on executive function anticiapted to be most highly correlated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the correlation between global COGState scores, radiation dose, and the perpendicular diffusivity of water as measured by Diffusion Tensor Imaging at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Determine the change in cognitive test scores from baseline, at 6 months using CogState (a computerized software testing system that offers various cognitive assessments based on expansive neurocognitive tests).  Correlate test scores from COGState with changes in Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) at the same timepoints (Baseline and 6 months) using scatter plots with Pearson and Spearman's correlation coefficients.  As a pilot study multiple comparisons will be assessed; however, the working hypothesis based upon results in adults treated with radiation therapy is that DTI changes as measured by an increase in diffusivity of water perpendicular to the direction of axonal transport will correlate with changes in global response as measured on COGState with the sub-domains on executive function most highly correlated.  In addition, these regional changes in DTI will be directly related to the radiation doses recieved in these regions.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pediatric patients (age 6-21) who will receive cranial radiotherapy for brian tumors.
              This could include but is not limited to:  low grade glioma, high grade glioma (to
             include grade III but not grade IV glioma), germ cell tumors, primitive
             neuroectodermal tumors, craniopharyngioma, or medulloblastoma.

          -  Patients should, in the estimate of the treating physician, be anticipated to have a
             median survival of greater than 1 year.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with previous Central Nervous System (CNS) radiation or or CNS tumors that,
             in the judgement of the investigators, are likely to undergo progression during or
             shortly after radiotherapy are excluded.

          -  Patients with glioblastoma, multiforme, gliosarcoma, diffuse pontine glioma, or other
             tumors presumed to have expected median survival per the investigators of less than 1
             year.

          -  Patients who require sedation for Magnetic Resonance Imagining (MRI)are excluded.

          -  Patients at risk for nephrogenic systemic sclerosis will be excluded as a safety
             precaution due to the contrast used in the scans.
