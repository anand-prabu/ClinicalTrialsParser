Biological\n      therapies such as CpG 7909 use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop cancer\n      cells from growing. Combining CpG 7909 with rituximab may kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of CpG 7909 plus rituximab in treating\n      patients who have relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."

Patients are sequentially\n      assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.\n\n        -  Group A: Patients receive rituximab IV over 4-5 hours followed by CpG 7909 IV over 2\n           hours on day 1. Courses repeat weekly for 4 weeks.\n\n        -  Group B: Patients receive rituximab as above followed by CpG 7909 subcutaneously on day\n           1. Courses repeat weekly for 4 weeks.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CpG 7909 until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2\n      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-48 patients (3-24 per treatment group) will be accrued for\n      this study."
