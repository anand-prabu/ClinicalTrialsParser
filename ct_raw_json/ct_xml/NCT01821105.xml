    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II studies how well computed tomography (CT) and positron emission
      tomography (PET) imaging works in detecting disease in patients undergoing surgery for
      metastatic colorectal cancer. Diagnostic procedures, such as CT and PET scans, done before
      and during surgery may help find colorectal cancer and help guide surgery

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of rigidly (linearly) registering PET to CT images and
      applying this fused dataset to guide surgery with an image-guided navigation system and a
      handheld positron probe in order to facilitate disease detection and improve resection
      accuracy in advanced stage colorectal cancer.

      II. To complete development of software for the nonlinear registration of PET and CT
      datasets.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo preoperative whole-body PET scans and CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis.
      Patients then receive 18 F fludeoxyglucose (FDG) intravenously (IV) 60-90 minutes prior to
      surgery and undergo intraoperative CT scans using a handheld probe and computer navigation
      system.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically-confirmed colorectal carcinoma and preoperative PET scan
             with evidence of hypermetabolic lesions suspicious for cancer will be eligible for
             this study.  In cases of primary cancer, there must be a tissue-confirmed diagnosis.
             In recurrent cases, patients must have clinical evidence by CT or MRI of disease
             suitable for resection.

          -  Patients must be candidates for clinically indicated surgery.

          -  Patients with recurrent disease may have had prior surgery and/or chemotherapy with
             no limit to the number of prior therapeutic procedures or chemotherapeutic regimens.

          -  Patients must have a performance status of 0, 1 or 2 by ECOG(Eastern  Cooperative
             Oncology Group)standards.

          -  Patients must give written informed consent including consent to have IV line placed
             for FDG administration.

          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age.  Children under the age of 18 are excluded
             from the study due to the rarity of colorectal cancer in children.

          -  Because radiolabeled agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing
             potential and men must agree to use an acceptable form of contraception prior to
             study entry and for the duration of the study participation.  Should a woman become
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should
             inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Organ function requirements: Patients must have organ and marrow function adequate to
             undergo laparotomy.  Specifically:

          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dl

          -  Serum bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl

          -  AST(aspartate aminotransferase,serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, serum
             glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase,serum glutamate pyruvate
             transaminase)[SGOT]/ALT[SGPT]&lt;4 times institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Total WBC(white blood cell)&gt;4,000/mm3 or ANC(absolute neutrophil count)&gt; 1,500/mm3

          -  Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3

          -  Hgb &gt;10g/dl

          -  Patient must have no clinically significant cardiac disease (New York Heart
             Association Class III/IV); no serious infection requiring treatment with antibiotics;
             no other serious ill-ness or illness requiring the use of steroids; no clinically
             significant pulmonary disease or other illness that would contraindicate or increase
             the risk of complications at surgery.

          -  Fasting blood sugar less than 120 mg/dl

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with active CNS (central nervous system)tumor involvement are ineligible.

          -  Any patient who has retained childbearing potential will not be pregnant or lactating
             and must use adequate contraception to assure avoidance of conception.

          -  Body size prohibits use of the diagnostic equipment (portable CT scanner).

          -  Tumor burden is so great (as determined by preoperative PET scanning or
             intraoperative findings) that further surgery is not advised.

          -  If lesions are detected with preoperative CT but not with PET scanning (in other
             words, all patients will have a positive PET scan as part of the inclusion criteria).
