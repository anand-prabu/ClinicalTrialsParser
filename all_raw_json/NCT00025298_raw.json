Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. Giving\n      chemoprotective drugs such as amifostine may protect normal cells from the side effects of\n      chemotherapy and radiation therapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of paclitaxel and\n      carboplatin followed by cisplatin plus radiation therapy with or without amifostine in\n      treating patients who have locally advanced cancer of the nasopharynx."

Patients are stratified according to WHO\n      performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2), response to induction chemotherapy (complete vs partial vs\n      stable disease vs not evaluable), and participating center.\n\n      Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and\n      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses\n      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients with a complete or partial response after 2 courses of induction chemotherapy\n      receive 2 additional courses before randomization. Patients with stable disease after 2\n      courses of induction chemotherapy or who cannot be evaluated after 1 course proceed directly\n      to randomization. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive cisplatin IV on days 1, 22, and 43. Patients also undergo\n           radiotherapy daily 5 days a week for 6.5 weeks.\n\n        -  Arm II:Patients receive amifostine subcutaneously daily. Patients receive chemotherapy\n           and radiotherapy as in arm I.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 41-93 patients will be accrued for this study."
