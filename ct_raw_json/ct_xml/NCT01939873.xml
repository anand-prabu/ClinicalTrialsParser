  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of fundal pressure in management of the second stage of labor is controversial. The
      aim of this study is both to evaluate the effectiveness of fundal pressure in shortening the
      second stage of labor and to examine the related neonatal and maternal outcomes.

      Patients will be randomly allocated to two groups by using a computer-generated random
      number chart: Kristeller maneuver intervention (study) group (n=140) and control group
      (n=140). Umbilical artery blood gas will obtained to assess the newborn's acid-base status.
      The umbilical artery levels of creatinine kinase, creatinine kinase with myocardial specific
      isoform, aspartate amino transferase, alanine amino transferase, lactate dehydrogenase and
      lactic acid will be measured. Length of episiotomy and length of vagina will be measured at
      45 degrees from the midline. Each patient's vaginal laceration, cervical laceration, length
      of episiotomy and vagina before and after delivery and duration of the second stage of labor
      in minutes will be recorded. Neonatal information will include: infant birth weight, apgar
      scores, babies requiring pediatric help, and admission of neonatal intensive care units.
