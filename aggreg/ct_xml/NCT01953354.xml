  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of trichuris suis ova
      (TSO) in ulcerative colitis (UC).  We will look at how TSO affects the body's immune
      response and if there are related changes in participants' UC.

      The cause of UC is not well understood. It is believed to be caused from an abnormal immune
      response to the normal bacteria that live in the gut (intestines and colon). This response
      acts as an &quot;attack&quot; on the healthy tissue of the bowel by a person's own immune cells which
      leads to disease.

      It is well known that autoimmune diseases such as IBD, asthma, diabetes, and multiple
      sclerosis are more common in industrialized, well-developed countries with better sanitation
      and hygiene, as in the United States.  These &quot;cleaner&quot; environments reduce exposure to germs
      and parasites naturally found in the environment.  This reduced exposure may trigger
      responses in the body that make people more prone to diseases such as UC. People in
      non-industrialized countries and the tropics, where parasites are common, rarely develop
      these diseases.  This observation has led researchers to want to better understand the
      relationship between the lack of natural bacteria in the gut and the onset of autoimmune
      diseases like as UC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has provided written informed consent

          2. Diagnosis of UC (newly diagnosed or established patients) as determined by medical
             history, endoscopic and histological confirmation with the proximal disease extent
             limited to the left colon (distal to the splenic flexure), and accessible by flexible
             sigmoidoscopy. Patients with left-sided disease and the presence of a periappendiceal
             red patch (limited cecal inflammation) will be eligible as long as there is no
             intervening evidence of colitis between the cecal base and the upper boundary of
             inflammation in the left colon.

             achieving the study objectives.
