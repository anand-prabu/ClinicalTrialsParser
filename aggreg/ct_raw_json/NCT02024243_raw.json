All subjects in this arm will have wound measurements, photographs for digital planimetry to measure wound area, and two 3 mm punch tissue biopsies of the same wound/ulcer (for OCT & infection) on days day 0, 14, and 28. Biopsies will not be taken if the wound has closed by day 14 or 28.

Adult patients, who do not have Diabetes, and, who have\n      chronic venous leg ulcers, that are not infected and have been open/not healed for at least\n      12 weeks, will be enrolled in this study.  Patients will be recruited from the OSU Wexner\n      Medical Center Comprehensive Wound Center (CWC).  On days 0, 14 and 28, patients will have\n      the following performed:  measurements and photographs taken of their wound; TCOM\n      (transcutaneous oxygen measurement) to measure the amount of oxygen in the wound tissue; and\n      two 3-mm punch biopsies from the same wound/ulcer.  Biopsies will not be taken if the wound\n      has closed by day 14 or day 28.  Additionally, patients' medical records will be reviewed\n      throughout the study to obtain information about the patient (age, sex, race/ethnicity,\n      current medications, TCOM, would location and type, other illness/diagnoses, wound care\n      treatment and instructions, nutritional status based on albumin levels), and at 14 weeks\n      after enrollment to determine the final status of the wound (healed or not healed).\n\n      There will be a total of 5 visits for this study (6 total visits for patients with open\n      wounds on day 28 of the study).  Visits will occur on days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28."

Wound photographs are\n      a part of standard care when patients come to the Comprehensive Wound Center (CWC). Images\n      do not include the part of body that could lead to identification of the participants.  In\n      addition, following standard of care, two biopsies will be taken - one biopsy will be used\n      for laser capture microdissection (LCM) and immunohistochemistry studies, while the other\n      will be used for determination of infection status using quantitative bacterial cultures and\n      Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging for biofilm phenotyping.\n\n      The following will be completed on days 0, 14 and 28:\n\n        1. Wound measurements - Photographs for digital planimetry to measure wound area.\n\n        2. Two Wound-edge biopsies (3mm) - following wound bed preparation with 1% lidocaine local\n           anesthetic, as required, two punch biopsies (3 mm each) will be obtained from the\n           wound-edge (the leading 3mm edge of the skin at the perimeter) of the same wound/ulcer.\n\n        3. Data Collection - the following information will be collected during the enrollment\n           visit and updated at each visit (weekly - on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 98 (week 14) ),\n           as necessary, and entered onto the data collection form:  Age; Sex; Race/Ethnicity;\n           Current medications; Transcutaneous oxygen measurement(TCOM) - Based on (TCOM), wounds\n           will be classified as ischemic:  30-40 mmHg, or non-ischemic:  >45 mmHg, where 60 mmHg\n           is recognized as normal; Wound location & Etiology; Other associated illnesses; Wound\n           care modality/treatment; and Nutritional status will be recorded as documented by\n           albumin levels and chart records.\n\n      Healing outcome: Wound photography will be performed every 7 days (every week) as a part of\n      the current standard of care. Based on wound measurements from days 0 and 28 , patients will\n      be classified as either healing or non-healing, per criteria described in the study\n      proposal/protocol.\n\n      There will be a total of 5 visits for this study (6 total visits for patients with open\n      wounds on day 28 of the study).
