Determine whether active specific immunization comprising tyrosinase and\n      gp100:209-217 (gp100) peptides fused with OVA BiP peptide and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70)\n      induces immunity against tyrosinase and gp100 in HLA-A2 positive patients with stage III or\n      IV melanoma. II. Determine the lowest optimally immunogenic dose of tyrosinase and gp100 in\n      these patients. III. Determine the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of tyrosinase and gp100:209-217 antigen (gp100).\n      Patients receive vaccination comprising tyrosinase and gp100 fused with OVA BiP peptide and\n      heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) subcutaneously on weeks 0, 1, 2, 6, and 18 for a total of 5\n      vaccinations in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 9\n      patients receive escalating doses of tyrosinase and gp100 until the lowest optimally\n      immunogenic dose is determined. The lowest optimally immunogenic dose is defined as the dose\n      at which 4 or more of 9 patients demonstrate T-cell responses.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study."
