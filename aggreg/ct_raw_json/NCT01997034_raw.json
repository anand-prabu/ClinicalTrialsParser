            "textblock": "In Denmark and the western world, there is an increasing prevalence of obesity probably due\n      to a combination of inadequate daily physical activity and a high energy intake. One\n      approach to achieve weight loss and change life style is to participate in an intensive\n      supervised prolonged life style modification course. The immediate effect is often positive,\n      but over time the overall effect is limited as the majority will not maintain weight loss\n      and a changed life style.\n\n      The purpose of this study is therefore to characterize the physiological factors that\n      determine/influence the capacity to maintain weight loss and a healthy lifestyle after a\n      prolonged lifestyle intervention.\n\n      The investigators have the following research questions:\n\n        1. Are there physiological traits and characteristics that mediate better adherence to\n           lifestyle changes and weight loss?\n\n        2. Does the adaptation in muscle oxidative capacity after lifestyle intervention predict\n           success in maintaining weight loss and lifestyle changes?\n\n        3. How does gender and age influence the capacity to maintain the lifestyle induced\n           adaptation in muscle and adipose tissue and maintaining weight loss?\n\n      The study design is cross-sectional and will be based on a lifestyle intervention, as it is\n      practiced in a real life setting at Ubberup folk high school. The investigators will recruit\n      former participants of this lifestyle style intervention. 50 % who maintained a weight loss\n      and a healthy life style and 50 % who did not."
