In\n      contrast to NMDAR antagonists, the neuropsychiatric effects of NMDAR agonists in the healthy\n      human organism are not known. The investigators studied neuropsychiatric and neurochemical\n      effects of the NMDAR-glycine site obligatory co-agonist D-serine (DSR) in healthy subjects\n      using a randomized, controlled crossover challenge design including a baseline assessment\n      day and two DSR/placebo administration days. Thirty-five subjects aged 23-29 years\n      participated in the study and received a 2.1g orally administered DSR dose. The main outcome\n      measures were the changes in scores of mood-related Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Continuous\n      Performance Test - Identical Pairs (CPT-IP), and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT)."
