  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The biology of prostate cancer is associated with changes in genes and metabolites within
      prostate tissue. There is robust evidence to suggest that a diet rich in broccoli can
      prevent or retard the development of prostate cancer by influencing these changes. This is
      likely to be due to a natural chemical that is obtained in these vegetables known as
      sulforaphane.

      In this study, we are seeking to provide further evidence that a diet rich in broccoli may
      prevent prostate cancer from developing, and to understand how this may happen. We propose
      to undertake a human intervention study to test the hypothesis that a broccoli-rich diet can
      alter the metabolism and gene expression within prostate tissue of men under active
      surveillance in a manner that would reduce the probability of the emergence and progression
      of aggressive cancerous clones. Volunteers recruited onto this study will be randomly
      allocated to one of three dietary groups in which they will be required to consume two
      portions per week of a broccoli soup delivering a different concentration of sulforaphane.
      This will be part of their normal diet for one year.

      Blood, urine and prostate biopsy tissue will be obtained before and after a 12 month
      intervention period. Prostate biopsies will be obtained either though transperineal template
      biopsies, a technique accepted as best clinical practice because it provides better sampling
      of the prostate, or transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy which is currently the standard of
      care for obtaining biopsies.

      This study has been funded by Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)
      and Prostate Cancer foundation (PCF).

      The study is a randomised double-blinded dietary intervention study. The study population
      will consist of smoking and non-smoking men aged between 18 and 80 years old. Volunteers
      recruited into this study will be randomly placed into one of three dietary groups in which
      they will be required to consume two portions of broccoli soup per week, delivering a
      different level of glucoraphanin (sulforaphane precursor), as part of their normal diet for
      one year. The three types of soup will contain (i)standard broccoli,
      (ii)glucoraphanin-enriched broccoli (Beneforte®), or (iii)Beneforte extra. Beneforte and
      Beneforte extra broccoli are especially cultivated to deliver high sulforaphane levels after
      consumption. All the three broccoli varieties have the same appearance and flavour thus
      enabling a blinded human intervention study to be undertaken. Broccoli soups will be
      manufactured by a food company that supplies soups to the leading supermarket retailers in
      the United Kingdom. In order to assess the habitual diet of the volunteers, they will be
      asked to keep three 7-day diet diaries, one pre-intervention, after 6-months and another one
      week before the end of their intervention. Twenty six volunteers will be recruited to each
      of the broccoli groups. The volunteers will be characterised as having a low or intermediate
      risk of developing prostate cancer and will be undergoing active surveillance. A number of
      physiological tests will be performed on the volunteers before they start the dietary
      intervention (baseline) and after their 12 months on the intervention. The study will
      involve collection of prostate biopsies, blood and urine samples at baseline and after a 12
      month dietary intervention. Prostate biopsies will be obtained through transperineal
      template biopsy (TPB) where possible or standard transrectal ultrasound scan guided biopsy
      (TRUS biopsy). TPB is a clinical procedure carried out under a general or regional
      anaesthetic which gives more detailed information about the position, amount and
      aggressiveness of the cancer within the prostate than other standard techniques. However,
      patients who do not wish to undergo TPB can alternatively choose the standard TRUS biopsy.
      It is anticipated that the dropout rate for this study will be approximately 25% due to the
      clinical progression of prostate cancer within the 12-month study period. In the event of
      clinical progression the volunteer will discontinue the intervention, receive advice from
      the urologist in charge and in case of prostatectomy will be asked to donate part of their
      prostate gland for research purposes.
