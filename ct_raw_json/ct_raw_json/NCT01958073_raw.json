The investigators will use two forms of vaginal estrogen that are available by\n      prescription (a ring and a cream) and compare their efficacy to that of a placebo (without\n      any active ingredient). The investigators are going to look at if the vaginal estrogen can\n      prevent UTIs altogether and also the number of UTIs each group experiences over a 6 month\n      period. After 6 months, all subjects will receive vaginal estrogen and the women on the\n      non-active treatment will be randomized to either the estrogen ring or cream. The\n      investigators will then be able to compare the number of UTIs on and off active vaginal\n      estrogen treatment within those subjects who started on the placebo. The investigators are\n      also going to look at quality of life before and during treatment using questionnaires and\n      whether subjects stop using the treatments or do not use them as directed (compliance)."

Diagnosis of Interstitial Cystitis/painful bladder syndrome\n\n          4. History of urinary tract infections which require the use of IV antibiotics or where\n             only one oral antibiotic is available for treatment, or where the risk of treatment\n             with vaginal estrogen only is deemed unacceptable by the principle investigator\n             secondary to the severity of prior urinary tract infections\n\n          5. Known etiology of infection such as, but not limited to: kidney or bladder stones,\n             enterovaginal/vesical fistula, fecal incontinence, intermittent catheterization,\n             indwelling catheter, poorly controlled diabetes\n\n          6.

Inability to use a vaginal ring (secondary to advanced prolapse or shortened vaginal\n             length)\n\n         10. Any medical reason the investigator deems incompatible with treatment with vaginal\n             estrogen\n\n         11. Prolapse requiring pessary use\n\n        Deferral Criteria\n\n          1. Undiagnosed hematuria - may enroll after malignancy is ruled out\n\n          2.

Use of drugs/supplements known to prevent UTIs (ie cranberry products, prophylactic\n             antibiotics, methenamine hippurate) 3 months prior to enrollment - may enroll after\n             wash out if still meets inclusion criteria.\n\n          4. History of estrogen sensitive tumor (breast or endometrial cancer) - requires\n             approval by the subject's primary oncologist or primary care physician"
