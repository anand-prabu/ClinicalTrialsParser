  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to gain further insight into the comparative effectiveness of
      treating patients, who are found to be anemic before their elective surgery, with a series
      of weekly subcutaneous doses of a drug given before surgery, which stimulates the natural
      production of red blood cells (a so-called erythropoietic stimulating agent [ESA]) along
      with intravenous iron, in reducing the need for blood transfusions (donated by someone other
      than the patient) during and after adult total hip arthroplasty (hip replacement surgery).
      The effects of a Preoperative Anemia Management Program (PAMP) on the patient's quality of
      recovery, health-related quality of life, fatigue, and rehabilitation pattern after surgery
      will also be examined.  A cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed to compare the cost
      of these commercially available, FDA-approved medications versus the cost of transfused
      blood

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient blood management (PBM) involves the timely and conscientious use of the current best
      evidence in making medical and surgical decisions about the care of patients to maintain red
      blood cell levels, optimize blood clotting, and minimize blood loss, in an effort to improve
      patient outcome. PBM focuses on the treatment of the individual patient and comprises
      transfusion therapy and drug therapy.  PBM is based on three points: (1) optimization of the
      (preoperative) red blood cell volume, (2) reduction of diagnostic, therapeutic, or
      intraoperative blood loss, and (3) increasing individual tolerance towards anemia and
      accurate blood transfusion triggers.  PBM primarily identifies patients at risk for
      transfusion and provides a management plan aimed at reducing or eliminating anemia and the
      need for blood  transfusion donated from someone other than the patient (allogeneic
      transfusion), thus reducing the risks, blood bank inventory pressures, and the escalating
      costs associated with transfusion. The implementation of a formal UAB Preoperative Anemia
      Management Program (PAMP) may help achieve consistent PBM.

      Efforts will be made to coordinate patients' scheduled surgery date and their initial
      evaluation in the UAB Highlands Hospital Preoperative Assessment, Consultation, and
      Treatment (HPACT) Clinic, so that their first PACT Clinic visit occurs approximately 14 days
      prior to the planned total hip replacement or total knee replacement
