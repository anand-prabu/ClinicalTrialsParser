The investigators will then conduct a randomized trial comparing an intervention\n      group (receiving website access and the printed guidebook) with a delayed treatment control\n      condition, to learn if the support intervention can effectively teach women supportive\n      behaviors and thereby increase their partners' smokeless tobacco cessation rates."
