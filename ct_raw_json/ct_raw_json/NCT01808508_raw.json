The\n      investigators want to see if treatment of OSAS improves learning, behavior and heart\n      problems."

CPAP is a machine with a mask that fits over the\n      nose, is worn during sleep and helps keep the airway open. Sham CPAP (placebo) is a machine\n      that looks and sounds like a CPAP machine but does not give pressure so it does not treat\n      OSAS. Individuals with normal breathing during the sleep study will not receive a machine,\n      and will serve as controls.\n\n      Individuals will also have baseline tests including blood tests, an echocardiogram (pictures\n      of the heart), a walking test and learning tests. After 4 months, the baseline tests will be\n      repeated in all participants. At the end of the study, all individuals with OSAS will get\n      treatment."
