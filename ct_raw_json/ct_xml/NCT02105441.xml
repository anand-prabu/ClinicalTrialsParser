    <description>A dual task performance paradigm will be used in which both the primary task and the secondary task will be performed simultaneously. The primary task will consist of speech recognition testing in varying levels of background noise and quiet, whereas the secondary task will consist of a motor reaction to a randomly presented light</description>

      <textblock>
        Adults

          -  18 years of age or older,

          -  Hearing loss in the ear to be implanted must such that speech understanding is not
             possible with a well fitted hearing aid. Specifically, less than 40% monosyllabic
             word understanding when that ear is tested in the best-aided condition and the other
             ear is sufficiently occluded or masked.

          -  Onset of hearing loss in the adult group must be within the past two years for the
             ear to be implanted.

        Children

          -  Children 7 years of age and older

          -  Hearing loss in the ear to be implanted configured such that word understanding is
             less 40% in the best aided condition

          -  Onset of hearing loss recent within the past two years, and that occurred after the
             critical period of auditory development; the third year of life (Sharma et al.,
             2005).
