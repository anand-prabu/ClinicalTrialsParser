Determine the effectiveness of low dose docetaxel and carboplatin by response\n      rate, response duration, and time to progression in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small\n      cell lung cancer. II. Determine the side effects and toxicity profile of docetaxel when\n      given in combination with carboplatin in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is open label study. Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour followed by\n      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes once a week for 4 weeks. Patients receive at least 2 courses\n      (8 weeks) of treatment. Courses are further repeated in the absence of unacceptable toxicity\n      and disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 20-38 patients accrued into this study."
