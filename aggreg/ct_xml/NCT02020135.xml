    <textblock>
      PSMA ADC 2301EXT is an open-label study to further assess the anti-tumor activity as
      measured by radiographic imaging and biomarkers, safety and tolerability of PSMA ADC in
      subjects with mCRPC.  Subjects who have participated in the PSMA ADC 2301 study and who, in
      the opinion of the Principal Investigator are likely to benefit from continued treatment
      with PSMA ADC are eligible for the PSMA ADC 2301 extension study.  Subjects who are
      benefiting from treatment may be able to receive up to an additional eight to sixteen doses
      (every 3 weeks) of PSMA ADC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have completed the PSMA ADC 2301 study and who, in the opinion of the
             investigator, are likely to benefit from continued treatment with PSMA ADC

          2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2

          3. If chemically castrated, subjects must agree to stay on androgen-deprivation therapy
             for the duration of the study

          4. If applicable, men must agree to commit to the use of a medically acceptable method
             of birth control (e.g., spermicide in conjunction with a barrier such as a condom) or
             sexual abstinence for the duration of the study, including 30 days after the last
             dose of study drug

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. An acute infection requiring ongoing antibiotic therapy (e.g., UTI, indwelling
             catheter or other potential site(s) of infection)

          2. History of significant hypersensitivity reactions to PSMA ADC or any of its
             components, or to any prior investigational or approved monoclonal antibodies (mAbs),
             immunoglobulin (Ig) fusion proteins (e.g., circulating neutralizing antibodies), or
             ADC

          3. Clinically significant cardiac disease or severe debilitating pulmonary disease

          4. Any recent or ongoing medical condition that may interfere with a subject's
             participation or compliance with the study or evaluation of PSMA ADC
