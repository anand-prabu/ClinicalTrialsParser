        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria for cases and controls:

        Patients with history of esophagectomy or mucosal ablation, gastric fundoplication or
        other gastric surgery, or known non-Barrett's esophageal pathology (e.g. eosinophilic
        esophagitis or achalasia) will be excluded. Patients with prior history of colon polyps or
        colon/esophageal/gastric/pancreatic carcinoma (unless had negative colonoscopy within 2
        years to clear polyps).

        Control patients without endoscopic evidence of Barrett's will be frequency matched by age
        (Â± 5 years) and gender (similar distribution) to cases. To ensure similar age and gender
        distribution between cases and controls, monitoring of recruited cases and controls age
        and gender distribution will be performed every two weeks. Data on height, weight, smoking
        history, medications (NSAIDS, PPIs) and indications (as well as findings on endoscopy) for
        endoscopy will be abstracted from medical records.  All participants will be &gt;18 years of
        age and will provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria for cases:

        Patients with history of esophagectomy or mucosal ablation, gastric fundoplication or
        other gastric surgery, or known non-Barrett's esophageal pathology (e.g. eosinophilic
        esophagitis or achalasia) will be excluded. Patients with prior history of colon polyps or
        colon/gastric/pancreatic carcinoma (unless had negative colonoscopy within 2 years to
        clear polyps).
