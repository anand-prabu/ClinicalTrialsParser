Recent evidence suggest that psoriatic arthritis is also associated with an\n      increased cardiovascular risk with accelerated atherosclerosis and increased cardiovascular\n      risk. However, data regarding cardiovascular comorbidity and cardiovascular risk factors in\n      patients with psoriatic arthritis are limited.\n\n      Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of daily supplementation with\n      3 g n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on risk markers for cardiovascular disease and\n      inflammation in patients with psoriatic arthritis.\n\n      Design: Randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial with n-3\n      polyunsaturated fatty acids in patient with psoriatic arthritis.\n\n      Setting: Departments of Rheumatology, Nephrology and Cardiology at Aalborg University\n      Hospital and Vendsyssel Hospital in Region Northern Denmark\n\n      Participants: 156 men and women aged > 18 years with psoriatic arthritis classified by the\n      CASPAR criteria will be included. Exclusion criteria: cardiac arrhythmias, conduction\n      disturbances, treatment with biological drugs or oral corticosteroids. Inclusion time:\n      spring 2013 to spring 2015.\n\n      Method: The following data will be collected for each participant: Interview including\n      dietary records, assessment of tender and swollen joints, enthesitis, dactylitis, patient\n      global assessment of disease activity (Visual Analogue Scale ), global assessment of pain\n      (Visual Analogue Scale), psoriatic skin involvement by Psoriatic Area and Severity Index\n      (PASI), laboratory parameters of disease activity and risk markers of cardiovascular\n      disease.\n\n      For detection of early cardiovascular risk markers Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Pulse\n      Wave Velocity (PWV) will be performed.\n\n      Main outcome measures: The primary endpoint will be HRV and secondary endpoints will be PWV,\n      inflammatory activity and use of analgesics.\n\n      The trial is approved by The local Ethics Committee, registration number N20120076"
