When cTOI/pTOI ratio increases >5%\n      within a 6h period, predefined interventions will be performed.\n\n      Primary outcome parameter will be duration of hypotensive episodes and use of catecholamines\n      during the first 48h after birth. Secondary outcome parameters will be cerebral injury and\n      mortality."
