            "textblock": "Aphasia, commonly defined as impairment or loss of language functions, is a frequent and\n      often chronic consequence of stroke, with detrimental effects on patient autonomy and\n      health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Although beneficial in some cases, the effectiveness\n      of behavioral therapy is often limited, and therefore new complementary treatments must be\n      developed in order to improve rehabilitation of post-stroke aphasia.\n\n      In most individuals, language areas in the brain are localized in the left hemisphere. After\n      stroke, there is evidence that the brain reorganizes such that either areas close to damaged\n      language areas in the Left Hemisphere, or anatomically similar areas in the Right\n      Hemisphere, are recruited to perform language tasks.  One hypothesis is that Right\n      Hemisphere activation in language tasks is detrimental to effective language use.\n\n      Recently, studies have begun to examine the effects of non-invasive brain stimulation on\n      aphasia rehabilitation. One such technique is transcranial direct current stimulation\n      (tDCS), which involves administering weak electrical currents through surface electrodes on\n      the scalp. The effects can either stimulate an area, or inhibit an area of the brain. The\n      main hypothesis is that stimulating language areas in the Left Hemisphere in conjunction\n      with speech language therapy will facilitate reorganization of language-relevant areas of\n      the brain, and improve expression.\n\n      The proposed study will compare the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation\n      (tDCS) activating language centers in the left hemisphere, and tDCS inhibiting Broca's\n      homologue in the Right Hemisphere, in right-handed individuals with chronic post-stroke\n      aphasia. This study will provide information on the effects of tDCS, in conjunction with\n      speech-language therapy, on aphasia rehabilitation."
