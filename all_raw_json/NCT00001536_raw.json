            "textblock": "Since the gene responsible for achondroplasia was identified in 1994, it has become possible\n      to test for achondroplasia prenatally.  Moreover, prenatal genetic testing for\n      achondroplasia is relatively simple and is highly likely to be informative for any couple\n      seeking testing.  Four diagnostic laboratories in the U.S. are currently performing prenatal\n      genetic testing for achondroplasia.  Before prenatal genetic testing for achondroplasia\n      becomes more widely available, however, it is essential that we learn more about the lives\n      of affected individuals and their families, the implications of offering testing for\n      achondroplasia, and the education and the counseling needs of this community.  Personal\n      interviews and stories have been published and discussed at national meetings (Ablon 1984).\n      We conducted a pilot telephone interview survey of 15 individuals with achondroplasia.  What\n      is needed now is a large scale quantitative study of the community of little people and\n      their families.  To meet this need, we have developed a survey tool to analyze family\n      relationships, quality of life, tendencies toward optimism or pessimism,\n      information-avoiding or information-seeking behaviors, social support, involvement in Little\n      People of America Inc. (LPA), self-esteem, sociodemographics and views on achondroplasia,\n      religiousness, reproductive and family plans, genetic testing, and abortion.  The\n      self-administered survey will be completed nationally by a sample of persons with\n      achondroplasia and their family members."
