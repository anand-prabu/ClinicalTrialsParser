Retrospective data indicate that the\n      hearing is preserved in most patient years after the gamma knife treatment. Recent\n      prospective data suggests that radiosurgery could be a hearing preserving treatment for\n      these patients.\n\n      The main objective of this study is to evaluate if GKRS can inhibit progression of hearing\n      loss in patients with VS. Patients with preserved hearing will be offered to participate in\n      the study and randomized ether to GKRS or initial conservative treatment for their\n      vestibular schwannoma. They will then be followed with scheduled magnetic resonance\n      image(MRI) and audiometry and evaluated after one, three and five years after treatment."

Hearing loss due injury or to active ear disease, such as Meniere\u00b4s disease,\n             otosclerosis or chronic otitis media.\n\n             5.
