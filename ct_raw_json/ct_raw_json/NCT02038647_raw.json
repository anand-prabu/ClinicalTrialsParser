Male or female patients \u2265 18 years old\n\n          2. Have a pathologically (histology or cytology) confirmed diagnosis of SCLC\n\n          3. Have received and progressed after a platinum-based standard chemotherapy regimen for\n             first line treatment of SCLC, either limited stage (LS) or extensive stage (ES).\n\n          4. Have measurable disease within \u2264 2 weeks before randomization. Clear radiographic\n             evidence of disease progression after initial therapy should have been documented.\n\n          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1 (PS 0-1).\n\n          6. Patients with treated brain metastases (surgery, whole or stereotactic brain\n             radiation) are allowed provided the lesions have been stable for at least 2 weeks and\n             the patient is off steroids or is on a stable dose of steroids. Patients should be\n             without neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurological\n             and/or other AEs.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria\n\n        Patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be randomized to\n        treatment:\n\n          1. Any prior therapy for second-line treatment of SCLC.\n\n          2. Patients who relapsed \u2265 180 days after their response to first-line treatment.\n\n          3. Prior treatment with an Aurora A specific-targeted or pan-Aurora-targeted agent,\n             including alisertib, or any other investigational agent.\n\n          4. Prior treatment with paclitaxel or any other taxane agent.\n\n          5. Known hypersensitivity to Cremophor\u00ae EL, paclitaxel, or its components.\n\n          6. Any comorbid condition or unresolved toxicity that would preclude administration of\n             alisertib or weekly paclitaxel.\n\n          7. Prior history of \u2265 Grade 2 neurotoxicity that is not resolved to \u2264 Grade 1\n\n          8. Patients with symptomatic and/or progressive brain metastases or with carcinomatous\n             meningitis.\n\n          9. Treatment with clinically significant enzyme inducers within 14 days prior to the\n             first dose of alisertib and during study conduct. Major prohibited enzyme inducers\n             include: phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine,\n             and St. John's wort.\n\n         10. Inability to swallow alisertib or other orally administered medications.\n\n         11. Requirement for administration of proton pump inhibitor (PPI), H2 antagonist, or\n             pancreatic enzymes.\n\n         12. Diagnosed with or treated for another malignancy within 2 years before the first dose\n             of study drug, or previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have any evidence\n             of residual disease.\n\n         13. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition(s) per protocol.\n\n         14. History of myocardial infarction, unstable symptomatic ischemic heart disease,\n             uncontrolled hypertension despite appropriate medical therapy, any ongoing cardiac\n             arrhythmias of Grade > 2, thromboembolic events (eg, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary\n             embolism, or symptomatic cerebrovascular events), or any other cardiac condition (eg,\n             pericardial effusion or restrictive cardiomyopathy) within 6 months before receiving\n             the first dose of study drug.\n\n         15. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis B or\n             hepatitis C.\n\n         16. Surgery within 3 weeks (or 2 weeks for a minor surgery) before study enrollment and\n             not fully recovered to baseline or to a stable clinical status.\n\n         17. Patients who are pregnant, lactating, or do not agree to use effective methods of\n             contraception during the study treatment period through 6 months after the last dose\n             of study drug per protocol."
