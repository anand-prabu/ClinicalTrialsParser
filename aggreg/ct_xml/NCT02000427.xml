      This study seeks adult subjects with R/R Ph+ B-precursor ALL. This is a single-arm Simon II
      stage design, multicenter study consisting of a screening period, an induction treatment
      period (2 cycles of blinatumomab), a consolidation treatment period (up to 3 additional
      cycles of blinatumomab for applicable subjects), and a safety follow-up visit 30 days after
      treatment. Following the safety follow-up visit, subjects will be followed for response
      duration and survival every 3 months for 18 months or death, whichever occurs first.

    <description>Blinatumomab is administered as a continuous intravenous infusion (CIVI). A single cycle of blinatumomab treatment is 6 weeks in duration, which includes 4 weeks of blinatumomab followed by a 2-week treatment-free interval. In the first cycle, the initial dose will be 9 μg/day for the first 7 days of treatment, a dose that then will be escalated (dose step) to 28 μg/day starting at day 8 (week 2) through day 29 (week 4).
For all subsequent cycles (beginning with the second induction cycle and continuing through consolidation for applicable subjects), 28 μg/day will be the dose for all 4 weeks of continuous treatment.</description>
