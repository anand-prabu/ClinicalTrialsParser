This study therefore evaluates the value of\n      non-invasively measured arterial stiffness and central hemodynamics for guiding\n      antihypertensive treatment in selected patient populations (i.e. elderly patients, patients\n      with diabetes mellitus, patients with heart failure, and patients with resistant\n      hypertension)."
