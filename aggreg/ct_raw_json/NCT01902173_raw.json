To assess the safety of dabrafenib in combination with GSK2141795 and select the optimal\n      dose of GSK2141795 for the phase II portion in patients with v-raf murine sarcoma viral\n      oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) mutant cancer. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the objective response\n      rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial responses) in patients with BRAF^V600\n      mutant metastatic melanoma who have previously progressed on BRAF^V600 inhibitor-based\n      therapy. (Phase II)\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To estimate overall survival and progression-free survival. II. To assess the toxicity\n      profile of the recommended phase II dose.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To explore the molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitor therapy\n      using available biopsies of lesions that progressed during prior BRAF inhibitor-based\n      therapy.\n\n      II. To explore potential drug-drug interactions between dabrafenib and GSK2141795 leading to\n      changes in the expected exposure with either agent compared to prior experience. (Phase I)\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 followed by a\n      phase II study.\n\n      Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 PO\n      once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and\n      then every 6 months for 2 years."
