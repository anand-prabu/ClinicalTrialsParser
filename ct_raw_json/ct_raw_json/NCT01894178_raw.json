The Parker Flex-Tip tracheal tube has\n      a flexible, curved, and tapered tip design different from traditional endotracheal tubes.\n      The design allows the tube to lie closely against the fiberoptic scope that is often used to\n      facilitate intubation, resulting in a smaller gap between the ETT and the fiberoptic scope.\n      This may allow the ETT to clear anatomic obstructions more easily. The patients they\n      examined had an average body mass index (BMI) categorized as normal weight. To our\n      knowledge, there have not been any studies that have investigated the use of the Parker\n      Flex-Tube for fiberoptic intubations in patients categorized as obese by BMI. Our hypothesis\n      is that the Parker Flex-Tip ETT results in easier passage of the ETT over a fiberoptic scope\n      during elective fiberoptic intubation of obese patients in comparison to a traditional ETT."

Both groups\n      will be electively intubated with a fiberoptic scope. One group will be intubated using a\n      Parker-Flex endotracheal tube and the second group of will be intubated with a standard\n      endotracheal tube. There will be an equal probability of being assigned to either group. No\n      placebo or control group will be used. Randomization will be computer-generated and\n      assignments will be enclosed in sealed envelopes to provide allocation concealment. The\n      anesthesiology technician involved in the case will open the envelope at the start of the\n      case and will not be blinded to the study, due to the fact that the technician must prepare\n      the endotracheal tube for the fiberoptic intubation."
