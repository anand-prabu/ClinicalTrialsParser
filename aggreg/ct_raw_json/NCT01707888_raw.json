However, the role of sublobar resection is still in dispute\n      considering the dramatic improvement in radiographic technology, minimal invasive surgical\n      technique and significant advances in our understanding of the biology of NSCLC in the\n      subsequent 20 years. And Recent meta-analysis revealed survival after limited resection for\n      stage I lung cancer was comparable to that after lobectomy. This is a nationwide,\n      multicenter, prospective, randomized open phase III study, aimed To evaluate the 5 year\n      overall survival (OS) rate of two types of surgery. Patients are stratified according to\n      tumor size, histology, smoking status and institutions. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2\n      treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo lobectomy by thoracotomy or thoracoscopy/VATS.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo sublobar resection(wedge resection or anatomical\n           segmentectomy) by thoracotomy or thoracoscopy/VATS.\n\n      patients will be followed up every 6 months for 2 years and annually for 5 years\n      postoperatively."
