      This study aims to evaluate topical application of Cocaine HCl 4% and 10% on safety and
      efficacy in local (topical) anesthesia for diagnostic procedures and surgeries on or through
      accessible mucous membranes of the nasal cavities.

    <textblock>
      Randomized, prospective, multisite, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study
      of a Placebo Topical Solution versus Cocaine HCl 4% or 10% Topical Solution as an anesthetic
      prior to a diagnostic procedure or surgery.

      In the Safety and Efficacy first phase, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to
      one of the three treatment groups (placebo, Cocaine HCl 4% or 10% topical solution)
      pre-procedure and given one application of up to 4 mL from one bottle of the assigned test
      product. After pre-procedure Von Frey filament testing, the blind will be broken, but only
      relative to placebo versus cocaine, not relative to the strength of the cocaine. The placebo
      subjects will then exit participation in the efficacy portion of the trial, and be followed
      for safety for 7 days. Treatment group subjects who do not feel pain after Von Frey testing
      will receive their surgery or diagnostic procedure and also be followed for safety for 7
      days.

      In the Safety second phase, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to one of the two
      treatment groups (Cocaine HCl 4% or 10% topical solution) pre-procedure and given one
      application of up to one 4 mL of the assigned test product. After pre-procedure Von Frey
      filament testing reveals a pain score of 0, subjects will receive their surgery or
      diagnostic procedure, and then all subjects will be followed for safety for 7 days.

    <description>The primary endpoint for this trial is analgesic success immediately after application of study drug and sustained throughout the diagnostic procedure or surgery for each nostril that received the study drug application. A subject will be considered a treatment success if they meet the following: Prior to the procedure or surgery, a 0 pain score on the 10 point pain scale (0=no pain, 10=unbearable pain) based on the Von Frey filament challenge after application of the assigned treatment solution (placebo, 4% or 10% Cocaine HCl). During the procedure or surgery, no further analgesic treatment is required (only 4% and 10% Cocaine HCl subjects who receive a procedure or surgery). Otherwise, the subject will be considered a treatment failure.</description>

    <description>Group 1: Placebo group -Placebo solution, up to 4 mL, is applied for 20 minutes via cotton pledget(s), then the nasal site is tested with a Von Frey (or equivalent) filament (Size 5.18, about 15 grams of force) to determine and record pain on a pain scale of 0 to 10. The subject will then exit the treatment portion of the trial and be followed for safety for seven days . All placebo subjects, regardless of Von Frey filament test results, will undergo Phase 1 recovery (i.e. at least 90 minutes after cotton pledget removal) and associated required study procedures (including the final 12 lead ECG). After a minimum of 24 hours from the time of study drug pledget removal, the subject may continue the procedure, and the treatment reverts to standard anesthetic management (suitable products at the discretion of the investigator). Alternatively, at the investigator's discretion, the diagnostic procedure or surgery may be delayed until study termination.</description>

             codeine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, aspirin, or acetaminophen.

          -  Subjects who have experienced a seizure while taking isoniazid (INH), phenothiazines,
             chlorpromazine, thioridazine, theophylline, or tricyclic antidepressants such as
             amitriptyline.

             rescreen if eligibility requirements are met.

          -  Has a history of myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, congestive heart
             failure, irregular heart rhythm (as fully defined in sections 9.4, 9.5, and 9.6 of
             the protocol), or uncontrolled hypertension or is taking (or has recently taken)
             monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Uncontrolled hypertension is defined as systolic blood
             pressure greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure greater than
             or equal to 90 mm Hg

          -  Has a known personal or family history of hereditary pseudocholinesterase deficiency.
             Study participants will be screened by asking about personal or family history of
             anesthetic reaction, anesthetic death, and previous diagnosis of pseudocholinesterase
             deficiency in a relative or personally. Subjects identified with pseudocholinesterase
             deficiency are at risk for delayed recovery with certain anesthetics (e.g.
             succinylcholine and ester-based anesthetics).

          -  Has a known personal or family history of pheochromocytoma. Study participants will

             during the course of the study. All stimulant prescription, and nonprescription
             products such as catecholamines (norepinephrine or epinephrine), ephedrine,
             pseudoephedrine and any other amphetamines in the 48 hours prior to screening or has
             a need to use these drugs during the course of the study. All herbal products are
             also prohibited within 48 hours prior to screening or if the subject has a need to
             use these drugs during the course of the study.

          -  Has screening 12-lead ECG findings of any abnormalities as listed in sections 7.9.4,
             7.9.5, and 7.9.6 of the protocol. Generally, these are current or prior myocardial
             ischemia or infarction, dysrhythmia, or risk of serious dysrhythmia (such as
             prolonged QT interval) An exception to this would be from 7.9.5.11 if sinus
             bradycardia or sinus tachycardia is present, the Investigator must determine whether
             this finding is clinically relevant and exclusionary.

          -  Hemoglobin &lt;8.5 g/dL; a one-time retest will be allowed for Hb 8.3-8.4 g/dL

          -  WBC &lt; 3.5 x 103 cells/mcL; a one-time retest will be allowed for WBC 3.3-3.4 x 103

          -  Cardiac enzymes outside of the range of normal

          -  Coagulation studies that in the opinion of the investigator would be cause for the
             subject to be excluded from the study.

          -  Positive urine pregnancy test at screening or Day 1

          -  Positive urine drug test at screening or Day 1 without prior medically-necessary use
             of controlled substances (for example, benzodiazepines for anxiety)
