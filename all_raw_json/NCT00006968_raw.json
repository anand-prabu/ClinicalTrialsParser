Combining chemotherapy with donor peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of pentostatin followed by peripheral\n      stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have advanced kidney cancer."

Beginning on day 1, patients receive filgrastim\n           (G-CSF) IV over 1 hour or subcutaneously daily until blood counts recover. As\n           graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, patients receive cyclosporine IV continuously\n           until stem cell engraftment and then orally with gradual tapering.\n\n      Cohorts of 3 to 6 patients receive escalating doses of pentostatin until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients\n      experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n        -  Phase II: Patients receive treatment as in phase I at the MTD for pentostatin. Patients\n           are followed weekly for 60 days and then monthly for 10 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients (12 per phase) will be accrued for this study."
