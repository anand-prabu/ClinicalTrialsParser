After the second refer an\n      Automated Auditory Brainstem Response (AABR) is performed. The parents of all newborns, born\n      at \u2265 37 weeks gestational age, that fail this AABR in the Netherlands (about 550 yearly)\n      will be asked for consent for CMV-testing on the dried blood spots. Newborns diagnosed with\n      congenital CMV and with confirmed SNHL (\u2265 20 dB) are eligible for inclusion. After informed\n      consent infants will be randomized before the age of 13 weeks to a treatment group (6 weeks\n      valganciclovir 32 mg/kg daily dose; oral solution) or control group (no antiviral\n      treatment). Infants will be monitored for leucopenia and liver- and kidney function.\n      Inclusion will continue for at least 1.5 years, or until 25 infants in each treatment arm\n      have been randomized.\n\n      At 1 year follow-up hearing and child development are assessed. Hearing will be assessed\n      with Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry at an audiological center. Child development will\n      be assessed during a home visit with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development III and parents\n      will fill in the Dutch Child Development Inventory (NCDI) which will give more detailed\n      information on communicative development of their child. Viral loads in blood and urine will\n      be monitored during antiviral treatment as well as twice in the control group.\n\n      This study will provide information on the percentage of infants with a congenital CMV\n      infection who fail the neonatal hearing screening . The RCT will show whether early\n      treatment of congenital CMV infected children with hearing impairment prevents deterioration\n      of hearing loss and to what extent. The outcome may lead to implementation of congenital CMV\n      testing in the neonatal hearing screening program or possibly into the newborn blood\n      screening."
