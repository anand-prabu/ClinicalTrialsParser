Patients are stratified according to current treatment\n      for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (consolidation chemotherapy vs maintenance chemotherapy vs\n      off therapy for the past 6 months).\n\n      Patients receive split-virus trivalent influenza vaccine intramuscularly once or twice at 4\n      weeks apart for 2 doses.\n\n      Patients are followed at week 5. Patients receiving 2 doses of vaccine are also followed at\n      week 9.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 175 patients (50 receiving consolidation therapy, 75 receiving\n      maintenance therapy, and 50 off therapy) will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
