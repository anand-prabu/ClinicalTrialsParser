Withholding or withdrawing of life support (WLS) care was\n      introduced to avoid the suffering of critically ill patients. Decision to WLS is a difficult\n      and affected by several factors including not only disease severity but also ethics,\n      religion, culture, and legal background. In western countries, advance directives had an\n      important role to WLS for dying patients and honor patient autonomy. However, the illegality\n      of advance directives in Korea and Korean culture under Confucianism, requiring children to\n      do the best to treat their parents in the name of filial piety make physicians and family\n      members difficult to WLS in terminally ill patients.\n\n      Additionally, WLS in intensive care unit had been usually decided without official\n      documentation before the final legal decision by Supreme Court in Korea. Scanty information\n      exists about end-of-life practices because informed consents of WLS were taken after the\n      legal decision.\n\n      Thus, we aimed to investigate the current status of informed consent at the time of decision\n      to WLS and difference between WLS group and non-WLS group in Korea."
