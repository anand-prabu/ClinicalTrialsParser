  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although behavioral disorders origins in autistic children are still unclear, they seem to
      be influenced by sleep disorders. Results of studies performed on sleep quality in autistic
      children showed a high prevalence of sleep disorders in these children, estimated between 50
      and 80% compared to children with typical development and insomnia is one of the sleep
      disorders most frequently reported by autistic children's parents. Others studies showed
      circadian rhythm disorder in autistic children which could be the consequence of genetic
      abnormalities in the melatonin synthesis and the melatonin role in the synaptic transmission
      modulation.

      Melatonin by its sedative effects and its action on circadian pacemaker is a promoter of
      sleep proposed for insomnia treatment and circadian rhythm disorders.

      Two major recent studies (not yet published) in the United States and in England seek to
      show the effectiveness of melatonin by testing the effects of three doses of melatonin on
      reducing sleep disorders.

      It is therefore interesting and important to conduct a parallel study to assess the
      melatonin effect not only on the reduction of sleep disorders (sleep onset latency, total
      sleep time…), but on sleep quality (number of nocturnal awakenings).

      The strength of this study lies in the combination of several measurement tools to assess
      the melatonin dose-effect on all parameters in both physiological (actimetrics,
      polysomnography), biological (dosage 24h sulfatoxymelatonin), behavioral (sleep
      questionnaire, index of insomnia severity, rating scale autistic disorder) as well as
      possible side effects.

      The primary objective is to determine the most effective dose of melatonin to improve sleep
      quality in autistic children.
