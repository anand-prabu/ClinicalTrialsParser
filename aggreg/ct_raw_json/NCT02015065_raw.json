            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      -Some people with wild-type gastrointestinal stromal tumors (WT-GIST) have a deficiency in\n      one of their proteins called SDH. Vandetanib is a cancer drug that has been approved to\n      treat thyroid cancer and has been used with some success in other tumors that have a similar\n      loss of SDH. Researchers want to see if this drug can also decrease tumor growth in people\n      with WT-GIST.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      -To test whether the study drug will benefit people with WT-GIST.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      -Adults and children 3 years old and older with WT-GIST.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Researchers will test participants tumor tissue to confirm it is the wild type of GIST.\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.\n           They will also have electrical recording of the heart (ECOG) and scans of the tumor.\n\n        -  Participants will take the study drug in 28-day cycles. Their doctor will decide how\n           many cycles they can complete.\n\n             -  They will take the study drug once every day and record it in a diary.\n\n             -  On Day 14, they will also visit their doctor to look for side effects.\n\n        -  Before cycles 2, 3 and 4, participants will have a physical exam, urine tests, blood\n           pressure check, and blood tests. These tests will then be done periodically for as long\n           as they are in the study.\n\n        -  Before cycle 4, scans will be done to check the size of the cancer. Most of these will\n           be repeated every 3-6 cycles.\n\n        -  When they stop taking the study drug, participants will return to the clinic for a\n           physicial exam and blood tests."

            "textblock": "Background:\n\n        -  Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumor of the\n           gastrointestinal tract, resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation therapy. KIT\n           and PDGFRA mutations have been identified as tumor initiating events in 85% of adult\n           patients with GIST, but 85% of GISTs in pediatric patients lack KIT and PDGFRA\n           mutations (wild-type) and imatinib is not as effective in eliciting objective\n           responses.\n\n        -  Recent work in the Pediatric and Wild-Type (wt) GIST Clinic at the NCI led to the\n           identification of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) germline mutations in 12% patients with\n           wt-GIST (6/34). SDH protein expression evaluated using immunohistochemistry (IHC) was\n           markedly decreased or absent in 18/18 patients with pediatric wt-GIST. Thus the\n           majority of wt-GIST are SDH-deficient. Vandetanib (ZACTIMA; ZD6474; AstraZeneca) is an\n           oral small molecule antineoplastic drug that inhibits VEGFR2, EGFR, and RET-dependent\n           signaling. Preliminary preclinical data demonstrate marked growth inhibition of\n           SDH-mutant/deficient renal cell carcinoma cell lines when treated with vandetanib.\n\n      Objective(s):\n\n        -  Primary: To assess the clinical activity (radiographic response RECIST v1.1) of\n           vandetanib in children and adults with wt-GIST using RECIST (v1.1).\n\n        -  Secondary: To evaluate the toxicity, progression-free and overall survival, the\n           pharmacodynamics, and quality of life on treatment with vandetanib.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      -Adults and children with measurable localized or metastatic wt-GIST confirmed in a CLIA\n      laboratory will be eligible for trial participation. Patients must have measurable disease\n      by RECISTv1.1 and adequate organ function.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  This phase II trial will determine whether daily oral vandetanib is active in patients\n           with wt-GIST. Vandetanib activity will be assessed primarily by radiographic response\n           of measurable disease using RECISTv1.1.\n\n        -  Vandetanib will be administered orally once daily continuously in the absence of\n           toxicity or disease progression, using a 28-day cycle.\n\n        -  Patients will be carefully monitored for toxicity and response. A small, optimal\n           two-stage phase II design with a target response rate of 25% will be used. Nine\n           evaluable patients will be enrolled initially. If 1 or more of the first 9 have a\n           response, then accrual would continue until a total of 24 patients have enrolled. If\n           there are 3 or more responses in 24 (12.5% or more) patients, then this would be\n           sufficiently interesting activity to warrant further study."
