Patients will be randomly allocated to the control or one of\n      the four experimental regimens in the ratio 2:1:1:1:1. Experimental regimens will be given\n      for 12 weeks. Thereafter, participants in the experimental arms will receive continuation\n      phase treatment for 14 weeks containing standard-dose rifampicin and isoniazid. All\n      participants will receive 25 mg of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) with every dose of INH to prevent\n      INH\u2010related neuropathy. Interim analyses will be conducted during the trial for efficacy,\n      with the aim of identifying experimental arms that perform below a pre\u2010specified efficacy\n      threshold; these arms will then be stopped from further recruitment.\n\n      Following the first scheduled interim analysis on March 3rd, the Trial Steering Committee\n      (TSC) followed a recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) and has\n      stopped the enrolment into two of the arms in the MAMS-TB trial: HRZQ and HR20ZQ, based on\n      these arms not meeting the pre-specified gain in efficacy over control. Importantly, there\n      was no safety concern that prompted stopping recruitment to these arms. They recommended\n      that recruitment to arm 2 (HRZQ) and 3 (HR20ZQ) be terminated as there was insufficient\n      evidence that these regimens could shorten treatment. Importantly, there was no evidence\n      that either arm was inferior to standard treatment (the control arm) with regards to\n      efficacy. There was, however, sufficient evidence that the other intervention arms HR35ZE\n      and HR20ZM could shorten treatment to continue enrolling patients."
