  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The low prevalence of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among adult Latinas
      likely contributes to the high rates of cancer and other chronic diseases in this
      population. The goals of the current study, based largely upon the core principles of the
      Social Ecological Model, are to design, implement, and evaluate an innovative multi-level
      intervention promoting physical activity among churchgoing Latinas.

      The evidenced-based intervention targets three &quot;tiers&quot; of environmental influences (i.e.,
      church, immediate neighborhood surrounding the church, and community) on activity, as well
      as MVPA-related personal factors (i.e.., intra/interpersonal, cultural, and perceived
      environmental variables). The physical activity intervention will be compared with an
      attention-control condition providing health education on cancer prevention and control via
      screening.

      Sixteen churches will be randomly assigned to either the physical activity intervention or
      the attention-control condition. The primary aim of the study is to determine whether a
      multi-level intervention will increase MVPA among Latina churchgoers in the intervention
      condition relative to the attention-control condition.
