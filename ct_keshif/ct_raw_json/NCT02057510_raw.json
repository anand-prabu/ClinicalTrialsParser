Follow-up examinations and data collection will be conducted at six-month intervals\n      up to 2 years after the start of radiation therapy.

Secondary outcomes will include measures of dental caries, periodontal\n      health, salivary flow, and exposed bone/osteoradionecrosis.\n\n      The proposed research will provide more information to inform the community about the\n      sequelae of Radiation Therapy (RT) in head and neck cancer patients, to refine current\n      guidelines and to design future studies on the dental management of these patients."
