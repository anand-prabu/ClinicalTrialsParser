Metformin is a medication used to treat patients with\n      diabetes. It has been shown to have anti-tumor properties in breast cancer. Atorvastatin is\n      widely used for the treatment of elevated cholesterol and has also shown to have anti-tumor\n      properties in breast cancer. Both have safely been used in patients without diabetes or\n      elevated cholesterol. This study will assess the impact of combined metformin and\n      atorvastatin on breast tumor tissue markers as well as blood levels, including cholesterol\n      and insulin. Both medications will be given for two weeks prior to your scheduled breast\n      surgery."

In this pre-surgical trial, patients will\n      receive metformin and atorvastatin at bedtime. Women with histologically-confirmed invasive\n      breast cancer or DCIS will be recruited by the medical oncologist and will start the dual\n      therapy at least two weeks prior to their scheduled surgery.\n\n      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate changes in tissue levels of the\n      proliferation marker Ki-67. These will be compared to a) historical control group of\n      metformin treated patients and b) historical control matched by age, body mass index, and\n      tumor stage who did not receive metformin or statin.  Secondary endpoints include assessment\n      of changes in protein expression of AMPK/mTOR signaling; modulation of apoptosis markers\n      such as bax, bid, and various caspase levels; and changes in fasting serum markers of the\n      insulin growth factor pathway such as insulin, glucose, and lipids.  The goal is to\n      determine if dual combination treatment with metformin plus atorvastatin significantly\n      impacts tumor-based markers, such as proliferation, and blood-based biomarkers."
