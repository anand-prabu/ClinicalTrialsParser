      This study is a phase I/II, open-label study in patients with relapsed CD37 positive
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  The Phase I part of the study is a dose escalating study to define
      the maximum tolerable dose of 177Lu-DOTA-HH1 (Betalutin), assess safety and toxicity,
      pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and efficacy. After completion of the phase I study, a
      dose will be selected for the phase II part of the study which is designed to investigate
      tumour response rate, progression free survival, confirmation of the selected dose as well
      as safety and toxicity.

    <description>Patients are closely monitored during and after injection of Betalutin over a 12 week period. Thereafter, at certain intervals up to 5 years. Safety evaluations are vital signs, physical examination, hematology and serum biochemistry.
Adverse events and abnormal laboratory values will be graded for toxicity according to CTCAE version 4.</description>
