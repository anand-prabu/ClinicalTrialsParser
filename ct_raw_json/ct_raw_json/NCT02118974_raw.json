Patients will be\n      randomized into each group Conventional Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (Group #1) and\n      Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (Group #2) using a random number generator.  Data\n      collection will occur during the following points of patient interaction: pre-operative\n      appointment, the surgical procedure, the patient's hospitalization, first post-operative\n      appointment, and final post-operative appointment.\n\n      The care for the patients enrolled in this study will not deviate from the standard care of\n      patients who are currently undergoing laparoscopic and robot-assisted laparoscopic\n      hysterectomy.  The patients who present to the office for pre-operative history and physical\n      examination for laparoscopic hysterectomy will be counseled about participation in this\n      study. Basic data collection will commence at the pre-operative visiting, including: patient\n      demographics, past medical history, past surgical history, physical exam findings, and\n      imaging results.  The pre-operative appointment will occur between one to thirty days prior\n      to surgery.  Intra-operative and immediate post-operative data will be collected by the\n      surgical assistant (resident or fellow) and will include surgical procedure (conventional\n      laparoscopic or robot-assisted), operative time, hematocrit, estimated blood loss, length of\n      stay, and complications."
