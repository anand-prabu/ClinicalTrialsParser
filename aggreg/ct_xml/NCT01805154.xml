  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this registry is to understand comprehensive clinical care strategies for
      Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) patients especially non-responders in real-world
      clinical practice.

      Patients who are implanted CRT devices will be enrolled in the study. Once implanted, all
      patients will be followed at every 3 months for the first 12 months from the implant.  The
      responder/non-responder evaluation will occur at 6 months from the implant date.  The
      criteria used for determining the response to CRT will be captured.

      After the 12 months follow-up, non-responders will continue to be followed at every 3 months
      whereas responders will be followed at every 6 months until the study completion.

      During the office follow-up visits, arrhythmic episode diagnoses, device data and stored
      electrogram will be collected. All clinical events such as hospitalization for HF, all-cause
      hospitalizations, and all-cause death will also be collected.  For patients who are
      non-responders to CRT, any re-optimization of the device, i.e., AV/VV interval optimization,
      LV lead repositioning and pacing vector reconfiguration as well as modified/new clinical
      therapies administered in an attempt to improve HF condition will be collected.
