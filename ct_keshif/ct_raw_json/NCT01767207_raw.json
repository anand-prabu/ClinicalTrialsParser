Accumulating evidence indicate that children with\n      cognitive dysfunction have a significant higher risk of developing psychological disorders.\n      Therefore assessment of such comorbid disorders should be offered. The main purpose of this\n      pilot study is to systematically assess the prevalence and type of comorbid psychological\n      disorders among children with cognitive dysfunction referred to a Norwegian outpatient\n      pediatric rehabilitation clinic."
