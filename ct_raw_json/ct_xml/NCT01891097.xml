      This is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the clinical efficacy of combined
      electro-acupuncture and auricular acupuncture for persistent Iinsomnia in the adult
      population in Hong Kong.

    <textblock>
      Combined electro-acupuncture and auricular acupuncture is potential to be an alternative
      treatment for primary insomnia. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical
      effectiveness of combined electroacupuncture and auricular acupuncture on persistent
      insomnia. This is a randomized double-blinded controlled trial. Patients will be randomly
      assigned to the electro-acupuncture group, the electro-acupuncture plus auricular
      acupuncture group or the waitlist controlled group. Patients will be put into groups and
      then compared.The chance of getting into each group is 3:3:1.

    <description>Patients will be treated at bilateral Ear Shenmen, Sishencong EX-HN1, Anmian, Neiguan PC6, Shenmen HT7, Sanyinjiao SP6, and unilateral Yintang EX-HN3 and Baihui GV20. Acupuncture treatment will be performed by a registered Chinese medicine practitioner. &quot;De qi&quot;(an irradiating feeling considered to be indicative of effective needling) is achieved if possible. An electric-stimulator (ITO ES160, Japan) is connected to these needles to give an electric-stimulation in continuous wave, frequency of 4 Hz, 0.4 ms square wave pulses and constant current. Surgical tape or hair pin will be adhered to the needles.The needles will be left for 30 min and then removed. Acupuncture treatment will consist of three sessions per week for 3 consecutive weeks.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be treated with electroacupuncture plus auricular acupuncture for 3 weeks. The acupuncture regimen, is the same as in electroacupuncture group. In additional to electroacupuncture, subjects will receive auricular acupuncture using borneol. The following 6 ear acupoints points will be selected: Ear Shenmen, Heart, Kidney, Liver, Spleen, Occiput, and Subcortex. In each treatment borneol crystals will be attached to the left or right side of the ear in alternation with adhesive plaster in each acupuncture treatment visit. Subjects will be asked to press the borneol crystals lightly for five minutes in the morning, afternoon and evening everyday and reminded them to remove the plaster and borneol crystals after 48 hours. We will check for skin irritation at each treatment visit.</description>
