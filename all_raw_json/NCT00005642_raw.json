            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum target-inhibiting dose of SU5416 in patients with\n      advanced solid tumors. II. Determine the relationship between dose or plasma levels and the\n      clinical safety profile and antitumor effects of this treatment regimen in terms of\n      objective response, stabilization of disease, or progression-free survival in this patient\n      population. III. Evaluate the relationship between dose or plasma levels of SU5416\n      concentrations and the ability of this treatment regimen to reduce microvessel density and\n      induce apoptosis of endothelial and tumor cells in this patient population. IV. Determine\n      prognostic and surrogate serologic markers in these patients treated with this regimen. V.\n      Determine if pre and posttreatment plasma and serum levels of angiogenic growth factors,\n      basic fibroblast growth factor, and vascular endothelial cell growth factor are prognostic\n      in predicting patient response to this regimen. VI. Determine if elevated plasma levels of\n      endothelial cell specific proteins reflective of SU5416-induced endothelial damage and/or\n      apoptosis are useful surrogate markers in assessing response to this treatment regimen in\n      these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-deescalation study. Patients receive SU5416 IV over 1 hour twice\n      weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 6-12 patients receive deescalating doses of SU5416 until\n      the maximum target-inhibiting dose (MTID) is determined. The MTID is defined as the dose at\n      which patients experience no greater than grade 1 toxicity. Patients are followed every 3\n      months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
