An investigational Enlite 2 glucose sensor measures the sensor glucose.  The glucose sensor signal is sent to the insulin pump.  From the insulin pump the sensor glucose is sent through the translator, which then relays the signal on to a controller.  An Android Mobile Device (off the shelf) has the control algorithm installed.  This device is known as the controller.  The controller serves as the control center for the Android system, receiving data from the sensor and pump components, feeding the data to its control algorithm, issuing delivery commands to the pump to apply the algorithm's recommend therapy, and providing a means to monitor the system.",
