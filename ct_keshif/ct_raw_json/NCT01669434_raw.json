Patients\n      presenting to the UNMC Pre-Anesthesia Screening (PAS) Clinic for an intermediate risk\n      surgery who are on chronic ACEI therapy will be eligible for enrollment. Subjects will be\n      randomized to either continue or hold their ACEI perioperatively. The outcome of interest is\n      intraoperative hypotension defined as a systolic blood pressure less than 60 mmHg or a\n      decrease in systolic pressure greater than a 30%. Blood pressure will be followed not only\n      throughout surgery, but also during recovery and the remainder of hospitalization. Renal\n      function will be assessed with creatinine measurements in the PAS clinic and on the first\n      postoperative day. No follow-up is planned beyond discharge from the hospital."
