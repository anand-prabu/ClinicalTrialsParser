Patients who will fulfill the entry criteria will\n      be enrolled in the study.\n\n      These patients will be treated with pantoprazole 40 mg die for 6 months and they will be\n      randomly assigned to 4 arms:\n\n        -  the first arm will receive placebo for 3 days/week for 6 months;\n\n        -  the second arm will receive LP-F19 in a dose of 25x109 live bacterial cells for 3\n           days/week for 6 months;\n\n        -  the third arm will receive LP-F19 in a dose of 25x109 live bacterial cells for 3\n           days/week for the first three months and placebo 3 days/week for the following three\n           months;\n\n        -  the fourth arm will receive placebo 3 days/week for the first three months and LP-F19\n           in a dose of 25x109 live bacterial cells for 3 days/week for the following three\n           months.\n\n      Placebo will consist of a  preparation similar to that of probiotic but with no added\n      microorganisms.\n\n      Adherence to treatment Will be evaluated based on self-reporting by the patients and count\n      of returned sackets during monthly control visits. Patients who will take at least 90% of\n      the drugs (pantoprazole, LP-F19 and placebo) for at least 90% of the scheduled time will be\n      considered compliant.\n\n      Before starting therapy (i.e. baseline evaluation) and every 4 weeks, each patient will fill\n      up a structured questionnaire for symptom assessment, concerning heartburn and\n      regurgitation, as well as, bowel symptoms, including bloating, abdominal pain, flatulence\n      and bowel habit.\n\n      Symptom and bowel habit assessment\n\n      Baseline and every 4 weeks after the beginning of the therapy, each patient will fill up a\n      structured questionnaire, focusing on the presence of heartburn, regurgitation, bloating,\n      flatulence, abdominal pain, diarrhea and constipation, with the help of a physician\n      interviewer. The questionnaire, according to a Likert scale, will assess frequency (0 =\n      never, 1 = < 1 episode/week; 2 = < 3 episodes/week; 3 = > 3 episodes/week; 4 = daily\n      episodes) and severity (0 = absent, 1 = mild i.e. not interfering with the daily activities,\n      2 = moderate i.e. limiting the daily activities, and 3 = severe i.e. hampering the daily\n      activities) of each symptom during the previous 6 months, at baseline and during the last\n      month at every 4-week checkpoints. According to an arbitrary index, symptoms will be\n      considered significant when interfering with daily activities (i.e., mean total score,\n      frequency plus severity, \u2265 4).\n\n      Subjects will record their bowel habit on validated diary cards, including every single\n      stool and stool consistency. Stool consistency will be de\ufb01ned according to the Bristol Stool\n      Form Scale (BSFS). Diary cards will be returned every four weeks."
