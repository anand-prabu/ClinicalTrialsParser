Bupropion is a promising medication for this purpose because of its\n      previously demonstrated efficacy and safety as well as its pharmacological actions at\n      dopamine systems.   The study will use a stratified randomization strategy that will allow\n      us to separately examine bupropion effects on abstinence initiation and relapse prevention.\n      Outcomes will be tracked over a 6-month time frame that includes assessment of drug use\n      during and after incentives have stopped.  In addition, the project will provide novel\n      information about mechanisms of medication effects by measuring subjective drug effects,\n      drug vs money choices, and self-reports of pleasure derived from daily non-drug activities.\n       The investigators hypothesis is that bupropion as compared to placebo treatment will both\n      enhance rates of abstinence initiation in those who have difficulty stopping cocaine and\n      retard rates of relapse in those who initially stopped their cocaine use.   Furthermore that\n      bupropion compared to placebo participants will report non-drug activities as more\n      pleasurable (reinforcing), will engage in more of them.  If hypothesized synergies are\n      demonstrated, the study will point the way to a significant advance in improved treatment\n      strategies for this critical group of drug abusers."

            "textblock": "The efficacy of behavior therapies may be enhanced by certain medications, particularly\n      those that act on dopaminergic systems.  The purpose of this project is to examine effects\n      of bupropion on initiation and maintenance of cocaine abstinence in a population of cocaine\n      dependent methadone maintenance patients.   Bupropion appears to be the most promising\n      medication for this purpose because of its previously demonstrated efficacy and safety as\n      well as its pharmacological actions at dopamine systems.\n\n      Methadone maintained cocaine dependent patients will participate (N = 200).  Volunteers will\n      be eligible for inclusion in the study if they are 1) enrolled in methadone maintenance\n      treatment, having previously met the criteria for opioid dependence; 2) between the ages of\n      18 and 65; 3) provide evidence of cocaine dependence (DSM-IV criteria, self-report, and/or\n      urine tests positive for cocaine during the intake process); and 4) are willing to take\n      study medications and adhere to reporting and data collection schedules.\n\n      Exclusion Criteria are:  1) history of epilepsy or seizure, including alcohol- or\n      cocaine-related seizure; 2) conditions with increased risk of seizure (e.g. head trauma with\n      loss of consciousness > 30 mins), 3) current use (past 30 days) of antidepressants,\n      antipsychotics, theophyillines, systemic steroids, MAO-A inhibitors, 4) recent use (past 30\n      days of any medication containing bupropion or budeprion (Wellbutrin\u00ae, Zyban\u00ae), 5) allergy\n      to bupropion or budeprion, 6) liver enzyme levels greater than 3x ULN; 7) uncontrolled\n      diabetes mellitus (glucose > 200mg%); 8) severe psychiatric diagnosis: schizophrenia,\n      psychosis, major depression, mania, current suicidal ideation with plan; cognitive\n      impairment severe enough to preclude informed consent or valid responses on questionnaires;\n      9) severe renal insufficiency (eGFR < 30 ml/min), 10) pregnant, breast feeding or unwilling\n      to use birth control, 11) medical illness that in the view of the investigators would\n      compromise participation in research, 12) advanced HIV infection requiring HAART 13) current\n      eating disorder (anorexia or bulimia), 14) uncontrolled hypertension with BO >140/90.\n\n      Study participants who qualify and sign informed consent will be stratified according to\n      their initial response to an abstinence incentive (contingency management) procedure\n      targeting cocaine negative urines.  Those who stop their cocaine use will enter a study that\n      examines effects of bupropion XL (300mg/day) versus placebo on relapse prevention.  Those\n      who fail to stop cocaine use after initial exposure to the CM procedure will enter a\n      parallel study conducted concurrently that examines the effects of bupropion XL (300mg/day)\n      on abstinence initiation. Our hypothesis is that bupropion as compared to placebo treatment\n      will both enhance rates of abstinence initiation in those who have difficulty stopping\n      cocaine and retard rates of relapse in those who initially stopped their cocaine use.\n\n      Each study will involve a CM schedule that is uniquely tailored to the questions being asked\n      but that is equated on total amount that can be earned ($675).   Both studies will track\n      outcomes over a 6-month time frame that includes assessment of drug use outcomes after\n      incentives have stopped.  In addition, the project will provide novel information about\n      mechanisms of medication effects by measuring subjective drug effects, drug vs money\n      choices, and self-reports of pleasure derived from daily non-drug activities.   The\n      investigators hypothesize that bupropion compared to placebo participants will report\n      non-drug activities as more pleasurable (reinforcing), will engage in more of them and that\n      measures of non-drug reinforcement will mediate abstinence outcomes.\n\n      Overall, this research will provide new and valuable information about combined\n      behavioral-pharmacological treatments and specifically the conditions under which medication\n      may enhance effects of CM.  If hypothesized synergies can be demonstrated, the study will\n      point the way to a significant advance in improved treatment outcomes for this critical\n      group of drug abusers.  The proposed study is compelling because it conceptually\n      differentiates the two key clinical issues in treatment of stimulant abusers- abstinence\n      initiation and relapse prevention.  It uses a design that efficiently and effectively tests\n      a combined treatment approach for each clinical issue and as well examines cognitive\n      function and reinforcement-based mediators.  The research will add to understanding of the\n      interplay between brain reinforcement systems and drug-seeking behavior.  Finally, it will\n      make an important contribution to behavioral therapy development by exploring a novel\n      solution to limitations previously noted for CM that include lack of response in some\n      patients and relapse after withdrawal of incentives."
