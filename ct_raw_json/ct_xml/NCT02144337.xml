    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the feasibility of a physical activity intervention called the Steps
      To Active Kids (STAK) programme in children aged 9 - 11 years with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus
      (T1DM). The STAK programme promotes physical activity in children who have a chronic
      condition, low levels of physical activity, are overweight or who lack confidence to take
      part in physical activity. The intervention involves an Activity Diary, circuit training,
      pedometer step  counting, daily physical activity monitoring and goal setting to promote
      long-term increases in physical activity and its associated health benefits. This randomised
      single-centre feasibility study will test whether the STAK programme is feasible for
      children with T1DM, in terms of acceptability, attractiveness and compliance and a
      qualitative process evaluation will aid the assessment of feasibility.
