As even mild disease leads to functional consequences with decreased ability to\n      live independently, HAND is of substantial public health concern. HIV-induced immune\n      activation/inflammation of monocytes (MO) may be primarily responsible for the development\n      of HAND.\n\n      Cenicriviroc is a combined CCR5 and CCR2 chemokine co-receptor antagonist. The investigators\n      hypothesize that dual CCR5 and CCR2 blockade with the use of CVC will lead to measurable\n      reductions in MO activation and lead to cognitive improvement by decreasing HIV infection of\n      MO and by interrupting the trafficking of such MO into the central nervous system.\n\n      The investigators propose a single arm, 24-week trial of CVC in 24 subjects  with HIV-1\n      infection suppressed on ART (plasma HIV RNA < 50 copies/ml) for 1 year or more with mild to\n      moderate cognitive impairment (NPZglobal < -0.5)."
