However, patient's compliance to conventional medical intervention is\n      generally unsatisfactory and many patients feel difficult to access to the detail medical\n      advice for type 2 DM.\n\n      Thus, the investigators developed a smartphone application for giving programed medical\n      intervention to patients according to patients data; blood pressure, fasting blood sugar,\n      body weight, calorie intake,exercise amount, etc."
