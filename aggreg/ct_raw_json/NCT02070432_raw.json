            "textblock": "LUZ11 is a new photosensitizer for use in photodynamic therapy (PDT) of solid tumors, such\n      as head and neck cancer. PDT with LUZ11 involves the intravenous administration of LUZ11\n      followed by irradiation of the target tumor with laser light of an appropriate wavelength.\n      The light causes the drug to react with oxygen, which forms reactive oxygen species (ROS)\n      locally and induces tumor cells death and damages the blood vessels of the tumor thus\n      preventing it from receiving nutrients.\n\n      The primary objective of this study is to assess the tolerability of LUZ11 following single\n      ascending doses of LUZ11. The secondary objectives of this study are to explore the LUZ11\n      dose that has anti-tumor effect following photoactivation and to determine LUZ11\n      pharmacokinetics."
