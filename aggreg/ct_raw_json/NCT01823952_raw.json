            "textblock": "-  Burden: Watery diarrhea including cholera continues to be a major cause of childhood\n           mortality in developing countries, with an estimated 1.5 million children dying each\n           year. This figure has greatly reduced from approximately 5 million diarrheal deaths\n           annually 20 years ago, a phenomenon often attributed to the utilization of oral\n           rehydration solution (ORS).\n\n        -  Knowledge Gap: ORS is very effective in correcting dehydration and reducing mortality,\n           but is not adequately used in many countries, partly due to the fact that it does not\n           reduce diarrhea. The physiological basis for ORS is that glucose-stimulated sodium and\n           fluid absorption is not inhibited by cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and\n           other diarrhea mediators which inhibit sodium chloride absorption. The conventional\n           glucose-based ORS does not reduce duration or severity of diarrhea and may in fact\n           paradoxically increase fecal fluid losses. Advances in ORS composition have included\n           the universal adoption of hypo-osmolar ORS (HO-ORS) in 2003. Recent technological\n           innovations have led to the use of amylase-resistant starches and their modifications\n           in the treatment of diarrhea. Short chain fatty acids (SCFA), which are produced in\n           colon from these non-absorbed carbohydrates, enhance sodium absorption. An orally\n           administered, non-absorbed starch (i.e., one resistant to digestion by amylase)\n           significantly reduced fecal fluid loss and the duration of diarrhea in patients with\n           cholera.\n\n        -  Relevance: Efforts are continuing to improve the efficacy of oral rehydration solution.\n           As glucose stimulates sodium and water absorption in small intestine, short chain fatty\n           acids (SCFAs) stimulate sodium and water absorption in the colon. In cholera, colonic\n           function is also impaired due to the lack of SCFAs. The main source of SCFAs is the\n           unabsorbed carbohydrates that are fermented in the colon by the colonic bacteria. The\n           maize starch contains substantial amount of amylase resistant starch that escapes\n           digestion and absorption in the small intestine and is fermented in the colon,\n           liberating SCFAs. We expect that our experimental ORS containing maize starch will\n           reduce the severity (stool volume) and enhance recovery (reduce duration) of diarrhoea."
