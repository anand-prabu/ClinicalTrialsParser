            "textblock": "Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) with or without medication has been used in the treatment\n      of panic disorder (PD). The purpose of this study is 1) to determine whether nine months of\n      maintenance cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) significantly improves the likelihood of\n      sustained improvement; and 2) to determine the acute acceptability and efficacy of\n      medication therapy or continued CBT alone among patients who fail to respond sufficiently to\n      an initial course of CBT alone.\n\n      It has been found that patients with PD respond as well to CBT or medication alone as they\n      do to a combination of the two. Since the combined treatments are expensive and CBT is\n      associated with less risk of medical toxicity compared to medications, CBT alone will be\n      used first.\n\n      All patients will first receive CBT alone.  If the patient responds to this therapy, the\n      patient will be assigned randomly (like tossing a coin) to 1 of 2 groups.  One group will\n      continue to receive CBT (maintenance therapy) for 9 months.  The other group of responders\n      will not receive any further therapy.  If a patient does not respond to CBT alone, he/she\n      will be assigned randomly to 1 of 2 different groups.  One group will receive paroxetine;\n      the other will continue to receive CBT for a longer period.  The response to treatment will\n      be evaluated to see which regimen works best to treat PD.  The study will last approximately\n      3 years.\n\n      An individual may be eligible for this study if he/she has panic disorder with no more than\n      mild agoraphobia (fear of being in public places) and is at least 18 years old."

            "textblock": "To determine if maintenance CBT produces a more sustained improvement among patients with\n      panic disorder (PD) who respond to an initial course of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)\n      alone. For those who do not respond sufficiently to CBT alone, to determine if the addition\n      of pharmacotherapy is acceptable and if  this improves response among those inadequate\n      responders to CBT alone.\n\n      This multicenter study builds upon the findings of a prior study comparing imipramine,\n      placebo, CBT, and their combination in the treatment of PD patients with no more than mild\n      agoraphobia. That study found response rates were as high with CBT or imipramine alone as\n      with their combination. Given the added cost of combined treatments, it therefore seems\n      reasonable to begin with monotherapy. Further, following general principles of medical\n      practice, it would be reasonable to initiate treatment with the less invasive cognitive\n      behavioral intervention. It is then important to learn what should be done following initial\n      treatment.\n\n      All patients initially receive CBT alone. Patients are then randomized into 1 of 2\n      post-acute studies, depending on response status. Responders are randomized to a maintenance\n      study comparing no maintenance with 9 months of continued CBT.  Nonresponders are randomized\n      to a study comparing paroxetine with continued CBT. The following outcomes will be examined:\n      the necessity of maintenance therapy in maintaining response; the ability of adjunct\n      pharmacotherapy to improve the response of patients who did not respond to CBT alone;\n      possible predictors of response and relapse; and possible mediators of response."
