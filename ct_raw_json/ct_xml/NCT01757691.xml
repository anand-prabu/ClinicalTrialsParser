  <study_design>Allocation: Randomized, Endpoint Classification: Safety/Efficacy Study, Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment, Masking: Double Blind (Subject, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor), Primary Purpose: Treatment</study_design>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning in patients treated with fingolimod 0.5mg/day, relative to patients treated with placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 18</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Primary endpoint is the difference between the OCT determined retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) of the affected eye at the week 18 post-baseline visit and the RNFLT of the fellow eye at baseline</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Low contrast visual acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 48</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The impact [on visual acuity], of immediate treatment with fingolimod 0.5mg/daily (48 weeks of continuous treatment) will be compared with that of delayed treatment with fingolimod 0.5mg/daily (18 weeks of placebo then 30 weeks of fingolimod), through testing with low contrast Sloan letter charts at 1.25, and 2.5% contrast levels</description>

    <measure>Vision based quality of life (QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 18, Week 48</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The impact [on vision based quality of life], of immediate treatment with fingolimod 0.5mg/daily (48 weeks of continuous treatment) will be compared with that of delayed treatment with fingolimod 0.5mg/daily (18 weeks of placebo then 30 weeks of fingolimod), through administration of the NEI-VFQ-25 Form</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Conversion to either 2005 or 2010 McDonald MS or to CDMS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 18, Week 48</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The impact [on conversion to either 2005 or 2010 McDonald MS or to CDMS], of immediate treatment with fingolimod 0.5mg/daily (48 weeks of continuous treatment) will be compared with that of delayed treatment with fingolimod 0.5mg/daily (18 weeks of placebo then 30 weeks of fingolimod), through MRI testing and MS relapse assessment</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety and tolerability of fingolimod in patients with ADON</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Safety and tolerability of fingolimod in patients with ADON will be assessed at each study visit through: physical exam, vital signs, blood sampling, urinalysis, pregnancy testing, ECG, detailed neurological exam. including EDSS. First dose monitoring will be conducted for all patients at baseline, Week 18 and re-starts after dosage interruptions, per the Protocol.</description>
