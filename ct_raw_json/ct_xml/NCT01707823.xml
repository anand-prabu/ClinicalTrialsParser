    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies low-dose acetylsalicylic acid in treating patients with
      stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer. Studying samples of urine and blood from patients
      with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes in biomarkers that
      occur during treatment with acetylsalicylic acid

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether ASA (acetylsalicylic acid) 325 mg inhibits prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)
      biosynthesis in patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Cyclooxygenase
      (COX) catalytic activity will be determined by measuring the metabolite of PGE2,
      11alpha-hydroxy-9,12-dioxo-2,3,4,5-tetranor-prostane-1,20 dioic acid (PGE-M) in urine pre-
      and post-ASA 325 mg as a surrogate of systemic PGE2 biosynthesis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether COX-2 protein has a slow turnover in adenocarcinoma of the lung. COX
      turnover will be determined by measuring urinary PGE-M levels daily for 7 days after
      discontinuing ASA 325 mg. COX-2 and Prostaglandin expression will also be measured in tumor
      samples of patients taken at the time of surgery.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive acetylsalicylic acid orally (PO) for 7 days and urine is collected for 7
      days post therapy.

    <description>PGE2 is a product of the COX-2 protein. Measurement of its urinary metabolite PGE-M would indicate the level of systemic biosynthesis of PGE2 and thus inhibition of COX-2 product formation.</description>

    <measure>Change in PGE-M levels from baseline and daily for 7 days after discontinuation of a 7-day course of 325 mg ASA per day</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>PGE-M is a metabolite of PGE2 in urine. PGE2 is a product of the COX-2 protein. Evidence suggests that COX-2 and PGE2 participate in tumor growth, apoptosis and metastasis, angiogenesis and abrogation of the tumor response. ASA inhibits COX-2. A slow rate of recovery in urinary levels of urinary PGE-M would indicate the rate of catalytically active COX-2 after discontinuation of ASA and may explain the efficacy of once daily low-dose ASA.</description>
