      The primary goal of this trial is to determine if individuals with acute ischemic stroke
      treated with a full dose of IV  recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) plus IV
      eptifibatide started within 3 hours of symptom onset are more likely to have a better
      outcome than individuals treated with standard IV rt-PA alone.

      The Combined Approach to Lysis Utilizing Eptifibatide and (rt-PA) in Acute Ischemic
      Stroke-Full Dose Regimen (CLEAR-FDR Stroke Trial) is a Phase II trial and part of the
      Specialized Program on Translational Research in Acute Stroke (SPOTRIAS). The overall goals
      of SPOTRIAS are to enhance delivery of acute stroke patient care and train acute stroke
      translational researchers.

      Stroke most often occurs when blood flow to the brain stops because it is blocked by a blood
      clot. When a blood clot blocks the blood supply to the brain, parts of the brain may not get
      enough blood and oxygen to survive. As a result, permanent brain damage can occur, which can
      affect a person's ability to walk, talk, and function independently. In order to reduce the
      risk of permanent damage, it is important to restore blood flow to the brain as quickly as
      possible.

      rt-PA, used alone, is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as
      treatment for patients with a stroke caused by blockage of an artery in the brain and when
      given within 3 hours of the onset of stroke symptoms. Eptifibatide is also already
      FDA-approved as a treatment for blood clots causing heart attack. The investigational aspect
      of this study is the use of eptifibatide for a stroke victim in combination with rt-PA.

      The CLEAR Stroke Trial demonstrated that the combination of low dose rt-PA plus eptifibatide
      can be safely given to acute ischemic stroke patients within 3 hours of symptom onset.

      The CLEAR-ER Stroke Trial demonstrated that the combination of medium dose rt-PA plus
      eptifibatide can be safely given to acute ischemic stroke patients within 3 hours of symptom
      onset.

      The CLEAR-FDR Stroke Trial is designed to provide data concerning the risks when combining
      eptifibatide with full dose intravenous rt-PA in 30 acute ischemic stroke patients within 3
      hours of symptom onset.

             due to focal brain ischemia.

          -  An NIH Stroke Scale score &gt;5 at the time the rt-PA is begun.

             had their 86th birthday).
