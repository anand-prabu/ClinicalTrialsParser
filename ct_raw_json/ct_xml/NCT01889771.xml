  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to understand whether distribution of two different supplies of nicotine
      patches through a telephone quitline has an effect on quit rates.  The two different
      supplies are four vs. eight (in two separate four-week mailings) weeks of nicotine patches.
      The hypothesis is that eight weeks will be slightly more efficacious but four weeks will be
      more cost-effective.
