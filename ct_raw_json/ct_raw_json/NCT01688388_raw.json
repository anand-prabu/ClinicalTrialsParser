PTV is defined as a 3D volume of 1-2 cm beyond the former macroscopic tumor edge (excluding skin, limit to anterior rib surface: 5 Gy).  The choice of electron energy as well as the cone applicator size has to account for minimum PTV requirements.  Tissue depth measurement will be documented by intraoperative sonography.",
