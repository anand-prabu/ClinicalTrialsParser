Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.\n      Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or\n      deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining paclitaxel, carboplatin, and\n      trastuzumab in treating women who have metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER2."

(Schedule A closed to accrual\n           effective 05/16/2003).\n\n        -  Compare the time to progression and median survival in patients treated with these\n           schedules.\n\n        -  Compare the toxicity of these treatment schedules in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior adjuvant\n      therapy (none vs less than 6 months vs at least 6 months), estrogen receptor (ER) status and\n      progesterone receptor (PR) status at initial diagnosis (ER positive/PR positive or unknown\n      vs ER positive/PR negative vs ER positive or unknown/PR negative), menopausal status (pre vs\n      post), and performance status (0 or 1 vs 2). Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment\n      schedules.\n\n        -  Schedule A: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over\n           30 minutes and then trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 90 minutes on day 1 of week 1.\n           Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease\n           progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive trastuzumab IV over 30\n           minutes every 3 weeks until disease progression. (Schedule A closed to accrual\n           effective 05/16/2003).\n\n        -  Schedule B: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed by carboplatin IV over\n           15 minutes on day 1 of weeks 1-3 and trastuzumab IV over 90 minutes immediately after\n           carboplatin on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the\n           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive\n           trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes every 3 weeks until disease progression.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36-92 patients (18-46 per treatment schedule) will be accrued\n      for this study within 7-18.5 months. (Schedule A closed to accrual effective 05/16/2003)."
