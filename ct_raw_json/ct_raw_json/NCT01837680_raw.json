After verbally counseling the patient, she will be recruited for the\n      study by the investigators.  An extensive explanation of the objectives of the study will be\n      presented to the patient, as well as written copies of the protocol and consent. After\n      informed consent is given, patients will be randomized to management with either insulin NPH\n      or detemir together with rapid acting insulin aspart (Novolog) with meals, as necessary.\n      The primary outcome will be level of glycemic control defined as overall mean blood glucose\n      in pregnancy.  This is a well established measure of overall glycemic control that has been\n      used in numerous publications in the obstetric literature on diabetes in pregnancy.\n      Participants will be followed until they deliver, with an expected range of 6-16 weeks\n      depending on when the patient was  enrolled in the study.
