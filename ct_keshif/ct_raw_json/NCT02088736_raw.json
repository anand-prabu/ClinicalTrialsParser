Thus,\n      by introducing a protocol including IO access for difficult IV cases, success rates for\n      vascular access will be higher and this might lead to higher survival rates.\n\n      This will be a study comparing 'IV+IO' and 'IV alone' protocols in patients with cardiac\n      arrest managed by Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) emergency ambulance service. The\n      trial will recruit 400 patients over 1 year. Each of the 30 SCDF ambulances will provide\n      both 'IV+IO' and 'IV alone' treatments in 2 consecutive phases of 6-months in order to allow\n      for all ambulance crew a chance to be trained on usage of IO. Currently, IO insertion is the\n      accepted standard of care in Singapore General Hospital, Department of Emergency Medicine."
