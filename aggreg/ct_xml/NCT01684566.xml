    <textblock>
      To compare the performance of standard of care (SOC) + episil® versus SOC alone on oral
      mucositis in patients receiving conditioning treatment for hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT). The primary variable will be the area under the curve (AUC) of oral
      mucositis scores defined by the WHO oral toxicity scale assessed daily by the investigator
      over the 28-day study period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Is at least 18 years of age.

          2. Has a confirmed diagnosis for which he/she is scheduled for hematopoietic stem cell
             transplantation (HSCT) of either type of transplant (autologous or allogeneic).

          3. Is due to undergo treatment with myeloablative conditioning (radiation-based or non
             radiation based) before HSCT.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Will undergo reduced intensity conditioning before HSCT.

          2. Has got known allergy to any ingredient in the study product or to peanuts,
             peppermint oil, or soya.

          3. Is pregnant or breast feeding.

          4. Has any other concurrent medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would increase the risk to the patient, compromise evaluation of the investigational
             device, or interfere with the conduct of the study.

          5. Has an unstable condition (eg, a psychiatric disorder, a recent history of substance
             abuse) or is otherwise thought to be unreliable or incapable of complying with the
             study requirements.

          6. Is undergoing treatment with parenteral opioids at enrolment.

          7. Uses treatments that promote mucosal healing (eg, palifermin).

          8. Uses electrolyte mouthwashes (eg, Caphosol®) or other topical oral treatments (eg,
             Tantum Verde® (benzydamine), Gelclair®, Fungicidin (nystatin)).
