  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Before Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical symptoms appear, there is a long period when
      changes in the brain occur. In this long asymptomatic period or preclinical phase, studies
      with populations at risk of developing AD have shown cognitive differences compared to
      control groups without such risk. There is a need for short, sensitive, easily administered,
      reproducible, non-expensive and independent of socio-demographic influences tests enabling
      the detection of pre-symptomatic variations in memory, when the memory decline is still
      within a normal range.

      Study hypothesis: When evaluated with high-demanding tests of memory and executive function,
      the cognitive performance of cognitive healthy people aged between 45 and 65, will vary
      significantly depending on clinical, socio-demographic and genetic features

      The purpose of Study 45-65 is to assess if:

        -  Endogenous factors (clinical history, risk factors, genetic factors APOE4, etc…),
           exogenous (socio-demographic, ambient and lifestyle variables) and cognitive reserve
           (including bilingualism) influence cognitive performance.

        -  New and/or updated tests translated and validated in Spanish and Catalan when needed,
           will provide accurate and sensitive measurements of the variability of cognitive
           performance in this target population, representative of the preclinical phase of
           Alzheimer's disease.
