  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine how well the combination of two medicines
      (solifenacin succinate and mirabegron) work compared to each medicine alone in the treatment
      of bladder problems, and how safe they are for long term use.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Main Inclusion at Screening (Visit 1):

          -  Subject has completed study 178-CL-101 or study 905-EC-012 (This inclusion criterion
             will no longer apply once the recruitment for study 178-CL-101 and study 905-EC-012
             has been completed. In that case the subject has to have symptoms of &quot;wet&quot; OAB
             (urinary frequency and urgency with incontinence) for at least 3 months);

          -  Subject is willing and able to complete the micturition diary and questionnaires
             correctly and able to measure his/her vital signs at home at stipulated time points,
             using the device provided by the study personnel, and to adequately record the
             readings;

        Main Inclusion at Randomization (Visit 2):

          -  Subject has a micturition frequency of on average ≥ 8 times per 24-hour period during
             the last 7 days of the micturition diary period (incontinence episode should not be
             counted as a micturition).

          -  Subject has experienced at least 3 incontinence episodes during the last 7 days of
             the micturition diary period.

          -  Subject has experienced on average at least 1  urgency episode (grade 3 or 4 on
             Patient Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale [PPIUS]) per 24-hour period during
             the 7-day micturition diary period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Main Exclusion at Screening (Visit 1):

          -  Subject has clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction at risk of urinary
             retention;

          -  Subject has significant PVR volume (&gt; 150 mL);

          -  Subject has significant stress incontinence or mixed stress/urgency incontinence
             where stress is the predominant factor;

          -  Subject has an indwelling catheter or practices intermittent self-catheterization;

          -  Subject has evidence of urinary tract infection (UTI), chronic inflammation such as
             interstitial cystitis, bladder stones, previous pelvic radiation therapy or previous
             or current malignant disease of the pelvic organs;

          -  Subject has had intravesical treatment in the past 12 months with e.g., botulinum
             toxin, resiniferatoxin, capsaicin;

        Main Exclusion at Randomization (Visit 2):

          -  Subject has evidence of a UTI (urine culture containing &gt; 100,000 cfu/ml). The
             subject can be rescreened after successful treatment of the UTI (confirmed by a
             laboratory result of negative urine culture).

          -  Subject had an average total daily urine volume &gt; 3000 mL as recorded in the
             micturition diary period.
