Subjects must be in good health, as determined by: a medical history, physical\n             examination, vital sign assessment, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical\n             laboratory evaluations (congenital non haemolytic hyperbilirubinaemia is NOT\n             acceptable)\n\n          4.

Subjects who have an abnormality in the 12-lead ECG that, in the opinion of the\n             investigator, increases the risk of participating in the study, confirmed by a repeat\n             ECG: such as QTcB interval >450 msec, 2nd or 3rd degree, Atrioventricular block,\n             complete left bundle branch block, complete right bundle branch block,\n             Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, defined as PR<110 msec,\n\n          4. Subjects who have received: any prescribed systemic or topical medication within 14\n             days of the first dose administration unless in the opinion of the Investigator the\n             medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise safety.  slow\n             release medicinal formulations considered to still be active within 14 days of the\n             first dose administration, unless in the opinion of the Investigator, the medication\n             will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise safety.\n\n          5. Subjects who are still participating in a clinical study (e.g. attending follow-up\n             visits) or who have participated in a clinical study involving administration of an\n             investigational drug (new chemical entity) in the past 3 months prior to the first\n             dosing occasion\n\n          6. Subjects with a significant history of drug allergy as determined by the\n             Investigator.\n\n          7.
