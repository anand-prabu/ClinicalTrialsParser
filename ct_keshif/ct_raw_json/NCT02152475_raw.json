The investigators hypothesis was that PDT with blue light and curcumin promotes\n      oral disinfection during 2 hours after treatment."

There are productions of reactive oxygen species (ROS)\n      and disrupts several of the cell's functions. This results in bacterial disinfection. In\n      order to perform the PDT on the oral cavity, a device based on blue LED with transparent\n      acrylic diffuser tip and cylindrical shape was developed."
