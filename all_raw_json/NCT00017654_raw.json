T-cell depleted\n      PBSC and bone marrow are infused on day 0. Patients receive cyclosporine IV over 12-24 hours\n      on days -1 to 120 followed by a taper and methylprednisolone IV on days 7-64 for\n      graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis.\n\n      Patients are followed every 30 days for 1 year, every 60 days for 2 years, and then as\n      needed for a minimum of 3 years."
