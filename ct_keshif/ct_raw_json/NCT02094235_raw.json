Diagnosis for AD should be made in accordance with the \"Guidelines\n             for Management of Atopic Dermatitis\" by the Japanese Dermatological Association.\n\n          2. Mild to moderate clinical symptoms appearing at baseline in areas where the\n             application of study drug is possible, except the skin of face/head and non-dermal\n             areas such as mucosa\n\n          3. Evaluable skin lesions appearing at baseline. \"Evaluable skin lesion\" means rash area\n             of 25 to 100 cm2 in the trunk or extremities, in which at least one of dermal\n             symptoms (erythema, exudate/eschar, excoriation or lichenification) must be moderate\n             in severity.\n\n          4. Continuous use of an appropriate moisturizer for at least 14 days before baseline\n\n          5. Females of child-bearing potential must be negative for pregnancy test at baseline\n             and are able to practice effective contraception during the study period including\n             the follow-up period\n\n          6. Virile males and females of childbearing potential, who and whose partners consented\n             to practice contraception throughout the study period after receiving an explanation\n             using the informed consent form and the separately-prepared assent form\n\n          7. Patients whose legally acceptable representatives (caregivers) are able to consent in\n             writing to participate in the study and who are able to adhere to the protocol\n             requirements. For patients aged 12 years or older at the time of informed consent,\n             written consent should be obtained from the patients as well as their legally\n             acceptable representatives (caregivers). Also for patients aged below 12 years,\n             written informed consent should be obtained whenever possible.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria\n\n          1. Use of biological products which may affect the pathological evaluation of atopic\n             dermatitis within 6 months before the start of study treatment\n\n          2. Concurrent or recent use of certain topical or systemic medications or phototherapy\n             without a sufficient washout period, except hydrocortisone butyrate preparations used\n             in areas which are unsuitable for application of study drug at the discretion of the\n             investigator\n\n          3. Currently has Kaposi's varicelliform eruption, scabies, molluscum contagiosum,\n             impetigo contagious, psoriasis, connective tissue disorder, or Netherton's syndrome,\n             etc, which may affect the pathological evaluation of atopic dermatitis\n\n          4. Any past history or present illness of serious allergy such as anaphylactic shock,\n             anaphylactic reaction and anaphylactoid reaction, or any past history or present\n             illness of drug allergic reaction or hypersensitivity\n\n          5.

Difficulty in venous access for blood collection\n\n          8. Any past history or present illness of malignant tumor, lymphoma, leukemia or\n             lymphoproliferative disorder, except non-melanoma skin carcinoma (e.g., squamous cell\n             carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma) which was completely removed and has not recurred\n             or metastasized for at least 5 years\n\n          9. Scheduled for surgery during the study\n\n         10. Concurrently enrolled in another clinical study or used any investigational drug or\n             device within 30 days before the date of informed consent\n\n         11.
