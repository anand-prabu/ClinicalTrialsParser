If these conditions are not met, the residential period may be prolonged for a\n      maximum of 3 days. If after this time one of the conditions is still not met, subjects are\n      requested to continue collecting their urine and/or feces at home for another 2 days. If\n      after these additional 2 days one of the conditions is still not met, the condition of\n      recovery of radioactivity is disregarded. Therefore only the total excretion condition is to\n      be met by collecting 24-hour intervals for urine and feces once a week for up to 2 weeks. If\n      the excretion condition is still not met after this time, no further samples are collected\n      and the subject is discharged from the study."
