  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether the Paula method is an effective treatment for UI and the
      correlating LUTD symptoms. We assume that the Paula method, a simple, non-aerobic exercise
      method that significantly decreased urinary incontinence in women with MIX in two randomized
      controlled trials, would also be effective in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients with UI. The
      secondary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness in terms of MS general physical functioning,
      quality of life and sexual function and to detect adherence and continuity six months post
      intervention.

      The patient will be examined by the neurologist at the MS clinic, at the Hadassah University
      Medical Center. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will receive an explanation, and
      will sign informed consent. She will be asked to complete the baseline questionnaires. Than
      the patient will be assigned to an exercise group. After 12 weeks the patient will be asked
      to complete post intervention questionnaire. Apart from the weekly lesson, women will be
      asked to exercise at home for 15 minutes a day.  After six months she will be invited again
      for a neurological examination and filling an additional questionnaire.

    <description>the Paula method, a circular muscle exercise, invented in Israel by Paula Garbourg.The method is based on the principle that all sphincters in the body are synchronized, with the movement of one affecting the other.One can rehabilitate damaged muscles by contracting and relaxing specific &quot;circular&quot; muscles in other parts of the body.</description>

    <description>The Paula method will be taught to the participants by several registered Paula instructors. Subjects allocated to this intervention will receive one 45-minute group session per week for 12 weeks (with up to 30 minutes for personal questions regarding the exercises). This length of time is crucial because it has been demonstrated that it take three months for women to adequately learn the exercises in order for them to practice independently at home.  Participants will be encouraged to practice daily for 15 minutes and report their at- home training.</description>
