  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Athletes using asthma medications called β2-agonists win a disproportionately high number of
      medals at Olympic Games. Due to a large variety in the genes that affect how individuals
      respond to β2-agonists, the investigators will look at variations in the genetic response to
      these medications by dividing athletes into high-responders and low-responders. The
      investigators will then compare athletic performance after the inhalation of β2-agonists to
      placebo. Furthermore, the investigators will analyze the effect of β2-agonists on breathing
      mechanics. Due to differences in their anatomy females may decrease the energy needed for
      breathing during high-intensity exercise to a greater extent compared to male athletes after
      the inhalation of β2-agonists.
