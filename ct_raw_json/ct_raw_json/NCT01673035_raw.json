Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and behavioral stress management\n      (BSM) have been showed to be effective in the treatment of severe health anxiety. The\n      mechanisms of the treatments are however poorly understood. In addition, effective\n      psychological treatments are accessible to only a few. One prior RCT has shown that\n      internet-based CBT could be effective in comparison to waiting list controls. More studies\n      on internet-based CBT is essential to establish evidence. In addition, few studies with\n      sufficient power have investigated the effect of CBT in comparison to other active\n      treatments.\n\n      Aim of the study The aim of the present RCT is to compare internet-based CBT (n=110) to\n      behavioral stress management (n=110) for adult participants with severe health anxiety. BSM\n      is considered a comparison treatment for two reasons: it has been shown to be effective and\n      it lacks exposure and response prevention, which is suggested to be an important mechanism\n      in CBT.\n\n      Participants in both treatments are expected to be significantly improved on measures of\n      health anxiety. Participants receiving CBT are expected to be significantly more improved\n      compared to participants receiving BSM."
