  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of aleglitazar monotherapy in patients with Type 2
      diabetes mellitus who are drug-naïve to anti-hyperglycemic therapy. Patients will be
      randomized to receive either aleglitazar 150 mcg orally daily or placebo for 26 weeks.
