Combining radiation\n      therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy and radiation\n      therapy in treating patients who have locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer."

Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Within 2 weeks of completing induction chemotherapy, patients receive gemcitabine IV over\n      30-60 minutes on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, 25, 29, and 32. Patients undergo concurrent\n      radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks.\n\n      Patients are followed every 8 weeks for 6 months and then every 3 months for 1.5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 60-120 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2\n      years."
