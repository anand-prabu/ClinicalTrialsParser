            "textblock": "Introduction:\n\n      Overall, 10 - 15% of couples seek specialist help once in their lives when a spontaneous\n      pregnancy does not occur. These couples are defined subfertile when there is at least one\n      year of unprotected intercourse without conceiving. Subfertility can have different causes\n      which can be diagnosed with a basic fertility work-up. Unfortunately, the subfertility in\n      25% of the couples still remains unexplained.\n\n      Hypothesis:\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that cardio-metabolic and hemodynamic abnormalities reducing\n      cardiovascular reserves relate to circulatory redistribution at the expense of uterine\n      perfusion and with it women's fertility. This could especially be important in the subgroups\n      with an unexplained subfertility and a decreased ovarian reserve. Interventions to improve\n      these abnormalities could lead to better results in fertility treatment, better obstetric\n      outcome and reduced lifelong health risks.\n\n      Objective:\n\n      The investigators want to examine specific cardio-metabolic and cardiovascular parameters in\n       women of  subfertile couples. The investigators want to evaluate the prevalence of\n      metabolic syndrome in all women who are assessed for  subfertility compared to healthy\n      parous women. Furthermore in the women with an unexplained subfertility or with (signs of) a\n      decreased ovarian reserve the cardiovascular profile will be studied  consisting of the\n      uterine artery pulsatility index (PI) as measure of uterine perfusion, the plasma volume as\n      measure of venous reserve capacity, the intima media thickness of the carotid arteries as\n      proxy of chronic strain and the endothelial function, measured by flow mediated dilatation\n      (FMD) of the brachial artery.\n\n      Study design:\n\n      Cross-sectional\n\n      Study population:\n\n      The study group consists of subfertile women between 18 and 41 years who visit the fertility\n      clinic in the Maastricht University Medical Centre with a primary or secondary subfertility.\n      Women with an unexplained subfertility or with (signs of) a decreased ovarian reserve are\n      evaluated for their cardiovascular profile. The control group consists of women with a\n      history of an uneventful spontaneous pregnancy.\n\n      Main study parameters:\n\n        1.

            "textblock": "Introduction:\n\n      Overall, 10 - 15% of couples seek specialist help once in their lives when a spontaneous\n      pregnancy does not occur. These couples are defined subfertile when there is at least one\n      year of unprotected intercourse without conceiving. Subfertility can have different causes.\n      A basic fertility work-up focuses on the reproductive system of the couple. After this basic\n      fertility work-up the subfertility remains unexplained in 16-24% of the couples. The\n      investigators hypothesize that cardio-metabolic and hemodynamic abnormalities reducing\n      cardiovascular reserves relate to circulatory redistribution at the expense of uterine\n      perfusion and with it women's fertility. This could especially be important in the subgroups\n      with an unexplained subfertility and a decreased ovarian reserve. For all possible assessed\n      abnormalities, proven effective treatments are available such as primarily life style\n      corrective actions. Furthermore these interventions could lead to better results in\n      fertility treatment, better obstetric outcome and reduced lifelong health risks.\n\n      Objective:\n\n      The overall objective of this study is to examine specific cardio-metabolic and\n      cardiovascular parameters in  women of  subfertile couples. This study protocol is divided\n      into 3 studies to evaluate several cardio-metabolic/cardiovascular parameters in different\n      subgroups of female subfertility compared to fertile women.\n\n        -  Study 1 \"The metabolic syndrome and female subfertility\": The prevalence of metabolic\n           syndrome in all women who are assessed for  subfertility compared to fertile women.\n\n        -  Study 2 \"The cardiovascular profile in female subfertility\": The cardiovascular profile\n           of women with female subfertility classified as unexplained subfertility or \"expected\"\n           decreased ovarian reserve compared to fertile women. For this study 4 measurements will\n           be performed: the uterine artery pulsatility index (PI) as measure of uterine\n           perfusion, the plasma volume as measure of venous reserve capacity, the intima media\n           thickness of the carotid arteries as proxy of chronic strain and the endothelial\n           function, measured by flow mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery.\n\n        -  Study 3 \"The cardiovascular profile of women with a poor ovarian response\": The\n           cardiovascular profile of women who had an In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) population with\n           a \"proven\" decreased ovarian reserve\n\n      With these different studies, the investigators hope to identify possible\n      cardio-metabolic/cardiovascular causes for female subfertility. This can lead to new\n      treatment options for female subfertility, enhancing reproductive and obstetric outcome, and\n      a risk assessment for later in life.\n\n      Study design:\n\n      We want to perform cross-sectional studies.\n\n      Study population:\n\n      Study 1:\n\n        -  Study group: subfertile women between 18 and 41 years who visit the fertility clinic in\n           the Maastricht University Medical Centre with a primary or secondary subfertility,\n           independent of the cause of their subfertility\n\n        -  Control group: women with a history of an uneventful spontaneous pregnancy\n\n      Study 2: Women who finished the basic fertility work up and are diagnosed with:\n\n        -  an unexplained subfertility: study group 1\n\n        -  an \"expected\" decreased ovarian reserve: study group 2 Control group: women with a\n           history of an uneventful spontaneous pregnancy\n\n      Study 3: Women who received an IVF treatment in the period of 2010 - 2012 and:\n\n        -  study group: had a \"proven\" decreased ovarian response, defined as retrieving 3 oocytes\n           or less at an ovum pick-up, despite maximal ovarian stimulation\n\n        -  control group: received and IVF/Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) treatment\n           because of a severe male subfertility\n\n      Main study parameters:\n\n      Study 1: Prevalence of metabolic syndrome in subfertile women  compared to fertile controls.\n\n      Study 2: The cardiovascular profile, in women with an unexplained subfertility or an\n      \"expected\" decreased ovarian reserve, consisting of:\n\n        1.
