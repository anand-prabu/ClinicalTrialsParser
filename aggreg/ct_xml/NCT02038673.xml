    <textblock>
      This study consists of two parts.  In the dose-escalation part, ASP5878 is administered to
      patients with solid tumors in an increasing dose manner, and the tolerability, safety,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and efficacy of ASP5878 are evaluated in these
      patients. In the expansion part, selected dose of ASP5878 is administered to patients with
      limited types of carcinoma and safety, PK, PD and efficacy of ASP5878 are evaluated.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumor.

          -  Patient must meet at least one of the following criteria in the judgment of the
             investigator or sub-investigator:

               -  Disease progression despite standard therapies

               -  Progressive disease without any standard therapies established

               -  Standard therapies are considered intolerable

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1.

          -  Predicted life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks in the judgment of the investigator or
             sub-investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with ≥ Grade 2 (CTCAE v 4.0-JCOG) persistent symptoms and objective findings
             due to the toxicity attributable to prior treatment with antitumor effect (except
             alopecia).

          -  Patient who received a prior treatment intended for antitumor effect (medication,
             surgery, radiotherapy, etc.) within 4 weeks prior to the planned first day of study
             drug dosing (or patient who received mitomycin C or Nitrosourea within 6 weeks prior
             to the planned first day of study drug dosing).

          -  A major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to the planned first day of study
             drug dosing or a surgical procedure is planned during the course of the study.

          -  Patient who were treated with other investigational drug or medical device within 4
             weeks prior to the planned first day of study drug dosing.

          -  Patient who has a history of organ transplantation.

          -  Patient with a brain metastasis with symptoms or requiring treatment.
