Determine the maximum tolerated dose of capecitabine when administered in\n      combination with oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic or recurrent solid tumors. II.\n      Determine the toxicities of this treatment regimen in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of capecitabine. Patients receive oxaliplatin IV\n      over 2 hours on day 1 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats\n      every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6\n      patients receive escalating doses of capecitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is\n      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients\n      experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for disease progression and\n      survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-15 patients will be accrued for this study."
