  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study is to investigate CSF and blood biomarkers among the subjects with
      mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as normal controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent cause of dementia. A biomarker is a variable that
      are measured in vivo and indicate specific features of disease related molecular mechanisms
      and pathologic changes, including amyloid processing and aggregation, tau
      hyperphosphorylation, accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic dysfunction,
      neurodegeneration, and loss of brain tissue.

      We examine serum oligomeric beta-amyloid 42 and CSF monomeric beta-amyloid 42, total tau and
      phosphorylated tau, as well as PiB-PET, FDG-PET and brain MRI in 90 participants (30 normal
      controls, 30 patients with mild cognitive impairment, 30 patients with Alzheimer's disease).
