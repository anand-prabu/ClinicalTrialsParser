Patients registered on this\n             trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies there\n             must be reasonable geographical limits (for example: 1 \u00bd hour's driving distance)\n             placed on patients being considered for this trial.

A previous history of drug induced significant QTc prolongation (defined as a\n                  QTc interval equal to or greater than 500msec) or causing significant ECG\n                  abnormalities\n\n               5.
