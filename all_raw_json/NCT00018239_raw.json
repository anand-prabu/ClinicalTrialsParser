The hypothesis is that regular exercise, whether aerobic or\n      resistive, will improve whole body insulin action, but the nature and magnitude of changes\n      in skeletal muscle will differ between the two types of exercise."

They will be instructed in a weight maintenance diet prior to\n      beginning the exercise program, and maintain this diet throughout the study. Metabolic\n      testing will be performed at baseline and after 6 months of exercise training. Testing will\n      include measurement of body composition (anthropometry, dual-energy Xray absorptiometry,\n      computed tomograph scan), maximal oxygen consumption, and muscle strength, glucose tolerance\n      (oral glucose tolerance test), insulin sensitivity (euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp), and\n      muscle biopsies to examine skeletal muscle metabolic characteristics (fiber type\n      distribution, capillary density, oxidative and glycolytic enzyme activities, and levels of\n      key proteins important in insulin signaling and glucose transport). Data will be analyzed\n      using analysis of variance to determine differences between the two exercise groups, and\n      multiple regression analysis to determine the primary adaptations that are associated with\n      the improvements in whole body insulin action."
