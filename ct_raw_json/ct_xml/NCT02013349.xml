             site, prior to any clinical study related procedure

          -  Patient must have evidence of myocardial ischemia (e.g., stable or unstable angina,
             silent ischemia, positive functional study or electrocardiogram (ECG) changes
             consistent with ischemia)

          -  Patient must be an acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)
             surgery

             years following the index procedure

        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria - Target Lesion/Vessel Target lesion must be located in a
        native coronary artery with a nominal vessel diameter of between 2.75 and 3.5 mm assessed
        by visual estimation or QCA

          -  Target lesion must measure ≤ 24 mm in length

          -  Target lesion must be in a major artery or branch with a visually estimated stenosis
             of ≥ 50% and &lt; 90% with a TIMI flow of ≥ 1

          -  Percutaneous intervention of lesions in the target vessel if:

          -  Not part of a clinical investigation

          -  ≥ 6 months prior to the study index procedure

          -  ≥ 9 months after the study index procedure (planned)

          -  Previous intervention was distal to and &gt; 10 mm from the target lesion

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has a known diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) within 72 hours
             preceding the index procedure and CK and CK-MB have not returned within normal limits
             at the time of procedure

          -  Patient is currently experiencing clinical symptoms consistent with AMI

          -  Patient requires the use of any rotablator intervention during the index procedure

          -  Patient has current unstable arrhythmias

          -  Patient has a known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 30%

          -  Patient has received a heart transplant or any other organ transplant or is on a
             waiting list for any organ transplant

          -  Patient is receiving or scheduled to receive chemotherapy for malignancy within 30
             days prior to or after the procedure

          -  Patient is receiving immunosuppression therapy and has known immunosuppressive or
             autoimmune disease (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosus)

          -  Patient is receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy (e.g., heparin, Coumadin) that
             cannot be stopped and restarted according to local hospital standard procedures

          -  Patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, both heparin and
             bivalirudin, both clopidogrel and ticlopidine, Novolimus, PLLA polymers or contrast
             sensitivity that cannot be adequately pre-medicated

          -  Elective surgery is planned within the first 6 months after the procedure that will
             require discontinuing either aspirin or clopidogrel

          -  Patient has a platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt; 700,000 cells/mm3, a WBC of &lt;
             3,000 cells/mm3, or documented or suspected liver disease

          -  Patient has known renal insufficiency (e.g., serum creatinine level of more than 2.5
             mg/dL, or patient on dialysis)

          -  Patient has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood
             transfusions

          -  Patient has had a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic neurological
             attack (TIA) within the past six months

          -  Patient has had a significant GI or urinary bleed within the past six months

          -  Patient has other medical illness (e.g., cancer or congestive heart failure) or known
             history of substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin etc.) that may cause
             non-compliance with the clinical study plan, confound the data interpretation or is
             associated with a limited life expectancy (i.e., less than one year)

          -  Patient is already participating in another clinical study

          -  Women of childbearing potential who have not undergone surgical sterilization or are
             not post-menopausal (defined as amenorrheic for at least one year) as well as women
