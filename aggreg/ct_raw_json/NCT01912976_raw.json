            "textblock": "Bowen's disease (BD) is a form of intraepidermal (in situ) squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)\n      originally described in 1912.1 It presents as a gradually enlarging, well-demarcated\n      erythematous plaque with an irregular border and surface crusting or scaling.2 BD is the\n      frequent precancerous skin lesion in Caucasians.3 In the UK, BD occurrence is most common\n      among patients in their 70s and in women (70-85%), and the majority (60-85%) of cases\n      involve lesions of the lower leg.4,5 BD is estimated to evolve into invasive SCC in 3-5% of\n      cases; therefore, treatment is recommended.6 Current guidelines suggest that the available\n      therapeutic options (including cryotherapy, curettage, excision, topical 5-fluorouracil, and\n      topical imiquimod) are broadly similar in efficacy, with 12-month recurrence rates of\n      approximately 5-10%.7 However, cryotherapy can be painful, making treatment of multiple\n      lesions difficult, and healing can be slow.8 Additionally, topical treatment with\n      5-fluorouracil or imiquimod is relatively slow and typically causes local irritation.9,10\n      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with methyl aminolaevulinate (MAL) is an attractive treatment\n      option for BD with large or multiple patches, and poor healing sites can be treated with\n      good efficacy, low recurrence rates, and good cosmetic outcomes.7 PDT requires light\n      activation of a photosensitizer in the presence of oxygen, which generates reactive oxygen\n      species leading to selective and highly localized destruction of abnormal cells.11,12 MAL is\n      an efficient photosensitizer, with deep lesion penetration resulting from enhanced\n      lipophilicity. Compared to 5-aminolevulinic acid, MAL also has a greater specificity for\n      neoplastic cells.13-15 Because histologic features of BD include full-thickness keratinocyte\n      atypia with disordered maturation, it is typically treated twice within an interval of 1\n      week.16,17 So, complementary techniques are needed to enhance the penetration and\n      accumulation of MAL in order to improve PDT efficacy and decrease treatment duration.\n\n      Er:YAG ablative fractional laser therapy (AFL) can ablate the stratum corneum in a precisely\n      tuned manner without producing significant thermal injury. This approach creates microscopic\n      vertical holes in the ablated tissue, surrounded by thin layers of coagulated tissue.18,19\n      Since the Er:YAG AFL resurfaces 5-20% of the skin at one time and does not injure the entire\n      thickness of the epidermis, healing times are minimized.18,19 Recent studies have\n      demonstrated that AFL facilitates delivery and uptake of topical MAL deep into the skin,\n      enhancing porphyrin synthesis and photodynamic activation.20,21 The objectives of this study\n      were to compare the efficacy, recurrence rate, cosmetic outcomes, and safety of MAL-PDT with\n      and without the use of Er:YAG AFL in Asian BD patients with multiple lower extremity\n      lesions."
