Participants will also\n      receive the routine China Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) vaccines (oral poliovirus\n      vaccine [OPV] and diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine [DTaP]) either\n      staggered or concomitantly with V260 or placebo. All participants will be followed for\n      efficacy and safety. Immune responses to OPV and DTaP will be evaluated in a subset of\n      participants.
