MiR-26 is a predictive marker for the efficiency of\n      postoperative interferon-alpha treatment in patients with HCC. Our study is to identify the\n      Efficiency of Postoperative IFN-Alpha Treatment in low miR-26 expression Patients With HCC.\n\n      METHODS: A quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assays of miR-26 are\n      performed on specimens which are collected from patients who underwent a curative resection\n      of HCC. These patients with low miR-26 expression will return to the hospital 25\u00b15 days\n      after the resection following the baseline examination. If all requirements are satisfied,\n      these patients will be randomly divided into the treatment group who received postoperative\n      IFN-alpha therapy or the comparison group who not received any treatment. Besides the\n      disease-free survival rate, the overall survival rate, time to recurrence and the side\n      effect will be observed.\n\n      Anticipated RESULTS: IFN alpha treatment improved the disease-free survival and the overall\n      survival in low miR-26 expression patients with HCC after curative resection, probably by\n      postponing recurrence."
