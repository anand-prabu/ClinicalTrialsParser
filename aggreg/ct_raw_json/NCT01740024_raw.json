The results of the prick-test will be valid\n             if they were obtained in the year prior to inclusion of the subject in the study.\n\n          -  A positive specific IgE test (> 0.70 KU/l) for cat epithelium. The results of the IgE\n             test will be valid if they were obtained in the year prior to inclusion of the\n             subject in the study.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        A subject will NOT be eligible for inclusion in the study if any of the following criteria\n        are met:\n\n          -  Immunotherapy in the last 5 years involving allergens known to be able to interfere\n             with the test allergen (e.g., cat extract).\n\n          -  Use of drugs that can interfere with the skin response before and during the study\n             (e.g., antihistamines), within the intervals established in section 9.1 and appendix\n             1.\n\n          -  Treatment with any of the following medicines: tricyclic or tetracyclic\n             antidepressants or MAOIs (Monoamine oxidase inhibitors), beta-blockers or chronic use\n             of oral corticosteroids or use of corticosteroids via either the oral or the\n             parenteral route in repeated and intermittent dosing regimens (> 10 mg/day of\n             prednisone or equivalent).\n\n          -  Pregnant or nursing women and women with a positive pregnancy test in visit 2.\n\n          -  Dermographism affecting the skin of the test site, in either of the two visits to the\n             study centre.\n\n          -  Atopic dermatitis affecting the skin of the test site, in either of the two visits to\n             the study centre.\n\n          -  Urticaria affecting the skin of the test site, in either of the two visits to the\n             study centre.\n\n          -  Clinically relevant immune system diseases (both autoimmune disorders and immune\n             deficiencies). (Hashimoto's thyroiditis with hypothyroidism well controlled through\n             thyroid hormone therapy does not necessarily represent a contraindication. Graves'\n             disease (hyperthyroidism) would be an exclusion criterion due to the potential risk\n             in the event adrenaline must be used.)\n\n          -  Serious uncontrolled diseases that may increase the safety risk of the subjects\n             participating in the study, including but not limited to the following: heart\n             failure, serious or uncontrolled respiratory diseases, endocrine disorders,\n             clinically relevant liver or kidney diseases, or haematological disorders.\n\n          -  Patents with diseases or conditions that limit adrenaline use (coronary disease,\n             severe arterial hypertension, etc.).\n\n          -  Serious psychiatric, psychological or neurological problems.\n\n          -  Medication, alcohol or illegal drug abuse in the last year.\n\n          -  Participation in any other clinical trial during the 30 days (or 5 times the\n             biological half-life of the investigational product - whichever is longest) prior to\n             inclusion of the subject in this study."
