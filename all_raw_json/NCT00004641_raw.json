Patients are stratified by\n      participating institution, cirrhosis etiology, and hepatic venous pressure gradient.\n\n      The dose of oral timolol is titrated over 28 days.  Patients are then randomly assigned to\n      daily timolol at the titrated dose or a placebo if successful titration is achieved by day\n      28, and the final titration dose is maintained for at least 10 days.  Timolol is\n      discontinued prior to randomization.\n\n      Criteria for removal from study include esophageal or gastric varices, significant bleeding\n      or hemorrhage, timolol-induced hepatic encephalopathy, and liver transplantation.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months."
