  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and the value
      of providing care to individuals with Parkinson disease directly into their homes. The
      specific aims are:

        1. To demonstrate the feasibility of conducting remote evaluations of patients with
           Parkinson disease nationally;

        2. To measure the impact of remote care on each patient's ability to improve his or her
           quality of life (QoL) and better manage his or her Parkinson disease; and

        3. To assess the long-term acceptability to patients in receiving ongoing care remotely
           via telemedicine.
