            "textblock": "It was estimated that 2.6 million people suffer from cancer and 1.8 million die of cancer in\n      China yearly according to the Annual Report of Cancer Registration in China 2012. So far,\n      the main treatment modalities for tumors have been surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\n      However, tumor relapse is still a risk for those patients underwent the conventional\n      therapy. With the development of oncology and immunology in recent years, immunotherapy\n      represents a novel path to obtain a durable and long-lasting response in cancer patients.\n      Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells are a heterogeneous subset of ex-vivo expanded T\n      lymphocytes which present a mixed T-NK phenotype and are endowed with a MHC-unrestricted\n      antitumor activity. CIK cells are expanded conventionally from peripheral blood mononuclear\n      cells by addition of a variety of cytokines in vitro culture.\n\n      Autologous CIK cells infusion therapy for patients with malignancies is reported world\n      widely. However, there are several drawbacks for autologous CIK limiting its clinical\n      application. For example, limited cell numbers, decreased cell activities, and unavailable\n      in time etc. Cord blood, as a novel source of non-senescent lymphocytes for tumor\n      immunotherapy, has been focused on recently. Accumulating preclinical studies have shown\n      that cord blood-derived CIK cells are potent anti-tumor effectors using in adoptive cancer\n      immunotherapy. However it is unclear whether administration of cord blood-derived CIK cells\n      is safe in patients with malignancies. Our previous studies demonstrated that clinical scale\n      expansion of CIK from cord blood is feasible. The cord blood-derived CIK cells exhibit\n      antitumor effect in vitro and in vivo (tumor bearing nude mice) against a variety of tumor\n      cells including ZR751, MCF7, HepG2, SMMC-7721, Hela, A375, DU145, H1299 and A549.\n      Furthermore, intravenous infusion of a single dose of 3X10^8 cord blood-derived CIK cells in\n      mice is safe.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of cord blood-derived\n      CIK cells in patients with solid tumor following radical resection."
