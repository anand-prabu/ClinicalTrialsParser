            "textblock": "Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in reducing the level of anger, hostility\n      and depression present in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients.In Taiwan, Weng et al. also\n      confirmed the eight-week group CBT program not only diminished the emotion disturbances\n      including anger, hostility and depression of CAD, but also significantly prolonged the\n      coagulation time, thus reducing the rate of thrombosis formation. Even though the\n      therapeutic effect of the CBT program was valid, this program is still not accessible for\n      some patients in need because they are not aware of it, or they are restricted by time and\n      transportation. Internet-based therapeutic intervention can overcome the obstacles to access\n      this program at any time and in any place. Presently, structured CBT intervention is\n      provided through the Internet and used widely by patients with physical or psychological\n      problems such as smoking, obesity, or headaches, but not by CAD patients. Therefore, the\n      purpose of this research is to evaluate the effects to reduce the psychological risk factors\n      of a web-based group CBT program in CAD patients. Follow-up assessments will be performed\n      after 3 and 6-month durations. The investigators expect that, after an eight-week group\n      intervention, there will be significant decrease of the psychological risk factors.\n      Moreover, the therapeutic effects can be maintained during the three- and six-month\n      follow-up."
