        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects between 18 and 75 years of age

          -  Undergoing elective meningioma surgery and having a tumor cavity

          -  Presence of an appropriate Target Bleeding Site (TBS) as identified intra-operatively
             by the surgeon  requiring an adjunct to achieve hemostasis

          -  Able  and willing to comply with procedures required by protocol

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to any study related procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects undergoing emergency surgery

          -  Subjects with any intra-operative findings that may preclude conducting of the study
             procedures

          -  Intended use of Fibrin Sealants (including autologous Fibrin Sealants) other than
             Bioseal on the TBS

          -  Subjects with known intolerance to blood products or to one of the components of the
             study product or unwilling to receive blood products

          -  Subjects who have a history of traumatic head injury

          -  Female subjects who are known breastfeeding or pregnant or intend to become pregnant
             during the clinical study period

          -  The subject, in the opinion of the investigator, would not be suitable for
             participation in the study

          -  Subjects who participated in another trial within 30 days prior to the planned start
             of treatment.
