To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) rates of patients with desmoid tumors\n      (DT)/deep fibromatosis (DF) who receive either sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate) or placebo\n      using a double-blinded randomized phase III study.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To assess toxicity. II. To assess time to surgical intervention. III. To assess tumor\n      response rates and survival.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To evaluate changes in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Tesla (T)2 to predict (or\n      correlate) with a biological effect such as tumor growth (by Response Evaluation Criteria in\n      Solid Tumors [RECIST] version [v]1.1), and pain palliation. (Correlative companion study)\n      II. The mechanism of action of sorafenib in DT/DF remains unknown. In patients consenting to\n      undergo the paired tumor biopsies (A091105-ST1), treatment induced changes will be\n      quantified by histology, gene expression profiling, proteomic changes and selected\n      interrogation of key pathways by Western blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain\n      reaction (RT-PCR). (Correlative companion study) III. To collect archival tissue, baseline\n      (tumor, blood) and day 8 (tumor, blood) specimens for basic science research (A091105-ST1).\n      (Correlative companion study) IV. To assess patient-reported adverse events and quality of\n      life (QOL) as measured by the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology\n      Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) and the single-item overall Linear Analogue\n      Self-Assessment (LASA) (A091105-HO1). (Correlative companion study) V. To assess pain\n      palliation measured by the \"worst pain\" item of the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form\n      (A091105-HO1). (Correlative companion study)\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I: Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28.\n\n      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD on days 1-28. Patients may crossover to Arm I upon\n      disease progression.\n\n      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up annually for up to 3 years."
