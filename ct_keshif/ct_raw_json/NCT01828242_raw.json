Decreased intakes of vegetables and fruits replaced\n      by pre processed food, added sugar and those of animal origin lead towards rapid increase of\n      adult-onset-diabetes.\n\n      In spite of the knowledge of the benefit of consuming vegetable and fruits, and people are\n      well informed, they still need to be committed to perform a behavior and implement these\n      intention. Behavioral approach methods have demonstrated successful adherence in health\n      education with life style changes.\n\n      Objective: To identify the impact of The Empowerment Model to enhance vegetable intake in\n      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus adults in achieving glycemic control."
