  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to document the extent to which intermittent hypoxia
      persists beyond the age of discontinuing clinical  methylxanthine, and will assess the
      effect of caffeine treatment on the number of intermittent hypoxia episodes and the total
      number of seconds with a hemoglobin oxygen saturation (HbO2 SAT) below 90%.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infants with prior clinical treatment with caffeine in the neonatal intensive care unit
      (NICU) will be enrolled and continuous physiologic data recording of oxygen hemoglobin
      saturation (HbO2 SAT) and heart rate will begin as early as 33 weeks postmenstrual age
      (PMA).  Randomization will occur when enrolled infants reach a corrected gestational age of
      at least 34 weeks PMA AND clinical caffeine has been discontinued for at least 5 days.
      Infants will be randomized to receive caffeine or to continue with usual care. The group
      randomized to start caffeine will receive an oral loading dose of caffeine citrate of 20
      mg/kg on Day #1, followed by a single daily oral maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg starting on Day
      #2 and continued daily thereafter until 40 weeks PMA. The continuous oximeter recordings
      will be stopped at the same time.  The number of intermittent hypoxia events/hour per week
      and the frequency/duration of bradycardia will be compared between the caffeine group and
      the usual care (no-caffeine) group for each week of physiologic data recordings.
