The starting\n      dose was 39 mg/M2 (based on 1/10 LD10 observed in mice and rats).\n\n      A modified accelerated dosing protocol of Simon, Freidlin, et al is in process to escalate\n      dosage which will reduce the number of patients required and minimize ineffective doses. The\n      protocol will result in one patient cohorts at 40% dosage escalations. When the 1st instance\n      of a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) [grade - 3 or 4 toxicity] is observed, or the 2nd instance\n      of a 1st course     grade 2 toxicity of any type is observed, the cohort for that current\n      dose level will be expanded to 3-6 patients and escalation will proceed at 33% increments.\n\n      During the entirety of the study, intra-patient escalation will be allowed.  This will occur\n      if the patient experiences are < grade 2 toxicity at the existing dose, if no > grade 2\n      toxicity was identified at the existing dose and no DLTs were noted at the higher dose level\n      (if any patients had been escalated to that dose).\n\n      Continuation of therapy - Patients who experience stabilization, partial or complete\n      remission while being treated will continue to receive the drug as per the last dose prior\n      to identifying positive results at an every 3 weeks interval.\n\n      Discontinuation of therapy - progressive disease and/or toxicities."
