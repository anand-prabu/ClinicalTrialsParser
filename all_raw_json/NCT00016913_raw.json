Androgens can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells.\n      Drugs such as goserelin or leuprolide may stop the adrenal glands from producing androgens.\n      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy,\n      hormone therapy, and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying giving chemotherapy together with hormone therapy\n      and radiation therapy in treating patients with locally advanced prostate cancer."

Treatment repeats every 4\n      weeks for 4 courses.\n\n      Patients also receive gonadotropin-releasing hormonal therapy comprising either goserelin\n      subcutaneously or leuprolide intramuscularly once monthly. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks\n      for 6 courses.\n\n      After the completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo radiotherapy once daily on weeks\n      17-24.\n\n      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 4 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5 years."
