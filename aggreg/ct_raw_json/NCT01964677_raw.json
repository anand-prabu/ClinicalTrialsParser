The main palliative mechanism of the\n      method is due to local bone denervation, caused by the heat denaturation of the periosteum\n      layer in the treated area. The importance of this therapy is that it offers a non-invasive,\n      focal therapy, avoiding side-effects to surrounding normal tissue that occur with radiation\n      therapy or the need for needle insertion as with radio-frequency(RF)ablation.\n\n      The study hypothesis is that MR-HIFU will be effective in treating the pain associated with\n      bone metastases"
