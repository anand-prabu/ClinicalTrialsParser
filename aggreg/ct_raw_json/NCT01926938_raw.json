The function of the endothelium has played a key role in the\n      understanding of vascular complications in people with diabetes. Endothelial function and\n      vascular reactivity are impaired not only in white adults with type 2 diabetes but also in\n      those at risk for the disease by virtue of having impaired glucose tolerance or parental\n      history of type 2 diabetes. Whether this finding is applicable to hispanics is not known.\n      The investigators plan to assess the endothelial function and vascular reactivity in young\n      Hispanic adults at risk of developing type 2 diabetes by virtue of being obese and belonging\n      to a minority population."
