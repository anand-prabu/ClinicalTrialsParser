This study will also\n      examine the ability of antiretroviral therapy combined with IL-2 to boost the immune system.\n\n      IL-2, given through injection under the skin, in combination with anti-HIV therapy can\n      increase CD4 cell counts. This study examines 3 doses of IL-2 in order to determine the\n      safest and most effective dose to use."

To develop appropriate clinical experience with this combination, this Phase II\n      trial will allow administration of IL-2 plus antiretroviral therapy to a small number of\n      patients in sites being considered for the Phase III trial.\n\n      Patients receive antiretrovirals alone or antiretrovirals plus IL-2 given subcutaneously.\n      Three doses of IL-2 are studied, with 12 patients evaluated at each dose.  When at least 9\n      of the first 12 patients complete the 5-day dosing period without dose-limiting toxicity,\n      the next 12 patients are treated at the next highest dose every 12 hours for 5 days every 8\n      weeks; when this dose is tolerated, the last 12 patients randomized receive the highest\n      study dose every 12 hours for 5 days every 8 weeks.  Patients enrolled at the first two\n      doses of IL-2 who complete three courses of treatment have their dose escalated to a maximum\n      of the highest study dose."
