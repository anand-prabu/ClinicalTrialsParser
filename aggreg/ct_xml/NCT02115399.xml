  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis, also called eczema, is a disease in which the skin is dry and scaly with
      severe itching. People with atopic dermatitis have defects in the skin barrier as well as
      defects in the immune system which fights off skin infections. People who have atopic
      dermatitis often have complications from viral and bacterial skin infections, such as
      recurring Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), or Staph infections. The purpose of this study
      is to look at how defects in the skin barrier and immune response affect risk for skin
      infections. The study will compare the skin barrier and immune response of people with and
      without atopic dermatitis in relation to whether Staph bacteria is growing on their skin.

      Participants will be classified based on Atopic Dermatitis (AD)/Non-Atopic (NA) status and
      S. aureus colonization into 4 groups. S. aureus colonization status will be based on the
      result of the non-lesional skin swab and will be quantified on a scale of 0-4 based on the
      number of quadrants with S. aureus colonies when plated.

             studied.

          5. Who have active EH or eczema vaccinatum (EV).

          6. Who have a history of serious or life-threatening reaction to latex, tape, or
