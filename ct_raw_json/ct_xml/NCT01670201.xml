  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, open, non-controlled clinical investigation to evaluate the adequacy of donor
      site healing when using a new donor site dressing, Mepilex Transfer Ag approximately 20
      subjects from 2 centres in the US, presenting with the need for surgical intervention and
      grafting for burn injury will be enrolled. Eligible subjects will have a selected donor site
      designated as a &quot;study site&quot;.

      The investigator will identify the test donor site and test location will be considered on
      the upper anterior thighs as being the most suitable if available. Circumferential donors
      will be considered acceptable as well.

      Treatment will be initiated in the operation room following debridement and split thickness
      grafting of wounds. Donors will be harvested at 0.010 - 0.012 in. thickness. Treatment and
      dressing of test donor site will include hemostasis post harvesting with epinephrine-soaked
      lap sponges. Once adequate hemostasis is achieved, a Mepilex Transfer Ag dressing will be
      applied directly to study site. Secondary dressing will include covering with ace wrap.

      Healing should be asses after 10-14 days.

             cannot be discontinued, or who is likely to be prescribed these medications or any
             other medications known to adversely affect wound healing during study participation.
