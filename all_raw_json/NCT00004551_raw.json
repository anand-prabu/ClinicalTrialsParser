The second aim is to determine the\n      effect of smoking treatments on alcohol abstinence and to identify factors associated with\n      smoking and alcohol outcomes (e.g., more days of abstinence).  A randomized, two-group\n      design will be used to evaluate the added benefit of mood management compared to a\n      state-of-the-art smoking cessation treatment.  Treatment will consist of 8 weekly group\n      sessions and 1, 3, 6, and 12-month follow-up."
