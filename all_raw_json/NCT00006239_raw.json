Patients also receive oral tretinoin three times daily on days 1-7 of weeks 3,\n      5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression\n      or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tretinoin until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 6\n      patients experience dose limiting toxicities.\n\n      An additional cohort of 6 patients is accrued at the MTD. These patients receive\n      phenylbutyrate IV continuously on days 1-3 of weeks 1 and 3-18. These patients also receive\n      oral tretinoin three times daily on days 1-3 of weeks 2-18. Treatment continues in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months."
