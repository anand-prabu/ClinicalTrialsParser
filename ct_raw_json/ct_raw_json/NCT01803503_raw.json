Sunitinib is an oral anti-angiogenic drug that has been\n      approved for the treatment of kidney cancer, a rare form of soft tissue tumor called\n      gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and a rare form of cancer in the pancreas called pancreatic\n      neuroendocrine tumor.   Sunitinib is usually given continuously at a dose of 37.5mg (3\n      pills) daily either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. However, there are studies\n      which have shown that the continuous administration of sunitinib may reduce chemotherapy\n      effectiveness. On the other hand, a short course of sunitinib before each chemotherapy cycle\n      may sensitize the tumor to chemotherapy. This treatment strategy will be used in patients\n      with different kinds of cancers with a commonly used chemotherapy drug, docetaxel. Ths study\n      aims to evaluate if intermittent administration of low dose sunitinib before docetaxel\n      chemotherapy can improve the treatment response in cancer patients.\n\n      Study Hypothesis: Low dose, short course sunitinib at 12.5mg daily orally for 1 week prior\n      to chemotherapy can normalize tumor vasculature and enhance delivery of chemotherapy into\n      the tumor, and improve treatment response and progression-free survival."
