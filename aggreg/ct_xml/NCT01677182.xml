      To evaluate the efficacy of ramelteon for treatment of acute depressive episodes associated
      with Bipolar 1 Disorder.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Ramelteon. Ramelteon is being tested to treat
      people who have Bipolar 1 Disorder. This study will look at the symptoms of depression in
      people who take Ramelteon as a sub-lingual formulation.

      This study plans to enroll a minimum of 276 participants and a maximum of up to
      approximately 870 participants Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups—which will remain undisclosed to the
      patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Ramelteon  (Dose 1)

        -  Ramelteon  (Dose 2)

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient All participants will be asked to take one tablet every night at
           bedtime throughout the study.

      This study plans to conduct one unblinded interim analysis after the first 276 subjects have
      been enrolled and treated for the 6-week double-blind treatment period. Based on the interim
      analysis, the study plans to adapt limited aspects of the design including: 1) to drop
      ineffective treatment arm/arms; 2) to reassess sample size based on the interim analysis
      results.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in North America and Europe. The overall time to
      participate in this study is up to 14 weeks. Participants will make 8 visits to the clinic,
      and will be contacted by telephone 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The MADRS is a depression rating scale consisting of 10 items, each rated 0 to 6. The 10 items represent the core symptoms of depressive illness. The rating is based on a structured interview with the participant, moving from broadly phrased questions about symptoms to more detailed ones, which allow a precise rating of severity, covering the last 7 days. Decrease in the total score or on individual items indicates improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Quality of Life, Enjoyment, and Satisfaction Scale (Q-LES-Q) Short Form (SF) is a self-administered, 16-item questionnaire to assess the degree of enjoyment and satisfaction experienced by patients in various areas of daily functioning, such as social relationships, living/housing, physical health, medication, and global satisfaction. Each item is rated by the patient on a 5-point scale. The scale is scored as a percent of the total possible score, with higher scores indicating better health status.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of participants with a MADRS response at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>A MADRS response at Week 6 is defined as a ≥50% decrease in the MADRS total score from Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score at Week 6.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The YMRS is a standardized, well-validated measure of manic symptoms that is sensitive to treatment effects in manic patients. Evaluations are made in terms of symptomatology during the prior 48 hours. Four items are rated on 0-8 scale and 7 items are rated on a 0-4 scale, with higher scores reflecting greater levels of mania. The YMRS total score is calculated as the sum of the 11 individual item scores and ranges from 0-60.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Scale-Improvement (CGI-I) score at Week 6.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The CGI-I assesses the participant's improvement (or worsening). The clinician assesses the participant's condition relative to Baseline on a 7-point scale.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Clinical Global Impression Scale-Severity (CGI-S) to Week 6.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The CGI-S assesses the clinician's impression of the subject's current mental illness state. The clinician uses his/her total clinical experience with this patient population and rates the current severity of the participant's mental illness on a 7-point scale.</description>

    <measure>MADRS  remission at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The 16 item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self Rated (QIDS-SR16) version is designed to assess the severity of depressive symptoms. The participant is asked to rate the severity and frequency of specific symptoms present over the last 7 days. The QIDS-SR16 total scores range from 0 to 27.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Total Score at Week 6.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The SDS measures the extent to which the patient's life is impaired by panic, anxiety, phobic, or depressive symptoms. The patient rates the extent to which work, social life or leisure activities and home life or family responsibilities are impaired symptoms on 10-point visual analogue scales. There are verbal descriptors for the points on the scales as well as numerical scores that provide more precise levels of the verbal descriptors. In addition, the SDS addresses the number of days lost and the number of days under-productive due to the symptoms.</description>
