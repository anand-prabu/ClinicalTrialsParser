FEV1/h2, VC/h2 and FEV1/IVC were\n      studied, using graphic smooth techniques and regression analyses techniques on both\n      cross-sectional and longitudinal datasets.  In addition, the investigators tested the\n      hypothesis stating that early adult symptoms of asthma, increased bronchial responsiveness,\n      markers of allergy influenced who became a smoker, influenced the amount smoked and/or\n      influenced who stopped smoking relatively early in adult life, using logistic regression\n      analyses and survival analyses."
