Though there is some recommendation about neuropathic pain,\n      there is no definite drug which is recommended for radiation-induced peripheral neuropathic\n      pain.\n\n      Pregabalin, a Central nervous system(CNS)-active compound, is an analog of the\n      neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. It has been proved an effective treatment for\n      diabetic peripheral neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia in previous clinical trials. This\n      study plans to evaluate the efficacy of pregabalin versus placebo for relieving\n      radiation-induced peripheral neuropathic pain, and assessed its safety."
