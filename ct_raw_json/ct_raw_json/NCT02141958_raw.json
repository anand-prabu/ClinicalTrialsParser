An increasing amount of evidence suggests that this lipid imbalance\n      is a primary effect in CF, playing a major role in the infection-inflammation vicious cycle\n      that leads to respiratory failure. Fenretinide, a derivative of vitamin A, was shown to\n      correct the AA/DHA imbalance in lungs and blood plasma in specific animal model of CF,\n      resulting in reduced lung inflammation and decrease in the severity of pulmonary infections\n      with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n\n      This is a single center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical\n      study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of up to 3 increasing oral doses of\n      Fenretinide compared to placebo, and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Fenretinide in\n      adult CF patients chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A single cohort of 16\n      clinically stable adult patients will be randomized to either Fenretinide or placebo, in a\n      3:1 randomization scheme (12 active, 4 placebo)."
