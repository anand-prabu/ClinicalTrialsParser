  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eating disorders are conditions that are defined by abnormal eating habits that involve
      insufficient or excessive food intake. With regards to treating these disorders, there is an
      increasing interest in fat deprivation due to a lack of proper diet, particularly dietary
      fats such as polyunsaturated fatty acids. These fatty acids are essential components of the
      brain and are important for normal functioning of the body. Since the body cannot synthesize
      these fats, it has to rely completely on diet to obtain a sufficient amount. Hence, diets
      that lack sufficient fats or under fasting conditions, the imbalance of these fats can
      severely alter brain functions. The investigators want to see if these supplements are well
      tolerated and accepted by adolescent patients with eating disorders.
