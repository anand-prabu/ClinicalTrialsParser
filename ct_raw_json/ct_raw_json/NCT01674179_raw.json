Quantitative EEG during\n      routine Nocturnal Polysomnography can be used to assess Alpha/Delta sleep. Hypothesis: Alpha\n      intrusions may be an objective marker for Fibromyalgia and may correlate with current\n      clinical American College of Rheumatology Criteria for the diagnosis of Fibromyalgia."

Research Study Number, 2.\n      Age, 3. Gender, 4. Body Mass Index, 5. Epworth Sleepiness Scale (self reported scale on\n      Sleepiness), 6. Fatigue Severity Scale (self reported scale on Fatigue, 7. American College\n      of Rheumatology (ACR) Criteria for Fibromyalgia, 8. Manual Tender Point Exam (# of\n      anatomically specific tender points/18),  9. Medications: Benzodiazepines (Bnz, Bnz ),\n      Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCA) and Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs SNRIs).\n\n      Sleep Study Data Points: The following data points will be captured from Overnight Sleep\n      Studies: 1. Total Sleep Time, 2. Sleep Efficiency, 3. Wake After Sleep Onset,\n      4.Apnea/Hypopnea Index, 5. Respiratory Distress Index, 6.
