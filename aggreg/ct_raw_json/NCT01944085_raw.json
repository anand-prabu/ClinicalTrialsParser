This is verified by clinic nurses conducting\n      the trial.\n\n      At the clinic visit, they are randomized into one of three groups\n\n      1. acetaminophen; 2. ibuprofen; or 3. Vitamin C (Placebo).\n\n      They are served the `medication' (weight-appropriate dose) and the pins are removed in the\n      clinic an hour later.\n\n      Pain score (Wong-Baker scale) and pulse rate are measured before pin removal, immediately\n      following pin removal, and 10 minutes after pin removal.\n\n      The study hypothesis is that non-narcotic analgesia (such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen) do\n      not decrease pain score and pulse rate associated with the pin removal procedure."
