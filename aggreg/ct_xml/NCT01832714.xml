  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the use of a collection of tests that measure the eye
      response, balance, oculomotor and reaction time tests to aid in the diagnosis of mTBI. The
      tests use highly precise measurement tools to assess various neurologic functions.  (For
      example, high-speed cameras to record eye movement, high-end motors to precisely spin and
      move the subject, comprehensive analysis to stitch together the stimulus and the response.)

      Hypotheses:

        1. A battery of oculomotor, vestibular and reaction time tests will generate variables
           that when properly weighted and run through a given multi-variant analysis, will
           separate the subjects into one of two groups, mTBI or not-mTBI.

        2. A battery of neurologic assessment tests including reaction time, vestibular and
           oculomotor tests taxing a range of neurologic functions and executed using one or more
           of the I-PortalÂ® family of devices, will generate responses that, when used by a
           trained physician, can aid in the diagnosis of an mTBI.

        The Investigational Group includes Service Members (SM) who had been diagnosed with an
        mTBI. The Control Group consists of SM who do not have clinical symptoms consistent with
        mTBI. There will be 90 participants in each group, for a target total of 180 study
        participants.

        Inclusion criteria for all subjects (Control and mTBI) - Males or females from 19 -
        45years of age and of all races.

        Additional Inclusion criteria for mTBI Subjects

        - Diagnosed with traumatic brain injury utilizing 2007 DoD Standard diagnosis of

          -  1) Exposed to an event,

          -  2) Suffered alteration or loss of consciousness secondary to the event, and

          -  3) Had a sequelae from the event.

        Exclusion criteria for all subjects (Control and mTBI)

          -  Brain injury resulting from a penetrating wound to the head, neck, face or brain (to
             include gunshot wounds)

          -  Persons whom have had an mTBI within the prior month and are symptomatic.

          -  Persons with a previous history of multiple mTBIs and are symptomatic.

          -  History of neuropsychiatric disorders antedating the head injury (e.g.
             hypochondriasis, major depression, schizophrenia)

          -  Pregnancy
