She is grieving the loss of her pregnancy, and is then faced with the anxiety of\n      an invasive and often painful procedure. Minimizing the pain during this procedure must not\n      be overlooked. There have been no randomized controlled trials evaluating pain control\n      during MVA for nonviable pregnancy, and the data is mixed regarding analgesia for MVA for an\n      elective abortion or other office procedures.\n\n      Women being treated at the Women & Infants Triage who have experienced a first trimester\n      missed abortion, inevitable abortion, incomplete abortion or other nonviable pregnancy and\n      are being treated with an outpatient manual vacuum aspiration will be asked to enroll in\n      this study. Those who wish to participate will be randomly assigned to treatment with\n      lidocaine gel or a placebo gel applied to the cervix during their procedure.\n\n      The hypothesis is that topical lidocaine will decrease pain during manual vacuum aspiration."
