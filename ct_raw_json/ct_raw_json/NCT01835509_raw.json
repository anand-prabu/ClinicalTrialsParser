The study will test the hypothesis that\n      childhood cancer survivors participating in a physical activity intervention guided by\n      Social Cognitive Theory will increase the amount of time spent daily in moderate to vigorous\n      physical activity, and improve exercise self-efficacy compared to children randomized to\n      usual care. A secondary aim is to assess the impact of the intervention on cardiovascular\n      risk factors including fitness and body composition."
