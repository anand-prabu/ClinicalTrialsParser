Two twelve-month periods were compared. During the first\n      one patients were tube fed with home-made diet without monitoring, while during the other\n      the complex HEN was carried out. The latter included tube feeding and complex monitoring by\n      nutrition support team. Number of complications, hospital admissions, length of hospital\n      stay (LOS), biochemical and anthropometric parameters and costs of hospitalization were\n      compared."
