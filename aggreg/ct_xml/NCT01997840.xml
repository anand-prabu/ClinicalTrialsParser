        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have a documented diagnosis of multiple myeloma and have relapsed and refractory
             disease.  Patients must have received at least 2 lines of prior therapies.  Patients
             must have relapsed after having achieved at least stable disease (SD) for at least
             one cycle of treatment to at least one prior regimen and then developed progressive
             disease (PD).  Patients must also have documented evidence of PD during or within 60
             days (measured from the end of the last cycle) of completing treatment with the last
             anti-myeloma drug regimen used just prior to study entry (refractory disease).

          -  Must have undergone prior treatment with at least 2 cycles of lenalidomide and at
             least 2 cycles of a proteasome inhibitor (either in separate regimens or within the
             same regimen).

          -  Must not be a candidate for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), has declined the
             option of ASCT, or has relapsed after prior ASCT.

          -  Must have measurable levels of myeloma paraprotein in serum (≥ 0.5 g/dL) or urine (≥
             0.2 g/24 hours).

          -  Must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0, 1,
             or 2.

          -  Females of child bearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL within 10 - 14 days prior to,
             and again within 24 hours of starting pomalidomide and must either commit to
             continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of
             birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE
             SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking pomalidomide.  FCBP must also
             agree to ongoing pregnancy testing.  Men must agree to use a latex condom during
             sexual contact with a FCBP even if they have had a vasectomy.  All patients must be
             counseled at a minimum of every 28 days about pregnancy precautions and risks of
             fetal exposure.  See Appendix 9.3.1 Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing
             Guidelines and Acceptable Birth Control Methods, AND also Appendix 9.3.2 Education
             and Counseling Guidance Document.

          -  Must be able to take acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (81 or 325 mg) daily as prophylactic
             anticoagulation.  Patients intolerant to ASA may use low molecular weight heparin.
             Lovenox is recommended.  Coumadin will be allowed provided the patient is fully
             anticoagulated, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2 to 3.

                  50% of bone marrow nucleated cells are plasma cells

               -  Serum creatinine ≥ 3.0 mg/dL

             disease for ≥ 3 years.  Exceptions include the following:

               -  Basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin

               -  Carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast

               -  Incidental histologic finding of prostate cancer (TNM stage of T1a or T1b)

          -  Corrected QT interval using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) value &gt; 480 msec at Screening
             and pre-dose on C1D1; family or personal history of long QTc syndrome or ventricular
             arrhythmias including ventricular bigeminy; previous history of drug-induced QTc
             prolongation or the need for treatment with medications known or suspected of
             producing prolonged QTc intervals on electrocardiogram (ECG).
