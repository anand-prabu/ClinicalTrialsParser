Patients are stratified by\n      performance status, tumor location, and randomizing center.\n\n      Patients randomized to no neoadjuvant chemotherapy undergo resection of the tumor with\n      adequate margins and resection of regional lymph nodes (R2 with at least 8 nodal groups\n      recommended).\n\n      Patients randomized to neoadjuvant chemotherapy receive fluorouracil and cisplatin at 3-4\n      week intervals; fluorouracil is given by continuous intravenous infusion for 5 days and\n      cisplatin is given on the first 2 days of fluorouracil administration. Tumor response is\n      assessed after 2 courses; responding patients with no serious toxicity receive a third\n      course. Surgery, as above, is initiated 4-6 weeks after the second or third course of\n      chemotherapy. Upon recovery (within 3-6 weeks), patients who responded to neoadjuvant\n      chemotherapy receive 3-4 additional courses of postoperative chemotherapy (maximum total of\n      6 courses). Patients whose best response was stable disease are assessed for postoperative\n      radiotherapy.\n\n      Patients on either arm with positive resection margins, positive lymph nodes, or equivocal\n      complete resection are referred for postoperative radiotherapy. Further therapy for patients\n      with incomplete resection is at the discretion of the physician.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3-4 months for at least 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 250 patients will be entered."
