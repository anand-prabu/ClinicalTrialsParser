            "textblock": "BACKGROUND:\n\n      The study contributed to an underdeveloped area of research.  Physical activity is\n      recommended as a nonpharmacological means to modify hypertension and obesity, two\n      cardiovascular risk factors.  African-American women have low levels of physical activity\n      and high rates of obesity, hypertension, and mortality from coronary heart disease,\n      diabetes, and hypertensive diseases.  In 1992, there was an absence of longitudinal data\n      about the physical activity habits of African-American girls even though a decline in\n      physical activity during adolescence had been reported in other subpopulations.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      Within the framework of puberty and maturation, the study: 1)  described longitudinal\n      patterns of physical activity; 2)  assessed longitudinal changes in physical activity and\n      concomitant changes in blood pressure and body fatness; and 3)  determined psychosocial\n      predictors of changes in physical activity.  The investigators hypothesized that there would\n      be a monotonic decrease in physical activity and that psychosocial variables would predict\n      changes in physical activity.  The study population consisted of 189 sixth grade, mostly\n      African-American, girls in Fort Bend Independent School District, Missouri City, Texas.  The\n      girls were measured for four and a half years, ages 11 or 12 at entry of the study.\n      Anthropometry, sexual maturation, blood pressure, physical activity habits and psychosocial\n      predictors were measured twice a year for a total of nine examinations.  Data on dietary,\n      smoking and drinking habits were collected annually.  Activity patterns, psychosocial\n      predictors and other habits were assessed by interviews and questionnaires.  Sexual\n      maturation was assessed by menarche and the Tanner stages. Skinfold and circumference\n      measures determined body fatness and body fat distribution."
