  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long-term sick-listing from work has considerable impact on social function, on the families
      of the sick-listed persons, the companies they work for, and society as a whole. Hence, the
      need for documented effective vocational rehabilitation programs is pressing. Vocational
      rehabilitation services described in the scientific literature have been specific to one
      single or a specific group of medical conditions (e.g.low back pain). In contrast, most
      people on sick leave have several health complaints, and many of the factors influencing
      sick leave are shared regardless of disorder (e.g. social surroundings, workplace
      environment), calling for rehabilitation programs that can be employed for both
      musculoskeletal-, unspecific- and common mental disorders. Aim of this study is to
      investigate whether a group based rehabilitation program for musculoskeletal, mental or
      unspecific complaints can facilitate return-to-work (RTW), thereby testing two
      multicomponent return-to-work RTW rehabilitation programs.
