Subjects randomized to the high-dose\n      vitamin D3 treatment arm will receive 6,000 IU per day from baseline until the subject's\n      vitamin D levels reach \u2265 40 ng/mL at which point the vitamin D3 dose will be reduced to\n      4,000 IU per day. Subjects randomized to the high-dose treatment arm weighing < 40 kg will\n      receive supplementation five days per week and all other subjects will receive\n      supplementation seven days a week.\n\n      In addition to the baseline, and weeks 6, 12, and 18 visits, subjects randomized to the\n      high-dose treatment arm will return at Weeks 3 and 9 to assess vitamin D toxicity. If a\n      subject in the high-dose arm is found to exhibit evidence of vitamin D toxicity at the week\n      12 visit, he/she will be asked to return to the site for an additional vitamin D toxicity\n      assessment at week 15. Study personnel will record each subject's interval history, assess\n      adverse events, disease activity, and collect samples for safety and mechanistic\n      assessments."
