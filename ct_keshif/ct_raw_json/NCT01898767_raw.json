            "textblock": "Theinvestigators and others have shown that airway epithelial cell infection with human\n      rhinovirus (HRV) is a major risk factor for subsequent exacerbation.  Additionally, the\n      investigators have shown that the nucleotide receptor, P2X7, is an important host factor in\n      the prevention of exacerbations, and have data to suggest that this may occur at the level\n      of the alveolar macrophage.  Alveolar macrophages facilitate the resolution of inflammation\n      in part by generating eicosanoid metabolites of arachidonic acid including prostaglandin E2\n      (PGE2) and lipoxin A4 (LXA4). Patients with severe asthma have a reduced capacity to\n      generate PGE2 and LXA4 when compared to those with non-severe asthma, despite alveolar\n      macrophage expression of two of the key enzymes involved in their production.  These and\n      other data suggest that pro-resolving eicosanoid metabolism is most efficient when airway\n      epithelial cells are in communication with alveolar macrophages, and that these pathways may\n      be defective in patients with severe asthma. Moreover, inoculation experiments with human\n      rhinovirus (HRV) demonstrate that alveolar macrophages express cox-2 during resolution.\n      These and other data have led to the central hypothesis that transcellular generation of\n      PGE2 and lipoxins is regulated by P2X7-induced cox-2 expression in alveolar macrophages, and\n      that this process facilitates resolution of an HRV-triggered exacerbation."
