        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Are 18 (eighteen) years of age or older at the time of surgery.

          -  Require spinal fusion using TLIF, PLF or PLIF, with the use of an interbody spacer,
             at 1 to 3 levels between L3-S1.

          -  Willing and able to return for the scheduled follow-up visits, follow post-operative
             instructions and undergo the required radiographic exams (A/P, Lateral Neutral and
             Lateral Flexion/Extension X-rays) for up to 3 time points between 6 months and 24
             months post-surgery (6±2 months, 12±3 months and 24±4 months post-surgery), including
             one CT-scan at 12±3 months.

          -  Unresponsive to conservative care over a period of at least 6 months or has signs
             and/or symptoms that mandate urgent surgical intervention.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Are long term users of medications (i.e. steroids greater than 2-weeks) that are
             known to inhibit fusion or bone metabolism at any time within 6 months prior to
             surgery. Exceptions are inhaled steroids for asthma treatment (i.e. patients on
             inhaled steroids are allowed), or epidural steroid injections.

          -  Are taking immunosuppressive agents (Cancer chemotherapy, treatment with Disease
             Modifying Anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or any similar immunomodulating drugs) or are
             treated with Growth Factors or Insulin at any time within 6 months prior to surgery.

          -  Are being treated with radiotherapy.

          -  Are having medical conditions, known to impact bone metabolism, such as Paget's
             disease, osteoporosis.

          -  Are smokers and/or nicotine/tobacco users.

          -  Are pregnant, lactating or women wishing to become pregnant.

          -  Are a prisoner.

          -  Are currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study that
             has not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the study
             endpoints.

          -  Prior spine surgery at the index level except posterior decompressive surgery where
             the posterior elements are preserved e.g. facet saving techniques such as discectomy,
             laminotomy, and intradiscal procedures.

          -  Use of any other bone graft or bone graft substitute in addition to or in place of
             Accell Evo3® with the exception of local autograft and/or cancellous bone chips.

          -  Use of routine prophylactic NSAIDS for 3 months post-operatively, but low dose
             concomitant pain medications e.g. aspirin should be continued and recorded on the
             Concomitant Pain Medications case report form (CRF).
