    <textblock>
      Coronary artery stents, particularly drug-eluting stents (DES), are used in the majority of
      patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to improve symptoms in
      patients with obstructive coronary artery disease. They function both to prevent abrupt
      closure of the stented artery soon after the procedure as well as to lower the need for
      repeat revascularization compared to balloon angioplasty alone . Stent restenosis and stent
      thrombosis are potential complications of coronary artery stenting; their incidence is
      highest in the first year after PCI. Stent restenosis, which occurs more frequently with
      bare metal stents (BMS) than DES, may occasionally present as an acute myocardial infarction
      (MI). Stent thrombosis is an uncommon but serious complication that often presents as death
      and is almost always accompanied by MI, usually with ST-segment elevation. Patients are
      commonly treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for the recommended duration for the
      particular stent. DAPT (aspirin plus platelet P2Y12 receptor blocker) and significantly
      lowers the risk of stent thrombosis.

      New Guidance on Antiplatelet Therapy After Stenting: Clinical Advisory, Kirsten E.
      Fleischmann, MD, MPH reviewing Grines CL et al. Circulation 2007 Feb 13. An expert panel
      recommends 12 months of therapy after placement of drug-eluting stents. Aspirin and
      clopidogrel are commonly prescribed after placement of both bare metal stents and
      drug-eluting stents. However, recent concerns about stent thrombosis (Journal Watch Jan 4
      2007) have led experts from multiple groups, including the American Heart Association and
      the American College of Cardiology, to issue an advisory on preventing premature
      discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy. Based on a review of the literature, the
      experts offer observations and recommendations including the following:

        -  Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a thienopyridine such as clopidogrel reduces
           cardiac events after coronary stenting.

        -  Premature discontinuation of these agents greatly increases the risk for stent
           thrombosis and associated clinical events such as myocardial infarction and death.

        -  Patients should receive 12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy after placement of
           drug-eluting stents.

        -  Elective surgery associated with a significant risk for bleeding should be postponed
           until an appropriate course of dual antiplatelet therapy (i.e., 1 month for bare metal
           stents and 12 months for drug-eluting stents) has been completed.

        -  Patients' ability to comply with prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy and their need for
           subsequent invasive procedures should be considered when choosing the type of stent.

        -  Patients and their other providers should consult with the patient's cardiologist
           before stopping dual therapy.

      Primary endpoint - Outcome Measures:
