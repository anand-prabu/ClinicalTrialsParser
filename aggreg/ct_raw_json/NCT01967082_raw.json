Objective 1.2 (During the first phase):\n      At post assessment, students enrolled in the study will qualitatively provide information\n      about the usability and usefulness for the prevention and cessation sites.\n\n      Objective 2.1 (During the second phase of the study): Investigate frequency of use of and\n      exposure to APPSPIRE modules via an objective measure of general use.\n\n      Objective 2.2 (During the second phase): Investigate how feasible the program will be.\n\n      Feasibility will be operationalized for this objective. Objective 2.3: Obtain a maintained\n      use of APPSPIRE with high completeness and extent of completion.\n\n      Objective 2.4: Evaluate change in stage of change from baseline to 1 and 4-month follow-ups\n      among participants.\n\n      Objective 2.5: Evaluate change in tobacco-related knowledge from baseline to 1 and 4-month\n      follow-ups among participants."

If you agree to take part in this\n      study, at the initial visit you will learn details about the study and have a chance to ask\n      the research staff questions. During the visit, you will complete an initial survey. The\n      survey asks about health-related attitudes and behaviors.  You will be given a new smoking\n      cessation and prevention app to use on your smart phone at your convenience. The entire\n      visit should last about 1 hour.\n\n      Part 2 will be a telephone survey. You will receive a telephone call from research staff 1\n      month after you receive the app. During this call, you will be asked to answer some of the\n      survey questions from the first survey. You will also be asked questions about how you liked\n      the app, how easy it was to use, and how helpful it was to you. This call should last about\n      1 hour. You will receive a phone call reminder before each follow-up telephone call with the\n      date and time of the call.\n\n      Part 3 will be another telephone survey.
