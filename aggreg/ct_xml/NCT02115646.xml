  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying the appearance and function of burn scars after treatment
      with fractionated carbon dioxide laser.  The investigators hypothesize that the cosmetic
      appearance and range of motion will improve with treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the study will analyze whether the fractionated carbon dioxide laser can
      improve other subjective and objective qualities of hypertrophic and/or contracted burn
      scars with or without involvement of nearby mobile joints.

      The investigators hypothesize that fractionated carbon dioxide laser therapy will increase
      range of motion and improve tissue compliance in all scars overlying a mobile joint that has
      been limited due to burn scar contracture.  In addition, the investigators will evaluate the
      effect of fractionated carbon dioxide laser therapy on common sequelae of hypertrophic
      and/or contracted burn scars.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy males and females between 5 and 70 years of age with hypertrophic and/or
             contracted burn scars with or without involvement of mobile joints.  The burn scars
             must have occurred at least 1 year prior to the date of enrollment.

          -  Having suitable areas of treatment: All wounds in the area of interest must be closed
             for at least two months, and the scars must be deemed stable for a period of 3 months
             before initiation of treatment.

          -  Fitzpatrick skin types I-VI

          -  Able and willing to comply with all visit, treatment and evaluation schedules and
             requirements

          -  Able to understand provide written informed consent

          -  Women of child-bearing age are required to be using a reliable method of birth
             control at least three months prior to study enrollment and throughout the course of
             the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant, intending to become pregnant during the course of the study, less than
             three months postpartum or less than six weeks after completion of breastfeeding.

          -  Active tanning, including the use of tanning booths, during the course of the study

          -  Showing symptoms of hormonal disorders (i.e.: uncontrolled thyroid disease or
             Polycystic Ovary Syndrome), as per the Investigator's discretion

          -  Abnormal photosensitivity due to metabolic disorder or due to use of external agents,
             (drugs, herbs, etc.) within 2 weeks of initial treatment or during the course of the
             study, except for use of aminolevulinic acid(Levulan®) which requires a washout
             period of three months

          -  Prior use of retinoids in treated areas within three months of initial treatment or
             during the course of the study

          -  Use of oral isotretinoin (Accutane®) within nine months of initial treatment or
             during the course of the study. Note: skin must retain its normal degree of moisture
             prior to treatment

          -  Prior skin treatment with laser or other devices in the treated area within three
             months of initial treatment or during the course of the study

          -  Adverse reactions to compounds of any external agent (e.g., gels, lotions or
             anesthetic creams) required for use in the study, if no alternative to the said agent
             exists

          -  History of collagen vascular disease

          -  Concurrent inflammatory skin conditions, including, but not limited to, rosacea of
             any severity

          -  Having a bleeding disorder or taking anticoagulation medications, including heavy use
             of aspirin, in a manner which does not allow for a minimum 10 day washout period
             prior to each treatment (as per the patient's physician discretion)

          -  History of immunosuppression/immune deficiency disorders (including human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)

          -  Significant concurrent illness, such as uncontrolled diabetes, (i.e., any disease
             state that in the opinion of the Investigator would interfere with the anesthesia,
             treatment, or healing process)

          -  Mentally incompetent, prisoner or evidence of active substance or alcohol abuse

          -  If it is determined that the contracture is due to a deeper process involving the
             muscles, ligaments or bones.
