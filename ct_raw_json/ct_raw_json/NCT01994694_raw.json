This study aims to measure both risk taking and risk perception in adults\n      with and without ADHD. It is hypothesized that people with ADHD show decreased risk\n      perception, accounting for their risky behavior. In contrast, it is hypothesized that people\n      with ADHD do not show increased risk attitude, namely, they are not risk seeking."
