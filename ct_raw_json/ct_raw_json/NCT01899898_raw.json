            "textblock": "One third of children with epilepsy have seizures that are medically intractable.\n      Uncontrolled seizures pose a variety of risks to children, including higher rates of\n      mortality, developmental delay and cognitive impairment. Epilepsy surgery is not a feasible\n      option for most children with refractory epilepsy. The ketogenic diet and the modified\n      Atkins diet have been shown to be effective alternative treatments in children with\n      refractory epilepsy. However, these need parents to be educated, and understand complex\n      instructions of weighing foods and diet preparation. Therefore, children with parents with\n      low levels of literacy and poor socioeconomic status have not been able to benefit from\n      these therapies. Also, the paucity of trained dieticians and limited availability of labeled\n      foods in resource-constraint settings has made these dietary therapies even more\n      inaccessible.\n\n      This study aimed to to develop a simple-to-administer variation of the modified Atkins diet\n      for use in children with refractory epilepsy and to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability\n      of this simplified modified Atkins diet in children with refractory epilepsy in a randomized\n      controlled open-label trial."
