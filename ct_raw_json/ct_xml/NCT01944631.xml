  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the effect of Iota-Carrageenan treatment on
      cold symptoms. The effect of treatment on the duration of the cold and the patients viral
      load plus cytokine level indicating the inflammatory response will be analyzed.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Patients consider that they are in an early stage of common cold with symptoms of no
             more than 48 hours duration

          -  Symptom score of equal or more than 1 for for at least one of the symptoms sore
             throat, runny nose and blocked nose on a 0-3 verbal rating scale

          -  Total symptom score of equal or less 9 for symptoms headache, muscle ache,
             chilliness, sore throat, blocked nose, runny nose, cough, and sneezing measured on a
             0-3 verbal rating scale

          -  Patients agree to refrain from taking any products intended to prevent, intervene in,
             or treat cough/colds/flu, starting at study entry and continuing through day 10 (e.g.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Known hypersensitivity or are allergic to any component of the test device

             obstructive pulmonary disease

          -  Severe nasal septum deviation or other condition that could cause nasal obstruction
             such as the presence of nasal polyps.

          -  History of nasal or sinus surgery that in the opinion of the investigator may
             influence symptom scores

          -  Taking any prescribed medication other than for contraception, that is considered by
             the investigator as a reason for exclusion e.g. systemic steroids, intranasal
             medicines, antibiotics

          -  Common cold or flu like symptoms for more than 48 hours.

          -  Recent (within the previous 2 days) intake of a common cold medicine that in the
             opinion of the investigator may influence symptom scores (analgesics, nasal
             decongestants, cough medicines)

          -  Current smoker (more than 10 cigarettes a day)
