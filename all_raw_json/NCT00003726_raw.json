Patients receive dose\n      escalated lepirudin subcutaneously once or twice a day for 3-4 days. Dose escalation\n      continues in each patient until aPTT prolongation occurs or the maximum dose level is\n      reached. The patient then continues treatment on the maximum tolerated dose. Treatment\n      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24\n      months."
