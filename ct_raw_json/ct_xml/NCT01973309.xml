  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 1b dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and
      PK of vantictumab when combined with paclitaxel.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) has been
      determined, up to 10 patients may be enrolled in the cohort-expansion phase to better
      characterize the safety, tolerability and PK of vantictumab combined with paclitaxel. Up to
      approximately 34 patients may be enrolled into the study.
