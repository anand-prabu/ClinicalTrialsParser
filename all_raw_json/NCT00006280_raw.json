This drug is an antibiotic that is inhaled into the lungs by the patient. It has\n      already been studied and approved by the FDA for treatment of CF patients 6 years and older.\n      Lung fluid will be examined for bacteria before and after the 28-day treatment. The amount\n      of bacteria before and after treatment will be compared. This will indicate whether the\n      antibiotic was effective in killing bacteria in the lungs. Once treatment begins, patients\n      will be monitored every 2 weeks throughout the study (5 exams in 56 days). Half of the\n      patients will receive TOBIr, half will receive a placebo (a substance that looks like TOBIr\n      but contains no medication)."
