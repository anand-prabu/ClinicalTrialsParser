The types of cells we hope to collect are\n      called CD34+ progenitor, or stem cells. These cells can be used in the laboratory to better\n      understand a number of diseases and suggest new strategies for therapy.  Perhaps the most\n      important potential application of human stem cells is the generation of cells and tissues\n      that could be used for cell-based therapies, as a renewable source of replacement cells and\n      tissues to treat diseases including Alzheimer's diseases, spinal cord injury, stroke, burns,\n      heart disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis."

This study does not involve the use of placebos, and subjects will serve as their\n      own controls for CD34+ cell mobilization. We hypothesize that a single dose of Mellaril\n      (thioridazine HCL) will mobilize CD34+ progenitor cells into human peripheral blood by a\n      factor of at least 10 fold, from 4 to 40 cells/microliter."
