The DASH enquires about the ability to perform simple and complex activities of daily living (ADL) that are commonly performed with either one or both arms. The total score is derived from the unweighted mean of 30 items, of which at least 27 have to be answered. The QuickDASH is a more efficient version of the DASH outcome measure that appears to retain its measurement properties. It contains eleven items and is similar with regard to scores and properties to the full DASH. A validated full-length German version is available that can be used in the shortened version.",
