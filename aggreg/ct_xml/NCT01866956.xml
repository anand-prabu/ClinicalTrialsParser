      The KSADS-COMP will facilitate identification of comorbid psychiatric and substance use
      diagnoses frequently missed in clinical practice, and improve adolescent treatment outcomes.
      The self-administered version of the KSADS-COMP can also be used cost-effectively in schools
      and juvenile justice settings where there is a growing interest in early identification and
      referral of youth in need of mental health services. The KSADS-Bridge assessment tool with
      its RDoC neurocognitive tasks, when completed with the self- or clinician administered
      KSADS-COMP, will help to create cross-talk between the DSM and RDoC diagnostic perspectives,
      and begin to generate a database on the relationship between RDoC constructs and treatment
      outcomes across a range of diagnostic categories.

      This Phase II SBIR grant is a follow-up to the Phase I SBIR grant &quot;Computerized Screening
      for Comorbidity in Adolescents with Substance or Psychiatric Disorders.&quot; During Phase I,
      parent and adolescent self administered computerized versions of the psychiatric interview,
      the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (KSADS), were developed to
      assess DSM-IVR diagnoses in adolescents. Since the funding of the Phase I grant, there have
      been two significant developments in the field: the American Psychiatric Association's
      release of the DSM-5 manual, and NIMH's launch of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)
      initiative that aims to create the necessary database to derive a new psychiatric
      nomenclature informed by neuroscience, genetics, and psychology. The primary goals of Phase
      II include: 1) Update the parent and adolescent self-administered computerized KSADS
      (KSADS-COMP) so it is compatible with DSM-5 criteria; 2) Develop software for a
      clinician-administered computerized KSADS (KSADS-COMP); 3) Create a KSADS- Bridge product
      that includes a battery of RDoC computerized neurocognitive tasks that can be completed with
      the self- or clinician-administered KSADS-COMP; and 4) Examine the criterion, convergent,
      and discriminant validity of the self-administered KSADS-COMP, and the relationship among
      DSM-5 diagnoses, dimensional measures of psychopathology, and performance on RDoC
      neurocognitive tasks. Ultimately the aim of this initiative is to create an instrument that,
      in addition to providing a reliable comprehensive assessment tool for psychiatric disorders
      in adolescents, can bridge DSM-5 and RDoC diagnostic perspectives. A sample of 400
      adolescents and their parents will be recruited for this study: half will complete the
      self-administered KSADS-COMP; the other half will complete the clinician-administered
      KSADSCOMP. All 400 adolescents and their parents, in addition to completing one of the
      KSADS-COMP versions, will also complete a battery of dimensional symptom rating scales. A
      subset of 210 adolescents and their parents will then complete the other version of the
      KSADS-COMP to test diagnostic concordance between the self- and clinician-administered
      KSADS-COMP. To obtain reliable Kappa estimates, this subset will include 30 adolescents with
      no psychopathology and 30 adolescents that meet criteria for each of the following
      diagnoses: conduct disorder, major depression, bipolar; substance use disorders; post
      traumatic stress disorder; and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. This subset of 210
      adolescents will also be administered the RDoC battery of neurocognitive computerized tasks.
      The KSADS-COMP and KSADS-Bridge assessment tools will have multiple clinical and research
      applications. In addition to helping identify comorbidity in teens with substance or
      psychiatric disorders, it will help to create the cross-talk needed between the DSM and RDoC
      diagnostic perspectives, and will help to improve clinical care in the short- and long-run
      as the field aims to transition to a new psychiatric nomenclature.
