  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who survive a stroke are often left with an arm that cannot be used. One reason for
      this is that the muscles affected by the stroke become overactive. This is known as
      spasticity. Such unwanted muscle overactivity, if left untreated or poorly managed, can lead
      to limb deformities. For example, the wrist and fingers in the arm affected by spasticity
      become stiff and curl into a fist and the hand cannot be used for any functional purpose.
      Palm hygiene can become difficult and patients find this deformity unsightly and painful.
      Botulinum toxin (BT) has been shown to reduce muscle overactivity and is licensed for this
      purpose. In current practice this treatment is often used as a last line of defence.
      Although BT can reduce the muscle overactivity, when injected using current protocols, it
      seems to have little impact on the recovery of function and/or treating the limb deformities
      and pain. If BT can be given in the early stages of a stroke, i.e. as soon as the muscle
      overactivity is observed, then we will be able to treat spasticity and may prevent the limb
      deformities and pain from developing. We may also be able to assist the recovery of arm
      movement in some of the patients who would otherwise not have regained this. In addition to
      benefiting the patient, the prevention of secondary complications by early treatment may
      reduce the costs of long term care to the NHS . We hope to discover if our plan of providing
      early treatment with BT is more effective than the current approach. If we demonstrate that
      the treatment is effective we will be able to introduce this new method almost immediately
      within the NHS through our collaboration with doctors and therapists who are actively
      treating patients with this condition.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Over 18 years of age.

             haemorrhage producing an upper motor syndrome affecting one body side which results
             in a hemiplegia
