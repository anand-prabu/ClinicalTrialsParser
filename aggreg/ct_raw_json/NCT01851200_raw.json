            "textblock": "Complete responses with third-line or later salvage chemotherapy (CT) for germ cell tumors\n      (GCT) range 0% to 10% and are usually short-lived and nearly all patients (pts) progressing\n      after multiple courses or high-dose CT will ultimately die from progressive disease.\n\n      Cluster of Differentiation antigen-30 (CD30) is expressed by untreated embryonal carcinoma\n      (ECA) thus lending support to a rationale for a targeted approach. The investigators\n      retrospectively re-assessed ECA to strongly retain CD30 staining in most cases (>70%), even\n      after multiple courses or high-dose CT. Moreover, a negative prognostic value of CD30\n      expression by residuals after CT, particularly in the salvage setting, was set. Brentuximab\n      vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate consisting of the chimeric anti-CD30 antibody\n      chemically conjugated to an antitubulin synthetic analog (MMAE).\n\n      Proof of activity will provide rationale for developing first-line chemo-immunotherapy or\n      maintenance immunotherapy for selected high-risk pts. The primary objective of the study\n      will be the activity of Brentuximab vedotin in refractory GCT. Secondary objectives will\n      include safety and survival.\n\n      24 pts with biopsy-proven CD30 positive GCT will receive intravenous Brentuximab vedotin at\n      the dose of 1.8 mg/Kg every 3 weeks until disease progression or onset of unacceptable\n      toxicity. Further eligibility requirements will include failure of 2 or 3 platinum-based CT\n      (prior high-dose CT is allowed). All pts will undergo measurement of serum tumor markers, a\n      computed tomography and a positron emission tomography (PET) scan every weeks. An optimal\n      Simon's 2-stage design will be applied. The primary endpoint is the objective response-rate\n      (ORR). An ORR of 5% is not promising, while a 25% rate will be promising. In stage 1, 9\n      evaluable patients will be accrued. The type I and II error are both set at 10%.\n\n      Additional post-treatment tissue will be available for pts undergoing surgery in the\n      treatment time-course. Tissue array blocks will be constructed from samples of all pts.\n      Assessment will include mutational analysis of most-frequently mutated genes. Two serum\n      aliquots will be collected at baseline and during/end of treatment to assess circulating\n      CD30."
