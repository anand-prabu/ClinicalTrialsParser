Subjects will\n      undergo a 24 hour intensive pharmacokinetic evaluation after ingesting a single dose of\n      either the Test or Reference formulation.

Additional pharmacokinetic samples 36, 48, 72, 120\n      and 192 hours postdose will be drawn.\n\n      Subjects will complete a wash out period form day 8 to day 28 during which no study drug\n      will be ingested. On day 29 (period 2) they will ingest either the Test or the Reference\n      formulation (opposite to the formulation received on period 1).

Adverse events and concomitant\n      medication will be documented throughout the study.\n\n      The sample size is 28 and is based on a 15% dropout rate (due to lost to follow-up,\n      treatment discontinuation, etc.) Since the investigators are expecting four subjects not to\n      complete the study,24 evaluable subjects are finally expected. If the discontinuation rate\n      is greater than 15%, the investigators will continue to enroll until they get 24 evaluable\n      subjects.\n\n      The primary endpoint is to determine average bioequivalence for Test and Reference\n      formulation of efavirenz according to the FDA guidance on bioequivalence testing. The ratio\n      of the Test to Reference formulation mean for efavirenz AUC0-192, AUC0-inf and Cmax and the\n      90% confidence interval around each mean ratio will be determined. Average bioequivalence\n      will be met if 90% confidence interval around de AUC and Cmax mean ratios for efavirenz\n      falls within the FDA's predefined limits of 0.80 to 1.25.\n\n      Safety will be evaluated by administering a questionnaire to the subjects during the study .\n      This questionnaire will list the most frequent adverse effects already described for the\n      innovator (Stocrin(R)). Safety will also be evaluated from vital signs recordings, lab tests\n      out of the limits fixed in the study protocol and Psychiatric Evaluations during screening,\n      in the wash out period and 15 days after the last administration of the study medication."
