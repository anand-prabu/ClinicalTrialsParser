New treatment options for inoperable\n      cancer in the  stomach are urgently needed, and local treatment with botulinum toxin seems\n      to be an attractive possibility. In this pilot study Botox injections will be given by\n      gastroscopy in both the tumor and the surrounding stomach wall. The purpose of the study is\n      to obtain data needed to calculate sample size in a larger controlled trial."
