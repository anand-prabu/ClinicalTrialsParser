    <textblock>
      The trial is divided in two parts, Part A and Part B.  Part A will involve dose-finding  of
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and MTD in patients with  advanced solid tumours. Part B will
      involve expansion of the MTD to 3 cohorts including non-small cell lung cancer squamous
      histology, recurrent/ metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck and other advanced
       solid tumours (except sarcomas).
