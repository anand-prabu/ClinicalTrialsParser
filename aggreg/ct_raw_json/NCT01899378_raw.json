The\n      investigators hypothesize that two probiotics are safe for infants in Bangladesh and may\n      have an effect on biomarkers of gut health and immunity.  The specific aims of this pilot\n      are: i) to confirm the safety of administering probiotic strains to infants in low-income\n      countries, ii) to determine the effects of dosing frequency on colonization and persistence\n      of probiotics in the GI tract, iii) to measure markers of intestinal and immune function and\n      microbiota structure."
