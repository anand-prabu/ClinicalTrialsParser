These\n      medications have shown to have an effect on some cognitive and non cognitive symptoms of the\n      pathology. However, their efficacy remains limited and may decrease with time. There is an\n      unmet medical need in this pathology. Based on pre-clinical and clinical studies, masitinib\n      (AB1010) can be considered as a good candidate at the dose of 3 and 4.5 mg/kg/day."
