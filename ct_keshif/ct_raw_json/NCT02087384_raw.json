            "textblock": "Rationale:\n\n      Since the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), human immunodeficiency\n      virus (HIV)-related morbidity and mortality have considerably decreased. However, as a\n      result of the significantly prolonged life span, new causes of morbidity and mortality have\n      become evident. In particular, anal cancer incidence has increased dramatically in\n      HIV-positive men. Like cervical cancer, anal cancer is causally linked to infections with\n      high-risk papillomaviruses, and is preceded by precursor lesions: anal intraepithelial\n      neoplasia (AIN). Over 90% of HIV-positive MSM have persisting anal HPV (human papilloma\n      virus) infection, and high-grade (HG) AIN is present in 30% of all HIV+ MSM.\n\n      As in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, early diagnosis and treatment of AIN have been\n      advocated to prevent malignancy. Electrocoagulation/ cauterization is standard of care for\n      intra-anal AIN, but after treatment, recurrence of lesions occurs in approximately 50% of\n      cases. This is a major problem in an effective screening program for AIN.\n\n      In a nonconcurrent, non-blinded cohort study qHPV (quadrivalent human papilloma virus)\n      vaccination significantly (HR 0.50) reduced HG AIN recurrence among MSM successfully treated\n      for AIN. This is in accordance with findings in women treated for cervical intraepithelial\n      neoplasia. Previous vaccination with quadrivalent HPV vaccine among women who had surgical\n      treatment for HPV related disease significantly reduced the incidence of subsequent HPV\n      related disease, including high grade disease.\n\n      Therefore, a strategy that is worth investigating is vaccination with the qHPV vaccine to\n      prevent recurrences in HIV+ MSM who were successfully treated for HG AIN.\n\n      Objective:\n\n      The primary objective of the current study is to assess the efficacy of qHPV vaccination in\n      preventing recurrence of high-grade AIN in HIV+ MSM with CD4 counts >350 x 10E6/l who were\n      successfully treated for high-grade intra-anal AIN in the past year.\n\n      Study population:\n\n      HIV-positive MSM with a CD4 count > 350 cells/ul and intra-anal high-grade AIN (grade 2-3)\n      that was successfully treated in the past year with conventional cauterization, cryotherapy,\n      or other forms of local treatment.\n\n      Study design:\n\n      A multicentre, randomised, double-blind clinical trial in four hospitals in the Netherlands.\n\n      Intervention:\n\n      Patients are randomised for vaccination with the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil \u00ae) or\n      vaccination with a matching placebo at months 0, 2 and 6.\n\n      Randomisation will be stratified for complete response versus partial response (from HG AIN\n      to low-grade (LG) AIN) of the initial HG AIN lesion, for treatment less than 6 months ago\n      versus treatment more than 6 months ago, and for AMC (Academic medical Center) versus other\n      hospitals.\n\n      Main study parameters/endpoints:\n\n      Screening for AIN will be performed by high-resolution anoscopy (HRA), at inclusion (first\n      vaccination) and at last vaccination (6 months), and repeated at 6 and 12 months after the\n      last vaccination. Safety Monitoring for spontaneous adverse events and injection-site\n      reactions will be performed one week after each vaccination and thereafter every 6 months\n      for a total of 12 months of follow-up.\n\n      Primary end point will be the cumulative recurrence of HG AIN at 12 months after the last\n      vaccination, as assessed by HRA (High-Resolution Anoscopy), with biopsies taken of suspect\n      lesions.\n\n      Secondary outcome measures are toxicity/ safety, recurrence of HG AIN at last vaccination\n      and 6 months afterwards, cumulative occurrence of LG AIN at  12 months after the last\n      vaccination, cumulative occurrence of anogenital warts at 12 months after the last\n      vaccination, causative HPV type in recurrent AIN lesions, as assessed by LCM (Laser Capture\n      Microdissection)/ PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), and HPV type-specific antibody response."
