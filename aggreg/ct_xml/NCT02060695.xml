      The purpose of this study is to determine the temporal relationship between motor
      fluctuations and non-motor fluctuations in persons with Parkinson's disease.

      Objectives

        1. how many patients will experience motor or nonmotor fluctuation during follow-up
           period?

        2. in how many patients, does motor fluctuation precede nonmotor fluctuation?

        3. in how many patients, does nonmotor fluctuation precede motor fluctuation?

      Participants: persons with Parkinson disease in early stage who does not have motor or
      nonmotor fluctuation

      Recruitment period: 2 years from the commencement of the study Follow-up period: 2 years for
      each participants

    <description>The proportion of participants with motor and/or nonmotor fluctuation will be evaluated at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after the enrollment of each participant in order to determine the time course of motor/nonmotor fluctuation in persons with early stage of Parkinson's disease.</description>

    <measure>sensitivity and specificity of self-diagnostic questionnaire of motor/nonmotor fluctuation</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The participants will be checked regularly for the development of motor/nonmotor fluctuation during study period by both of self-diagnostic questionnaire and clinician. The validation of self-diagnostic questionnaire of motor/nonmotor fluctuation will be conducted compared to the clinician-evaluated occurrence of motor/nonmotor fluctuation.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The presence of impulse control disorders including excessive shopping, binge eating, pathologic gambling, and hypersexuality will be checked with questionnaire at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months in order to determine the frequency of impulse control disorders among the participants</description>

    <description>The presence of REM sleep behavior disorder will be checked with questionnaire at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months in order to determine the frequency of REM sleep behavior disorder among the participants.</description>
