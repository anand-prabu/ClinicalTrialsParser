The study will enroll\n      pediatric subjects who are currently not on, or not fully compliant with a ketogenic diet.\n      Enrolled subjects are otherwise able to maintain their standard treatment with 1-3\n      antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) throughout the duration of the study.\n\n      Beginning with the screening visit, subjects will record seizure frequency during the 6-week\n      Baseline Period.. At the end of the Baseline Period, subjects will be randomized and dosing\n      will be initiated using a 2-week titration schedule until the subject has reached 35% of\n      total daily calories from study drug.\n\n      After the initial 8-week double-blind Treatment Period, the open-label Extension Period will\n      begin, wherein all subjects will be treated with UX007 through Week 52 of the study. Long\n      term safety and persistence of effect of UX007 will be assessed during this Extension\n      Period. Subjects who complete treatment through Week 52 may have the option to continue\n      UX007 treatment, if warranted, in a separate open-label extension study."
