  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we will apply transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for 5 consecutive
      days in chronic patients in minimally conscious state (MCS).

      2 sessions of 5 days of stimulation will be realized, one anodal and one sham. After each
      stimulation, behavioral improvement will be assessed with the Coma Recovery Scale Revised
      (CRS-R). A final assessment will be done one week after the end of the sessions to assess
      the long term effect of the tDCS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Positive effects of tDCS in patients in MCS was showed in a recent study published in
      Neurology. But the effects went down after 1 or 2 hours. To increase the lasting of the
      effects, we will start a study where we will apply tDCS on the left prefrontal dorsolatral
      cortex for 5 consecutive days in chronic patients in MCS.

      2 sessions of 5 days of stimulation will be realized, one sessin will be real (anodal
      stimulation) and one placebo (sham stimulation). After each stimulation, behavioral
      improvement will be assessed with the Coma Recovery Scale Revised (CRS-R). A final
      assessment will be done one week after the end of the sessions to assess the long term
      effect of the tDCS.

      We expected to see an improvement of the CRS-r total score at the end of the anodal session
      and that this improvement persists for a week.

    <description>Patients received anodal tDCS (on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) every day for 5 days (tDCS of 2mA during 20minutes). A CRS-R is performed at baseline (before the first stimulation) and after each tDCS.
