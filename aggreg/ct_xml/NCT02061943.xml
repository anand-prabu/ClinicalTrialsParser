    <textblock>
      This is a study of patients with spasmodic dysphonia to determine how best to measure  the
      severity of the disorder in patients. It addresses which characteristics of speech are the
      best indicator of whether or not a particular treatment has benefited a person with
      spasmodic dysphonia. We hope to recruit 20 participants each at 2 different centers. The
      evaluation for each participant will be done on a two visits, one just before and another
      several weeks after treatment.

      This is a study of changes in voice and laryngeal function with treatment recorded using the
      Spasmodic Dysphonia Diagnosis and Assessment Procedure (SD-DAP). Persons with adductor
      spasmodic dysphonia will complete a questionnaire on the Voice Handicap Index (VHI) and
      ratings of speech effort as well as have their speech recorded and receive a
      nasolaryngoscopy examination prior to their usual treatment with botulinum toxin injection
      into the laryngeal muscles for their voice disorder.  They will return for re-examination
      several weeks later after their injection and repeat each of the examinations.  The purpose
      is to determine which items on the SD-DAP are sensitive to changes in the severity of their
      voice disorder.  The items that show sensitivity would be those that would be useful for
      assessing voice outcomes in clinical trials. Some of the questions this study is trying to
      answer are

        -  What is the best way to measure the severity of spasmodic dysphonia?

        -  How does treatment of spasmodic dysphonia by botulinum toxin injection affect voice for
           communication in regular daily life in spasmodic dysphonia

        -  Is change in speaking effort related to the change in severity of spasmodic dysphonia
           with botulinum toxin injection?

      Each participant in this study will be asked to do the following:

        -  Provide a copy of medical records and medical history relating to the diagnosis of
           spasmodic dysphonia.

        -  Have an examination by an otolaryngologist with a medical periscope inserted in the
           throat to view the voice box in action. The examination will be so it can be reviewed
           later by several different experts.

        -  Complete questionnaires regarding the severity of their disorder before and after
           receiving their usual treatment; an injection of botulinum toxin into the laryngeal
           muscles.

        -  Repeat a speech recording and laryngeal examination before and after treatment
