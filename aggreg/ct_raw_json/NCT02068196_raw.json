            "textblock": "In Norway ipilimumab (Yervoy\u00ae) has been available for treating patients with advanced,\n      locally advanced or metastatic melanoma, but was not approved for reimbursement until\n      recently. The Department of Health and Social Services decided that in Norway a national\n      Phase IV interventional study examining survival and Quality of Life should be performed. In\n      addition a research project should be launched aiming at isolating biological markers to\n      identify patients who would benefit the most from ipilimumab therapy.\n\n      Because ipilimumab is a new therapeutic agent with a novel mechanism of action, it is\n      important to understand the scope of its impact once being widely available as a treatment\n      option, i.e. real-world experience. Treatment guidelines and clinical research provide\n      information on how unresectable or metastatic melanoma is to be treated with ipilimumab and\n      how Adverse Events should be managed, but may not reflect what actually occurs in clinical\n      practice compared to controlled trials.\n\n      The results of the study will provide a more extensive understanding of the safety profile\n      of ipilimumab in oncology practices in Norway in patients who may differ substantially from\n      those included in the clinical trial program. In addition, the study results will provide\n      information on how treatment patterns, patient-reported outcomes, clinical outcomes such as\n      survival and disease progression may be influenced by ipilimumab. The proposed study\n      objectives are: assessment of the safety of ipilimumab and analysis of health outcomes, in\n      routine clinical practice, to ensure appropriate patient and provider utilization of\n      ipilimumab."
