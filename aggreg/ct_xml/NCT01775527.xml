  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis in the world and it
      represents an important cause of  end-stage kidney failure. This disease was described as a
      distinct entity in 1968 by J Berger and N Hinglais. The aetiology and the pathogenesis
      remain still obscure. Clinical observations and immunisation studies indicate that IgAN
      represents a dysregulation of the immune system, rather than an intrinsic renal abnormality.
      Twenty years ago, some authors proposed the mucosa-bone marrow axis to explain the
      pathogenesis of the disease. Mucosal IgA plasmocytes are displaced and take up residence in
      systemic sites. The unusual characteristics featured by the IgA produced by these cells
      (charge, size, glycosylation) drive their accumulation, deposition and mesangial activation
      characteristic of IgAN.

      Evidence is emerging that altered lymphocyte homing may ultimately explain this aberrant
      localization.
