However, phenobarbital, as the traditional premedication, has less\n      sedative, weak anxiolytic and other shortcomings. Midazolam accompanied by inhibition of\n      respiration,excessive sedation, easily induced delirium,prolonged recovery time and so on.\n      Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective \u03b12-adrenergic receptor agonist, it has sedative,\n      anxiolytic, no inhibition of respiration, and also colorless, odorless, non-mucosal\n      stimulation, nasal drip ease of administration, patient acceptance, comfortable. Therefore,\n      dexmedetomidine as premedication has certain advantages.
