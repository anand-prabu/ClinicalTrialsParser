  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to: develop an emergency care visit registry for pediatric
      patients for Quality Improvement purposes and to support future research; to use the
      emergency care visit registry to collect stakeholder-prioritized emergency care performance
      improvement measures for important pediatric medical and trauma conditions at the level of
      the ED and individual clinical; and report emergency care performance improvement measures
      to individual ED clinicians and sites, and measure subsequent changes in quality
      performance. The hypothesis is that by providing this type of information to individual
      clinicians will result in improved performance and decreased variability (variation) of care
      for an individual clinician, between different clinicians, and eventually between hospital
      sites.
