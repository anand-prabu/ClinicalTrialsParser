            "textblock": "Methylnaltrexone for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in the setting of\n      palliative or hospice care, is significantly more effective than placebo (1). However, in\n      both the randomized and the open-label phase of the multi center trial showing this\n      favorable outcome, the drug produced rescue-free laxation in only about half of the patients\n      (2). There may be several reasons for this result, since constipation in palliative care\n      patients often has multiple simultaneously occurring causes.\n\n      Assuming that constipation of the non-responders is still opioid-induced, one of the\n      possible reasons for not responding to methylnaltrexone could be that central actions of\n      opioids contribute to constipation by reducing motility of the intestines through direct\n      actions in the spinal dorsal horn (2). However, as methylnaltrexone is a \u00b5-receptor\n      antagonist and not all opioids are solely \u00b5-receptor agonists another reason may well be\n      that successful laxation is determined by the receptor-profile of the specific opioid the\n      patient is using.\n\n      Opioids do not only influence bowel functioning, but also immune system functioning and\n      angiogenesis. Methylnaltrexone possibly antagonizes these changes, therefore this study will\n      also investigate the influence of methylnaltrexone on immunologic and angiogenic parameters."
