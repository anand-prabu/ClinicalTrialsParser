This study\n      will use a new, longer acting form of IFN called PEG-IFN alfa-2b. PEG-IFN alfa-2b is\n      approved by the FDA for use in treating HCV but has not yet been approved for use with RBV.\n      This study also will use IL-2, which is a substance that the body naturally produces. People\n      with HIV infection usually do not make enough IL-2. IL-2 is being tested in this study to\n      see if it will \"boost\" the immune system's response to HCV. The FDA has approved IL-2 for\n      the treatment of some cancers."

            "textblock": "HCV infection is an increasingly important clinical problem in patients infected with HIV.\n      In HIV-uninfected patients with acute HCV infection, the presence of vigorous T-cell\n      proliferative responses to HCV proteins is associated with normalization of serum\n      transaminase levels and viral clearance. Furthermore, early results suggest IL-2 may improve\n      transaminase levels in HCV/HIV patients. These observations provide the rationale for an\n      immune-based therapeutic approach to HCV/HIV coinfection.  This study explores the use of\n      initial immunostimulatory therapy with IL-2 followed by the addition of antiviral therapy\n      with PEG-IFN alfa-2b and RBV, as a possible synergistic approach to treatment.\n\n      Patients receive IL-2 for 12 weeks followed by the addition of PEG-IFN alfa-2b and RBV at\n      the Week 12 visit. Patients remain on IL-2, PEG-IFN alfa-2b, and RBV for an additional 48\n      weeks. At  Week 60, all study treatment is permanently discontinued and patients continue to\n      be evaluated through Week 84. Toxicity or intolerance is evaluated. Data is collected on\n      biochemical and virologic responses."
