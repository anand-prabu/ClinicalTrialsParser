  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how frequently children undergoing elective
      neurosurgical procedures develop blood clots in the deep veins of the legs while
      hospitalized. The information gained from this study will help us determine when children
      children need to receive therapy to help prevent this type of blood clot from forming.

    <description>No DVT prophylaxis will be provided during surgery. Bilateral lower extremity Doppler ultrasounds are obtained within 48 hours pre-operatively.  Doppler ultrasound studies will then be performed within 72 hours after the surgery.  The studies will be evaluated by a board-certified radiologist.</description>
