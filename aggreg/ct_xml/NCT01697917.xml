      The purpose of this study is to find out more about differences of the quality of life in
      patients undergoing total gastrectomy or proximal gastrectomy for adenocarcinoma of
      esophagogastric junction. To find a better reconstruction for patients who received total
      gastrectomy.

    <textblock>
      Overall, the incidence of stomach cancer worldwide is declining with geographical variation.
      However, an increase in the incidence rate of adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction,
      called cardia or AEG has been observed in recent years. AEG may represent a specific
      histopathological and biologic entity. In the treatment AEG there is argument over whether
      proximal gastractomy(PG) or total gastractomy (TG) should be done. The quality of life (QOL)
      of the patients following TG or PG arouses people's attention. The purpose of this study was
      to evaluate differences of the quality of life in patients undergoing total gastrectomy or
      proximal gastrectomy for adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction.
