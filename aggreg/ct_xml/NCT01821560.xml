  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project will utilize perfusion functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a
      functional candidate gene association approach (of dopaminergic addictions-targeted
      polymorphisms), and the dopamine-modulating and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) B receptor
      agonist, baclofen, to examine the brain and behavioral responses in smokers to appetitive
      smoking reminders (cues that motivate continued smoking and relapse). These studies will
      provide a means to identify an appetitive cue-sensitive pharmacologic-responsive
      endophenotype. Once brain/behavioral/genetic endophenotypes can be determined prior to
      treatment, smoking cessation treatments can be structured to meet individual needs, which
      will significantly improve treatment outcome.

    <description>At baseline (prior to randomization) brain and behavioral responses to smoking cues will be significantly greater in 9-repeats compared to 10/10-repeats. While on medication (3 weeks later), 9-repeats receiving baclofen will demonstrate greater reductions in brain activity and smoking behavior compared to 10/10-repeats. 9-repeats receiving placebo will exhibit responses similar to baseline responses.</description>

    <description>Baclofen will be dispensed in pill form.  Baclofen will be prescribed at 20 mg 4 times per day.  Each baclofen pill will be 10 mg. Thus, 2 pills will be taken at each scheduled dose for a total of 8 pills a day over a period of 8 weeks. In this way, the titration schedule, taper and potential dose reductions can be managed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Physically healthy, as determined by a comprehensive physical examination and
             approval of the study physician males or females who smoke cigarettes, ages 18-60.

          -  Smoke ≥ 6 cigarettes per day for at least 6 months prior to study start date.

          -  Females must be non-pregnant, non-lactating and either be of non-childbearing
             potential (i.e. sterilized via hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation or at least 1
             year post-menopausal) or of child bearing potential but practicing a medically
             acceptable method of birth control. Examples of medically acceptable methods for this
             protocol include barrier (diaphragm or condom) with spermicide, an intrauterine
             device (IUD), the Nuvaring, oral contraceptives, levonorgestrel implant, hormonal
             injection or complete abstinence.

          -  Provide voluntary informed consent.

          -  Must be able to read. [Subjects are required to be able to read because there are
             several self-administered measures that they must read, understand and provide
             written answers.]

          -  Intelligence quotient of ≥ 80.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of head trauma or injury causing loss of consciousness, lasting more than
             five (5) minutes or associated with skull fracture or inter-cranial bleeding or
             abnormal MRI.

          -  Current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV (DSM-IV) Axis I diagnoses other than
             nicotine dependence.

          -  Presence of magnetically active irremovable prosthetics, plates, pins, permanent
             retainer, bullets, etc. (unless a radiologist confirms that it's presence is
             unproblematic).  An x-ray may be obtained to determine eligibility given the
             possibility of a foreign body.

          -  History of psychosis.

          -  Claustrophobia or other medical condition preventing subject from lying in the MRI
             for approximately one (1) hour.

          -  Current diagnosis of or treatment within the last 3 months for alcohol dependence.

          -  Current use of any smoking cessation treatments such as Zyban, Chantix, Wellbutrin,
             patch, gum, inhaler, electronic cigarettes, herbal preparations.

          -  Vision problems that cannot be corrected with glasses.

          -  Weight exceeding 300 pounds [Imaging data acquisition is impaired with high weight
             individuals].

          -  History of stroke.
