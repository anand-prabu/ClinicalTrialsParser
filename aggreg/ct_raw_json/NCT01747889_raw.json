The Thopaz system is already in clinical use in the United States\n      and throughout the world. As such, this study is not evaluating safety or efficacy of this\n      system both of which have already been demonstrated. This study's primary aim is to\n      determine whether the use of a digital chest drainage system compared with a traditional\n      system affects duration of chest drainage and length of hospital stay.\n\n      Furthermore, we aim to determine whether the use of a digital chest drainage system compared\n      with a traditional system increases the total distance of ambulation in the first 48 hours\n      after thoracic surgery and affects overall patient satisfaction in the peri-operative\n      period.\n\n      Finally, we want to determine whether the aforementioned outcomes relative to the chest tube\n      drainage systems differ in different parts of the world."

Then, suction will be decreased to -8 cmH2O (so-called water seal).  At that time, management of chest tube drainage and decision for chest tube removal will be dictated by clinical signs, symptoms, and surgeon preference following the standard clinical algorithm for post-operative care of general thoracic patients",
