            "textblock": "General anesthesia and morphine based pain medicine analgesia has been the mainstay of\n      practice in breast cancer surgery at Women's College Hospital. There is evidence to suggest\n      that patients have a better recovery, with less pain and nausea and vomiting when nerve\n      blocks or freezing of nerves are given in addition to a general anesthetic. Specifically for\n      breast cancer surgery, evidence has suggested that the use of paravertebral blocks provide\n      patients with a better quality of recovery after surgery. The aim of this study is to\n      examine whether patients who receive the nerve blocks using an ultrasound machine in\n      addition to general anesthesia have a better quality of recovery than patients who receive a\n      general anesthetic alone. The hypothesis is that patients receiving ultrasound-guided\n      paravertebral blocks (PVB) with propofol-based general anesthesia (GA) will have a better\n      quality of recovery than patients receiving general anesthesia-opioid-analgesia. Quality of\n      recovery will be assessed using a modification of the QoR-27, a validated instrument to\n      assess postoperative recovery in an ambulatory surgical population."
