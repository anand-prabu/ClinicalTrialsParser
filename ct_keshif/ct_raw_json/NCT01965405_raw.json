Phase 1 will last 4 weeks, and will involve brief intervention to help\n      participants stop smoking. For phase 2, participants will be assigned to different study\n      arms depending on whether they are Responders (reduced their smoking) or Non-responders\n      (continued to smoke).\n\n        1. Phase 1:  We hypothesize that brief high-magnitude prize contingency management will\n           result in greater reduction in smoking than standard of care alone.\n\n        2. Phase 2a:  We hypothesize that non-responders who are assigned to contingency\n           management will be more likely to reduce their smoking throughout treatment and to\n           abstain from smoking at all follow-up points.\n\n        3. Phase 2b: We hypothesize that responders who are assigned to monitoring and\n           low-magnitude prize contingency management will be more likely to maintain their\n           reduced or abstinent smoking status at all follow-up time-points."
