Investigators at multiple\n      centers caring for patients with CGD in North America and 3 centers in Europe will\n      participate. Patients with CGD will have been treated according to institutional practice\n      and protocols. Investigators will enroll these patients as subjects in this protocol. This\n      study will investigate which patients benefit most from HCT, and what types of transplants\n      are optimal for patients with CGD, in the context of overall outcomes in CGD patients with\n      and without transplant."
