The treatment of phantom limb pain is still challenging. Despite many\n      different pharmacological interventions, the outcomes on the longer-term are in many cases\n      not satisfying. Alternative, non-pharmacological interventions, such as mirror therapy, are\n      gaining increased recognition in the treatment of phantom limb pain. In this context,\n      telerehabilitation plays an important role to support long-term self-management and autonomy\n      of these patients.\n\n      In the developmental phase of the project, a user-centred design is applied. Patients as\n      well as physical and occupational therapists are interviewed concerning their preferences\n      and needs with respect to the design and content of the telerehabilitation. Additionally,\n      two focus groups with each five participants will be conducted. Subsequently, a prototype of\n      the telerehabilitation will be developed based on user preferences, available evidence,\n      expert opinion and already existing systems. This prototype will be tested on its usability\n      and technical performance in phase three using the thinking-aloud-method and data logging.\n      Accordingly, a multicenter, randomized controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the\n      cost-effectiveness of the telerehabilitation."

Sufficient cognitive, communicative and motor functions to be able to use the\n             telerehabilitation service, to concentrate for at least 15 minutes on the mirror\n             image and to follow instructions and questionnaires; this is based on clinical\n             judgment of recruiting physicians or therapists.\n\n             Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          4. Duration of inpatient rehabilitation not long enough to ensure the 4-week clinical\n             intervention phase.\n\n          5. Bilateral amputation, severe co-morbidity (e.g. stroke) or pain affecting the intact\n             limb; this prevents engagement in the prescribed exercise programs of the study.\n\n          6. Severe psychiatric disorders that preclude patients from participating in the trial.\n\n          7. Intensive course of mirror therapy in the past (> 6 treatments during the last three\n             months)."
