            "textblock": "Thyroid cancer is typically treated with surgery, radiation or a combination of both.\n      Following surgical removal of thyroid tissue patients receive thyroid hormone replacement\n      medication.  In addition patients undergo tests to determine the status of the disease.  One\n      of the tests conducted is a whole body scan using radioactive iodine to detect and locate\n      any remaining cancerous thyroid tissue.\n\n      Thyroid tissue uses iodine to make thyroid hormones (T3 and T4).  In order for a radioiodine\n      scan to work, cancerous thyroid tissue must be \"hungry\" for iodine.  Thyroid stimulating\n      hormone (TSH) produced in the pituitary gland is responsible for making thyroid tissue\n      \"hungry\" for iodine.   Once thyroid tissue absorbs the radioactive iodine it will be clearly\n      visible on the scan and can be located for removal.   However, thyroid hormone replacement\n      medication tends to lower the activity of the pituitary gland and the amount of naturally\n      produced TSH.   So it is necessary to stop thyroid hormone replacement to increase TSH.  A\n      problem arises when there is a lack of thyroid hormone replacement causing patients to\n      experience hypothyroidism.  This condition is associated with unpleasant physical and\n      emotional symptoms.\n\n      TSH has been created in a laboratory and called Thyrogen.  It is basically the same as the\n      TSH produced in the human pituitary gland.  However, Thyrogen increases the level of TSH in\n      the body without having to stop thyroid replacement medication.  Therefore patients will not\n      experience hypothyroidism while preparing for a radioactive iodine scan.\n\n      The objective of this study is to compare the activity of radioiodine (131I) in patients\n      taking Thyrogen with normal thyroid activity versus patients with hypothyroid activity after\n      thyroid replacement medication is withdrawn.  In addition the study will provide information\n      on how radioactive iodine is eliminated from the body.  The study will help researchers\n      understand how to give Thyrogen and radioiodine for purposes of scanning and  therapeutic\n      ablation (the destruction of  function) of cancerous thyroid tissue.\n\n      The study will accept patients with non-medullary thyroid cancer who are preparing for\n      ablation therapy.  The patients will be placed in one of two groups.  Group one will receive\n      Thyrogen in 2 doses 24 hours apart.  Group two will receive Thyrogen in 3 doses 72 hours\n      apart.  The patients will undergo two 131I whole body scans: one after Thyrogen while taking\n      thyroid hormone suppressive and the second after withdrawal from thyroid hormone.  131I\n      ablative therapy will be given under hypothyroid conditions at the completion of the study."
