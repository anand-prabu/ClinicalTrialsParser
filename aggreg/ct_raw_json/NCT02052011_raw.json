The CPC cohort represents\n      a unique population with unrecognized microvascular disease and is often only accessible\n      through the ED. We propose a one-year pilot study to understand the mechanisms of angina\n      relief by Ranolazine (n=20) in patients with microvessel disease in the ED population as\n      compared to controls (n=10) at baseline and at 1-month. In addition, changes in pain scores\n      and function as measured by Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ), recidivism and costs will be\n      measured and correlated with changes in coronary flow reserve (CFR). Serum samples will be\n      obtained and banked for future marker analysis as intermediate surrogates of outcomes.\n\n      Primary aim: To compare changes in coronary flow reserve as measured by cardiac PET in\n      patients receiving Ranolazine versus controls.\n\n      Secondary aim: To determine if Ranolazine changes Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) scores\n      in association with changes in Coronary Flow Reserve (CFR) versus controls.\n\n      Exploratory aim: To compare composite rate of return visits (office, emergency department\n      and hospitalization) for chest pain within 4-weeks of enrollment between patients with and\n      without Ranolazine."
