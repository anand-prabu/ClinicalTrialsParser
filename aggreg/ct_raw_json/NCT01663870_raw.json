HealthATM is a website that is\n           designed to provide information and tools to help patients better manage their health.\n           After 10-15 minute session with the website, patient will be asked about how easy the\n           website was to use and other questions about their session.\n\n        -  Patient will complete a short questionnaire at the end of the interview asking about\n           personal characteristics, how involved they are in their health care, and their\n           attitudes towards the HealthATM website. It should take about 5 minutes to complete\n           this questionnaire.\n\n      All interviews will be audiorecorded. All audio recordings will be kept for 5 years and then\n      destroyed. All interview data will be stored in password-protected computers and/or locked\n      file cabinets.  There will be no personal identifying information connected to patient's\n      interview answers.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      All of the study procedures will take place at one visit. The visit should last about 60\n      minutes.\n\n      This is an investigational study.\n\n      Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at LBJ General\n      Hospital.\n\n      Clinic Stakeholders:\n\n      If clinic staff agree to take part in this study, the following tests and procedures will be\n      performed:\n\n        -  Clinic staff will take part in a 60-90 minute focus group session where they will be\n           asked about their feelings about survivorship care plans and if they think web-based\n           eHealth programs would be helpful as tools in breast cancer survivorship.\n\n        -  Clinic staff will be asked about any challenges and barriers they feel are facing the\n           survivorship programs at LBJ.\n\n        -  Clinic staff will use a web-based tool called HealthATM.  HealthATM is a website that\n           provides information and tools to help patients better manage their health.  After a\n           10-15 minute session with the website, they will be asked about how easy the website\n           was to use and other questions about their session.\n\n      All focus group sessions will be audiorecorded.
