  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity stereotactic body
      radiation (SBRT) as consolidation following standard chemoradiation for patients with stage
      III non-small cell lung cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will investigate the potential role of SBRT for patients with stage 3 NSCLC.
      Eligible patients will first have received standard 50.4 Gy chemoradiation. Patients
      entering the study will have the opportunity to receive SBRT as a noninvasive option as
      compared to surgical resection. For patients who are not surgical candidates, SBRT after
      50.4 Gy chemoradiation represents a technique of radiation consolidation that may be more
      effective and less toxic than standard conventional fractionated radiation

          -  Stage III NSCLC according to the AJCC 7th edition staging criteria. Stage II (T1-3N1)
             patient that are deemed medically inoperable are also eligible.

          -  Concurrent chemoradiation to a radiation dose of 50.4 Gy.

          -  residual tumor volume after concurrent chemoradiation that is appropriate for SBRT:

               -  Primary tumor &lt;120cc (approximately 6cm diameter).

               -  Mediastinal/Hilar disease: 1-2 involved regions &lt;60cc (approximately
                  5cmx3cmx3cm)

          -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/uL, platelet ≥ 60,000/uL.

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 2x upper institutional limit of normal (ULN), and AST or ALT ≤5x
             ULN.

          -  ECOG performance status 0 to 2

          -  Minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks.

          -  Age older than 18 years.

          -  Voluntary, signed written informed consent.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test

          -  Men and women of childbearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective
             contraception while on treatment and for at least 1 months thereafter.

        Conditions for Patient Ineligibility

          -  Disease progression during or after standard chemoradiation to 50.4 Gy

          -  Prior thoracic radiation other than the pre-operative radiation not greater than 50.4

          -  Metastatic disease

          -  Uncontrolled severe, intercurrent illness.

          -  Women who are breast-feeding.

          -  No chemotherapy within 2 weeks from the first SBRT treatment.

          -  Concurrent anticancer therapy.

          -  Prior complete resection of all NSCLC.
