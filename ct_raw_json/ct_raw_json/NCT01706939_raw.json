After 3 cycles, the patients\n      will be assessed for clinical, radiographic and pathologic response to TPF. Patients with a\n      clinical or radiographic CR or PR will be randomized on the second phase of this study,\n      where patients will undergo a 2:1 randomization to reduced (5600 cGy) or standard (7000 cGy)\n      dose radiotherapy with weekly Carboplatin. Patients not meeting the response criteria will\n      be treated with standard dose CRT. Patients not completing 3 cycles TPF for reasons of\n      toxicity, progressive disease, choice, or other medical necessity will be treated with\n      standard dose CRT or surgery depending on their primary site and overall medical condition\n      and followed for survival. Toxicity will be assessed by Symptom scores, QOL and SAE\n      monitoring. The primary end point of the trial is equivalent local regional control and PFS\n      at 3 years. Patients will be followed for 5 years."
