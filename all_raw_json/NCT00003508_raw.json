After 3 months, patients with stable or responding disease may\n      continue treatment. Patients achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for at\n      least 8 months beyond CR.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for the second year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
