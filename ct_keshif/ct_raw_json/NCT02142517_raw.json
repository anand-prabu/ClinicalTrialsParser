The incidence of POPF after\n      pancreaticoduodenectomy among different studies, ranging from 5 to 30%.Morbidity and\n      mortality after pancreaticoduodenectomy are usually related to surgical management of the\n      pancreatic stump. The safe pancreatic reconstruction after pancreaticoduodenectomy continues\n      to be a challenge at high volume centers. The variety of reconstruction is a reflection of\n      the lack of ideal one.Duct to mucosa and invagination are two classic PJ techniques. Many\n      studies compared both techniques, but their surgical outcomes still unclear.The aim of the\n      study was to assess the effectiveness and surgical outcomes of both techniques of PJ after\n      pancreaticoduodenectomy."
