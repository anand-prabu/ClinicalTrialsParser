PBM focuses on the treatment of the individual patient and comprises\n      transfusion therapy and drug therapy.  PBM is based on three points: (1) optimization of the\n      (preoperative) red blood cell volume, (2) reduction of diagnostic, therapeutic, or\n      intraoperative blood loss, and (3) increasing individual tolerance towards anemia and\n      accurate blood transfusion triggers.  PBM primarily identifies patients at risk for\n      transfusion and provides a management plan aimed at reducing or eliminating anemia and the\n      need for blood  transfusion donated from someone other than the patient (allogeneic\n      transfusion), thus reducing the risks, blood bank inventory pressures, and the escalating\n      costs associated with transfusion. The implementation of a formal UAB Preoperative Anemia\n      Management Program (PAMP) may help achieve consistent PBM.\n\n      Efforts will be made to coordinate patients' scheduled surgery date and their initial\n      evaluation in the UAB Highlands Hospital Preoperative Assessment, Consultation, and\n      Treatment (HPACT) Clinic, so that their first PACT Clinic visit occurs approximately 14 days\n      prior to the planned total hip replacement or total knee replacement"
