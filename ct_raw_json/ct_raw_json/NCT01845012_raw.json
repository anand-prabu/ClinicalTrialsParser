The main objective of the study is to determine the\n      percentage of success of a procedure of daily hemodialysis at low dialysate flow. All\n      patients treated with conventional hemodialysis, for at least 3 months and clinically\n      stable, can be included in the study. Their 3 months data prior to inclusion is collected\n      retrospectively. These 3 months of conventional hemodialysis are the reference period.\n      Patients are then treated with daily hemodialysis at low dialysate flow for 3 months. During\n      this 3 months period, the same data as during the period of conventional hemodialysis are\n      collected prospectively."
