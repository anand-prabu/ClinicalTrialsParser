Ultrasound (US) guided greater occipital nerve (GON) injections are effective at a\n           novel, proximal C2 location in live, human subjects, measured by improvement in visual\n           analog scale (VAS) pain scores pre-injection compared to VAS scores 30 minutes\n           post-injection, 2-weeks post-injection, and 1-month post-injection .\n\n        2. Ultrasound (US) guided injection of the greater occipital nerve (GON) at a novel, C2\n           location is effective at improvement of both occipital neuralgia and cervicogenic\n           headache demonstrated by improvement in visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores\n           pre-injection compared to VAS scores 30 minutes post-injection, 2-weeks post-injection,\n           and 1-month post-injection. We further hypothesize that the mean improvement in VAS\n           scores at 1-month post injection will be greater than 2 units.\n\n        3. Ultrasound (US) guided injection of the greater occipital nerve (GON) at novel,\n           proximal C2 location in live, human subjects appears safe."
