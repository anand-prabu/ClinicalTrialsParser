    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) receiving
      optimized non-surgical treatment plus surgical realignment of the tibia, or optimized
      non-surgical treatment only. We hypothesize that outcomes assessed at 12 and 24 months
      follow-up will suggest favourable changes in patients undergoing surgical realignment when
      compared to patients receiving non-surgical treatment only.

      This two groups, parallel design randomized controlled trial will compare patients with
      medial compartment knee OA and varus alignment receiving optimized non-surgical treatment
      plus High Tibial Osteotomy (HTO) to similar patients receiving optimized non-surgical
      treatment only. All participants will receive non-surgical treatment that will be
      individualized to the patient and include medications, physiotherapy and nutritional
      seminars. The non-surgical treatment will include supervised physiotherapy and nutritional
      seminars once per week for 12 weeks, will be accompanied and followed by a home program, and
      follow-up appointments for potential modification every three months for the duration of the
      study. Participants randomized to surgery will also undergo medial opening wedge HTO after
      12 weeks of optimized non-surgical treatment. Both groups will follow the same schedule of
      clinic visits throughout the 24 month follow-up period. MRI-derived measures of articular
      cartilage morphology, biological markers of articular cartilage degradation and synthesis,
      gait biomechanics and patient-reported outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 12 and 24
      months follow-up.

    <description>The optimized non-surgical treatment program consists of medications, physiotherapy and nutritional seminars. The 12-week program will include an assessment by a primary care physician, physiotherapist and orthopaedic surgeon, one supervised physiotherapy session per week, one body recomposition session per week, and a home program. After the 12-week program is completed, patients randomized to this group will undergo a medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy (HTO). They will continue with their home program and will be followed up for 2 years after baseline.</description>
