    <textblock>
      This study investigates the most common major complications that result in unplanned
      additional surgery in patients undergoing vats anatomical resections. Several high-volume
      European centres participate. The purpose is to quantify these major complications, discuss
      the steps that can be taken to prevent these events, how they can be dealt with, be it by
      vats or conversion

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vats lobectomy is becoming the standard of care for early stage lung cancer. Several studies
      have shown feasibility and safety in dedicated centres. Compared to thoracotomy the
      procedure results in at least equal oncologic results and survival, perhaps better.

      Most series do not publish their early experience. They are retrospective and report on
      lobectomies and segmentectomies, excluding the live-saving pneumonectomies. They are
      potentially ignoring the intention-to-treat principle, excluding conversions.

      Based on scarce existing literature and conference worst-case presentations a pattern of the
      most common intraoperative major complications can be drawn In Europe, a large percentage of
      high-volume-centres have now successfully implemented a vats lobectomy program. In this era
      with low-volume-centres switching into vats anatomical resections, it is important to focus
      on potentially life-threatening complications. To be aware of potential hazards is the best
      way to avoid them.
