Inappropriate polypharmacy (i.e. often\n      overprescribing) is one of the major problems in the nursing home population increasing the\n      number of adverse drug reactions, falls, hospital admissions, mortality as well as having an\n      impact on health care utilization. Multidisciplinary medication reviews have a great\n      potential to reduce inappropriate medication use. The purpose of this study is to determine\n      the efficacy of a multidisciplinary medication review model focussing on discontinuing\n      inappropriate medication in a cluster randomized controlled trial in 600 nursing home\n      residents. The primary outcome measure is the difference in proportion of residents who\n      successfully discontinued medication between intervention and control group after four\n      months. Secondary outcome measures will be the drug burden index, adverse drug withdrawal\n      events related to the discontinued medication, death, referral to hospitals and quality of\n      life."
