            "textblock": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. Despite\n      strong evidence that reducing low-density lipoproteins (LDL) with statins successfully\n      lowers CVD risk, physicians under-prescribe statins, physicians fail to intensify treatment\n      when indicated, and more than 50% of patients stop taking statins within one year of \ufb01rst\n      prescription though such therapy typically should be life-long. In this study, we will test\n      the effectiveness of different financial incentives in increasing statin use and reducing\n      LDL cholesterol among patients with poor cholesterol control who are at very high risk for\n      CVD. The application of conceptual approaches from behavioral economics offers considerable\n      promise in advancing health and health care. We will test these approaches among patients at\n      very high risk of CVD at Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates.  Using a 4-arm,\n      cluster-randomized controlled trial, we aim to answer these questions: [1] How does the\n      provision of patient incentives compare to no incentives at all? [2] Is success with patient\n      incentives improved by increasing the financial amounts? [3] Are results sustained after\n      incentives and other interventions are withdrawn?\n\n      Study Objectives and Hypothesis\n\n      Aim 1: To evaluate the effectiveness of varying patient incentives on improvement in LDL\n      cholesterol relative to usual care during a 3-month intervention among patients at high risk\n      of CVD. H1: Each of the incentives will be more effective than usual care in reducing LDL\n      cholesterol.\n\n      Aim 2: To evaluate the relative effectiveness of those intervention arms superior to control\n      in reducing LDL cholesterol. H2: Higher incentive amounts for patients will be more\n      effective than lower incentive amounts.\n\n      Aim 3: To evaluate the impact of each effective intervention in sustaining adherence and\n      reduced LDL after the 3-month intervention period.\n\n      Aim 4: To conduct a rigorous process evaluation to examine why some incentives were more\n      effective than others and to address other factors relevant to broader implementation."
