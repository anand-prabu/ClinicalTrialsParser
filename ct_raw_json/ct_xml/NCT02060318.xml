      Aim: the main aim of this study is to investigate if immune cells (regulatory T-cells, Th17
      cells and other immune cell types) can be used to predict the response or lack of response
      to treatment with Infliximab. If so, characteristics of the immune cells may also unveil the
      mechanisms behind lack of response to Infliximab.

      Design: a prospective, observational study with three arms. In the treatment group, 40
      patients with Crohn's disease about to start Infliximab-treatment are recruited. They have
      blood samples drawn at day 1 before first treatment, after 6 week, and again after 22 weeks
      of treatment. 12 healthy volunteers and 12 Crohn disease patients with low disease activity
      and no Infliximab treatment are the control groups. Controls are only investigated once. All
      treatment and follow-up are according to national guidelines, and data from this study is
      not used by the clinicians.

      Methods: the number of regulatory T-cells and pro-inflammatory T-cells (Th17 cells) is
      investigated using flow cytometry. From plasma and serum samples, various proteins
      (biomarkers), such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and tumour necrosis factor
      alpha (TNF-alpha), are measured using immunoassays. From frozen immune cells, intracellular
      signaling pathways (e.g. the TGF-beta pathway) are investigated at a later time point also
      by flow cytometry. Patient data (demographics and medical history) are extracted from
      various registries.
