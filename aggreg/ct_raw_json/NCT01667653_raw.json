Following baseline visit at the day of randomization,\n      treatment with Augmentin 875mg for 7 days will be given. Concurrently and after antibiotic\n      treatment subjects will also receive the study treatment, either probiotic or placebo. Daily\n      Bowel Habit Diary will be completed by the subjects. The subjects will be asked to collect\n      fecal samples for microbiological examination. The primary objective of the study is to\n      evaluate the maintenance of intestinal microbiota composition during antibiotic treatment\n      with Augmentin 875mg. Secondary objectives will be to evaluate the reduction in side effects\n      associated with antibiotic use."
