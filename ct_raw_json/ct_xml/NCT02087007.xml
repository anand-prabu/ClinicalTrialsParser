      A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-controlled, Parallel group, Therapeutic
      confirmatory Study.

      The subject who has at least one episode of chest pain weekly and at least two episodes of
      chest pain during last week despite Amlodipine 5mg qd taking during 2 weeks will have
      treatment of Pletaal(Cilostazol) or Placebo for 4 weeks. Pletaal(Cilostazol) is taken 100mg
      oral tablets bid during 2 weeks after dosing of Pletaal(Cilostazol) 50mg oral tablets bid
      during 2 weeks. Placebo of Pletaal(Cilostazol) is used as the control medication.
