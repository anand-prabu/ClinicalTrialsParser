Nevertheless, the evidence of a possible\n      neuroprotective action of exercise in PD has been obscured by the facts that all studies\n      were performed in patients in different disease stages and under a variety of\n      pharmacological treatments. Our objective is to test whether a multidisciplinary intensive\n      rehabilitation treatment (MIRT) slowed down the progression of the disease in PD \"de novo\"\n      patients, all treated with Rotigotine, in a randomized controlled study with a 18 months\n      follow-up.\n\n      40 Patients at the initial stages of PD (H&Y stages 1,5-2) treated only with Rotigotine will\n      be enrolled and randomly assigne into two groups. Patients in group 1 (20 subjects) will be\n      undergone 2 MIRT cycle (at T0 and T3). MIRT consist of a 4-week cycle of physiotherapy that\n      entailed three daily sessions 5 days a week (Frazzitta G. et al., Neurorehabilitation [30]\n      2012, 295-301). Patients in Group 2 (20 subjects) will continue with drug therapy alone.\n\n      For the group 1, Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) II, UPDRS III, six-minute\n      walking test (6MWT), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Timed-up-and-go test (TUG), comfortable and\n      fast gait speed, Self-assessment Parkinson's disease disability scale and L-dopa equivalents\n      will be assessed at Baseline T0, T1 (discharge after the first MIRT cycle), T2 (control at 6\n      months after discharge), T3 (hospitalization for second MIRT cycle), T4 (discharge after the\n      second MIRT cycle) and T5 (end of the protocol, 18 months); For the group 2,  UPDRS II,\n      UPDRS III, six-minute walking test (6MWT), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Timed-up-and-go test\n      (TUG), confortable and fast gait speed, Self-assessment Parkinson's disease disability scale\n      and L-dopa equivalents will be assessed at Baseline T0, T1 (check-up at 6 months), T2\n      (check-up at 12 months), T3 (check-up at 18 months)."
