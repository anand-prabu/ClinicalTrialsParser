If the patient has not achieved a partial or complete\n      response after 3-4 months of treatment, the investigator may discontinue treatment. Patients\n      with stable disease may continue to receive treatment until disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity is observed.\n\n      Tumors are measured every 4 months during the first 2 years, then every 6 months during\n      years 3 and 4, and yearly during years 5 and 6.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
