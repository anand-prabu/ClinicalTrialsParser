  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of paclitaxel-coated balloon
      catheter to prevent restenosis after PTA (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty) of
      hemodialysis access (HA) in comparison with the uncoated PTA balloon catheter.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Canada, there are over 20,000 patients with chronic end-stage renal disease (ESRD)on
      long-term hemodialysis and the number is increasing rapidly.The creation of hemodialysis
      access (HA) (also called &quot;lifeline&quot; for dialysis patients) has become the most common type
      of vascular surgery. These HA are frequently complicated by dysfunction after their creation
      mainly due to neointimal hyperplastic stenosis (&gt; 60% at one year). PTA is an established
      cornerstone method of treating stenotic lesions because of its minimally invasive
      percutaneous nature and widespread availability.Although PTA has a high initial success
      rate,narrowing will often recur in 2-3 months hence requiring further interventions. There
      are currently no durable therapies for the prevention or treatment of HA dysfunction
      restenosis after PTA.

      Recently drug eluting balloon (DEB) with paclitaxel have repeatedly demonstrated their
      effectiveness to prevent restenosis due to intimal proliferation in the coronary and
      peripheral arterial systems. The investigators believe that the DEB with paclitaxel will
      significantly decrease the HA restenosis rate at the treated site and therefore will improve
      the management of HA failures.
