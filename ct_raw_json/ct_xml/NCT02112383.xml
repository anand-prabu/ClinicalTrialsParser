  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Procrastination is defined as a voluntarily delay of an intended course of action despite
      expecting to be worse-off for the delay, and is considered a persistent behavior pattern
      that can result in major psychological suffering. About one-fifth of the adult population
      and half of the student population are presumed having substantial difficulties due to
      recurrent procrastination in their everyday life. However, chronic and severe
      procrastinators seldom receive adequate care due to preconceptions and the lack of
      understanding regarding procrastination and the treatment interventions that are assumed
      beneficial. Cognitive behavior therapy is often deemed treatment of choice, although the
      evidence supporting its use is scarce, and only one randomized controlled trial has been
      performed. The primary aim of the current study is therefore to test the efficacy of
      cognitive behavior therapy delivered as either a group intervention or via the Internet.
      Participants will consist of students recruited through the Student Health Centre at
      Karolinska Institutet. A randomized controlled trial with a sample size of 100 participants
      divided into two conditions will be employed; a ten week Internet-based cognitive behavior
      therapy intervention, and an eight week group intervention based on cognitive behavior
      therapy. The current study is believed to result in two important findings. First, different
      interventions inherent in cognitive behavior therapy are assumed to be helpful for people
      suffering from problems caused by procrastination. Second, both a group intervention and an
      Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy intervention are presumed suitable for
      administering treatment for procrastination, which is considered highly important as the
      availability of adequate care is limited, particularly among students. The current study
      will increase the knowledge regarding the efficacy of different treatments of
      procrastination, as well as enhance the overall comprehension of the difficulties related to
      dilatory behavior.

    <description>For participants in the group intervention condition, the modules from a self-help treatment for procrastination will be delivered at four consecutive three-hour sessions at the Student Health Centre at Karolinska Institutet, with approximately two modules given at each session. The sessions will be spaced two weeks apart, during which participants are instructed to complete assignments related to the modules that were in focus of the previous session, e.g., goal-setting, time management, and behavioral experiments, which they are advised to present and discuss with the other participants.</description>

    <description>For participants in the Internet-based condition, the modules from a self-help treatment for procrastination will be distributed weekly during the treatment period, with one module given each week, i.e., ten weeks. In comparison to the group condition, participants will not receive a therapist contact or attend any sessions. In addition, the participants are expected to complete both the reading material and the assignments that are included in each module.</description>
