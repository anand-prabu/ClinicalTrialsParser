Patients in Kenya who agree to be in this study will\n      let the resesarchers look at their medical record, follow their normal cancer care, and have\n      blood drawn to look at different proteins and viruses.  Researchers would also like to look\n      at part of the original tumor that was taken out of each patient.  Some of these samples\n      will be stored at Kenyatta National Hospital and research will be done on them later.  This\n      study does not involve any change in treatment, but only allows the study team to follow how\n      a patient in Kenya with lymphoma is treated."

This is the current standard of practice in\n        Kenya.]\n\n          -  All subjects must receive some form of systemic chemotherapy.  Subjects not receiving\n             chemotherapy of any kind are not eligible. Subjects must not have had any prior\n             chemotherapy for lymphoma.\n\n          -  Subjects may have received prior radiotherapy for localized stage I or stage II\n             disease that is clearly documented to have progressed beyond initial radiotherapy\n             ports.\n\n          -  All subjects must give written informed consent to participate on study.  In Kenya, a\n             child is considered < 18 years of age and an adult \u2265 18 years of age.  All children\n             will have their parental or legal guardian provide consent..  Children between the\n             ages of 7 and < 18 years old should be given the opportunity to provide their assent.\n              For children between the ages of 7 and 11 years old this should be done using the\n             parental consent form assent statement. For children > 11 years old assent should be\n             documented using the IRB approved assent form.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Subjects who do not fulfill the criteria as listed in Sections 3.1.1 through 3.1.4\n             are ineligible.\n\n          -  Subjects who received prior chemotherapy (i.e., first-line treatment) or are not\n             receiving any chemotherapy for their non-Hodgkin's (NHL) or Hodgkin's lymphoma (HD)\n             are ineligible."
