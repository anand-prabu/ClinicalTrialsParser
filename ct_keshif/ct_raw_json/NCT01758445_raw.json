That comparison demonstrated a benefit form proton planning for patients with\n      non-metastatic breast cancer requiring complex, loco-regional, postoperative radiotherapy.1\n      The advantages of PT were improved target coverage compared to standard photon irradiation\n      and reduced dose to heart, lungs and contralateral breast.\n\n      The study goal is to demonstrate a \"meaningful benefit\" of proton therapy for women with\n      loco-regionally advanced breast cancer. The main clinical endpoints of this trial are the\n      reduction of cardiac morbidity and mortality (coronary artery disease, myocardial\n      infarction, cardiac insufficiency) and the reduction of contralateral, second breast cancer.\n      Both adverse events are presently associated with external beam photon therapy. Both goals\n      require longitudinal follow-up of minimum 5-10 years.  Despite the logistical challenges of\n      long term follow-up, the effort is needed in view of the compelling preclinical evidence of\n      dose avoidance or even absence of radiation dose to heart and contralateral breast uniquely\n      accomplishable by protons only."

Must have had surgical treatment of the breast - either mastectomy or breast\n             preserving surgery, such as lumpectomy. Re-excision of surgical margins is permitted.\n\n          7.

(If surgical margins are rendered free of disease by\n             re-excision, the patient is eligible).\n\n          4. Breast size exceeding the technical limitation of daily set-up reproducibility. This\n             may be center-specific and will be assessed at the discretion of the treating center.\n\n          5. Women with post-surgical temporary breast expanders will require individual\n             assessment. Depending on the manufacturing product and other treatment\n             planning-specific details the patient may be eligible or may be deemed ineligible, as\n             determined by treating investigator.\n\n          6. Prior history of breast cancer.\n\n          7. Prior radiation to the breast or thorax.\n\n          8.

Pregnancy or lactation at the time of proposed study entry. Women of reproductive\n             potential must agree to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception during\n             therapy such as an intrauterine device or condom with spermicide. (Note: Women of\n             childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 3 weeks of\n             study registration).\n\n         10.

Prior history of non-breast malignancies unless they have been disease free for 5 or\n             more years and are deemed by their physician to be at low risk for recurrence.\n             Further, patients who have the following cancers treated within the prior 5 years are\n             permitted:  carcinoma in situ of the cervix, carcinoma in situ of the colon, melanoma\n             in situ, basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin."
