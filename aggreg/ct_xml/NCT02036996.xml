  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to collect heart rate, respiration data and motion data of
      patients admitted to sleep lab and to determine the current accuracy level of the EarlySense
      system vs. the standard system, and predicate device for EarlySense (Embla) used in sleep
      lab in monitoring heart rate and respiration rates monitors (ECG, respiratory belts,
      oximeter) that are currently used in the sleep lab among different population (Obese,
      patients with or without apnea, patients with or without arrhythmia).  It is emphasized that
      no interpretations or clinical decisions will be made based on data received from the ES
      study device.

      The study objective is to collect heart rate,  respiration rate and motion data of patients
      admitted to sleep lab and to determine the  accuracy level of the EarlySense system vs. the
      monitors used in sleep lab (e.g., Polysomnography, respiratory belts, ECG, etc..) . Data
      regarding sleep condition, scoring and quality of sleep and in and out of bed status,
      patient turns will also be collected and compared to data collected by EarlySense
      contactless monitor. Different patient population will be monitored including obese,
      morbidly obese, patients with or without obstructive/central apnea, patients with or without
      arrhythmia as well as healthy population who arrive to sleep lab for general evaluation will
      be monitored
