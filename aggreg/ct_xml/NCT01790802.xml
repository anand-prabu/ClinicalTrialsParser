      LEAD is a patient and assessor masked, multi-centre randomized controlled exploratory
      medical device clinical investigation of 240 participants (1:1 active to shame laser
      procedure) designed to assess the effectiveness of nanosecond laser treatment of patients
      with early high-risk AMD.

      No less than 240 participants will be randomized into either active laser treatment or sham
      laser procedure groups at a ratio of 1:1. Patient eligibility based on ocular inclusion
      criteria will be evaluated using measures of vision, fundus photography, OCT imaging, and
      macular integrity (MAIA) performed during the qualifying period. Fundus images and MAIA
      results will be sent to a coordinating centre where these will be reviewed to confirm
      eligibility based on lesion attributes and the criteria specified in the protocol. Following
      confirmation of eligibility by the coordinating centre, participants whom satisfy all the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria can be randomized. Allocation to treatment group will be
      stratified by smoking status. All participants will receive either active laser treatment or
      sham laser procedure at the treatment visit and be assessed for retreatment on a semi-annual
      basis. All participants will be contacted by telephone at 1 week and present for clinical
      examination visits at 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or females from 50 to 95 years of age at the time of consent

          -  Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 6/12 (20/40) or better in each eye.

          -  Bilateral high-risk early AMD: At least one druse ≥125um within an inner macular zone
             (a circle with a radius of 1500 microns centred on the fovea)  with or without
             pigment.

          -  A MAIA static threshold sensitivity less than 25 dB at any point, within a customized
             grid, as measured using a Macular Integrity Assessment (MAIA) device), at the same
             location of the one eye on two separate occasions.

          -  Pupil dilation of a least  5 mm in each eye

          -  Fundus photographs, OCT and FAF images of adequate quality as assessed by the LEAD
             Image Reading Centre.

          -  Ability and willingness to consent, and be randomized, to the 2RT active or sham
             laser treatment, and all qualification and follow-up phases of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any evidence of definite geographic atrophy within the macula (a circle with a radius
             of 3000 microns centred on the fovea). Geographic atrophy is defined as an area of
             partial or complete depigmentation of the RPE in the fundus photographs that has at
             least 2 of the following 3 characteristics (i) roughly round or oval shape, (ii)
             sharp margins, and (iii) visibility of underlying large choroidal vessels25

          -  Any black (hypofluorescent) area of FAF consistent with GA (roughly round or oval
             shape, sharp margins), and corroborated on colour photography as a patch of
             hypopigmentation.

          -  Any evidence of 'preclinical atrophy' as determined on OCT: loss of the outer retina
             (RPE and photoreceptors on the cube scan (Spectralis OCT) (49 horizontal B scans, 120
             µm apart over a 20 x 20 degree scan). This covers approximately 6 x 6 mm in an
             emmetropic eye (N.B., peri-papillary atrophy (PPA) further than 1500 microns from the

          -  Current CNV, or past evidence of CNV in either eye.

          -  Any other experimental treatment for AMD, excluding dietary supplements, received in
             the past 12 months or thought likely to chronically change the course of the
             participant's retinal disease.

          -  Any OCT showing evidence of intraretinal fluid, or subretinal fluid for which CNV
             cannot be excluded as a cause.

          -  A subfoveal pigment epithelial detachment/drusenoid detachment greater than 1000
             microns in diameter.

          -  Other macular disease with subretinal deposits not typical of AMD, e.g., Malattia
             Leventinese, Sorsby fundus dystrophy,  Alports syndrome

          -  Ocular disease in either eye, other than AMD, which significantly compromises the
             ability to treat or visualize the fundus or would compromise the ability to assess
             any effect following laser application including; Diabetic retinopathy (unless
             limited to fewer than 10 microaneurysms and/or small retinal hemorrhages, without
             retinal thickening on OCT) Angioid streaks, Central serous choroidopathy, Optic
             atrophy, Epiretinal membrane involving the macula, Pigmentary abnormalities 0f the
             retina atypical of AMD (e.g., myopia, pattern dystrophy or chronic central serous
             retinopathy), Myopic crescent wider than 50% of the longest diameter of the optic
             disc, or closer than 1500 microns to the fovea, Macular hole or pseudohole, Retinal
             vein occlusion, active uveitis, presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, Choroidal
             naevus within 2 DD of the fovea associated with depigmentation or overlying drusen,
             if these drusen are used to determine eligibility. Amblyopia in either eye even if
             BCVA is better than 6/12 (20/40).

          -  Known allergic hypersensitivity to fluorescein.

          -  Previous retinal or other ocular surgical procedures, the effects of which may now or
             in the future complicate assessment of the progression of AMD.

          -  Requirement for any systemic or ocular medication known to be toxic to the retina,
             such as: Deferoxamine, Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquinil), Chlorpromazine,
             Phenothiazines, Ethambutol

          -  Any serious systemic disease that will preclude a 3 year survival and regular
             attendance for follow up.

          -  Sensitivity to contact lens application.

             disc/nerve fibre layer defects suggestive of glaucoma).
