            "textblock": "Historically, degradation of balance control in older adults has been attributed to\n      impairments of the motor and/or sensory systems. As a result, therapy has focused on motor\n      and sensory impairments. However, evidence suggests that an impaired ability to allocate\n      attentional resources to balance during dual-task situations is a powerful predictor of\n      falls. Despite this fact, few studies have examined whether interventions can improve older\n      adults' dual-task ability. The goal of this study is to develop effective interventions to\n      improve ability to allocate attention to balance and gait under dual-task conditions.\n\n      Older adults (n = 44) who have been referred to physical therapy (PT) for gait or balance\n      impairments who have dual-task impairment will be randomized to receive either standard\n      balance rehabilitation or balance rehabilitation with dual-task practice. Following PT,\n      subjects will receive cognitive training (CT), either speed of processing or generalized\n      cognitive training. Primary outcomes are ability to walk while performing four different\n      cognitive tasks of varying difficulty. Assessment will occur at baseline, post-PT, post-CT."
