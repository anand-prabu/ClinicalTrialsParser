    <textblock>
      The objective in 1st phase of this randomized study is to evaluate the efficacy of SME3110
      compared to placebo on change in total score of Japanese version of the Children's
      Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale 10-item for children from baseline to the last
      observation visit in pediatric/adolescent Obsessive Compulsive Disorder subjects in
      short-term (10 weeks) in double blind period.  The safety of SME3110 compared to placebo is
      also evaluated.

      The objective in 2nd phase of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of
      SME3110 in pediatric/adolescent Obsessive Compulsive Disorder subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 1st phase will be conducted in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind manner to
      evaluate the efficacy of SME3110 on change from baseline to the last observation visit in
      Japanese version of the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale 10-item total
      score.  Eligible patients will be allocated in SME3110 group or placebo group with 1:1 ratio
      using the experience of fluvoxamine treatment and age as the stratification factor (dynamic
      allocation).  The 1st phase consists of 5 periods; screening period of 1-2 weeks, forced
      titration dose period of 2 weeks, dose adjustment period of 4 weeks, maintained dose period
      of 4 weeks, and tapering dose period of 0-4 weeks.

      The 2nd phase will be conducted in an open-label manner in patients who completed the 1st
      phase to evaluate long-term safety of SME3110.  The 2nd phase consists of 3 periods; forced
      titration dose period of 2 week, flexible dose period of 50 weeks, and tapering dose period
      of 0-4 weeks.  After the last dose of study drug (including tapering dose period) or the
      early termination visit, subjects will be followed up to 30 days.
