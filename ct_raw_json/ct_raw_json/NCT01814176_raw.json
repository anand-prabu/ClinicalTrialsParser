When achieving a direct line-of-sight to the windpipe is difficult,\n      more force is often applied, resulting in greater patient stress.  A GlideScope video\n      laryngoscope uses a camera and light source to see the windpipe.  This enables the user to\n      see objects that may not be in the direct line-of-sight.  This likely results in less force\n      being required, reducing patient stress.  Because such stresses are often confounded by\n      patient variables, we are comparing the forces required by the direct and video\n      laryngoscopes on patients with at least one risk factor for difficulty, by directly\n      measuring these with special sensors attached to the laryngoscope blades."
