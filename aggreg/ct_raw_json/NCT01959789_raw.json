The aim of this study was to evaluate the tooth sensitivity (TS)\n      risk using a shorter interval between clinical sessions. Methods: In this randomized,\n      single-blind study, 40 young patients with color C2 or darker were selected and randomly\n      divided in two groups. In the 7-day group, two bleaching sessions with a 35% hydrogen\n      peroxide gel (Whiteness HP Blue Calcium - FGM) were performed with a one-week interval and\n      in the 2-day group, the same protocol was performed but with a 2-day interval. TS was\n      recorded on a 0-10 visual analog scale up to 48 h after bleaching. The color evaluation was\n      performed at baseline and 30 days after bleaching with a value-oriented shade guide and a\n      spectrophotometer. The absolute risk of TS (%) was evaluated by Fisher\u00b4s exact. The TS\n      intensity was evaluated by two-way repeated measured ANOVA and color changes (\u0394SGU and \u0394E)\n      were evaluated by Student\u00b4s t-test (alpha = 5%)."
