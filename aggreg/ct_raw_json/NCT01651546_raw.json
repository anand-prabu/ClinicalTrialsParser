Recently, we have validate a new test for predicting the\n      physical and cognitive abilities to practice CISC named \"PP-Test\". Meanwhile, psychological\n      factors are not explored in this test. To our knowledge, no study has been conducted in\n      order to demonstrate in a prospective trial, which kind of psychological barriers can exist.\n      Likewise it would be interesting to create a new test assessing the psychological\n      \"acceptance\" of the patients to CISC before learning (I-CAT).  Based on the results of this\n      self-assessment test, the specific nurse could then change her speech by playing down the\n      importance of some fear and anxiety described by the patients. The learning of CISC would be\n      facilitated."
