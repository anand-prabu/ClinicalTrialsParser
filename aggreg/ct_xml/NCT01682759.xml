During the double-blind treatment period, glimepiride can be up-titrated, as appropriate, to a maximum total daily dose of 6 mg/day. Throughout the trial, down-titration of glimepiride may also occur based upon the participant's glucose measurements and clinical symptoms of hypoglycemia.</description>
