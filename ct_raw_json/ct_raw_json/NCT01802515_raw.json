As the next step, the\n      investigators will evaluate the safety and tolerability of atomoxetine in a small clinical\n      trial with cocaine users. If atomoxetine is found to be promising in this study and\n      sufficiently powered, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies will be proposed."

The study will have 3 phases: 1) a oneto\n      two week- methadone-induction phase; 2) an 8-week \"treatment\" phase; and 3) 1 week\n      atomoxetine taper and  about a 4-week methadone \"taper and detoxification or transfer\"\n      phase. Subjects will be randomized to three treatment arms: 40 mg (n=15) atomoxetine, or 80\n      mg (n=15) atomoxetine, or placebo (n=15). During the methadone induction phase, subjects\n      will be stabilized on methadone. During induction onto methadone, participants will be\n      administered increasing doses of methadone starting at 30 mg daily, and this dose will be\n      increased for stabilization of opiate withdrawal symptoms from 40 mg up to 140  mg depending\n      on individual need. Based on the clinic schedule between 1 to 2 weeks after methadone\n      treatment is initiated , atomoxetine treatment will be started at 40 mg/day. For those\n      assigned to 80 mg of atomoxetine, the dose will be titrated up to 80 mg/day on the second\n      week of treatment phase. At the end of the treatment-phase, subjects will undergo\n      detoxification from methadone over a 4-week period based on an individual's needs, and they\n      will concurrently be tapered off atomoxetine. All participants will receive a weekly\n      one-hour of individual psychotherapy (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) with experienced\n      clinicians specifically trained to deliver the therapy, and who will receive ongoing\n      supervision."
