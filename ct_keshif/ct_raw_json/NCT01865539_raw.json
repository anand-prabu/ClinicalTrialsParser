            "textblock": "Specific Aim 1: Utilizing a gold standard sham controlled randomized trial design, we will\n      evaluate the change in pain, back related disability and quality of life in Veterans with\n      CLBP who utilize either a custom foot orthotic or a sham orthotic.\n\n      As part of this aim the investigators will build on the teams strength of recruiting and\n      enrolling Veteran's with CLBP into a randomized trial. The investigators will collect\n      baseline pain and disability measures utilizing validated tools. Once the patients are\n      enrolled, utilizing the \"gold standard\" placebo controlled design the investigators will\n      randomize patients to receive either a custom foot orthotic or a sham orthotic. The Veterans\n      will then be assessed at 5, 12 and 24-weeks post baseline to evaluate differences in pain\n      and disability. Based on previous studies on the effectiveness of custom foot orthotics the\n      investigators hypothesize that that Veteran's who receive the custom orthotic will\n      experience less pain and disability as compared to those who receive the sham orthotics.\n\n      Specific Aim 2: To evaluate baseline characteristics of Veterans with CLBP predictive of\n      responsiveness to custom foot orthotics including age, BMI, psychosocial characteristics and\n      arch classification.\n\n      Focusing on the Veterans who receive the custom foot orthotic, the investigators next\n      examine the important characteristics that may predict those Veterans who are most likely to\n      benefit from wearing custom foot orthotics. Assessing potential confounders or facilitators\n      of effectiveness of the custom foot orthotic will allow the investigators to best describe\n      potential mechanisms of responsiveness.  The investigators have chosen previously described\n      confounders to responsiveness to treatment of CLBP, specifically age, body mass index and\n      psychosocial characteristics. This methodology is particularly important in a sham\n      controlled trial to assess if effectiveness or lack of thereof, is a factor of the\n      intervention or from other confounding variables. The investigators have also chosen to\n      evaluate the arch classification based on the measurement of the Veterans arch; again this\n      allows for specific recommendations concerning use of this product. Based on previous\n      studies on the effectiveness of custom foot orthotics in addition to previous studies\n      evaluating CLBP the investigators hypothesize that those Veterans who are older, have a\n      higher BMI and greater fear avoidance belief scores will show less responsiveness to the\n      custom foot orthotics as compared to those younger Veterans who have a lower BMI and lower\n      fear avoidance belief scores. In addition based on previous biomechanical literature, the\n      investigators feel that those Veterans with a lower arch will show the greatest\n      responsiveness to the custom foot orthotic."
