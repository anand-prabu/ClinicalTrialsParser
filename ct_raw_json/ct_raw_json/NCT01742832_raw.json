Both vilazodone and\n      citalopram have been approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder. This research\n      is being done because the researchers want to find out if vilazodone works in reducing the\n      symptoms of depression significantly more than a generic SSRI."

Seventy-two subjects with major depressive disorder\n      who are still symptomatic or report intolerable side effects after a 6-week open-label trial\n      of citalopram 20mg/day ( i.e. who are not classified as responders) will be randomized to\n      receive a higher maximum dose of citalopram (40mg/day) or switch to vilazodone during the\n      randomization phase of the trial for 6 weeks. The hypothesis to be tested is that vilazodone\n      will result in greater rates of treatment response and be better tolerated compared to being\n      titrated up to a higher maximum dose (40mg/day) of citalopram. The proposed study will\n      provide needed data on the efficacy of switching antidepressants when individuals do not\n      fully respond to previous treatment or have intolerable side effects with a generic SSRI."
