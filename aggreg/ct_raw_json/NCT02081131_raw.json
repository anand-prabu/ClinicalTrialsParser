After full assessment, optimization, approval\n      of hospital tumor board with informed consent, those patients selected for surgical therapy\n      with curative intention, will be randomized using computer generated random numbers either\n      into Laparoscopic Pancreatoduodenectomy (LPD) group or Open Pancreatoduodenectomy (OPD)\n      group.\n\n      The details of surgery, blood loss, operating time, conversion if any as well as details of\n      postoperative events & complications if any will be recorded in proforma. Protocols for\n      adjuvant therapy according to pathological stages will be followed. These patients will be\n      reviewed at 1, 3 and 6 months post-surgery.\n\n      The primary outcome will be Complications according to the expanded Accordion Severity\n      Grading System And pathological radicality at time of discharge or death. The secondary\n      outcomes will be Blood Loss, Operating Time, no of lymph nodes retrieved, Hospital Stay at\n      discharge or death. The trial is expected to last for a duration of 2 year."
