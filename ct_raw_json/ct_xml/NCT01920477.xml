  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a rare, chronic, debilitating, and potentially life-threatening
      autoimmune disorder that is characterized by mucocutaneous blisters. Ofatumumab is a novel
      monoclonal antibody (mAb) that specifically binds to the human CD20 antigen, which is
      expressed only in B lymphocytes.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of
      ofatumumab injection for subcutaneous use (ofatumumab SC) 60 milligrams (mg) administered
      once every 12 weeks to subjects with PV.  It is anticipated that with sustained B-cell
      depletion in the presence of ofatumumab SC, and the resultant reduction of pathogenic anti
      Dsg (desmoglein) autoantibodies in PV, that clinical remission of the disease will result.

             subject will be considered to be of childbearing potential; Is of childbearing
             potential, defined as a woman who has functional ovaries, ducts, and a uterus with no
             documented impairment that would cause sterility.  This includes women with
             oligomenorrhea (even severe), women who are perimenopausal, and women who have just
             begun to menstruate.  Subject must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening,
             agree to the consistent and correct use of acceptable methods of contraception during
             heterosexual intercourse, beginning when the subject provides informed consent and
             lasting until 6 months after last dose of investigational product.  Acceptable
             methods of contraception are limited to the oral contraceptives (either combined or
             progesterone only), injectable progesterone, levonorgestrel implants, estrogenic
             vaginal ring, percutaneous contraceptive patches, intrauterine device or intrauterine
             system with a documented failure rate of &lt;1% per year, male partner sterilization
             (vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia) prior to the female subject's entry
             into the study; this male must be the subject's sole partner, double barrier method
             (condom and an occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps] with a vaginal
             spermicidal agent [foam/gel/film/cream/suppository]) and complete abstinence from
             intercourse

             protocol.
