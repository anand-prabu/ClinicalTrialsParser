Three factors seem to\n      affect the night time blood pressure: chronic kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)\n      or the way ambulatory blood pressure is monitored.\n\n      The aim of this study is to analyse the importance of these three factors on nighttime\n      bloodpressure.\n\n      Hypothesis:\n\n      Central 24 hour blood pressure monitoring provides another measure of daily fluctuations in\n      blood pressure than peripheral 24 hour blood pressure monitoring, because measurement is\n      painless and does not interfere with activities during the daytime or night-time sleep\n\n      In chronic kidney disease and OSA the decrease in nocturnal BP is lower than in healthy\n      subjects.\n\n      In chronic kidney disease the decrease in the nocturnal BP is inversely correlated to the\n      severity of OSA,  the severity of kidney disease, and blood pressure during daytime."
