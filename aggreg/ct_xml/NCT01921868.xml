    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn how treatment with acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) will
      affect the hearts of patients with Friedreich's Ataxia as well as how it may affect other
      symptoms of Friedreich's Ataxia such as difficulties with balance, walking, or upper arm
      function.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Outpatients with Friedreich's Ataxia diagnosed by a movement disorder specialist and
             confirmed by genetic testing (of the patient or in a first degree relative of the
             patient). Subject may be non-ambulatory.

          2. Age 18 years to 80 years.

          3. Stable medical condition for 3 months prior to screening.

          4. Women of child-bearing potential must use a reliable method of contraception and must
             provide a negative pregnancy test at entry into the study.

          5. If on cardiac medications such as beta-blockers or ace inhibitors, patients must be
             on a stable dose for 6 months prior to study entry and for the duration of the study.

          6. Friedreich's Ataxia patients with systolic or diastolic dysfunction present on
             echocardiogram and ejection fraction between 35% - 65% at screening.

          7. Subjects with ejection fractions &lt; 50% need to be stable and on optimal heart failure
             therapy for at least 2 weeks prior to screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any unstable illness or concomitant medical condition that, in the investigator's
             opinion, precludes participation in this study. This includes other disorders that
             may affect gait or balance (stroke, arthritis, etc).

          2. Pregnancy or lactation.

          3. Concurrent participation in another clinical study where use of an investigational
             product is used. Subjects who are currently enrolled in the Friedreich's Ataxia
             Clinical Outcome Measures Study at any site will be allowed to enroll in this study
             as well.

          4. Any use of the investigational product within the past 30 days.

          5. Dementia or other psychiatric illness that prevents the patient from giving informed
             consent (Mini Mental Status Exam score less than 25).

          6. Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity.

          7. History of stroke.

          8. Subjects with a history of thyroid disease (hypothyroidism). Clinical laboratory
             evaluations of thyroid stimulating hormone levels taken 3 months prior to the study
             or at screening will be used to confirm absence of current thyroid problems.

          9. Subjects with a history of seizures.

         10. Subjects taking warfarin or acenocoumarol.

         11. Presence of severe renal disease (estimated creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min) or
             hepatic disease (AST or Alanine transaminase(ALT)&gt;2x times normal) (as evidenced by
             labs reported within the past 6 months).

         12. Clinically significantly abnormal white blood cell, hemoglobin or platelet count (as
             evidenced by labs reported within the past 6 months).

         13. Subjects with blood work showing carnitine deficiency (&lt;60nmol/mg total carnitine in
             the urine or &lt;35umol/L total carnitine in the plasma).
