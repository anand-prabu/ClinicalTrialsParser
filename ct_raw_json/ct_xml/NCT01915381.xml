    <description>The Self-Efficacy and Social Support for Activity for persons with Intellectual Disabilities (SE/SS-AID) scales were developed to measure the relationship between self-efficacy, social support, and physical activity participation for those with ID (Peterson et al., 2009).This modified set of SE/SS-AID scales, composed of 23 questions, and was employed in this study. The Self-Efficacy (SE) scale contained six items, with response options of &quot;no, maybe, and yes.&quot; Together, the three Social Support (SS) scales included 17 items, which were divided into three subcategories, including six family items, six staff items, and five peers items. The SS scales have response options of ''no, yes - sometimes, and yes - a lot.''</description>
