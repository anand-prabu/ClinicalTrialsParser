Selecting the\n      acupoints on the specific meridian is the basic principle of acupuncture. Recently, as to\n      the existence of specificity of acupoints on the meridian has been questioned by many\n      researchers. This trial using chronic stable angina pectoris as a carrier, select the\n      acupoints on the hand shao yin heart meridian and hand jue yin pericardium meridian to treat\n      chronic stable angina pectoris. Compared with acupoints on the other meridian and\n      non-acupoints ,aiming to evaluate the efficacy, furthermore ,to confirm the existence of the\n      specificity of acupoints on meridian."
