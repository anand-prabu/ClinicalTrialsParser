Bendamustine is a recently FDA-approved agent with\n      significant activity in CLL/SLL, including significant activity in the setting of\n      fludarabine-refractory disease. However, durations of remission following\n      bendamustine/rituximab combination therapy tend to be short in patients with heavily\n      pre-treated disease or who have already received rituximab.\n\n      The incorporation of a maintenance therapy to overcome the shorter remission durations in\n      this population is a reasonable and feasible option. In considering potential options for\n      treatment of CLL/SLL as a maintenance strategy following induction chemotherapy,\n      lenalidomide and rituximab are appealing options based on their convenient dosing schedules\n      and recent evidence of acceptable toxicity and promising efficacy in combination therapy."
