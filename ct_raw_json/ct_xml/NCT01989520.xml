        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male and/or female volunteers aged 18 to 50 years (inclusive).

          2. Non-smokers or ex-smokers with no smoking history for the last 3 months prior to
             screening.

          3. Body mass index (BMI) ≥18.0 and ≤30.0 kg/m2 calculated from height and weight at
             screening; minimum (min) weight 50 kg and maximum (max) weight 100 kg.

          4. Healthy volunteers with neutrophil counts within the laboratory range at screening.

             -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A definite or suspected personal history of severe allergy, intolerance or
             hypersensitivity or ongoing allergy to drugs with a similar chemical structure or
             class to AZD5069 and/or the excipients, as judged to be clinically relevant by the
             Investigator.

          2. Healthy volunteers who have previously received AZD5069.

          3. Volunteers with latent tuberculosis as suggested by their history and judged by the
             Investigator; confirmatory testing with eg, Quantiferon(R) -TB Gold may be done if
             required.

          4. Volunteers who have received live or live-attenuated vaccine in the 2 weeks prior to
             the first administration of the IP -
