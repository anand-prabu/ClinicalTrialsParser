  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of our project is to see if a 12-week program of Nordic walking is better
      than standard exercise therapy for increasing exercise capacity (measured by how far people
      can walk in 6 minutes) and increasing quality of life (measured by having people fill out
      two questionnaires). We will also see if Nordic walking: improves heart performance
      (measured by heart ultrasound); improves how active people are (measured by an activity
      monitor); increases aerobic fitness (measured by a treadmill test); improves body
      composition (measured by waist size); and reduces hormone levels in the blood.

      A single-site, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial will be conducted (Appendix C) at
      the University of Ottawa Heart Institute (UOHI).  Patients with stable HF referred to
      cardiac rehabilitation will undergo baseline assessment and then be randomly assigned (1:1)
      to either standard exercise therapy (consisting of regular walking and a resistance exercise
      program) or Nordic walking.  Follow-up measures will be taken at the end of intervention (12
      weeks) and after a 14-week no-intervention observation period (26 weeks).  After initial
      randomization to treatment group, participants will be stratified by treatment group and
      randomly assigned to one of three follow-up measurement conditions at 12 weeks:
      echocardiograph and cardiopulmonary test (N=80); cardiopulmonary test only (N=60); or no
      follow-up echocardiograph or cardiopulmonary test (N=76).  The primary outcomes will be: a)
      changes in exercise capacity measured by 6MWT; and b) changes in disease-specific HRQL
      measured by the MLHFQ.  Additional measures will examine the effects of the exercise
      interventions on: cardiac performance; leisure time activity; cardio-respiratory fitness;
      body composition; neurohormonal activation; and generic HRQL

    <description>The MLHFQ is a 21-item scale that measures the effects of HF-related symptoms, functional limitations, and psychological distress on an individual's quality of life.  Participants are asked to indicate using a 6-point, zero to five, Likert scale how much each of 21 factors prevent them from living as they desire.  The total score is the best measure of how HF and treatments impact an individual's quality of life.</description>

    <description>Participants in the Nordic walking group will be provided with walking poles (GymstickTM Nordic Walking Poles, Gymstick International OY, Lahti, Finland) for the duration of the study.  They will attend on-site exercise classes twice weekly for 12 weeks.  The on-site exercise training classes will be one hour in length and include the following components: a 15 minute chair warm-up that excludes resistance exercises; 10-15 minutes of walking with Nordic walking poles for the first 3 weeks, progressing to 30 minutes of continuous walking with poles for the remaining 9 weeks; and 15 minutes of cool down exercises. Participants will be instructed to take the walking poles home and perform 200-400 minutes of Nordic walking per week for 12 weeks</description>

    <description>Individuals assigned to standard exercise therapy will attend on-site exercise classes twice weekly for 12 weeks.  Each on-site class will be one hour in duration and consist of: a 15-minute chair-based warm-up that includes 6-8 upper and lower body resistance training exercises using either hand-held weights or therabands at an intensity of 50-60% of 1- RM with the patient completing one set of 10-12 repetitions progressing to 15 repetitions before increasing the intensity by 5-10%; 10-15 minutes of walking for the first 3 weeks, progressing to 30 minutes of continuous walking for the remaining 9 weeks; and 15 minutes of cool down exercises. A strength training program will be provided to participants and they will be encouraged to do one additional strength training session at home. Participants will also be instructed to complete additional walking sessions at home so that they can accumulate a total of 200-400 minutes of exercise per week.</description>
