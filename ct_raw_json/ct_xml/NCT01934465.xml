  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators propose to assess, retrospectively and prospectively the safety and
      tolerability profile (number of participants with adverse events) of standard chemotherapy
      and anti-angiogenic agent bevacizumab (Avastin) as first line treatment of patients with
      advanced or metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer.

      All treatment schedules that are going to be assessed are considered by the international
      guidelines as standard therapy for patients with advanced or metastatic Non Small Cell Lung
      Cancer.

      In addition investigators propose to assess the compliance of patients to treatment and the
      efficacy of treatment. That means percentage of objective responses, duration of response,
      progression free survival and estimation of overall survival
