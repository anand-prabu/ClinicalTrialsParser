As the\n      sedative which is commonly used in ICU, Midazolam is supposed to change fluid responsiveness\n      for the pharmacological effect of venodilation. However, the hypothesis has not been\n      certified clinically. In this research, the investigators aim to test the hypothesis that\n      Midazolam can increase fluid responsiveness(using passive leg raising test) in septic shock\n      patients."
