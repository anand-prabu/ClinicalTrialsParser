Restrictions in the concurrent use of drug therapy are as follows:\nPatients are, in principle, permitted to continue the drug therapy they were on prior to the enrollment, for the treatment of concurrent illnesses other than Dementia, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or hyperlipidemia.\nFor drugs used in the treatment of dementia, behavior-modifying drugs can be added to the pharmacological regimen of a subject during the course of the study. However, adding a new cognitive enhancer, such as donepezil, memantine, galantamine, rivastigmine, is not permitted while dose adjustment is permitted given that the drug had been in use prior to the initiation of the study."
