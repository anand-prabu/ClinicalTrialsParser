The study will utilize a standard 3+3 design to estimate the MTD [maximum tolerated\n      dose] for vosaroxin administered to subjects with MDS. MTD will be defined as the highest\n      dose level at which no more than 33% of the subjects observed at a given dose level\n      experience a DLT [dose limiting toxicity]. Subjects will be assessed for safety and DLT in\n      the first cycle of vosaroxin. Subjects will be enrolled into the study in cohorts of 3.\n      Three eligible subjects will be enrolled in sequential cohorts at increasing dose levels\n      until at least 1 DLT is observed during the first cycle of vosaroxin therapy. Subjects who\n      receive both doses of vosaroxin will be evaluated for the MTD, DLTs, and safety profile\n      during the first cycle of therapy. Once the MTD has been determined, an expanded evaluation\n      of safety and hematologic response or improvement rate at this dose level will be conducted\n      in additional subjects so that the total number of subjects exposed to this dose level is up\n      to 15 subjects, inclusive of those treated at this dose level in the dose-escalation phase.\n      The exposure of additional subjects at the MTD will provide a better estimate of the\n      toxicity rate. Subjects with a documented response of Complete Response, Partial Response,\n      or hematologic improvement at the end of Cycle 2 may continue to receive vosaroxin for\n      additional cycles at the discretion of the treating investigator and after discussion with\n      the medical staff at Sunesis Pharmaceuticals. There will be a 30-day follow-up period\n      following the termination of study drug treatment."
