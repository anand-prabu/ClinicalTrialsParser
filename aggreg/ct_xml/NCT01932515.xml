  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is in three stages and will translate and validate screening and assessment
      instruments for use with deaf children.

      The first stage is modifying the screening and assessment instruments (ADI-R and ADOS) for
      use with deaf children. This will involve choosing the most promising screening instrument
      based on the systematic review and the expertise of a review panel, which contains experts
      and public and patient involvement (PPI).  This phase of the study seeks a wide range of
      user (parents/ carers and young people) views and experiences about the symptomatology and
      presentation of deaf children with autism, comparing this to hearing children with autism,
      and deaf children without autism.

      The second stage is to ensure that the newly modified instruments are accessible to deaf
      children and deaf parents by making any necessary translations from English into British
      Sign Language. This involves a strict translation and back translation methodology with
      reiterations until successful translation is achieved.

      For stage three in order to ensure that the new questionnaires are successfully identifying
      children and young people with Autism Spectrum Disorder, the modified instrument will be
      validated using a 'gold standard'. The current 'gold standard' for the mental health
      screening of Deaf children is a clinical interview administered by experienced senior
      multidisciplinary deaf child mental health clinicians.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        For the purposes of this study, children and young people will be recruited if they have a
        chronological age of  ≥18 months old, up to 18 years.

        Deaf children will have a hearing loss of at least 40dB

        Exclusion Criteria:

        This is a pragmatic trial which recognises the frequency and complexity of co-morbidities
        in children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and deafness. We will therefore not
        exclude on the basis of co-morbidity in the groups where a diagnosis of ASD already
        exists, since these tools would be used with this population if adopted more widely in the
        NHS.

        We will not exclude children or young people with language delay as children with ASD may
        have severe language delay. Families where the parents do not have either a signed
        language being studied here, or a language in which the ADI-R is available, will not be
        included.
