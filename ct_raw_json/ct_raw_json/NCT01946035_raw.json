A significant symptom of the condition, nasal blockage,\n      remains difficult to treat even when using nasal corticosteroids. Decongestant medications\n      act on the blood vessels in the nose and have an immediate effect in clearing a blocked nose\n      but if used for more than seven days a more severe rebound congestion of the nose develops.\n\n      In this study, the investigators aim to assess the effects of doxazosin, a drug which is\n      currently used to treat high blood pressure and symptoms of prostate enlargement, to find\n      out if it has an effect on nasal blockage."
