  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to employ advanced methods to estimate the individual factors contributing
      to sleep apnea from standard recordings made during routine clinical sleep studies. This
      study focuses on breathing control or &quot;loop gain&quot; as one of the factors contributing to
      sleep apnea. Increased levels of oxygen in the air is known to make breathing more stable by
      lowering &quot;loop gain&quot;. Here, our goal is to use a new method capable of detecting a reduction
      in loop gain with oxygen. The investigators also aim to test whether a high loop gain
      measured at baseline/placebo predicts a greater improvement in sleep apnea with oxygen
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a single-blinded randomized crossover study, inspired oxygen/air (40%/21%) is delivered
      on two separate nights. Loop gain is measured from routine polysomnography using a novel
      mathematical method. A value of loop gain &gt;1 reflects unstable breathing, and a value less
      than but approaching 1 denotes a system more prone to oscillate. Loop gain is measured as
      the changes in ventilatory drive/effort that arises subsequent to changes in ventilation
      (e.g. due to obstructive apnea). A simple chemoreflex model (gain, time constant, delay) is
      fit to surrogate ventilation data (derived from airflow) during sleep. The best model is one
      that best matches the elevated ventilatory drive (measured as ventilation in the absence of
      airflow obstruction) based on the prior apneic/hypopneic fall in ventilation. Loop gain is
      calculated from this model. We aim to use loop gain measured on and off oxygen to determine
      whether a strong response (reduction in apnea severity) can be predicted by a higher loop
      gain (in the sham arm) using our method. A majority subset of subjects will attend for
      detailed phenotyping of sleep apnea to assess upper airway anatomy/collapsibility, dilator
      muscle responsiveness, loop gain and the arousal threshold.

    <description>Acute change in AHI is taken as the difference between values on the sham and oxygen nights, taken approximately 1 week apart.
Hypopneas are based on 30% reduction in airflow (sensitivity analysis will employ criteria using 3% desaturation and arousals)
1-way RM ANOVA will assess the reduction in AHI in patients with higher (&gt;=0.7) and lower loop gain (&lt;0.7); an interaction between treatment and group may indicate a preferential benefit of oxygen in those with higher loop gain.
The percentage of the night that is not interrupted by events and arousals will also be assessed (stable breathing).</description>
