  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phenylketonuria(PKU)is a rare condition caused by the body's inability to properly breakdown
      an amino acid called phenylalanine(PHE), due to a missing enzyme, phenylalanine
      hydroxylase(PAH). When the enzyme is missing  and/or not functioning properly, it increases
      the level of PHE in the body. High levels of PHE can cause severe brain damage or nerve
      damage unless the children are on a strict low PHE diet. A low PHE diet restricts the intake
      of protein rich foods and can pose a significant burden to both the patient and the family.

      Investigators at the University of British Columbia and British Columbia Children's Hospital
       will examine the phenylalanine metabolism in children with PKU using a simple breath test.

      Patients (5-18y) receiving standard clinical care at the BC Children's Hospital's
      Biochemical Diseases Clinic will be enrolled.The study will be conducted twice on each
      patient. Baseline measurements will be performed at the beginning of each study for each
      patient.The Physician in charge will then prescribe the standard dose of sapropterin
      dihydrochloride (Kuvan®) (20mg/kg/d) or otherwise as deemed appropriate by the
      physician-in-charge.  The test will be repeated a week (minimum) after the beginning of
      treatment with the prescribed dose.

      The investigators propose that children who are responsive to sapropterin dihydrochloride
      (Kuvan®) will have increased 13CO2 in breath after treatment, and those who do not respond
      will have no change in the 13CO2 in the breath before and after treatment.

      As a comparison to the experimental group, age and gender matched healthy controls will also
      be studied. The test in healthy controls will be performed once without any intervention,
      and is only used as a comparative value.

        Children with PKU  will be enrolled from the Biochemical Diseases clinic at the British
        Columbia Children's Hospital.

        Healthy controls will be enrolled from the community and will undergo screening for age
        and gender match.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Study Subjects:

          1. Children (4-18y)diagnosed with PKU

          2. Parent(s) or guardian(s) willing and able to provide informed signed consent.

          3. Parent(s) or guardian(s) willing and able to comply with all study procedures

        Healthy controls:

          1. Healthy Children (4-18y) with no health condition

          2. Willing to go through an initial screening for age and gender match

          3. Parents or guardians willing and able to provide informed signed consent.

          4. Parents or guardians willing and able to comply with study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Study Subjects:

          1. Children &lt; 4y of age diagnosed with PKU, as it may be challenging to collect breath
             samples and perform indirect calorimeter in very young children

          2. Children (4-18y)who are diagnosed with PKU, but are currently ill, with a fever,
             cold, vomiting or diarrhea

        Healthy controls:

          1. Healthy Children &lt; 4y of age , as it may be challenging to collect breath samples and
             perform indirect calorimeter in very young children.

          2. Healthy Children (4-18y), but are currently ill, with a fever, cold, vomiting or
             diarrhea.
