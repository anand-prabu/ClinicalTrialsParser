      The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of FACTOR X in the prevention
      of bleeding when given as routine prophylaxis over 12 months.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        1. To assess the pharmacokinetics of FACTOR X after a single dose of 50 IU/kg.

        2. To assess the safety of FACTOR X when given as routine prophylaxis over 12 months.

    <description>At the Baseline Visit, eligible children will receive a bolus dose of 50 IU/kg FACTOR X.  After the Baseline Visit, children will be treated with FACTOR X prophylactically for a period of 12 months (52 weeks).
A dosing regimen of 40-50 IU/kg twice a week is recommended, but is not mandatory.  Each dose of FACTOR X must not exceed 60 IU/kg.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Children with hereditary severe FX deficiency (FX:C &lt;1 IU/dL, based on their lowest
             reliable FX:C recorded).

          2. Children under 12 years old, whose parent/guardian has given written informed
             consent.

          3. Assent of child (for children aged 6-11 years).

          4. Children with a history of severe bleeding (a minimum of one bleed with a bleed score
             of 3 or 4, Appendix XI) or a mutation in the F10 gene causing a documented severe
             bleeding phenotype.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any one of these criteria makes the child ineligible:

          1. Children with a history of inhibitor development to FX or a positive result at the
             Screening Visit (quantitative result of &gt;0.6 BU).

          2. Children who have thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt;50 x 109/L).

          3. Children who have clinically significant renal disease (serum creatinine &gt;200
             umol/L).

          4. Children who have clinically significant liver disease (serum ALT levels greater than
             three times the upper normal limit).

          5. Children known to have other coagulopathy or thrombophilia.

          6. Children who have known or suspected hypersensitivity to the investigational
             medicinal product or its excipients.

          7. Children with a history of unreliability or non-cooperation.

          8. Children who are participating or have taken part in another trial within the last 30
             days.

          9. Children who are planning more than 4 weeks' continuous absence from the locality of
             the investigational site, between the Screening Visit and the 12 Month Visit.
