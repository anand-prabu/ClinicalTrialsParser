      Primary objectives:

      The efficacy of the therapeutic decision taken by respiratory polygraphy (RP) against
      polysomnography (PSG) using the Epworth scale;

      Secondary Objective:

        1. the cost-effectiveness of diagnosis and therapeutic decision valued using the Epworth
           Scale and EuroQol 5D.

        2. effectiveness of the therapeutic decision by means of: 1) quality of life tests, 2)
           adherence and compliance to treatment, 3) blood pressure MAP, 4) biochemistry
           determinations. Design: prospective, randomized, controlled, open, parallel of
           non-inferiority. 440 patients will be randomized to diagnose and follow treatment based
           on the RP or the PSG. The follow-up will last 6 months with 4 assessments. Statistical
           analysis: We will compare the change in the Epworth scale between both arms of
           treatment through analysis of covariance. The premise of non-inferiority is -2 at the
           lower limit of 95% IC. Secondary variables will be analyzed using differences in
           independent means (or non-parametric equivalent) or Chi2 for dichotomous variables.
           Cost-effectiveness: costs generated by one and another method will be evaluated against
           the effectiveness of the primary variable using Bayesian techniques

      Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled, open, parallel noninferiority. 440 patients
      will be randomized to diagnose and follow treatment based on the PR or PSG generating four
      groups: two treated and two untreated with CPAP. The latter did not undergo
      self-certification home. The monitoring will be 6 months and 4 assessments. Statistical
      analysis: compare the change of the scale Epworth before and after the intervention between
      both treatment arms using analysis of covariance. The premise is non-inferiority of -1.6 at
      the lower limit of 95%. Secondary variables were analyzed by independent means differences
      (or nonparametric equivalent) or Chi2 for dichotomous variables. Cost-effectiveness: the
      costs generated by the two methods will be measured against the effectiveness of the primary
      endpoint using Bayesian techniques
