However,\n      fertilization rate with this method is still lower compared with ICSI using motile sperm.\n      One of the reasons for that is the immotile sperm inability to activate the oocyte Our\n      research hypothesis is that better fertilization rate can be accomplished in these cases by\n      combining PXN sperm activation with Ca ionophore oocyte activation."
