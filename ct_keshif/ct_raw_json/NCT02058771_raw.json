            "textblock": "It is universally recognised that current methods for risk stratification of sudden cardiac\n      death (SCD) are limited. A novel SCD risk marker, the Regional Restitution Instability Index\n      (R2I2), measures the degree of heterogeneity in electrical restitution using data obtained\n      from a standard 12 lead ECG acquired during an invasive electrophysiological study.\n\n      In an ischaemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) cohort of 66 patients, an R2I2 of \u22651.03 identified\n      subjects with a significantly higher risk of ventricular arrhythmia (VA) or death (43%)\n      compared with those with an R2I2 <1.03 (11%) (P=0.004).\n\n      This study will use non-invasive techniques to acquire electrical restitution data: exercise\n      and pharmacological stress, and will incorporate body surface potential mapping to develop a\n      non-invasive and high-resolution form of R2I2. Suitable patients will be recruited into a\n      prospective, observational study.\n\n      HYPOTHESES:\n\n      PRIMARY:\n\n        1. R2I2 is predictive of ventricular arrhythmia (VA) / SCD in patients with ICM.\n\n        2. The exercise stress protocol will create a dynamic range of heart rates that allows ECG\n           quantification of electrical restitution heterogeneity that correlates with invasive\n           R2I2 and is predictive of VA/SCD. The pharmacological stress protocol will create a\n           dynamic range of heart rates that allows ECG based quantification of electrical\n           restitution heterogeneity that correlates with invasive R2I2 and is predictive of\n           VA/SCD.\n\n      SECONDARY:\n\n        1. A high-resolution electrical map acquired using body surface potential mapping will\n           correlate with R2I2 and these data can be included in the R2I2 calculation to improve\n           its prediction of SCD/VA.\n\n        2. Serial measurement of R2I2 will produce consistent values."
