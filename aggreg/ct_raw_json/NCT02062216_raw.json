At the\n      beginning, the so-called foam cells contribute to the formation of early lesions; in mature\n      plaques, macrophages constitute 50% of the cells in the lesion; finally, they are involved\n      in the mechanisms leading to plaque rupture.\n\n      The primary objective of this study is to assess whether the inflammatory receptors play a\n      role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis."
