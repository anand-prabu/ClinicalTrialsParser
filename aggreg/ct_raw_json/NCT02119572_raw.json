Therefore, there\n      is an urgent need to find cost-effective and multi-faceted approach for diabetes care. Peer\n      support models provide a potentially low-cost, flexible means that is complimentary to the\n      current existing  health care services. Trained peer leaders can become qualified extenders\n      to a formal healthcare system, thereby, assisting with the education delivery and bolstering\n      the efforts of the professional staff.   To implement a culturally- specific peer support\n      program and determine whether it is acceptable, cost-effective in China is important. This\n      study aims to implement and evaluate biophysical and psychosocial outcomes of a peer support\n      program and to explore  it's  feasibility and  sustainability in China"
