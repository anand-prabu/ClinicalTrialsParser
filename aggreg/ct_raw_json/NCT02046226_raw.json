The target ulcer is defined as the highest-grade ulcer (Wagner's\n             classification) at initial evaluation.  For wounds with identical grading, the\n             largest wound is the index wound\n\n          -  The patient or legally authorized representative is willing to provide informed\n             consent and comply with specified follow-up evaluations\n\n          -  Undergoing intervention for infrainguinal or infrapopliteal artery disease (below the\n             femoral artery bifurcation and above the ankle joint)\n\n          -  The index procedure resulted in successful revascularization.  For endovascular\n             procedures, successful revascularization is defined as complete revascularization of\n             the target ulcer culprit vessels according to the angiosome treatment strategy, with\n             a final percent diameter stenosis >50% and improved distal flow by angiography\n             following the procedure.  For surgical procedures, successful revascularization is\n             defined as a patent graft and improved distal flow following the procedure.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Pregnant or nursing patients and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 1 year\n             following index procedure.  Female patients of child-bearing potential must have a\n             negative pregnancy test done within 7 days prior to index procedure.\n\n          -  Rutherford classification stage 0,1,2,3,4, or 6\n\n          -  Target wound duration <2 weeks\n\n          -  Presence of frank gangrene (Wagner classification grade 4 or 5), major tissue loss\n             (severe/extensive necrosis), or unsalvageable limb (extensive ischemic ulceration\n             beyond the transmetatarsal level anticipated to require major amputation after the\n             index procedure)\n\n          -  Previous or planned surgical or interventional procedure within 6 months before or 30\n             days after the index procedure, or any previous or planned target limb amputation.\n\n          -  Active local or systemic infection\n\n          -  Patients with ulcers judged by the examining physician to have a primary etiology\n             other than ischemic arterial disease (e.g., venous related, decubitus, or other\n             [goug, pyoderma gangrenosum, necrobiosis lipoidica, vitamin B12 deficiency])\n\n          -  Renal failure or chronic kidney disease with estimated glomerular filtration rate\n             (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.7sm sq. within 30 days of the index procedure or treated with\n             dialysis)\n\n          -  Severly decreased cardiac output\n\n          -  Uncontrolled hyperglycemia\n\n          -  Patients with a known other medical illness or known history of substance abuse that\n             may cause non-compliance with the protocol, confound data interpretation, or is\n             associated with a life expectancy of less than 1 year\n\n          -  Patient is currently participating (or has participated in the last 30 days) in a\n             study of any other investigational treatment.\n\n          -  Ulcer treatment with normothermic or hyperbaric oxygen therapy, recombinant or\n             autologous growth factor products, or use of enzymatic debridement\n\n          -  Concomitant medications such as corticosteroids, immunosuppressive medications, or\n             chemotherapy\n\n          -  Acute thrombus in the target limb"
