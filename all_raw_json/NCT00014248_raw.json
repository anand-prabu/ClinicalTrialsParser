Treatment repeats\n      weekly for a total of 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      Each patient receives escalating doses of ATP until the individual maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which the patient\n      experiences at least grade 3 (at least grade 2 cardiac ischemia or arrhythmia) toxicity.\n\n      Weight is measured at baseline and at weeks 1-8, 10, and 13. Percentage of body fat and\n      skeletal muscle strength is measured at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 8, 10, and 13.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 8, 10, and 13.\n\n      Patients are followed at weeks 10 and 13.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 13-24 patients will be accrued for this study."
