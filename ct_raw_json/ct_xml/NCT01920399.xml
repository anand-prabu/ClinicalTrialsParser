    <textblock>
      Investigate the safety and tolerability, as well as PK profile of ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ
      -AVI) administered in single and repeated intravenous (IV) infusions in healthy Chinese
      subjects.This study data will be used to support CAZ-AVI NDA  in China.

  <study_design>Allocation: Randomized, Endpoint Classification: Safety Study, Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment, Masking: Double Blind (Subject, Caregiver, Investigator)</study_design>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety and Tolerability:Adverse events, vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory measurements, physical examinations, oral body temperature</measure>
    <time_frame>Routine safety assessments, throughout the period that subjects receive CAZ-AVI/PLACEBO up to 5 days following discontinuation of study treatment</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>AE: The onset of an AE relative to treatment will be calculated as the time difference between the onset (date and time) of the AE and the start time of the last dose (date and time) prior to the AE; the duration of a resolved AE will be calculated as the difference between the resolution (date and time) of the AE and the onset (date and time) of the AE. Vital signs and oral temperature:Change in BP, pulse rate and oral temperature at each post treatment time point will be calculated as the post treatment measurement value minus the baseline value observed on Day -1. Physical examination: complete physical examination and brief physical examination. ECG: heart rate, RR, PR, QRS, and QT intervals from the 12-lead ECG and the derived variable QTcF. Safety laboratory (hematology, chemistry and urinalysis): Change in laboratory test value at each post treatment time point will be calculated as the post treatment value minus the baseline value observed on Day -1 .</description>
