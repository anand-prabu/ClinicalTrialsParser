      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of a study drug known as LY2835219
      in combination with different standard hormone therapies (letrozole, anastrozole, tamoxifen,
      exemestane, or exemestane plus everolimus) for  hormone positive breast cancer that has
      spread to other parts of the body.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a diagnosis of hormone receptor positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor
             receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast cancer.

          -  For Part A (LY2835219 + letrozole): Except for ongoing therapy with letrozole, the
             participant must not have received prior systemic endocrine therapy for metastatic
             disease.

          -  For Part B (LY2835219 + anastrozole): Except for ongoing therapy with anastrozole,
             the participant must not have received prior systemic endocrine therapy for
             metastatic disease.

          -  For Part C (LY2835219 + tamoxifen): The participant may have received prior systemic
             endocrine therapy for metastatic disease and may be receiving ongoing therapy with
             tamoxifen.

          -  For Part D (LY2835219 + exemestane): The participant must have received prior
             systemic endocrine therapy with at least one nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor
             (anastrozole, letrozole) for metastatic disease and may be receiving ongoing therapy
             with exemestane.

          -  For Part E (LY2835219 + exemestane + everolimus): The participant must have received
             prior systemic endocrine therapy with at least one nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor
             (anastrozole, letrozole) for metastatic disease and may be receiving ongoing therapy
             with either exemestane or exemestane + everolimus.

          -  Have either measureable disease or nonmeasureable but evaluable bone disease as
             defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1)

          -  Participants must have either post-menopausal status or pre-menopausal status if
             continuing or beginning ovarian suppression with a luteinizing hormone-releasing
             hormone (LHRH) agonist such as goserelin.

          -  Have adequate organ function, including:

               -  Hematologic: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5 x 10^9/liter (L), platelets ≥
                  100 x 10^9/L, and hemoglobin ≥ 8 gram/deciliter (g/dL).

               -  Hepatic: Bilirubin ≤1.5 times upper limits of normal (ULN), alanine
                  aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3.0 times ULN.

               -  Renal: Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times ULN.

          -  Have a performance status of ≤1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             scale.

          -  Have discontinued all previous therapies for breast cancer (including chemotherapy,
             radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and investigational therapy), except for ongoing
             endocrine therapy, for at least 21 days for myelosuppressive agents or 14 days for
             nonmyelosuppressive agents prior to receiving study drug(s), and recovered from the
             acute effects of therapy (until the toxicity resolves to either baseline or at least
             Grade 1) except for residual alopecia or peripheral neuropathy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have metastatic breast cancer with severe organ dysfunction as assessed by symptoms
             and signs, laboratory studies, and rapid progression of the disease.

          -  Have brain metastasis without prior radiotherapy.

          -  Have received prior systemic chemotherapy for metastatic disease. However, the
             participant may have received prior systemic chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant or
             adjuvant setting.

          -  Have initiated bisphosphonates or approved receptor activator of nuclear factor
             kappa-B (RANK-L) targeted agents (for example, denosumab) ≤28 days prior to Day 1 of
             Cycle 1.

          -  Have serious preexisting medical conditions that, in the judgment of the
             investigator, would preclude participation in this study (for example, history of
             major surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel).

          -  Have central nervous system (CNS) metastasis and either radiotherapy or development
             of neurological changes ≤14 days prior to receiving study treatment. Participants may
             be receiving a stable dose of corticosteroids. Screening of asymptomatic participants
             without history of CNS metastasis is not required.
