      This study evaluates cognitive impairment in subjects with Parkinson disease (PD) and
      similar neurological disorder through obtaining longitudinal clinical and neuropsychological
      data.  The long term goal is to have a well-characterized subject population to contribute
      to our understanding of the natural history, diagnosis and ultimate treatment of cognitive
      impairment in patients with PD and similar disorders.

          -  History and physical examination

          -  Questionnaires about mood, activities of daily living, environmental exposures and
             demographic information.

          -  Psychometric tests

        Study companions may also be asked to complete questionnaires about the study subject
        regarding medical and psychiatric history, as well as activities of daily living.
