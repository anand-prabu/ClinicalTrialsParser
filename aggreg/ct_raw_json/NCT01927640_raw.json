At the dobutamine visit,\n      the subject will only receive low-dose dobutamine, which will be used as an internal\n      inotropic/vasodilator control for cocaine. At the cocaine visit, the subject will receive\n      low-dose intranasal cocaine followed by either the active study drug (dexmedetomidine) or an\n      inactive placebo (saline). Both cocaine and dobutamine will increase myocardial\n      contractility and oxygen demand, thereby stimulating metabolic vasodilation. If, as\n      predicted, cocaine also causes \u03b1-adrenergic agonist in the coronary microcirculation, then\n      myocardial blood flow should increase less with cocaine then with dobutamine for a given\n      level of myocardial oxygen demand. We will study if dexmedetomidine, a central\n      sympatholytic, can normalize this cocaine effect. We previously have used dobutamine as a\n      comparator for cocaine in our research. At both visits, myocardial contrast echocardiography\n      will be used to measure regional myocardial perfusion."
