Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a total of\n      26 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of SCH 66336 until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which it is predicted that 20%\n      of patients may experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 6 patients are treated at\n      the determined MTD.\n\n      Patients are followed within 30 days of the last administration of the study drug and then\n      for up to 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25 patients will be accrued for this study."
