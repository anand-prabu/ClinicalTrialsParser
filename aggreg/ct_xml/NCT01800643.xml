  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Busulfan is an alkylating antineoplastic agent used commonly during the conditioning
           regimen (CR) in patient undergoing Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT). Due
           to the fact that this drug has a variable metabolism in different individuals, the
           investigators performed the plasmatic dosage of chemotherapy before starting the
           conditioning regimen (test dose) as a way to predict the best dose to them during the
           CR. Busulfan toxicities depends on the &quot;Area Under Curve&quot; and Concentration Steady
           State (CSS) that the investigators see by the pharmacokinetic study.

        -  The investigators randomized in two groups according to the route of drug
           administration: Oral and intravenous. For both the investigators did test dose before
           HSCT and in the first day of CR. The dosage of test dose was 1 mg/Kg/dose for oral
           formulation of busulfan and 32 mg/m2 for intravenous busulfan. The dose of busulfan
           that the investigators give for the patients during the CR depends on the
           pharmacokinetics obtained during the test dose. On the first day of CR the
           investigators calculated plasma levels again to make adjustments according the &quot;Area
           Under Curve&quot; target. This is a good way to know the population pharmacokinetic study of
           busulfan before and during HSCT.

        -  To test dose analysis pharmacokinetic and analysis during CR for oral busulfan, the
           investigators collect peripheral blood samples at the time: 0h (before taking
           busulfan), 30', 1h, 1,5h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 5h and 6h after taking this drug. To test dose
           for intravenous busulfan the investigators collect on time 0h, 30', 45', 1h, 2h, 3h,
           4h, 5h, 6h and 8h after receiving busulfan. If the patient is receiving intravenous
           busulfan during CR, the blood samples should be collected on time 0h, 30', 1h, 2h, 3h,
           4h, 5h, 6h, 7h and 8h after taking busulfan. The blood samples will be centrifuged (4ยบ
           C/ 3200 rpm/10 minutes) and analysed.

        -  Since pharmacokinetic study until clinical outcomes, patients will be monitored. The
           investigators will evaluate acute and chronic toxicities after Stem Cell
           Transplantation.

    <description>Evaluate Bu pharmacokinetics (PK) when given orally or intravenously (IV) and establish the ideal &quot;Area Under Curve- AUC&quot; based on a single daily dose (test dose) before HSCT. The test dose of orally Bu is 1 mg/Kg and the blood samples are collected and processed in time: 0h, 30 min, 1h, 1,5h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 5h and 6h after drug intake. After extraction of the plasma samples busulfan, quantitative analyzes of busulfan on human plasma will be performed by the liquid chromatograph. For the patients thar receive intravenously busulfan, the test dose is 32 mg/m2 and blood samples are collected in time: 0h, 30', 45', 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 5h, 6h and 8h after drug intake. The dose during the CR depends on the test dose and the AUC target.</description>
