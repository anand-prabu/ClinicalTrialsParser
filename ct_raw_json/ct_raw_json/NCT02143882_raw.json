            "textblock": "The Department of Health has recently announced the implementation of annual vaccination for\n      all those aged 18 years and under, with live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), which is\n      delivered as a nasal spray. The programme will begin in the influenza season, from September\n      2013, with children aged 24 years of age, and older children being included from the\n      influenza season of 2014. Therefore this study seeks primarily to measure antibody responses\n      to the LAIV vaccination over three subsequent years and will involve six blood samples, six\n      dried blood spots (taken from the end of the blood sample needle) and six oral fluid samples\n      - before and three weeks after each vaccination each year. These samples will allow us to\n      assess how the immune system responds to the vaccinations in terms of the antibodies that\n      are present.\n\n      The study will specifically recruit children in previous receipt of Pandemrix, a pandemic\n      influenza vaccine, and those na\u00efve to pandemic influenza vaccination, which will allow the\n      comparison of responses to LAIV between these groups.\n\n      The sample size required to answer the primary objective of the study is 200 evaluable\n      children per group. As the study will be conducted over three years the recruitment target\n      will be 500 children across the two groups to allow for the expected attrition of numbers\n      over time.\n\n      The investigators will also be assessing how well the vaccines are tolerated and each\n      participant will therefore be asked to complete a health diary for the week following\n      vaccination. They will be asked to record any symptoms, which the investigators will elicit\n      in line with the information in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) as well as any\n      illnesses or visits to their GP or hospital."

The participant may not enter the study if ANY of the\n             following apply:\n\n        From Fluenz Summary of Product Characterstics (SPC):\n\n          -  Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients (e.g. gelatin\u037e\n             see appendix 1), to gentamicin (a possible trace residue), to eggs or to egg proteins\n             (e.g. ovalbumin).\n\n          -  Children and adolescents who are clinically immunodeficient due to conditions or\n             immunosuppressive therapy such as: acute and chronic leukaemias\u037e lymphoma\u037e\n             symptomatic HIV infection\u037e cellular immune deficiencies\u037e and highdose\n             corticosteroids.

However, based upon the potential for influenza\n        antiviral agents to reduce the effectiveness of FLUENZ, it is recommended not to\n        administer the vaccine until 48 hours after the cessation of influenza antiviral therapy.\n\n        Administration of influenza antiviral agents within two weeks of vaccination may affect\n        the response of the vaccine.\n\n        Because of this information in the SPC, should any child be given these medications the\n        administration of LAIV would be delayed as specified.\n\n        Study specific:\n\n          -  Fever (sublingual temperature \u2265 38\u00b0C)\n\n          -  Received any blood or blood products within the past 12 weeks."
