            "textblock": "Background: Unintentional injuries in preschoolers are frequent. Many accidents meet\n      criteria for a psychotraumatic event as defined by the DSM-IV. It is therefore not\n      surprising that previous studies have found considerable rates of posttraumatic stress\n      disorder (PTSD) or clinically relevant posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in preschoolers\n      with injuries following accidental trauma, such as road traffic or burn accidents. In\n      consequence, secondary preventive efforts (early interventions) should be undertaken to\n      minimize such long-term deleterious consequences in children. While important components of\n      successful early interventions have been identified in school-age children, evidence is\n      completely lacking for younger children, especially for those below the age of 4 years.\n\n      Aims: The proposed study aims at examining the effect of a newly developed, standardized\n      early psychological intervention in reducing posttraumatic maladjustment and in enhancing\n      health-related quality of life in children ages 1 to 4 years with acute burn injuries. Also,\n      the effectiveness of an early screening measure in identyfing children with high risk for\n      psychological follow-up problems shall be studied.\n\n      Method: The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial within a stepped procedure.\n      First, eligible children will be screened 5 to 7 days post injury by means of a standardized\n      measure for their risk of developing PTSS. After a baseline assessment, children at risk\n      will then be randomly allocated to either a control group (standard medical care) or an\n      intervention group. Participants of the intervention group will be provided with the\n      standardized \"EPICAP 1-4\" intervention which uses established cognitive-behavioral\n      techniques and is directed to the parents. The intervention includes the following\n      components: psychoeducation on child and parental PTSS, promotion of adaptive strategies to\n      manage child and parental distress, construction of a parental trauma narrative, promotion\n      of strategies that increase parental capacity and enhance parent-child relationship. The\n      intervention consists of two face-to-face sessions with the parents (at baseline and 1 week\n      later) and a follow-up call or short follow-up face-to-face meeting (6 weeks after the first\n      session). Blinded follow- up assessments with standardized parent report measures will be\n      conducted at 3 and 6 months post injury. The primary outcome measures are child PTSD and\n      PTSS, secondary outcome measures include child behavior and health-related quality of life.\n      In addition, a variety of socio-demographic, medical and parental variables will be assessed\n      as co-variates. Children screened as low-risk will be reassessed only at 6 months to make\n      sure that the screening procedure is valid."
