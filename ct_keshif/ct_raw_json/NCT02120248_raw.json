As of 2008, 50 percent of WIC clients received services from local WIC agencies that\n      offered peer counseling.  Little is known as to the effectiveness of these peer counseling\n      programs.  Randomized controlled trials of peer counseling interventions among low-income\n      women in the U.S. showed increases in breastfeeding initiation and duration, but it is\n      doubtful that the level of support provided could be scaled up to service WIC clients\n      nationally.   The investigators tested whether a telephone peer counseling program among WIC\n      participants could increase breastfeeding initiation, duration and exclusivity."
