            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Roflumilast is a drug used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is\n      designed to help reduce lung inflammation. However, during testing, roflumilast also\n      appeared to reduce high blood sugar levels in people with COPD and type 2 diabetes. Other\n      tests showed that roflumilast also improved blood sugar levels in people who only had type 2\n      diabetes. Researchers want to see how roflumilast affects insulin and blood sugar levels in\n      overweight or obese people who are not diabetic, but who have high blood sugar levels.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To see how well roflumilast improves blood sugar and insulin levels in prediabetic\n      overweight or obese individuals.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Individuals between 30 to 65 years old who are overweight or obese (body mass index of\n      24.9 to 39.9 kg/m2) and have elevated blood sugar levels.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  This study will last 4 to 5 months. Participants will have 10 study visits over about\n           14 weeks. Two of these visits will be overnight inpatient stays.\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine\n           samples will be collected. They will also have a 3-day diet and exercise assessment\n           with a dietitian.\n\n        -  In Week 1, participants will have a special diet for 2 days to keep their regular\n           weight. They will then have a 2-day inpatient stay. During their stay, they will have\n           multiple tests, including blood sugar tests and full body scans. They may provide a fat\n           and muscle tissue biopsy sample. They will then receive either the study drug or a\n           placebo to take during the study.\n\n        -  In Week 3, participants will repeat the diet and exercise study from the screening\n           visit.\n\n        -  In Week 4, participants will review their diet and exercise results and have blood and\n           urine tests. They will receive a different dose of the study drug or a placebo.\n\n        -  In Week 11, participants will repeat the diet and exercise study from the screening\n           visit.\n\n        -  In Week 12, participants will repeat the inpatient studies and tests from Week 1.\n\n        -  In the last week, participants will have a final follow-up visit."

            "textblock": "Resveratrol, a polyphenol most notably found in red wine has anti-aging properties in mice\n      fed a high-fat diet; resveratrol protects against obesity and type 2 diabetes. Several\n      clinical trials have been conducted to study the metabolic effects of resveratrol. Although\n      these trials have used different subject groups (e.g. obese healthy, type 2 diabetics or\n      older adults with glucose intolerance), they suggest that resveratrol may improve insulin\n      sensitivity.  However, the therapeutic potential of resveratrol is diminished by the fact\n      that it has a very promiscuous target profile. In order to translate resveratrol biology\n      into clinical application, it is helpful to identify the cellular target(s) of resveratrol\n      that mediate the desired effects and to develop therapies specific for that target(s).\n      Recently, we discovered that the metabolic effects of resveratrol appear to result from\n      competitive inhibition of cAMP-degrading phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which increases cAMP\n      levels. The cAMP-dependent pathways activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is\n      essential for the metabolic effects of resveratrol. Inhibiting PDE4 with rolipram reproduces\n      all of the metabolic benefits of resveratrol, including protection against diet-induced\n      obesity and an increase in mitochondrial content, fat oxidation, physical stamina and\n      glucose tolerance in mice.  Based on results from cellular and preclinical studies, we\n      hypothesize that PDE4 inhibition will ameliorate insulin resistance and improve glucose\n      tolerance in pre-diabetic individuals.  To test these hypotheses, we will conduct a\n      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study on the potential beneficial effects of\n      roflumilast (Daxas  ), a PDE4 inhibitor, on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in\n      pre-diabetic individuals.   Each study participant will receive either placebo or oral\n      roflumilast (250 (micro)g, once a day for three weeks, followed by 500 (micro)g once a day\n      for nine weeks).  At baseline and after the 12-week treatment period, we will assess insulin\n      sensitivity. In addition, Beta-cell function, skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, body\n      composition, and circulating adipocytokine profile will be measured at baseline and after\n      treatment to evaluate potential changes that may be related to improvements in metabolic\n      function.  This study will explore whether roflumilast is effective at improving insulin\n      sensitivity in pre-diabetic individuals.  Results from this study may have important\n      implications for the potential use of roflumilast in treating type 2 diabetes."
