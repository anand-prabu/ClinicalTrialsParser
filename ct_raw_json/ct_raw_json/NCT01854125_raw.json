The immunomodulatory impact of MSCs in fibrosis\n      was confirmed, and several clinical studies have applied MSCs to eliminate the progression\n      of fibrosis. In this research the investigators will study the affect and influence of MSCs\n      in the patients,include assay of liver function,variation of ascites,Child-Pugh score etc."
