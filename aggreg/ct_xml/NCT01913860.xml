      Background The over use of antimicrobials is recognised as the main selective pressure
      driving the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance in human bacterial pathogens.
      Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)  are one of the most common infections presented in primary
      care and empirical antimicrobial treatment is currently recommended. Previous research has
      identified that a substantial proportion of Irish GPs prescribe antimicrobials for UTI that
      are not in accordance with the Guidelines for Antimicrobial Prescribing in Primary Care in
      Ireland.

      Aim To design, implement and evaluate the effectiveness of a complex intervention on GP
      antimicrobial prescribing and adult (18 years of age and over) patients' antimicrobial
      consumption when presenting with a suspected UTI.

      Methods The SIMPLE study is a randomised three armed intervention with practice level
      randomisation. Adult patients presenting with suspected UTI in primary care will be included
      in the study.

      The intervention integrates components for both GPs and patients. For GPs the intervention
      includes interactive workshops, audit and feedback reports and automated electronic prompts
      summarising recommended first line antimicrobial treatment and, for one intervention arm, a
      recommendation to consider delayed antimicrobial prescribing. For patients multimedia
      applications and information leaflets are included. A minimum of 920 patients will be
      recruited through 30 practices. The primary outcome is change in prescribing of first line
      antimicrobials in accordance with the Guidelines for Antimicrobial Prescribing in Primary
      Care in Ireland. The intervention will take place over 15 months. Data will be collected
      through a remote electronic anonymised data extraction system (iPCRN), a text messaging
      system and through GP and patient interviews and surveys. The intervention will be
      strengthened by the implementation of a social marketing framework and an economic
      evaluation.
