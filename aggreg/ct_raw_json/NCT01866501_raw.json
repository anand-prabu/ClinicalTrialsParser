Results suggest that a combination of the best\n      features of the 4 techniques may lead to optimal IO needle set placement more consistently.\n      This study is needed to validate the \"Blended\" proximal humerus IO insertion technique to\n      confirm that use of the technique results in proper site identification among device\n      operators and results in increased confidence.To most closely evaluate the Blended proximal\n      humerus insertion technique and how it is received by clinicians who perform these\n      procedures in actual patients, device operators will include licensed/certified clinicians\n      including, emergency medicine technicians/paramedics and nurses."
