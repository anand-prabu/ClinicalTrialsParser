Thirty patients\n      with biopsy proven carcinoma awaiting prostatectomy will be included in the study. Ex-vivo\n      MRI will also be conducted on the prostate specimen to obtain high resolution imaging\n      correlates to both in-vivo MRI and whole mount prostatectomy specimens. The investigators\n      hypothesize that the addition of these three techniques will increase the accuracy,\n      sensitivity, and specificity of MRI for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer."
