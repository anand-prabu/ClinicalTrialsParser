    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in hematologic malignancies (myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS],
      multiple myeloma [MM], Hodgkin's lymphoma [HL], mediastinal large B cell lymphoma [MLBCL],
      and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [NHL]).
