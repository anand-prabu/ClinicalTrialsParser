This study aims at evaluating for the first time the\n      efficacy of a nurse-led reminder program through email (NRP-e) to improve CVD risk factors\n      among hypertensive adults.\n\n      Participants will receive usual care and a guideline-based educational program on BP control\n      and healthy lifestyle habits. Subjects in the NRP-e group will also receive weekly email\n      alerts and phone calls from a nurse care manager for 6 months. Emails contain a reminder\n      program on the compliance with a healthy lifestyle based upon current guidelines for CVD\n      prevention. Follow-up visits will be scheduled at 1, 3 and 6 months after enrollment;\n      randomization will be made centrally and blood samples will be evaluated into a single,\n      accredited laboratory."
