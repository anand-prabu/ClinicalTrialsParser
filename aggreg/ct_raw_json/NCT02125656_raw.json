            "textblock": "Sleep is an essential biological process for life and great value to functions such as\n      learning, memory processing , cell and brain repair. Recently, new evidence points to the\n      relationship between lack of sleep and carbohydrate metabolism , establishing a framework\n      for insulin resistance observed in studies with restriction and sleep deprivation on several\n      nights and in a single night . To reverse this process , one of the most effective\n      strategies is physical exercise and part listed in the literature as a non-pharmacological\n      tool for prevention and health promotion , as well as in the treatment of some diseases .\n      However , the pace of modern society causes people to practice less physical exercise , lack\n      of time being the main reason . In this scenario, the High Intensity Interval Training (\n      HIIT ) emerges as a powerful strategy that induces major changes optimizing the time spent\n      on such activity. Considering the benefits of this mode , the purpose of this study is to\n      investigate the effects of high-intensity interval training in the context of insulin\n      resistance observed during sleep deprivation.  Will be recruited 20 male volunteers, aged\n      between 18 and 35 years old, healthy, with normal sleep duration equivalent to 7-8 hours /\n      night, not smoking and regular eating habits. They will be submitted to a protocol of 6\n      sessions of high-intensity interval training for two weeks, and since the end period, sleep\n      normally, or be deprived of sleep for 24 hours. Biochemical (thyroid hormones, cortisol,\n      glucagon, free fatty acid, cholesterol, glucose and insulin) will be undertaken as well as\n      evaluation of body composition by plethysmography, basal metabolic rate by indirect\n      calorimetry and insulin sensitivity through Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) before and\n      after the training period."
