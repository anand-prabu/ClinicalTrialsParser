The dose will adjust according to the China Great Pharmacopoeia only\n      when the adverse reaction occurs. In the concentration-based dosing group, the dose of PTX\n      or DOC will adjust based on the plasma drug concentration of previous cycle. A target\n      interval of PTX and DOC have been set before the trial based on earlier studies of the\n      drugs. Patients should finish at least 4 cycles chemotherapy, treatment should continue\n      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
