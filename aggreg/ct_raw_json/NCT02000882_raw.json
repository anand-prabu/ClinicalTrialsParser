            "textblock": "This is a Phase 2, multicenter, single-arm study to determine the safety and efficacy of\n      BKM120 plus capecitabine in triple-negative (ER-, PgR-, HER2-) breast cancer patients with\n      measurable brain metastases. Approximately 40 patients will be included, who have previously\n      received \u2264 3 prior systemic therapies for their disease.\n\n      The Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA) is a recently developed, validated prognostic score\n      for patients with brain metastases.  A recent study utilizing GPA in patients with TNBC and\n      brain metastases showed that these patients had a median survival time of 6.4 months. The\n      Graded Prognostic Assessment will be utilized to evaluate efficacy in this proposed clinical\n      study.\n\n      Capecitabine is a prodrug which is enzymatically converted to 5-fluorouracil in its tumor\n      target where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows tumor growth.  It is currently FDA approved\n      for both colorectal and breast cancer.  BMK120 is a pan phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase\n      inhibitor being developed under IND# 102,823 by Novartis Corporation.  As of September 2012\n      over 600 patients had been enrolled in fourteen separate Novartis sponsored monotherapy or\n      combination therapy clinical studies of BMK120.\n\n      Patients with triple negative breast cancer have an increased susceptibility to the\n      development of brain metastases.  In one clinical study 46% of TNBC patients were found to\n      have CNS metastases at some point before death.  Because currently available targeted\n      therapies such as endocrine or HER-2 targeted agents are ineffective against TNBC, current\n      treatment options are generally limited to chemotherapy.\n\n      Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling regulates diverse cellular functions\n      including cell proliferation, survival, translational regulation of protein synthesis,\n      glucose metabolism, cell migration, and angiogenesis.  PI3K signaling also serves a central\n      role in the pathogenesis of numerous cancers.\n\n      Constitutive activation of PI3K signaling is known to be a critical step in mediating the\n      transforming potential of oncogenes and tumor suppressors in many tumor types.  Resistance\n      to a variety of therapeutic interventions, including hormonal therapy, anti-HER2 therapies\n      and chemotherapy (as is the case for TNBC patients) can also be linked to constitutive\n      activation of the PI3K pathway.\n\n      Preliminary data suggest that activation of the PI3K pathway is a predictor of a poor\n      prognostic outcome in many cancer types.  Thus, as a pan-PI3K inhibitor, BMK120 may provide\n      a therapeutic benefit to patients with TNBC.  Both capecitabine and BMK120 have previously\n      shown activity in patients with TNBC.  Like capecitabine, BMK120 is also effective in\n      crossing the blood brain barrier making it a preferred candidate for its evaluation in\n      patients with TNBC.\n\n      Current clinical experience with BMK120 has shown that its most frequent adverse events\n      (AEs) include fatigue, decreased appetite, diarrhea, hyperglycemia, nausea, rash and mood\n      alteration disorders.  Therefore patients will be closely monitored for fasting plasma\n      glucose (FPG) HbA1c, and insulin C-peptide.  Patients will also be frequently and routinely\n      evaluated for mood disorders and disturbances.  The remaining most frequent AEs will be\n      detected by regular, frequent monitoring with symptomatic treatment to be provided as\n      required."

Oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives may be affected by\n                  cytochrome P450 interactions, and are therefore not considered effective for\n                  this study. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as sexually mature women\n                  who have not undergone a hysterectomy or who have not been naturally\n                  postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., who has had menses any\n                  time in the preceding 12 consecutive months), must have a negative serum\n                  pregnancy test \u2264 72 hours prior to initiating treatment.\n\n               -  Note: Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if\n                  they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate\n                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six\n                  months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels > 40 mIU/mL [for US only:\n                  and estradiol < 20 pg/mL] or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or\n                  without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone,\n                  only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up\n                  hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.\n\n               -  Note: Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically\n                  capable of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during\n                  treatment for 4 weeks (5 T1/2) after stopping treatment. The highly effective\n                  contraception is defined as either:\n\n                  i. True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle\n                  of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,\n                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of\n                  contraception.\n\n             ii. Sterilization:  have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without\n             hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.  In case of oophorectomy\n             alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up\n             hormone level assessment.\n\n             iii. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of\n             the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the\n             vasectomised male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.\n\n             iv. Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b):\n\n               1. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)\n\n               2. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or\n                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository\n\n                    -  Oral contraception, injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed\n                       as BKM120 potentially decreases the effectiveness of hormonal\n                       contraceptives.\n\n         27. Patient has known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection\n\n         28. Patient has history of another malignancy within 3 years, except cured basal cell\n             carcinoma of the skin or excised carcinoma in situ of the cervix\n\n         29.
