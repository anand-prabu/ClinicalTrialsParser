Placing a gene that has been created in the laboratory into white blood\n      cells may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer\n      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

usually, this will mean metastatic disease;\n             this may also be multiply recurrent disease or locally advanced disease; locally\n             advanced disease is defined for this study as disease where a mutilating surgery is\n             required and the patient is more likely than not to die of their disease despite an\n             aggressive operation; patients with metastatic disease that has been resected or\n             radiated are allowed to participate; Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors\n             (RECIST) evaluable disease is not necessary for participation\n\n          -  NY-ESO-1 positive by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (for this study, even a small level\n             of positivity is acceptable); for patients with < 5% NY-ESO-1 by IHC positivity, the\n             level of staining should be discussed with the patient and they should be informed\n             that this will likely effect the efficacy of the therapy;

patients with an arrhythmia that has been stable\n             for at least 6 months will be allowed to participate\n\n          -  Untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastasis; patients with CNS metastasis will\n             be allowed on study once treated\n\n          -  Patients with systemic infections requiring antibiotics or chronic maintenance/\n             suppressive therapy; once the infection in question has resolved, patients may\n             participate\n\n          -  Systemic anticancer treatments (including chemotherapy and biologics) less than 3\n             weeks prior to T cell therapy;

(if a\n             patient was not tested at the time of their leukapheresis, they must be tested prior\n             to receiving T cell infusion; if testing was done for leukapheresis, this is\n             adequate)\n\n          -  Patients with a history of proven myocarditis, pericarditis, and/ or endocarditis\n\n          -  Patients who do not meet the screening inclusion criteria will not be leukapheresed"
