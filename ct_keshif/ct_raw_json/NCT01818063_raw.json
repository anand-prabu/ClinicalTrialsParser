Relapse free survival (follow-up period of 36 months).\n\n        2. Overall clinical response to neoadjuvant therapy.\n\n        3. To determine whether expression of 5 biomarkers (cytokeratin [CK]5, endothelial growth\n           factor receptor [EGFR], excision repair cross complementing 1 [ERCC1], Ki67,\n           poly[adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosyl]transferase [Parp1]) correlate with a higher\n           pCR in response to a particular treatment combination. 4) To determine whether tumors\n           with biomarker signatures that are most like breast cancer (BRCA)-mutated tumors (high\n           expression of CK5 and high expression of EGFR), will correlate with a higher likelihood\n           of pCR with treatment with a PARP inhibitor in combination with chemotherapy.\n\n      5) To determine whether tumors with high expression of the markers ERCC1, Ki67, and Parp1\n      will correlate with a higher rate of pCR with platinum agents in combination with paclitaxel\n      or a PARP inhibitor.\n\n      6) To correlate response of tumor on imaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], ultrasound\n      [US], and positron emission tomography [PET]/computed tomography [CT]) with path CR.\n\n      7) To correlate levels of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with pathologic CR.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n        1.

To determine which arms are best tolerated by patients with co-morbid conditions, such\n           as hypertension and diabetes.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) and carboplatin IV on day 1 (course 1\n      only) or day 2 (courses 2-12).

Treatment\n      repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      ARM II: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-5. Patients also\n      receive paclitaxel IV and carboplatin IV on day 3 (course 1 only) or day 4 (courses 2-12).\n      Treatment repeats every 7 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 21 days after the last course, patients receive doxorubicin\n      hydrochloride IV and cyclophosphamide IV on day 1.
