This\n      study will also determine how long after a single injection of IFN-G white blood cells\n      remain stimulated.\n\n      AIDS is a disease that progressively destroys that aspect of the body's defense called the\n      immune system. It is particularly harmful to a class of cells called helper T-lymphocytes.\n      The specific opportunistic infections and malignancies associated with AIDS have been\n      treated with therapies that are often poorly tolerated by the patients and are associated\n      with dose-limiting toxicities. The principal focus of AIDS therapy research at present is to\n      control the underlying retroviral infection and to restore immune function with recombinant\n      lymphokines, adoptive immunotherapy, and/or lymphocyte transplants. These treatments include\n      zidovudine (AZT), which has been shown to control the HIV infection, and IFN-G, a lymphokine\n      which activates tumor-destroying and germ-killing functions. Studies are needed to find the\n      dose by which IFN-G works best."

Monocyte\n      antimicrobial activity is examined in test tube studies before and after each injection of\n      IFN-G. In part B, five patients receive the optimal dose of IFN-G established in part A.\n      Patients enrolled from part A have completed at least 2 weeks of part A before enrolling in\n      part B. Antimicrobial activity is examined 1, 2, and 3 days after a single injection of the\n      optimal dose of IFN-G (determined in part A). In part C (safety and tolerance of combined\n      treatment of IFN-G and AZT), patients are treated with IFN-G for 4 weeks using the optimal\n      dose and administration schedule derived from parts A and B."
