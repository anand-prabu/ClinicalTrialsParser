While DBS improves\n      Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms and walking in many patients in some of the patients\n      walking problems persist.  This study aims to find out what are the best stimulation\n      parameters of the DBS in order to improve  walking."

Gait disorder in Parkinson's disease is common and\n      has a greater impact on quality of life.  Currently, carbidopa-levodopa and Deep Brain\n      Stimulation are the only treatments available for gait impairment.\n\n      This study is meant to see if there is improvement in gait or freezing of gait are seen\n      after changes in the stimulation parameters.   Subjects  will be randomly assigned to four\n      different stimulation parameters: both stimulators on (BL ON), both stimulators off (BL\n      OFF), right stimulator on (R ON), left stimulator on (L ON). The investigators will assess\n      your gait using a clinical scales as well as wearable sensors attached to your body.\n      Assessments will be done one hour after each change in the stimulation parameters.\n\n      Gait will be studied using wireless sensors attached to the ankles and wrists to determine\n      speed, stride length and turning time."
