      This is a randomised, open-label phase II study comparing GEM-P chemotherapy (experimental
      arm) with CHOP (control arm) in previously untreated T-cell lymphoma. Eligible patients will
      be randomised 1:1 between 4-weekly GEM-P or 3-weekly CHOP chemotherapy.

      Background: T-cell lymphoma is an aggressive rare subset of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)
      comprising several different subtypes of disease within this group. No standard first-line
      treatment exists for T-cell lymphoma as published series are small, with heterogeneous
      populations and often retrospective.

      PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS Study Period: 5 years

      Objectives:

      Primary

      • To compare the complete response rate of GEM-P with CHOP chemotherapy in the first line
      treatment of patients with T - cell Lymphoma. Secondary

      To investigate, between both arms:

        -  Rate of metabolic complete response

        -  Toxicity of treatment

        -  Overall survival (OS)

        -  Progression Free Survival (PFS) Exploratory

        -  Investigate impact of International Prognostic Index(IPI) on the outcomes response
           rate, PFS and OS Study Design: A randomised multi-centre open-label phase II study
           Indication: Previously untreated T-Cell lymphoma No of Participants: 186 (93 patients
           in each arm) Main Eligibility Criteria

        -  Histologically proven T-cell lymphoma of the following subtypes:

        -  Peripheral T-cell lymphoma NOS

        -  Systemic Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)negative
           cases only

        -  Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma

        -  Hepatosplenic gamma/ delta T-cell lymphoma

        -  Bulky Stage I, Stage II, III or IV

        -  No prior chemotherapy regimen

        -  Patients aged 18 years or over.

        -  WHO performance status 0,1 or 2

        -  Adequate organ function:

        -  No treatment for lymphoma within 4 weeks of commencing trial therapy

        -  No known HIV, Hepatitis C or active Hepatitis B viral infection

      Treatment:

      CHOP: cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone every 21 days. GEM-P:
      gemcitabine, methylprednisolone, cisplatin every 28 days.

      Assessment Schedule:

        -  Patients will be reviewed at baseline and prior to each scheduled dose of treatment for
           toxicity

        -  Radiological tumour assessment will be done with CT scan after every 2 cycles in Arm A
           and after cycle 1, 3 and 4 in Arm B

        -  PET/CT scan will be performed at baseline and upon completion of treatment..

        -  Follow up after completion of treatment will be 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 months then
           annually for 5 years in total. CT scan will be performed at 3 &amp; 12 months.

        -  Following disease progression patients will be followed for survival every 3 months
           until death
