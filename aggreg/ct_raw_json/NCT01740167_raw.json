In literature, before specific psychotic symptoms appear, individuals may\n      experience a period of nonspecific symptoms and growing functional impairment. Early\n      interventions may alter the natural course of mental diseases and improve treatment\n      outcomes. So that, the purpose of this study is to develop a screen and prevention mode for\n      identifying young adults with high risk status of mental health disability. The psychosocial\n      intervention strategies for emotional and cognitive support in prevention model based on\n      health promotion theory will be used for this study. Participants in this experimental\n      design study will be randomly assigned into experimental and control groups. Four scales and\n      objective physical assessments are used for evaluating study outcomes. The pre- and\n      post-test will be held before and one week after prevention interventions. In addition,\n      follow-ups will be included for understanding long-term outcomes of the effectiveness of the\n      screen prevention model."
