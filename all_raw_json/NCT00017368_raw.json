Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.\n      Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of\n      chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by\n      peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating children who have newly diagnosed\n      neuroblastoma."

Patients are stratified according to peripheral blood\n      stem cell (PBSC) selection (selected PBSCs vs unselected PBSCs). (Selected PBSC stratum\n      closed to accrual as of 7/17/02.)\n\n        -  Induction/harvest:\n\n             -  Course 1: Patients receive etoposide (VP-16) IV over 1 hour on days 2-4, cisplatin\n                IV over 6 hours (beginning after VP-16 infusion) on days 1-5, and filgrastim\n                (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) beginning on day 6 and continuing until blood counts\n                recover.\n\n             -  Course 2: Patients receive vincristine IV and doxorubicin IV over 15 minutes on\n                day 1, cyclophosphamide IV over 6 hours on days 1 and 2, and sargramostim (GM-CSF)\n                SC beginning on day 3 and continuing until PBSC are harvested. Beginning after\n                completion of course 2 and when blood counts recover, autologous PBSC are\n                harvested.\n\n             -  Course 3: Patients receive VP-16 IV over 1 hour and ifosfamide IV over 1 hour on\n                days 1-5 and G-CSF SC beginning on day 6 and continuing until blood counts\n                recover.\n\n             -  Course 4: Patients receive VP-16 IV over 1 hour on days 1-3, carboplatin IV over 2\n                hours (beginning after VP-16 infusion) on days 1 and 2, and G-CSF SC beginning on\n                day 4 and continuing until blood counts recover.\n\n             -  Course 5: Patients receive treatment as in course 2 but supported by G-CSF.\n                Courses 1-5 each last 3-4 weeks. Patients undergo resection of the primary tumor\n                after course 4 or 5 unless primary resection was completed at diagnosis (which is\n                not recommended), no primary site is found, or the primary site is unresectable.\n                Patients complete courses 1-5 and then proceed to the first conditioning/PBSC\n                transplantation (PBSCT) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n                toxicity.\n\n        -  First conditioning/PBSCT: Patients receive high-dose thiotepa IV on days -7 to -5 and\n           cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -5 to -2. CD34+ PBSC are reinfused on day 0.\n           GM-CSF is administered SC beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover.\n           If blood counts have not recovered by day 28, unselected PBSC are reinfused. In the\n           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, patients proceed to the second\n           conditioning/PBSCT.\n\n        -  Second conditioning/PBSCT: Beginning within 6-8 weeks after initiating the first\n           conditioning, patients receive high-dose carboplatin IV continuously and etoposide\n           phosphate IV continuously on days -7 to -4 and melphalan IV on days -7 to -5. PBSC and\n           GM-CSF are administered as in the first PBSCT.\n\n      Beginning no earlier than day 28 after the second PBSCT, patients undergo local radiotherapy\n      to the primary site and sites that are positive by meta-iodobenzylguanidine scan after\n      induction twice a day for 7 days (or once a day for 12 days if twice daily dosing is not\n      possible). Beginning on day 90 after the second PBSCT, patients receive oral isotretinoin\n      twice a day for 2 weeks. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 31-39 patients will be accrued for this study within 22\n      months."
