A\n      baseline medical history will be taken and physical examination will be performed for all\n      participants, and any comorbidities and concomitant therapies would be noted. Patients with\n      controlled concomitant diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes, will be allowed to enter\n      the study.

Safety and\n      tolerability evaluations included physical examinations, electrocardiography, vital sign\n      monitoring and laboratory testing weekly for the first 8 weeks and every 4 weeks thereafter.\n      The MMSE and ADAS-cog will be recorded at each efficacy follow-up visit."
