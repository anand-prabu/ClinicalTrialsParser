  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-cohort, open label, Phase II study with Dabrafenib (GSK2118436) and
      Trametinib (GSK1120212) combination therapy in subject with BRAF mutation-positive melanoma
      that has metastasized to the brain. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of 4
      cohorts. Cohorts will consist of; V600 E, D, K, R mutations, metastases to the brain,
      symptomatic and asymptomatic, with or  without prior local (brain) therapy,  with or without
      prior local (brain) therapy, and range of  ECOG scores from 0-2.
