  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the US, inhaled albuterol is currently available for use in an aerosol formulation
      dispensed by metered dose inhalers (MDI). A common problem with conventional MDI devices is
      inefficient inhaler technique (i.e., inability to properly coordinate actuation with
      inspiration). Inefficient inhaler technique can compromise delivery of the active drug to
      the airways and potentially result in suboptimal clinical benefits. Breath actuation has
      been found to reduce administration errors in comparison with conventional MDIs.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent and HIPAA signed and dated by the subject or written
             informed assent signed and dated both by the subject and/or parent/caregiver/legal

          -  Documented history of persistent asthma and current use of an MDI containing any
             short-acting beta-adrenergic agonist (e.g. albuterol, levalbuterol,) on average of at
             least once/week over the 4-weeks prior to screening. The asthma diagnosis must be
             consistent with the diagnosis of asthma as per the National Asthma Education and
             Prevention Program.

             urinalysis) assessed as either normal or abnormal not clinically significant (NCS)
             per the principal investigator, as well as a 12-lead ECG interpreted as either
             &quot;Normal&quot; or &quot;Abnormal NCS&quot; as determined by the central cardiologist. Subjects must
             also be free of any clinically significant, uncontrolled concomitant conditions other
             than asthma that could interfere with study conduct, influence the interpretation of
             study observations/results, or put the subject at increased risk during the trial.

          -  Capable of understanding the requirements, risks, and benefits of study
             participation, and, as judged by the investigator, and being compliant with all study
             requirements (visits, record-keeping, etc).

          -  Non-smoker for at least one year prior to the screening visit and a maximum pack-year
             (PY) smoking history of 10 years.

             last study related visit.

          -  Participation in any investigational drug trial within 30 days preceding the
             screening visit or planned participation in another investigational drug trial at any
             time during this trial.

          -  A known hypersensitivity to albuterol or any of the excipients in the formulations.

          -  History of severe milk protein allergy

          -  History of an upper or lower respiratory tract infection or disorder (including, but
             not limited to bronchitis, pneumonia, acute or chronic sinusitis, otitis media,
             influenza, etc) which is not resolved at least 1 week prior to the SV.

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse within two years preceding the SV.

          -  Use of any protocol prohibited concomitant medications for asthma (any oral
             β2-adrenergic agonists) or any protocol prohibited concomitant non-asthma medications
             including treatment with β2-adrenergic receptor antagonists and non-selective
             β-receptor blocking agents such as β-blocking anti-hypertensive products
             (administered by any route), MAO inhibitors, and/or tricyclic antidepressants.
             (Subject's own MDI short-acting β-agonist rescue inhaler should be used until the
             start of the Run-In period when a study rescue inhaler is provided.)

          -  Inability or unwillingness to comply with the protocol requirements.

          -  History of life-threatening asthma [defined here as an asthma episode requiring
             intubation and/or associated with hypercapnea, respiratory arrest or hypoxic
             seizures.]

          -  Any asthma exacerbation within 3 months of the SV requiring oral or systemic
             corticosteroids or any hospitalization for asthma within 6 months of the SV.

        Note: An exacerbation of asthma is defined as any worsening of asthma requiring any
        treatment other than rescue albuterol or the subject's regular asthma maintenance therapy.
        This includes requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids and/or emergency room visit or
        hospitalization or a change in subject's regular asthma maintenance treatment. A subject
        does not need to be withdrawn from the study due to an asthma exacerbation unless
        hospitalization is required or unless the principal investigator believes it is in the
        subjects' best interest to withdraw from the study.

          -  Previous participation in an inhaled Albuterol Spiromax® (Teva) study, with the
             exception of the ABS-AS-306 study.

          -  Study participation by clinical investigator site employees and/or their immediate
             relatives.

          -  Study participation by related or non-related individuals living in the same
             household, i.e. only one subject per household may participate in the study.

          -  Any clinically significant endocrine, hematological, hepatic, renal,
             gastrointestinal, neurological, cardiac, metabolic, immunological, any non-asthmatic
             acute or chronic pulmonary condition (including but not limited to bronchitis,
             emphysema, active tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis), and malignancy
             other than basal cell carcinoma. Significant is defined for this protocol as any
             condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the
             subject at risk through participation, or which could affect the safety analyses.

          -  Any medical or psychological condition that in the investigator's opinion should
             preclude enrollment.
