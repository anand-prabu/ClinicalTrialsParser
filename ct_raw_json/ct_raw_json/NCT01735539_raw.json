The investigators will perform this study in healthy older (65-75y) and younger\n      (18-28) men. The investigators will also explore how feeding affects muscle blood flow as\n      this is important in the delivery of the nutrients we eat to the muscle where they are used.\n\n      The investigators plan to supplement the feed with arginine, a safe and widely found\n      non-essential amino acid, to explore if this can improve muscle blood flow."
