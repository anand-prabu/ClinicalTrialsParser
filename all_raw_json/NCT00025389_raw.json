Others find cancer cells\n      and help kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy\n      work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.\n      Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy before surgery may may shrink the\n      tumor so that it can be removed.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is to see if bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin given\n      before surgery work in treating patients who have stage IB, stage II, or stage IIIA\n      non-small cell lung cancer."
