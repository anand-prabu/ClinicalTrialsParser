            "textblock": "Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by eosinophilic airway inflammation.\n      Individuals with classic asthma experience paroxysmal symptoms including cough, wheeze,\n      shortness of breath and chest tightness. Cough variant asthma (CVA) is asthma in which\n      chronic cough (cough lasting eight weeks or more) is the sole or predominant symptom of\n      asthma. The pathophysiologic mechanisms which differentiate asthma, CVA, and eosinophilic\n      bronchitis without asthma are not fully understood. We have recently identified individuals\n      with chronic cough who cough during methacholine but have normal airway sensitivity (ie. do\n      not have asthma or CVA) and may or may not have eosinophilic bronchitis. The purpose of this\n      research is to examine the pathophysiologic differences between three causes of chronic\n      cough: asthma, cough variant asthma and methacholine-induced cough with normal airway\n      sensitivity.\n\n      The objectives of this research are to compare (i) the bronchodilating and (ii) the\n      bronchoprotective effects of deep inspirations (DIs) in individuals with: (a) asthma, (b)\n      CVA and (c) methacholine-induced cough but normal airway sensitivity.\n\n      Hypotheses:\n\n      i. The bronchodilating effect of a DI will be: (a) absent or impaired in individuals with\n      classic asthma; (b) impaired in individuals with CVA; and (c) preserved in individuals with\n      methacholine-induced cough but normal airway sensitivity.\n\n      ii. The bronchoprotective effect of a DI will be: (a) absent in individuals with classic\n      asthma; (b) impaired in individuals with CVA; and (c) preserved in those with\n      methacholine-induced cough but normal airway sensitivity."
