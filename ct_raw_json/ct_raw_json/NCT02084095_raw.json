            "textblock": "Background Glucose metabolism abnormalities are frequent in acromegaly. Insulin resistance\n      (IR) correlates with the intensity of acromegaly and Insulin-like Growth factor-I (IGF-I)\n      correlates better with IR than growth hormone (GH). Insulin secretion (IS) is significantly\n      reduced in hyperglycemic acromegalics as compared with those with normal glucose levels. IS\n      is independent of acromegaly intensity.\n\n      The aim of this study is to show that in active acromegaly: 1) IGF-I does not cause IR but\n      is just a better marker of acromegaly intensity than GH; 2) high GH levels induce IR through\n      free fatty acids (FFA); 3) hyperglycemia is caused by a defficient IS on a background of IR.\n\n      Methods Intensity of acromegaly will be assessed using serum levels of GH, IGF-I and IGF\n      binding globulin-3. IR and IS will be assessd using an intravenous glucose tolerance test\n      acording to Bergman model. FFA will be directly measured in plasma."
