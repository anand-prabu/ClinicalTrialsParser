The 20-30 minute program offered onscreen assessments of Transtheoretical Model strategies of change, and then provided individually tailored feedback messages matched to their readiness to change for relevant target behaviors. The program addressed smoking cessation and relapse prevention, stress management, and fruit and vegetable consumption. The feedback screens were interactive and engaging. The messages were written at a 4th-5th grade level and were reviewed for multicultural relevancy. Participants in the treatment group interacted with the program up to 3 times during pregnancy. A printed multiple behavior change guide also was distributed. All program components are available in English and Spanish."

            "textblock": "Promoting health behaviors during pregnancy has tremendous public health significance. Poor\n      health behaviors are associated with pregnancy complications, birth outcomes, and the health\n      of the child. They influence infant birthweight, premature birth, and infant mortality\n      rates, all of which continue to be public health concerns, reflected in the goals of Healthy\n      People 2020.\n\n      Pregnant women, particularly those from under-served populations, often have a multitude of\n      health behavior risks that threaten positive pregnancy and birth outcomes, as well as the\n      future health of mother and baby. Pregnancy offers a window of opportunity for behavioral\n      intervention. The immediate health risk for the baby motivates most pregnant women to at\n      least consider changing their behavior. Furthermore, the regular and continual medical care\n      that most pregnant women receive allows optimal access for intervention. The circumstance of\n      pregnancy can be used as a teachable moment to better the future health of women and\n      children.\n\n      The primary goals of this study were to complete and enhance the development of an iPad\n      delivered intervention and to assess the efficacy in a randomized clinical trial involving\n      pregnant women from three federally-funded community health centers that treat under-served\n      populations. Using interactive technology, users complete onscreen assessments and receive\n      individually tailored feedback messages on key behavior change strategies identified by the\n      Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change and matched to their stage of readiness for each\n      behavior. Supplemental intervention components were created including printed feedback\n      reports, a multiple behavior stage-based manual, and Spanish versions of all intervention\n      materials. This intervention offers a cost-effective, science based, and easily deliverable\n      solution to improve multiple health behaviors, and overall health and well-being, of\n      populations of pregnant women."
