The subject is classified as a cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) poor metabolizer (or an\n             indeterminate metabolizer with neither allele known to be active) based on results of\n             CYP2D6 genotyping performed at screening. (Note: Prior CYP2D6 genotyping results may\n             be used for the purpose of determining study eligibility if a copy of the laboratory\n             report is available and the genotyping results can be interpreted with the same\n             classification system used by the study reference laboratory.)\n\n          2.
