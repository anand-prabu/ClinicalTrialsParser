The investigators' aim was to compare transurethral resection of\n      bladder tumor and adjuvant intravesical electromotive mitomycin with transurethral resection\n      and adjuvant intravesical passive diffusion mitomycin and transurethral resection alone in\n      patients with primary stage pTa-pT1 and grade G1-G2 urothelial bladder cancer Patients will\n      be randomly assigned to:  transurethral resection alone, transurethral resection and\n      adjuvant intravesical 40 mg passive diffusion mitomycin dissolved in 50 ml sterile water\n      infused over 60 minutes once a week for 6 weeks, or transurethral resection and adjuvant\n      intravesical 40 mg electromotive mitomycin dissolved in 100 ml sterile water with 23 mA\n      pulsed electric current for 30 minutes once a week for 6 weeks. Patients in the intravesical\n      adjuvant electromotive and passive diffusion mitomycin groups who are disease-free 3 months\n      after induction treatment, will be scheduled to receive monthly intravesical instillation\n      for 10 months, with the same dose and methods of infusion as initial assigned treatment. All\n      patients will be assessed for safety. The investigators' primary endpoints are recurrence\n      rate and disease-free interval. Analyses will be done by intention to treat."
