  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluid expansion during cardiocirculatory insufficiency was helped by cardiac output
      monitoring. However, the goal of fluid expansion was to increase the oxygen delivery, which
      consider cardiac output, but also Haemoglobin which decrease during a fluid challenge. The
      maximalization of cardiac output could decrease the oxygen delivery if the haemodilution was
      too wide. The aim of this study was to describe the oxygen delivery during a fluid expansion
      conducted for cardiac output maximalization, following actual guidelines.
