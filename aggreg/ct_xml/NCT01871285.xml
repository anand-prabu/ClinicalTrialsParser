    <textblock>
      The primary aim of EN3409-204 is to determine if chronic pain subjects on around the clock
      opioids who are receiving 100 to 220 mg oral MSE can be safely transitioned on to BEMA
      Buprenorphine at 50% of their MSE dose without inducing opioid withdrawal or reversing
      analgesic effects.
