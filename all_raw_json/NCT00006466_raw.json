At day 85, patients\n      may receive an additional 12-week course of therapy in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with an apparent complete response receive additional\n      courses.\n\n      Patients are followed for 2 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13-37 patients will be accrued for this study."
