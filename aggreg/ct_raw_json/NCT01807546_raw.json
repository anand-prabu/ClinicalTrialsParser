A secondary objective is to\n      determine if treatment with rigosertib causes any side effects.\n\n      Rigosertib is an investigational drug, which means that it has not been approved by the U.S.\n      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat any diseases. We are studying rigosertib as a\n      new anticancer drug. Tests that we have done in the laboratory suggest that rigosertib works\n      by blocking cell division in cancer cells and causing them to die."

Patients with stable disease (SD) or better, based on revised Response\n      Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) 1.1, will receive repeated cycles of treatment on a\n      21-day cycle schedule until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, or\n      withdrawal of consent. Patients with progressive disease (PD) but who, in the opinion of the\n      Investigator, appear to be deriving clinical benefit, may continue on study with a planned\n      disease reassessment after one further cycle of therapy. Should the patient have SD or PR at\n      this reassessment, s/he may continue on study, with subsequent reassessments every 3 cycles.\n\n      Following discontinuation of rigosertib treatment, patients' mortality status will be\n      assessed every 3 months."
