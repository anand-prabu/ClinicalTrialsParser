    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with anti-aquaporin 4 antibody positive Neuromyelitis Optica spectrum
      disorder were confirmed based on diagnostic criteria. Patients who meet all inclusion
      criteria and do not conflict with the exclusion criteria will receive steroid plus therapy
      （1g/day for five consecutive days）. Subsequently, patients who not provided adequate effect
      of therapy to steroids plus therapy will receive NPB-01 (intravenous immunoglobulin)
      400mg/kg/day for five consecutive days. Patients evaluated Quantification of nerve and
      spinal cord impairment （QOSI） and the Expanded Disability Status Scale （EDSS）/ Functional
      Systems （FS） and anti-aquaporin 4 antibody et al.

      As a safety endpoint, the safety of NPB-01 will be investigated the occurrence of adverse
      events by one year after the start of the study treatment.
