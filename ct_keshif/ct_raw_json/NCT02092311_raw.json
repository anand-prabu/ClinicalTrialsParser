The study hypothesis is\n      that using this method will lead to less incidental injuries to arteries and as a result to\n      less testicular atrophy.In addition, using microscope would result in significantly low\n      rates of all major complications of varicocelectomy."

Then\n      another mini incision is made at high inguinal level and the rest of surgery is conducted by\n      retroperitoneal approach.\n\n      Outcome is compared to the outcome of non-microscopic methods of varicocelectomy and the\n      inguinal and subinguinal microscopic varicocelectomy accompanied by testicular delivery that\n      is suggested by Goldstein and associates."
