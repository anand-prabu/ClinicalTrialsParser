            "textblock": "The purpose of the study is to learn different proteins that may appear on the \"injured\" end\n      of the sciatic nerve and compare it to the other end of the cut nerve, which is \"uninjured\".\n      By comparing the \"normal\" versus \"traumatized\" ends of the cut sciatic nerve, the\n      investigators hope to identify proteins that may be specifically related to pain. For\n      instance, if the non-traumatized end of the nerve has none of Protein X but the traumatized\n      end of the nerve has a lot of Protein X, then Protein X would be a protein that the\n      investigators will want to study further and see if it plays any role in the sensation of\n      pain.\n\n      Other studies have shown that there are specific pain-related proteins and they may be\n      increased or decreased after traumatic injury. If the investigators are able to identify\n      specific proteins that are related to pain, then that may eventually lead to the development\n      of medications that will block those proteins and decrease the sensation of pain."
