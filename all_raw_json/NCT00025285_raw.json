Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression\n      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responsive disease receive up to 6 courses\n      of therapy. Patients also receive oral thalidomide once daily beginning on day 1 and\n      continuing until disease progression.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 39-70 patients will be accrued for this study within 14\n      months."
