In women with heterogeneous or dense breast tissue, the specificity of MBI in correctly\n           classifying subjects without breast cancer will be non-inferior to breast\n           tomosynthesis.\n\n        2. In women with heterogeneous or dense breast tissue, the area under the receiver\n           operating characteristic (ROC) curve for MBI will be non-inferior or superior to breast\n           tomosynthesis.\n\n        3. Combining the use of MBI and breast tomosynthesis will provide performance superior to\n           either technology alone, as manifest by a superior ROC curve area."

The LumaGEM MBI scanner is a dual-head, small field-of-view (FOV) device for developing an MBI image of Tc99m-Sestamibi uptake within the breast.  The device consists of solid-state detectors, a data acquisition system, and a computer.  The detectors are also used to immobilize the breast during image acquisition by mild compression.  The detectors are housed in two heads that are positioned on both sides of a compressed breast.",
