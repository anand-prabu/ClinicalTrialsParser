  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if NIR fluorescent imaging is an effective
      approach to detect the margins of head and neck tumours or lymph nodes draining the tumour
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective:

      definition of the distribution of intravenously injected ICG in the normal and pathological
      lymph nodes draining the dissected tumor in head and neck cancer patients or in nodes
      recurrences in head and neck cancer

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Evaluation of the ability of NIR fluorescence imaging to determine the tumoral volume,
           specifically the margins of the tumoral tissues (in the operating room and in the
           pathology department)

        -  Analysis of the correlation between ICG fluorescence and tumoral invasion in the
           dissected lymph nodes

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients requiring neck dissection with or without resection of the primary (the
             decision and the type of neck dissection are preliminary decided during head and neck
             multidisciplinary oncologic consultation).

          -  Informed consent form signed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age less than18 years old.

          -  Inability to give informed consent.

          -  History of allergy or hypersensitivity against the investigational product (its
             active substance or ingredients), to iodine or to shellfish.

          -  Apparent hyperthyroidism, autonomous thyroid adenoma, unifocal, multifocal or
             disseminated autonomies of the thyroid gland.

          -  Documented coronary disease.

          -  Advanced renal impairment (creatinine &gt; 1,5mg/dl).

          -  During the 2 weeks before the enrolment, concurrent medication which reduces or
             increases the extinction of ICG (i.e. anticonvulsants, haloperidol and Heparin).

          -  Pregnancy, breastfeeding
