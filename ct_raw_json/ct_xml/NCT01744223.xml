    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate patients with blood cell cancers who are going to have an
      allogeneic (donor) blood stem cell transplant from a partially matched relative. The
      research study will test whether immune cells, called T cells, which come from the donor
      relative and are specially grown in the laboratory and then given back to the patient along
      with the stem cell transplant (T cell addback), can help the immune system recover faster
      after the transplant. As a safety measure, these T cells have been &quot;programmed&quot; with a
      &quot;self-destruct switch&quot; so that if, after they have been given to the patient, the T cells
      start to react against the tissues (called &quot;graft versus host&quot; disease, GVHD), the T cells
      can be destroyed.

      This is a Phase1/2 dose escalation study evaluating the safety and feasibility of BPX-501
      infused after partially mismatched, related (haploidentical), T cell-depleted HSCT.  The
      purpose of this clinical trial is to determine whether BPX-501 infusion can facilitate
      engraftment, enhance immune reconstitution and potentially improve the graft versus leukemia
      (GVL) effect, with the potential for reducing the severity and duration of severe acute
      graft versus host disease (GvHD).  The trial will evaluate the treatment of GvHD by the
      infusion of dimerizer drug (AP1903) in those subjects who present with severe GvHD (Grades
      III and IV) as well as those subjects with Grade I and II who progress or do not respond to
      corticosteroid therapy within 4 days.
