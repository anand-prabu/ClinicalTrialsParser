  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this randomized controlled study is to investigate the effectiveness of
      mirror therapy supported by telerehabilitation on the intensity, duration and frequency of
      phantom limb pain and daily activities compared to traditional mirror therapy and sensomotor
      exercises without a mirror in patients following lower limb amputation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 75% of patients after amputation of an arm or leg suffer from chronic phantom limb
      pain that still is perceived in the missing limb, leading to limitations in daily activities
      and quality of life. The treatment of phantom limb pain is still challenging. Despite many
      different pharmacological interventions, the outcomes on the longer-term are in many cases
      not satisfying. Alternative, non-pharmacological interventions, such as mirror therapy, are
      gaining increased recognition in the treatment of phantom limb pain. In this context,
      telerehabilitation plays an important role to support long-term self-management and autonomy
      of these patients.

      In the developmental phase of the project, a user-centred design is applied. Patients as
      well as physical and occupational therapists are interviewed concerning their preferences
      and needs with respect to the design and content of the telerehabilitation. Additionally,
      two focus groups with each five participants will be conducted. Subsequently, a prototype of
      the telerehabilitation will be developed based on user preferences, available evidence,
      expert opinion and already existing systems. This prototype will be tested on its usability
      and technical performance in phase three using the thinking-aloud-method and data logging.
      Accordingly, a multicenter, randomized controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the
      cost-effectiveness of the telerehabilitation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Lower limb amputation

          2. At least since one week constant or intermittent phantom limb pain (PLP) with an
             average intensity of at least score 3 on the 11-point NRS and a minimum frequency of
             one episode of PLP per week.

          3. Sufficient cognitive, communicative and motor functions to be able to use the
             telerehabilitation service, to concentrate for at least 15 minutes on the mirror
             image and to follow instructions and questionnaires; this is based on clinical
             judgment of recruiting physicians or therapists.

             Exclusion Criteria:

          4. Duration of inpatient rehabilitation not long enough to ensure the 4-week clinical
             intervention phase.

          5. Bilateral amputation, severe co-morbidity (e.g. stroke) or pain affecting the intact
             limb; this prevents engagement in the prescribed exercise programs of the study.

          6. Severe psychiatric disorders that preclude patients from participating in the trial.

          7. Intensive course of mirror therapy in the past (&gt; 6 treatments during the last three
             months).
