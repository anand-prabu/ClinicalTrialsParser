            "textblock": "About 45 million people in Europe have allergic rhinitis (hay fever) - inflammation of the\n      nasal passages causing sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion, itching and tearing of the\n      eyes. In the United Kingdom, seasonal hay fever due to grass pollen allergy accounts for\n      approximately 7 times more doctors' appointments than asthma. The standard treatment for hay\n      fever consists of treating the symptoms with a nasal spray and an antihistamine.  However,\n      in a survey taken in a UK general practice less than 40% of patients with hay fever reported\n      good symptom control with this standard treatment. For those patients with hay fever whose\n      symptoms are not well controlled by treatment with antihistamines and nasal sprays,\n      subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) - (monthly injections of a grass allergen extract for a\n      period of 3-5 years) is an effective alternative, and is approved in the UK on a named\n      patient basis. More recently, allergen immunotherapy tablets (AITs) have been developed,\n      including grass pollen allergen tablets. These have been shown to be highly effective in the\n      treatment of hay fever, with the additional benefit of being convenient for patients, given\n      that they may be taken at home. Grazax\u00ae (manufactured by ALK-Abello, Denmark) has UK and\n      European Union (EU) license for use in the treatment of troublesome grass pollen induced hay\n      fever. The aim of this research is to investigate the effects of the AIT treatment on the\n      immune system over time - which changes are taking place and when in the course of\n      treatment. This will provide insight into the complexities of the development of\n      allergen-specific immune tolerance - how harmful allergic responses against innocuous\n      substances such as grass pollen can be overridden."

            "textblock": "The study will be conducted over 44 months. We expect to screen 70 atopic patients in order\n      to enroll 44 suitable atopic participants to ensure randomisation of at least 40 atopic\n      participants following their baseline visit. Additionally, we shall recruit 20 healthy,\n      non-atopic volunteers. Individuals with moderate to severe grass pollen hay fever, with or\n      without associated seasonal asthma, will be recruited and screened after the pollen season\n      from September through December 2013. Atopic Participants will undergo baseline assessments\n      in December 2013 and January 2014. All screening assessments will be completed before\n      eligible participants are randomized to active or placebo treatment. Atopic participants\n      will then begin AIT treatment in January-February 2014 and continue treatment for 12 months.\n      All atopic participants will be provided with anti-allergic rescue medications\n      (antihistamine tablets, topical intranasal corticosteroids, and eye-drops) throughout the\n      pollen season. Clinical surrogate endpoint assessments, plus blood, nasal fluid and nasal\n      brushing sampling, will be performed at baseline (December 2013-January 2014), at 4, 8 and\n      16 weeks after starting the AIT, and at 7 and at 12 months (January 2015) of treatment.\n      Nasal mucosal biopsies will be taken at baseline, 7 months, and 12 months of treatment.\n      After 12 months of treatment, unblinding will take place. Those atopic participants\n      receiving active AIT treatment will continue therapy for another 12 months followed by a\n      withdrawal phase of 12 months. Blood samples and nasal biopsies will be taken from these\n      participants again at 24 and at 36 months from the initial start of treatment. Those atopic\n      participants on placebo will be offered 24 months of active treatment after unblinding.\n\n      20 healthy, non-atopic participants will also be recruited and studied on a single day\n      before and after nasal challenge at one timepoint at 12 months. They will undergo the same\n      clinical and immunological measurements as for the 44 randomised subjects participating in\n      the clinical trial. The healthy subjects will undergo no therapeutic intervention and serve\n      as controls for the immunological measurements.\n\n      The study will receive monitoring by:\n\n        -  the sponsor, Imperial College London\n\n      and audits by:\n\n        -  Medicines for human use (clinical trials) regulations authority (MHRA)\n\n      We will assess the clinical data on paper case report forms and will use Inform as a\n      database in order to verify completeness of data entry.\n\n      The Inform database also includes normal ranges of parameters if relevant.\n\n      Standard Operating Procedures are in place regarding clinical measures (e.g. nasal allergen\n      challenges, nasal biopsies etc.) as well as data management (e.g. the Trial Master File),\n      reporting of adverse events and data collection. All involved investigators are informed\n      about these procedures and have current Good Clinical Practice (GMC) instructions.\n\n      Statistical analysis will be with non-parametric statistics taking into account treatment\n      effect baseline values and visit number. Inclusion of 20 participants per group will give\n      greater than 90% power (p=0.05) to detect a 40% reduction in the early phase response (EPR)\n      after nasal challenge (AUC of the TNSS in the first 60 minutes after challenge, a 40%\n      reduction in the skin LPR, and a 50% increase in grass pollen allergen specific\n      immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) for AIT vs. placebo.\n\n      Based on more recent nasal allergen challenge studies (Scadding et al, unpublished data;\n      mean 4.63, standard deviation 1.65 for AUC 0-60 minutes post grass pollen nasal challenge in\n      14 allergic volunteers), inclusion of 13 patients per group will provide 80% power to detect\n      a 40% reduction in AUC after challenge, whereas inclusion of 22 patients per group will\n      provide 80% power to detect a 30% reduction.\n\n      Further based on a recent study (Scadding et al, unpublished data; mean 70.14, standard\n      deviation 14.17 for cross-sectional area in cm2 at 8 hours for skin late phase response to\n      intradermal grass pollen injection), inclusion of 7 participants per group will provide 80%\n      power to detect a 30% reduction, whereas inclusion of 10 participants per group will provide\n      90% power to detect a 30% reduction.\n\n      Intent-to-treat (ITT) sample will be defined as all randomized participants. ITT\n      participants will be analysed with the group to which they were randomized, regardless of\n      the medication actually received. If participants drop out post randomisation, they will be\n      invited to complete study assessments throughout the duration of the trial.\n\n      Per-protocol (PP) sample will be defined as ITT sample participants who remain in the study\n      for 12 months and in whom the primary endpoints were assessed. Participants in the PP sample\n      must be compliant with study medication, defined as taking 75% or more of their study\n      medication for the duration of the study. Compliance with study medication will be as\n      assessed by pill count for AIT/placebo. Participants in the PP sample will be analysed with\n      the group to which they were randomized.\n\n      Safety sample (SS) will be defined as all randomized participants who received at least one\n      dose of study medication. Participants in the safety sample will be analysed with the group\n      according to the medication they actually received, regardless of their randomized\n      assignment.\n\n      Analysis of study data will be conducted to address all objectives of the trial and other\n      interrelationships among all data elements of interest to the investigators and of relevance\n      to the objectives of the study. Primary analysis of treatment effect will be conducted under\n      the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle of eligible patients, whereby outcome data from all\n      eligible patients will be included regardless of treatment compliance. In addition to the\n      analyses described in sections below, summary descriptive statistics will be provided in the\n      following manner: continuous data will be summarized descriptively by mean, standard\n      deviation, median, and range; categorical data will be presented as enumerations and\n      percentages.\n\n      Analysis of primary endpoint:\n\n      The primary endpoint will be analysed using the ITT sample. The analysis of the primary\n      endpoint will compare the mean EPR to nasal challenge recorded by the AUC of the TNSS during\n      the first 60 minutes after the nasal challenge, at 12 months of therapy. Comparison between\n      active and placebo groups will be assessed using ANOVA at the 0.05 level of significance.\n\n      Analysis of secondary endpoint:\n\n      All secondary analyses will be treated as supportive. P-values will be presented for the\n      secondary endpoints but will not be adjusted for multiplicity and should be interpreted with\n      caution. Findings will be evaluated in the context of the available body of knowledge and\n      with respect to other findings."
