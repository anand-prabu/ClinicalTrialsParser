  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of
      BYM338 in patients with COPD and cachexia.  The primary outcome will be a change in thigh
      muscle volume compared to placebo.  The study will last for approximately 24 weeks.
