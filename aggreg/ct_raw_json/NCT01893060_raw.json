Bacterial colonization can\n      occur at the umbilical stump and potentially lead to serious bloodstream infections (BSIs).\n      This study is a prospective, randomized controlled feasibility trial to evaluate three types\n      of hygiene products on umbilical line stumps, on the effect of line colonization and\n      subsequent infections. Infants admitted to the NICU with an umbilical line(s) will be\n      randomized into one of four study groups, three products against standard of care (no\n      product). The three products that will be evaluated are currently being used in different\n      capacities for skin care in the University of Virginia (UVA) NICU. The study hypothesizes\n      that twice daily topical application of 1 or more antiseptic to the top of the umbilical\n      stump will decrease colonization of the umbilical stump while umbilical lines are in place."

(www.CDC.gov - NSHN 2010 Report).\n      Routine care of the skin entry site (e.g. central line dressing care) is standard for other\n      central lines, but there is no standard for care of the umbilical stump while umbilical\n      lines are in place.\n\n      In a pilot study to evaluate the relationship of umbilical stump colonization with\n      gestational age, the number of days the catheter was in place, and the type of organisms,\n      colonization was detected in 78% of patients. There was a direct correlation with\n      colonization and line days as well as an inverse relationship with lower gestational age.\n\n      This pilot data supported the need for the study of interventions to reduce umbilical stump\n      colonization, which may help decrease blood stream infections (BSIs) associated with\n      umbilical lines in the NICU.
