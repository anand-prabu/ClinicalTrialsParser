Polyunsaturated\n      fatty acids (PUFA) including omega-3 is known to  affect the risk for coronary disease,\n      however its effect on patients with FH is not known.\n\n      The purpose of the study is to assess the effect of PUFA on patients with FH, with regard to\n      inflammation measured in the blood and the effect on the blood vessels`ability to relax\n      (endothelial function) by means of tonometry.\n\n      Hypothesis\n\n      Treatment with 4 grams of PUFA a day for 4 months will lead to an improvement in the\n      endothelial function, and the treatment will also lead to a decrease in in several markers\n      of inflammation and in lipids in the blood."
