            "textblock": "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a serious, complex and extremely debilitating chronic\n      illness, but often misunderstood characterized by prolonged fatigue, the hallmark of the\n      condition and multiple nonspecific symptoms. The World Health Organization has recognized\n      CFS as a disease that affecting the nervous system (ICD-10 G93.3) and multiple body systems.\n      The etiology is unknown. Previous studies have demonstrated in CFS patients a significant\n      reduction in plasma and intracellular Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells concentrations of\n      CoQ10 and NADH, which correlate with clinical symptoms of the disease. Hypothesis:\n      Supplementation with CoQ10 plus NADH could be beneficial in the improvement of clinical and\n      molecular parameters in this disease. The primary endpoint is to evaluate the efficacy of\n      oral Reconnect \u00ae suplementation in CFS patients in the variations of the maximum heart rate\n      during the exercise test. The secondary endpoint are to evaluate the effect of Reconnect \u00ae\n      suplementation at maximum load reached during the exercise test, maximum oxygen consumption,\n      maximum C02 production, perception of fatigue assessed by the FIS, pain perception; McGill\n      Pain Index questionnaire, and sleep dysfunction; Pittsburgh Sleep Index Questionnaire.\n\n      Patients and Methods: A total of 80 consecutive women patients with a diagnosis of CFS\n      according to the 1994 CDC Fukuda's case definition criteria were initially evaluated and\n      enrolled in this study. The majority were excluded for no meet the inclusion criteria of the\n      study. All subjects are treatment with ReConnect\u00ae containing NADH plus CoQ10 versus placebo.\n      Fatigue, pain and sleep disturbances are scored using the Fatigue Impact Scale, McGill Pain\n      Questionnaire and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, respectively.\n\n      Discussion: To our knowledge, no previous studies have yet evaluated the effectiveness of\n      oral ReConnect supplementation in CFS patients. ReConnect containing the combination of\n      CoQ10 plus NADH and other nutrients (phosphoserine/serine and Vitamin C) can help to improve\n      clinical symptoms and restore mitochondrial function and oxidative stress damage reducing\n      fatigue, pain and sleep impairments in CFS patients. The combination of these supplements\n      can result in a safe and effective therapy to reduce fatigue, chronic pain and help restore\n      quality of life of CFS patients."
