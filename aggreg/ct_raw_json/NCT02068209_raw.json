The invitation will include a clear full explanation of the study and patients\n      will provide written consents. Only patients consenting to participate will be included in\n      the trial.\n\n      Tramadol and placebo will be enclosed in sealed envelopes which will be numbered using a\n      computer generated random table. Neither the patient nor the physician will be aware of the\n      drug used. Patients will be categorized into 2 groups: Group I who will receive Tramadol\n      50mg (Tramadol, October Pharma, Giza, Egypt) 1 hour before the procedure, group II who will\n      received a placebo acting as the control group.\n\n      Full history will be taken followed by general and local examination. The procedure will be\n      done in the lithotomy position. Hysteroscopy will be done using a 5mm outer diameter\n      continuous flow hysteroscope with a French working channel and a 30 degrees direction of\n      view provided by Techno GmbH and CO. The hysteroscope will be introduced using the\n      vaginoscopy technique, in which no speculum will be used. The cervix will be detected and\n      the external os will be identified using the hysteroscope. The hysteroscope will be\n      introduced in the uterine cavity. Saline will be used as the distension medium and the\n      pressure will be set at 100mm Hg. The anterior wall, posterior wall and tubal ostea will be\n      visualized, any polyps, adhesions septa, congenital malformations or submucous fibroids will\n      be noted.\n\n      Base line characteristics will be compared and the main outcome measure will be patients'\n      pain perception during the procedure and 30 minutes later, this will be determined using a\n      visual analogue scale."
