Determine the efficacy and toxic effects of recombinant human insulin-like\n      growth factor I (rhIGF-I) on carbohydrate tolerance, insulin action, insulin secretion,\n      hyperandrogenism, and hyperlipidemia in patients with severe insulin resistance who have\n      failed other therapies.\n\n      II. Determine the dose and time response of rhIGF-I on carbohydrate homeostasis and\n      secondary abnormalities in this patient population.\n\n      III. Determine the effect of rhIGF-I on insulin clearance, the regulation of insulin-like\n      growth factor binding protein 1, the regulation of sex hormone binding globulin, and\n      hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis in this patient population."

Patients receive the first dose of\n      subcutaneous recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I (rhIGF-I) on day 7.\n\n      Patients receive rhIGF-I twice daily 15-30 minutes before breakfast and dinner, and are\n      hospitalized for the first week of therapy. Patients return for an outpatient exam on day 19\n      of rhIGF-I therapy. Approximately 30 days into the therapy, patients are readmitted to the\n      clinical center for repeat screening tests. Patients then receive maintenance therapy of\n      rhIGF-I for up to 6-12 months. A washout period follows the maintenance therapy phase.\n\n      Patients are followed weekly, biweekly, or monthly depending on blood glucose response of\n      patients off rhIGF-I therapy. Weekly phone contact with study coordinator is mandatory\n      during this time."
