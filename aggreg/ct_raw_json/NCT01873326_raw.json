In exceptional circumstances, patients without pathological diagnosis\n             may be included in the study following discussion with the national principal\n             investigator, Dr. Feldman,(or national Co-PI or MSKCC Co-PI if the national PI is\n             unavailable) if they meet the one of the following criteria:\n\n               -  Patients with a testicular mass (detected clinically and/or by ultrasound),\n                  and/or mediastinal or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy or pineal tumor AND\n                  elevated serum tumor markers (HCG and/or AFP). Patients with elevated LDH only\n                  will not be included without pathological confirmation of GCT since LDH is a\n                  nonspecific marker for GCT and could potentially be elevated in other\n                  malignancies such as lymphomas.\n\n        This is because patients may present with a clinical scenario consistent with GCT\n        (elevated serum tumor markers, testicular mass and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy) with a\n        concurrent life-threatening oncologic emergency that require immediate treatment. In this\n        case, initial treatment without biopsy confirmation is usually recommended and tissue\n        confirmation may be obtained after initiating therapy.\n\n          -  Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease.\n\n          -  Patients who received prior radiation therapy (RT) for treatment of germ cell tumor\n             are eligible for this study as long as there is evidence of progressive disease\n             determined by tumor markers or other sites of metastases outside of the radiated\n             site. Radiation must be completed prior to starting chemotherapy with the exception\n             of brain metastases where chemotherapy and radiation can be given concurrently.\n             Toxicity from radiation must have recovered to grade 1 or less prior to initiating\n             chemotherapy.\n\n          -  Patients must have recovered from prior surgery based on treating physician's\n             discretion.\n\n          -  Patients of reproductive potential must agree to use effective contraception during\n             the period of therapy\n\n          -  Signed informed consent.\n\n          -  Diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) adjusted for hemoglobin \u226560%\n             predicted, except if related to high volume metastatic GCT to the lungs in which case\n             there is no minimum DLCO requirement. In rare cases, such patients who may not be\n             able to undergo PFT testing due to the severity of their presentation.

In the setting of metastatic\n                  disease to the liver, AST/ALT may be \u22645x ULN and total bilirubin \u22642.5 x ULN.

Serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) from 5,000 to < 50,000 MIU/mL\n\n        iii. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) from 1,000 to <10,000 ng/mL\n\n          -  Seminoma histology regardless the primary site or serum tumor markers with any\n             non-pulmonary visceral metastasis (liver, bone, brain, etc)\n\n               -  Poor-risk (any of the following):\n\n                    1. Testis or retroperitoneal primary with non-pulmonary visceral metastasis\n                       (liver, bone, brain, etc) regardless the STM values.\n\n                    2. Mediastinal primary site of disease regardless the presence/absence of\n                       visceral metastasis or STM values.\n\n                    3. Testis or retroperitoneal primary without non-pulmonary visceral metastasis\n                       but with poor-risk STM values: i. LDH \u2265 10 x ULN ii.

The only exception will be patients with a history of stage I\n             seminoma treated with adjuvant carboplatin for 1 or 2 cycles.\n\n          -  Concurrent treatment with any cytotoxic therapy.\n\n          -  Known concurrent malignancy (except for non-melanoma skin cancer).\n\n          -  Patients known to be HIV positive and receiving HAART.\n\n          -  Presence of an active infection. Patients with fever assessed to be \"tumor fever\" but\n             without active evidence of infection (e.g. blood cultures are negative) are eligible.\n             In addition, patients who have an infection but without evidence of fever for 48\n             hours on antibiotics will be eligible.\n\n          -  Inability to comply with the treatment protocol or to undergo prespecified follow-up\n             tests for safety or effectiveness.\n\n          -  Pregnant patients are ineligible"
