Our\n      previous studies in animal models of ITP demonstrated that intravenous immunoglobulin G\n      (IVIG) could protect against anti-GPIIb/IIIa-mediated thrombocytopenia but failed to\n      ameliorate ITP induced by most anti-GPIb/IX antibodies. The objective of this human study\n      was to evaluate the association between the specificity of anti-platelet autoantibodies and\n      response to IVIG treatment."
