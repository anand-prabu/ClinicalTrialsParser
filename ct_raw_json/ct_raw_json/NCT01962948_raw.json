Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as\n      paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the\n      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Ganetespib may stop the growth of tumor cells by\n      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving paclitaxel and ganetespib may be\n      an effective treatment for ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer."

Clinical response rate (partial and complete responses as defined\n      by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1 criteria). (Phase II)\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of ganetespib and weekly paclitaxel in this\n      cohort of patients as measured by the frequency and severity of adverse reactions. (Phase I)\n      II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of ganetespib and weekly paclitaxel in this\n      cohort of patients as measured by the frequency and severity of adverse reactions\n      encountered. (Phase II) III. Duration of progression-free survival. (Phase II)\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of ganetespib followed by a phase II\n      study.\n\n      Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and ganetespib IV over 1 hour on\n      days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,\n      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter."
