All patients will be scanned before, during and after\n      chemotherapy. The findings on MRI will be correlated with histological finding after\n      surgery.\n\n      Second purpose : to define apparent diffusion coefficient value of the bone sarcoma.\n\n      Third purpose : to try define prognostic factors, to investigate if there is a correlation\n      between early treatment response and outcome."
