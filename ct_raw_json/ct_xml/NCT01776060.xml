      The goal of this study is to enroll 100 participants with Primary Progressive Multiple
      Sclerosis (PPMS) that have joined the MURDOCK Study Horizon 1.5 (Duke IRB Pro00011196) and
      the Multiple Sclerosis cohort (Duke IRB Pro00023791).  All 100 participants will complete a
      biannual collection of a follow up questionnaire and blood/urine collection for a period of
      5 years.

      Unlike Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) or Secondary Progressive Multiple
      Sclerosis (SPMS) in which patients experience a remission or lessening of their symptoms,
      Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS) is characterized by progression of disability
      from onset, with no, or only occasional and minor, remissions and improvements. The age of
      onset for the primary progressive subtype is later than for the relapsing-remitting, but
      similar to mean the age of progression between the relapsing-remitting and the secondary
      progressive - around 40 years of age. Because of its prevalence, RRMS represents the largest
      basis for basic and clinical MS research. Therefore, drugs have primarily been developed to
      slow disease progression in RRMS and SPMS patients. No treatment has been proven successful
      in treating primary progressive MS.

      The MURDOCK-MS collection represents a unique opportunity to carry out detailed biomarker
      research on PPMS patients and, to the knowledge of this investigator and his colleagues in
      the field, would represent an exceptional cohort  that is not available elsewhere in the US
      or the rest of the world. Aside from first in disease sampling, the serial, biannual
      collection of samples from PPMS patients would not only permit the identification of 'omic
      profiles that can be compared and contrasted to those from RRMS patients in a parallel
      study, but it would also allow the generation of 'omic markers of disease progression. This
      progressive etiology would provide valuable insight into PPMS development and may also shed
      light on SPMS progression.

        Participants must enroll in the MURDOCK Study Horizon 1.5 (Pro00011196) as well as the
        Multiple Sclerosis cohort (Pro00023791) in order to participate in this biannual
        collection of a follow up questionnaire and blood/urine collection for participants who
        have Primary Progressive MS.  The biannual collection will continue for 5 years. Those
        participants with PPMS who are already enrolled in the MURDOCK Study Horizon 1.5 and
        Multiple Sclerosis cohort will be contacted via phone to assess interest in the PPMS
        study.  New participants with PPMS who enroll into the Horizon 1.5 study and Multiple
        Sclerosis cohort will be asked during the time of enrollment if they would like to
        participate in the PPMS study as well.
