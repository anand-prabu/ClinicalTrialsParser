Postmenopausal women with at least Stage 2 pelvic organ prolapse will\n      receive either estrogen vaginal cream or placebo cream 6-8 weeks prior to reconstructive\n      surgery.  At time of surgery, full thickness biopsies will be obtained from a standardized\n      location at the top of vagina.  The investigators will measure the thickness of the vaginal\n      muscularis, elastic fiber number and morphology, and analyze if elastic fiber synthesis or\n      degradation is affected by estrogen therapy.  The results will provide important data to\n      support a larger clinical trial to determine if preoperative and maintenance estrogen\n      therapy alter long-term success rates of pelvic reconstructive surgery for pelvic organ\n      prolapse."
