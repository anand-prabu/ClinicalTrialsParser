  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The burden of iatrogenic bile duct injury (BDI), the most feared complication of
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), is extremely high and the repercussions on the patient's
      outcomes may be severe ranging from intraoperative repair to liver transplant or patient's
      death. Different techniques have been proposed to prevent BDI.

      Our hypothesis is that a fluorescence-based Imaging would allow visualization of the biliary
      tree anatomy as good as with the Intraoperative Cholangiogram with several main advantages:

        1. ease of use

        2. lack of invasiveness

        3. absence of ionizing radiation to the patient and the operating staff

        4. performed prior to any dissection (prior to &quot;critical view of safety&quot;)

      Capacity of enhanced-reality based on virtual cholangiography (computer treatment of MRI
      images) to guide biliary tree anatomy visualization will be also evaluated in this study.

      The study requires a 2-month patient participation.
