    <textblock>
      The study will be an open label, long term extension to Study AMB115811. All subject may
      continue in the extension study until one of the following conditions is met: The product is
      approved locally and made commercially available for use in inoperable CTEPH subjects;
      development for use in the CTEPH population is discontinued or product is not approved by
      the local regulatory authority and the investigator decides to discontinue the subject or
      subject decides to discontinue from the study.

      The primary purpose of this study is to provide clinically relevant information on the long
      term safety of ambrisentan in subjects with inoperable CTEPH.

             &gt;= 3x Upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Subjects with bilirubin &gt;= 2xULN (&gt;35% direct bilirubin)

          -  Subjects with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance &lt;30 millilitre
             per minute (mL/min) assessed within the previous 45 days) at the point of transition
             from Study AMB115811

          -  Subject has moderate - severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B-C with or
             without cirrhosis) at the point of transition from study AMB115811

          -  Subject with clinically significant fluid retention in the opinion of the
             investigator

          -  Subject with clinically significant anemia in the opinion of the investigator
