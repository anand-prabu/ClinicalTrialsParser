CB1R are present in everyone's brain, regardless of whether or not\n      someone has used cannabis. The investigators will image brain cannabinoid receptors using\n      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging and the radioligand OMAR, in healthy individuals\n      and several conditions including 1) cannabis use disorders, 2) psychotic disorders, 3)\n      prodrome of psychotic illness and 4) individuals with a family history of alcoholism, using\n      the PET imaging agent or radiotracer, [11C]OMAR. This will allow us to characterize the\n      number and distribution of CB1R in these conditions. It is likely that the list of\n      conditions will be expanded after the collection of pilot data and as new data on\n      cannabinoids receptor function and psychiatric disorders becomes available.\n\n      Those in the cannabis us disorder arm of the study will have a PET scan on at least three\n      occasions:  once while smoking as usual, once after 48-hours of abstinence from cannabis,\n      and a final time after 4 weeks of abstinence.  Additional scans may be conducted within the\n      4 weeks and the last scan may be conducted well beyond 4 weeks.  Similarly, while most\n      schizophrenia patients may get scanned just once, a subgroup of patients may get scanned\n      more than once.  For example to tease out the effects of medications, unmedicated patients\n      may get scanned while unmedicated and again after treatment with antipsychotic medications.\n       Similarly prodromes may get scanned while in the prodromal stage off medications, on\n      medications and after conversion to schizophrenia."
