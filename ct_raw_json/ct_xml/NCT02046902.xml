  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to gather input from patients who have undergone PCI, their family
      and/or caregivers, and clinicians to develop a patient decision aid. The purpose of the
      decision aid is to deliver information, including individualized estimates of patients'
      restenosis risk, in an understandable format that would be informative and assist in
      decision-making for patients undergoing PCI.

      Study Plan: Qualitative research methods (focus groups) will be used to gather the
      information that would be helpful in decision making as well as review several possible
      output formats. Several sets of focus groups will be convened, with particular attention to
      recruitment of a diverse population, including women and underserved minority groups.

      Study Procedure: We will gather input to create a clinically useful format for presenting
      the risk estimates for desired outcomes and support clinical decision-making.

      Subjects:  We anticipate 2 or 3 patient focus groups of 6-8 individuals and 2 clinician
      focus groups of 3-5 individuals will be scheduled.  Fliers will be posted to enlist
      potential patients.  If necessary, patients will also be contacted by a Cardiovascular
      Research Coordinator and invited to attend a scheduled focus group.   After receiving
      patient/family/caregiver input, selected clinicians from the Saint Lukes Hospital Staff,
      including cardiologists, cardiac nurses and other cardiology staff, will be invited to
      attend a scheduled focus group. The invitation will be sent via email and followed up with a
      phone call, if necessary. If a clinician focus group is unable to be scheduled, then
      individual interviews will be conducted.

      Setting: Patient and Clinician focus group sessions will be held at Saint Luke's Hospital.

    <description>Given that the purpose of this study is to elicit from patients and their caregivers what the most important outcomes of PCI, how they vary by stent choice and the optimal mode of presenting these outcomes, we will use a qualitative research approach where the Research team will review all transcripts seeking theoretical saturation (no new information is gained from subsequent Groups) which signals full illumination of patients' perspectives and the end of the study. The transcripts come from audiotaping each Focus Group where a trained facilitator will lead a discussion of: participant experiences of PCI procedures or other medical/surgical procedure preparation; elicitation of key outcomes (avoiding repeat procedures, costs, bleeding, etc.). In addition, examples of potential visual displays of risk and benefit presentations will be shown; and consensus will be achieved for each Focus Group on the clearest, most optimal mode of presentation.</description>
