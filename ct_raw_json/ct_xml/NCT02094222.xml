  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Byler Disease is the result of a homozygous missense (G308V) mutation in the ATP8B1 gene.
      The disease is typically manifest in the first year of life on the basis of complications of
      cholestasis; common presentations include jaundice, poor growth, bleeding related to vitamin
      K deficiency, and/or weak bones related to vitamin D deficiency.  Early management of Byler
      Disease is directed at nutritional issues which tend to be responsive to medical
      intervention, unlike the pruritus/scratching which remains a devastating problem.
      Progressive liver disease develops in Byler Disease and can lead to cirrhosis and end-stage
      liver disease.  This is an open label expanded access protocol of RAVICTI in children with
      Byler Disease.  The primary hypothesis is that the administration of RAVICTI in these
      children is feasible, well tolerated and safe.  It is also hypothesized that RAVICTI
      treatment leads to an improvement in biochemical markers of liver disease and it may
      ameliorates or prevents the development of scratching behavior as a manifestation of
      pruritus attributed to the liver disease.
