The CAA results are compared to the findings of the medical\n      professionals as well as to the echocardiogram findings.\n\n      Hypothesis: The specific CAA algorithms used in this study are able to automatically\n      diagnose pathological heart murmurs in premature babies and newborns with at least the same\n      accuracy as experienced medical specialists."
