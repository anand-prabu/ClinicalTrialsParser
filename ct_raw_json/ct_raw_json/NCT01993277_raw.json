We intend to enroll 200 patients to give us a\n      sufficient number of subjects for the planned comparisons.  Following informed consent and\n      baseline assessment, patients will be randomly assigned to receive either 1) 15 40-minute\n      sessions of Nexalin Brain Stimulator, a cranial electrical stimulation (CES) device,\n      once-per-day within a 3-week time-frame; 2) 30 20-minute sessions of the Fischer Wallace\n      Stimulator, another CES device, twice-per-day within a 3-week time-frame; 3) 15 40-minute\n      sessions of the DAVID Delight, an audio-visual stimulation device (AVS), once-per-day within\n      a 3-week time-frame; OR 4) the control-group condition of 15 40-minute relaxation therapy\n      sessions once-per-day within a 3-week time-frame. All subjects will then be reassessed at\n      the end of the 3 weeks of treatment and again 1, 3, and 6 months later.  In addition to the\n      assigned treatments, all patients will also receive the standard array of services that are\n      provided by Behavioral Health of the Palm Beaches (BHOPB) including as clinically\n      appropriate, psychiatric medication management and Eye Movement Desensitization Response\n      (EMDR) therapy.  Patients diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are assessed\n      to determine their suitability for EMDR and if suitable, will receive 2 or more EMDR\n      sessions.  Patients without PTSD do not receive EMDR therapy."
