      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of closed loop insulin pump
      therapy to control blood sugar following total pancreatectomy and islet auto-transplantation
      (TPIAT).

      OBJECTIVES AND HYPOTHESES The main objective of this study is to determine if a closed loop
      insulin system can successfully achieve tighter blood sugar control than the current
      multiple daily injection regimen.  The investigators hypothesize that the average blood
      glucose will be lower in the closed loop group than the control group, there will be less
      glucose variability in the closed loop group than the control group, and there will be less
      total time spent in hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia in the closed loop group than in the
      control group.  The investigators also will investigate insulin requirements and islet
      function in the first 6 months post-transplant in the closed loop group  The investigators
      hypothesize that the insulin requirements will be lower and the C-peptide levels higher in
      the closed loop group than in the control group.
