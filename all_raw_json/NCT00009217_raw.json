Outpatients with AD who meet inclusion/ exclusion criteria\n      enter Phase A, the 20 week open acute treatment phase that uses a flexible dose regimen of\n      haloperidol 1-5 mg daily.  Haloperidol is started at an oral dose of 1 mg daily, with\n      subsequent dose titration in 1 mg increments until the optimal dose is reached, i.e.,\n      optimal trade-off between efficacy and side effects.  At the end of Phase A, patients who do\n      not meet criteria for clinical response exit the protocol and is treated openly with\n      alternative medications.\n\n      Phase A responders enter Phase B, a 24-week random assignment, placebo-controlled,\n      continuation trial.  Randomization is stratified by the severity of dementia and by the\n      presence of psychosis.  Half the patients are randomized to haloperidol (continuing at the\n      same dose as at the end of Phase A), and the other half are randomized to placebo.  Patients\n      who relapse during Phase B exit the protocol and receive open treatment.\n\n      In Phase A, patients are followed at 0, 2, 4 weeks and every 4 weeks thereafter until 20\n      weeks.  In the discontinuation trial, Phase B, patients are followed at 0, 1, 2, 4, week\n      time points and every 4 weeks thereafter until 24 weeks.  If a patient shows signs of\n      relapse, the patient is brought in for more frequent visits, regardless of the stage of the\n      protocol."
