      AIM: To validate the tracer [11C]donepezil for use in the parasympathetic nervous system.

      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Investigators will include 6 healthy males aged 45-75 in our
      study. The participants will receive a careful medical examination, including a neurological
      examination, as part of the inclusion process. The subjects also have an MRI scan of the
      brain. The PET/CT scans with [11C]donepezil are conducted - once for the upper abdominal
      region and once for the head region.

      PERSPECTIVES: The study will potentially result in the development of a PET ligand for
      imaging the parasympathetic nervous system. This will have applications for research in
      Parkinson's disease, diabetes, heart disease and other disorders, in which the autonomic
      nervous system is involved
