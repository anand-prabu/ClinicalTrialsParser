    <textblock>
      The purpose of this quality improvement project is to improve the immunization rates of an
      at-risk adult population seen in an ambulatory healthcare environment, through the use of
      targeted health education messages regarding pneumococcal immunization. Patients seen in an
      out-patient pre-surgical testing center will receive 1) a one-page written information sheet
      that outlines the benefits of pneumococcal immunization and 2) verbal reinforcement of this
      message, provided by the clinical staff, during the patient's interview.

      At-risk adult patients (as defined by Centers for Disease Control) seen in an ambulatory
      healthcare environment (a pre-surgical testing center) will receive a one page,
      &quot;gain-framed&quot; message that emphasizes the benefits of pneumococcal vaccinations. This
      educational material will be reviewed and reinforced by clinical staff during the assessment
      phase of the clinical visit. Among this group, there will be increased vaccination rate
      compared with at-risk adult patients who did not receive this communication (prospective vs
      retrospective data).
