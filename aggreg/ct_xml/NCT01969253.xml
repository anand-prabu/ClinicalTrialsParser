  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past few years, several studies have been made on various outcomes about the
      incidence of lymphedema. Because the outcomes can be came out differently each study by
      measurement, criteria, treatment period, treatment method and morbid extremities of
      lymphedema. Therefore it is required for understanding about the incidence, risk factor and
      physical progress for to be treated and prevented of lymphedema. Also it is necessary that
      to understand characteristics of lymphedema measurements and to establish diagnostic
      criteria of lymphedema through comparative study.

      The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence and risk factor of lymphedema through
      prospectively observation, and to determine effects on the quality of life of lymphedema
      after breast cancer surgery with ALND.

      Primary Objectives:

      - To analyze incidence rate of lymphedema using tape measurements, perometre, bioimpedance,
      spectroscopy.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the risk factor of lymphedema in postoperative breast cancer.

        -  To understand that lymphedema has an effect on quality of life and physical function in
           postoperative breast cancer.

        -  To complete uestionnaire about physical and quality of life in postoperative breast
           cancer with ALND patients.

        This prospective study is observational study that focused on incidence of lymphedema in
        breast cancer patients. Annually six hundred patients have received treatment of breast
        cancer from the breast cancer center at National Cancer Center in Korea. Among of them,
        two hundred patients have received surgical treatment with axillary dissection. About four
        hundred patients were recruited consecutively for enrollment  from May 2012 to December
        2013.
