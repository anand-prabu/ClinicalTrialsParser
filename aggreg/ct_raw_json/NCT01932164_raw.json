            "textblock": "The reconstruction of the craniofacial skeleton in development between 2 and 10 years old,\n      remains a major challenge for reconstructive plastic surgery. Local autogenous bone is\n      practically unavailable, the distant bone graft has significant morbidity and use of\n      alloplastic materials is incompatible with the growing facial skeleton. With the advent of\n      bioengineered tissue, however, osteogenesis induced by the use of mesenchymal stem cells\n      associated with biomaterials has become a potential solution to the shortage bone-related\n      morbidity and donor bone in the region in pediatric patients.\n\n      The association of mesenchymal stem  cells to biomaterials has provided new bone formation\n      and a significant reduction of morbidity, for rehabilitation of the alveolar bone in\n      patients with cleft lip palate.\n\n      To perform the rehabilitation of alveolar bone cleft, other donor regions of bone (iliac\n      crest, ribs, skull) suffer morbidity for obtaining bone to be used in alveolar bone\n      grafting. In order to eliminate the morbidity at the  bone  donor region for these patients\n      and reduce costs of patient permanence in the operating room  the aim of this study is  to\n      perform the bone tissue engineering to reconstruct the alveolar bone defect in cleft lip and\n      palate patients using mesenchymal stem cells from deciduous dental pulp associated with a\n      collagen  and hydroxyapatite biomaterial (Geistlich Bio-Oss\u00ae) through prospective\n      qualitative and quantitative analysis of bone neoformation."
