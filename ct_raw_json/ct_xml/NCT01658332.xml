      TITLE : Circulating tumor cells identification in advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer
      (CIRCUBRONCH)

      BACKGROUND : Circulating tumor cells identification is a new field of research in oncology,
      and some studies have been conducted with success on breast and prostate cancer. Nearly 80%
      of lung cancers are diagnosed in an advanced stage (IIIB, and IV). Circulating tumor cells
      identification and monitoring these cells after treatment could help the clinicians to
      detect relapse or be a prognostic factor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : Circulating tumor cells identification, and monitoring in advanced stage
      lung cancers (IIIB and IV).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : Predictive value of the monitoring of circulating tumor cells on the
      therapeutic response. Prognostic value of identification of circulating tumor cells at the
      time of diagnosis.

      STUDY DESIGN : This study is a prospective, monocentrique trial analyzing the identification
      of circulating tumor cells in stage IIIB, and IV non-small cell lung cancers.

      Duration of the inclusions: 18 months.

      Duration of the study: 30 months.

      PROCEDURES : Detection of circulating tumor cells with CellSearch system (Veridex), and a
      cut-off of 5 cells/7,5 ml of blood.

      SAMPLE SIZE : 200 patients

      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : Detection of circulating tumor cells is predicted in 20% of stage
      IIIB, and IV non-small cell lung cancers included in this study. The cut-off is 5
      circulating tumor cells per 7,5 ml of blood.
