  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colloid solution is generally used to maintain intravascular volume. It is reported to
      impair blood coagulation in vivo and in vitro more than crystalloid does by prolonging
      coagulation time and decreasing clot strength. The formed fibrin clot is more vulnerable for
      fibrinolysis in a case of using colloid. Dilution of plasmin in vitro with colloid enhances
      fibrinolysis primarily by diminishing Î±2-antiplasmin-plasmin interaction.

      Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytics that competitively inhibits the activation of
      plasminogen, by binding to specific site of both plasminogen and plasmin, a molecule
      responsible for the degradation of fibrin, a protein that forms the framework of blood clot.
      It is used to treat or prevent excessive blood loss during surgery and in other medical
      conditions. Gastrointestinal effect, dizziness, fatigue, headache, hypersensitivity
      reaction, or potential risk of thrombosis is reported as the adverse effect of tranexamic
      acid.

      We hypothesized that inhibition of plasmin by tranexamic acid after colloid administration
      can improve the colloid-induced clot strength impairment.
