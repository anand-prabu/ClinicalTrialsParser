Regardless of the chronic dose, all patients will receive Dabigatran 110 mg BID for\n      5 days prior to device surgery and for the 5 days following surgery.  The peri-operative\n      management of Dabigatran 110 mg BID is randomized to the following:\n\n        1. Interrupted Dabigatran\n\n             -  based on renal function, patients will discontinue Dabigatran 1 day before surgery\n                if GFR > 50 mL/min, and 2 days before surgery if GFR is 30-50 mL/min.\n\n             -  Dabigatran will be resumed at the next regular dose time, at least 24 hours after\n                the end of surgery.\n\n        2. Continued Dabigatran\n\n             -  patients will continue on Dabigatran 110 mg BID throughout\n\n             -  patients will have an aPTT measured at trough (within 2 hours prior to next\n                dose)once within 5 days prior to the surgery.  If the aPTT is > 2.5 times the\n                upper limit of normal, the dose of Dabigatran will be held on the morning of\n                surgery.\n\n      All patients will have clinical lab testing of serum creatinine, CBC, INR, aPTT, thrombin\n      clotting time (TCT) and Hemoclot test on the day of surgery.\n\n      Patients will be seen post-op on the day of their surgery for assessment of the surgical\n      site and each day throughout their hospital stay by a blinded member of the research team.\n      A telephone follow-up will be done on day 3-4 post surgery by an unblinded team member.  All\n      patients are seen 1-2 weeks post-op at their first routine post-op device clinic visit, for\n      surgical site assessment by the blinded assessor and to complete Quality of Life\n      questionnaires. Patients will be seen for assessment in the case of any bleeding or\n      development of pocket swelling or hematoma. Patients developing a hematoma will be followed\n      until resolution of the hematoma."
