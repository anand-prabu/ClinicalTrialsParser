In each cohort, patients will be randomly assigned in a ratio of 3:1 to receive\n      either intraventricular EG 1962 or enteral nimodipine, respectively. The first cohort will\n      receive 100 mg EG 1962. Upon completion of the dose escalation period, a safe and tolerable\n      dose will be selected for further study.\n\n      Part 2 of the study is a treatment period to assess the safety and tolerability of the\n      selected dose of EG-1962.\n\n      The safety and tolerability of a single intraventricular dose of EG 1962 will be compared to\n      enteral nimodipine (60 mg given every 4 hours orally or via nasogastric or gastrostomy tube)\n      for 21 days."
