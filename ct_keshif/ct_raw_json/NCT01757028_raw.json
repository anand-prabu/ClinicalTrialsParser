            "textblock": "Improving maternal and infant mortality are key priorities in Kenya and internationally.\n      This study aims to establish a hospital-based surveillance system for pregnant women so that\n      the contribution of risk factors (HIV and other infections, maternal nutrition, sepsis,\n      malaria and anaemia) to maternal and infant morbidity and mortality can be accurately\n      assessed. All mothers who are admitted to Kilifi District Hospital will be invited to enrol\n      in the study. Routine clinical data from maternal admissions for delivery will be\n      systematically collected using a standardised admissions procedure. Analysis will be carried\n      out for the risk factor effects of HIV, maternal nutrition, malaria infection, bacterial\n      infection, and anaemia on maternal and infant outcomes after adjusting for other factors\n      (mode of delivery, age, and parity etc). Subsequent morbidity and survival of mothers and\n      infants, and the later consequences to children's health will be monitored through the\n      Kilifi epi-DSS. Samples for research purposes will be collected for detailed future studies\n      of particular pathogens and risk factors, such as malaria parasite strain, bacterial species\n      and HIV-induced immunological impairment. This will be the first prospective study in\n      sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) to assess the effect of these risk factors on both maternal and\n      infant health together, and that considers both short and long term outcomes. Information\n      generated by the study will be used by the maternity department in a rolling audit that will\n      help improve care. The study will therefore improve care of new mothers and infants\n      attending the Kilifi District Hospital as well as informing health planning so that future\n      interventions for maternal and child health are targeted more effectively."
