The study aims to 1) refine a curriculum for\n      non-palliative clinicians caring for persons living with HIV disease early in disease\n      trajectory; 2) assess the impact of this palliative educational intervention on outcomes for\n      2 target populations: a) staff (burn-out and caregiving stress) and b) patients (retention\n      in care, mental health, and quality of life).  It is hypothesized that training outpatient\n      HIV staff in palliative competencies will improve care provided that might, in turn, improve\n      clinical outcomes for one group of HIV patients receiving care from the clinic.\n      Quantitative data will be augmented by qualitative interviews of selected staff and patients\n      in the final year of the study to appreciate response to the intervention."

            "textblock": "Evidence exists in African populations that palliative care delivered early in HIV disease\n      trajectory can improve symptom management and mental health issues. This study represents a\n      proof of principle for HIV care delivery in the US using observed distillation of critical\n      palliative elements.\n\n      Care and Support Access (CASA) is a complex multidisciplinary care strategy in which a\n      palliative approach is integrated into the delivery of standard HIV care, using an iterative\n      teaching method and on-site mentored training of site-based care teams. CASA will implement\n      patient-centeredness into HIV treatment at the practice setting to improve patient-level\n      outcomes for persons with HIV/AIDS known to have difficulty in engaging in care, initiating\n      antiretroviral therapy (ART), and remaining in routine follow-up. This lack of retention\n      puts them at high risk for experiencing health-related symptoms and poor quality of life\n      (QOL).\n\n      The study design is quasi-experimental with longitudinal observation of the HIV positive\n      young men who have sex with men (YMSM) population and staff who deliver their care at two\n      HIV outpatient clinics. We will use mixed methods (surveys and qualitative interviews) with\n      patients and staff of these clinics.\n\n      The Specific Aims are:\n\n      (1)  To refine, deliver and determine the acceptability and applicability of an\n      interdisciplinary professional education program to prepare a site-based multidisciplinary\n      health care team to demonstrate proficiency in basic palliative domains fundamental to\n      patient-centered care being integrated with standard HIV care.\n\n      2) To describe and measure the impact of early integration of a palliative approach upon\n      YMSM relative to: a) improvement of mental health status and overall QOL; b) increased\n      retention in care measured by clinic attendance and treatment adherence.\n\n      3) To describe and measure the impact upon staff of the early integration of the palliative\n      approach with regard to: a) reducing work-related stress and burn-out and, b) obtaining\n      insights regarding the CASA experience.\n\n      The anticipated impact of the CASA study will be to improve clinical practice with regard to\n      engagement and retention of difficult to engage and retain patient populations by\n      introducing a basic palliative approach to care management."
