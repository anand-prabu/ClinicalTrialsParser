The investigators are using proven components of HIV prevention\n      interventions, social cognitive theory, self-efficacy, prospect theory, message framing, and\n      video gaming principles to develop and evaluate this interactive HIV prevention video game.\n      In Phase 1 of this project, the investigators have been working with Schell Games of\n      Pittsburgh, PA, Digitalmill of Portland, ME, and the Farnam Neighborhood House in New Haven,\n      CT to develop our interactive video game with the input from our experts and focus groups\n      and interviews with adolescents. Phase 1 has been a developmental iterative process in which\n      the investigators have been building the software for the game for the purposes of targeting\n      HIV prevention in our population of interest: young minority adolescents.  Following\n      development of the video game, the investigators will move to Phase 2 in which the\n      investigators will enroll 330 minority adolescents who are attendees at one of several\n      after-school programs in the greater New Haven area and assign them to play either the\n      experimental game or a control game. In the experimental game, the player will be presented\n      with a series of \"risk challenges\" thereby helping them to develop sex, drug and alcohol\n      negotiation and refusal skills."
