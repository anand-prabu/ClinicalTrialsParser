We will (a)\n      determine the most efficient and feasible method for recruitment; (b) understand\n      demographic, health-related, and military service-related factors influencing participation\n      so that potential biases can be identified; and (c) demonstrate that the proposed individual\n      exposure reconstruction techniques based on deployment history are feasible.\n\n      Three aims are proposed: Aim 1: Using the Department of Defense (DoD) Defense Manpower Data\n      Center (DMDC) master personnel roster, identify a representative sample of deployed Veterans\n      who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as a sample of non-deployed Veterans;\n      identify the optimal methods for recruitment of participants to Phase 1 of data collection\n      (mailed survey or telephone interview on self-reported health and military service history)\n      and assess the willingness of Veterans to visit a nearby Veterans Health Administration\n      (VHA) medical center to participate in Phase 2 in-person data collection, which includes\n      more extensive self-reported health information, lifetime exposure ascertainment, and\n      assessment of pulmonary function. Aim 2: Assess the Phase 2 participation rate of Veterans\n      using VA Boston Healthcare System as a pilot study site. Aim 3: Using publically available\n      exposure data and data from the DoD personnel file, demonstrate that the proposed individual\n      exposure reconstruction techniques are feasible.\n\n      The study is organized by the CSP Epidemiology Center program with the Seattle Epidemiologic\n      Research and Information Center serving as the CSP coordinating center. The 2 participating\n      sites are at the VA Boston Healthcare System and Durham VA Medical Center. The pilot study\n      will provide information that will allow the planning of a national, large-scale health\n      study to assess the residual effects of exposure to high levels of particulate matter while\n      deployed. This will help inform VA health policy for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans."
