Kisspeptin is a recently identified natural hormone which is\n      regulates human reproduction. Learning more about the physiological role of kisspeptins may\n      therefore give us a better understanding about human fertility, and improve the management\n      of patients with reduced fertility. The effects of sustained administration of kisspeptin on\n      hypothalamic reproductive function (i.e. Luteinising hormone pulsatility) are not known."
