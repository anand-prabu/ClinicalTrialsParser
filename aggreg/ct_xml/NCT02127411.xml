  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Benzodiazepines (BZD) are the most prescribed psychiatric drugs in Brazil, especially for
      women. Although it is recommended that the use of BZD is not greater than four weeks, there
      are many cases of prolonged use due to the lack of treatment options for dealing with
      complaints of insomnia. Given this, the aim of this project is to evaluate the program
      Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention (MBRP) for adult women with chronic use of
      benzodiazepine (BZD) to induce sleep. Specifically aims to evaluate if the MBRP program, can
      reduce the pattern of use and level of dependence of chronic users of BZD under gradual
      reduction (tapering) or cessation of the use of BZD. This study will be conducted at the
      Drug Dependency Unit (UDED) of the Department of Psychobiology of Federal University of São
      Paulo. The study will count with two groups: intervention group (IG) and control group (CG)
      (that will stay in the waitlist until the eighth month . The sample will comprise 100 women
      with chronic use of BZD as hypnotics, 50 will be randomized in the IG condition and 50 in
      the CG condition. Changes will be evaluated on several variables such as cessation and
      dependence of BZD, quality of life, sleep, anxiety, depression and sexual satisfaction
      before and after the intervention in both groups. The data will be submitted to descriptive
      and inferential bivariate and multivariate statistic analyzes. It is hoped that this study
      create subsidies for the development of complementary interventions for the management of
      withdrawal symptoms in chronic users of BZD.
