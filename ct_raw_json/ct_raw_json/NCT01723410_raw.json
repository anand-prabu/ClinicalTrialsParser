This study takes place over an eight week period and involves providing\n      the names of 8 close friends or family members, completing a neuroimaging session, providing\n      blood and saliva (for genetic analysis), and a 6-week period in which participants login\n      twice a week to complete online questionnaires. Compensation is up to $210 for those who\n      complete all aspects of the study. Please email realworld.ucla@gmail.com for more\n      information."
