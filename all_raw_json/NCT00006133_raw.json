Both strata are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n      Stratum 1 (Premenopausal/Oral contraceptives): Patients receive either oral ethinyl\n      estradiol and norethindrone or placebo daily for 28 days beginning on the Sunday following\n      the first day of the menstrual cycle.\n\n      Stratum 2 (Postmenopausal/Hormone replacement therapy): Patients receive either oral\n      estradiol and medroxyprogesterone or placebo on days 1-12 monthly.\n\n      Treatment continues in both arms of both strata for a total of 13 courses in the absence of\n      a severe disease flare-up or other complication that would preclude further study\n      participation.\n\n      All patients are followed at 1 year."
