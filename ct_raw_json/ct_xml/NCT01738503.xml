    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study in treatment seeking opioid-dependent subjects for safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, efficacy markers, and opioid receptor availability of
      subcutaneous injections of depot buprenorphine after induction and stabilization of
      treatment seeking subjects onto Subutex.

Participants who receive RBP-6000 containing 200 mg buprenorphine and reach Day 112 (and have received all 4 planned SC injections) will have the option to participate in the Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Pilot substudy.  In the PET Pilot sub-study participants will remain on 200 mg SC injections at 28 day intervals for an additional 6-9 intervals until they complete an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a PET scan and pharmacokinetic samples at week 1 and week 4 post injection.</description>
