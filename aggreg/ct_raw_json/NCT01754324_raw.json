Signs of NAS may include irritability,\n      high-pitched crying, muscle tightness, seizures, diarrhea, vomiting, poor feeding, and\n      unstable body temperature.  Many infants may be treated by supportive (non-pharmacological)\n      therapy by minimizing stimulation, cuddling, responding promptly to hunger cues, and other\n      comfort care.  However, some infants continue to show severe symptoms of withdrawal despite\n      these interventions.  In these cases, infants may be treated with medications\n      (pharmacological therapy).  Although it has been several decades since the first\n      descriptions of NAS, there still remains limited information with regards to the most\n      effective treatment.  We hypothesize that medical treatment protocols of NAS with methadone\n      can be optimized by better understanding what the body does to the drug (the\n      population-based pharmacokinetics of methadone)."
