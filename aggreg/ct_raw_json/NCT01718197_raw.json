The SARP will gain a better understanding of asthma and its endotypes, in\n      children and adults, by defining the disease at the molecular and cellular levels in the\n      context of the temporal phenotypic expression of the disease. To this end, the SARP\n      investigators will utilize both mechanistic and evoked phenotype approaches to: 1)\n      characterize developmental molecular, cellular and physiologic phenotypes in children and\n      adults with mild to severe asthma, and 2) to further elucidate the evolving pathobiology and\n      pathogenesis of severe asthma and its sub-phenotypes and 3) compare these features over\n      time.\n\n      This approach involves a shared longitudinal protocol conducted across all participating\n      centers which includes common information on all SARP participants. Additionally, the\n      SARP-SF has identified mechanistic research questions to be included in the shared\n      longitudinal protocol. This will be explored through additional sample collections of sputum\n      and fluids and biopsied tissue collected by bronchoscopy. Together, these longitudinal and\n      mechanistic approaches will enable prediction of phenotype stability/fluctuation and\n      pharmacologic responses and identification of novel, disease-modifying targets for\n      treatment."
