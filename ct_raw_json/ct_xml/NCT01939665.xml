  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a new, minimal-invasive image-guided treatment method
      for tumors not amenable for surgical resection or thermal ablation, due to vicinity near
      vital structures such as vessels and bile ducts. With IRE, multiple electrical pulses are
      applied to tumorous tissue. These pulses alter the existing transmembrane potential of the
      cell membranes, and create 'nanopores', after which the cell dies through loss of
      homeastasis.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety of percutaneous IRE in the treatment
      of patients with locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma (LAPC). Other objectives are
      feasibility and efficacy of IRE based upon symptomatic response and tumor response.

      Ten patients with histologically confirmed locally advanced pancreatic adenoacarcinoma (&lt;
      3.5cm) will undergo percutaneous irreversible electroporation of the tumor using CT and
      ultrasound guidance. After IRE, patients will be carefully monitored and any (serious)
      adverse events are registered. Follow-up will consist of frequent CT and MRI scanning, as
      well as serum CA19.9 tumor marker and quality of life questionnaires and pain registration
      forms.

      We hypothesize that IRE in the pancreas will induce good symptom palliation and local tumor
      control, without causing severe complications.

    <description>Number of adverse events of IRE-treatment (within 12 months after treatment) are registered and analyzed according to the CTCAE version 4.0. Complications related to IRE are early complications during hospital admission (e.g. bile leak, bowel leak, infection, pancreatitis), or late complications of IRE such as bile duct stenosis that become apparent during follow-up in the year after treatment.</description>

    <description>IRE may aid in the generation of effective anti-tumor immunity. To examine the immunologic response before and after IRE, venous blood sampling will be performed 1 day before, 14 days after and 3 months after IRE. Employing five 25-mer peptides selected to cover the major HLA-A1, A2, -A3, and -A24 restricted T cell epitopes from mesothelin, peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be in vitro stimulated for 10 days, followed by a 24h restimulation and IFNγ Elispot read-out. Mesothelin-specific T cell frequencies will be determined at baseline, 14 days after IRE and after 3 months to assess memory responses.</description>
