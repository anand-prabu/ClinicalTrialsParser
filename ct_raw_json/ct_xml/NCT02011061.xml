  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary calcium hampers accurate evaluation of the coronary arteries with coronary computed
      tomography angiography (CCTA). A novel approach to potentially overcome this limitation is
      coronary calcium subtraction.

      The primary hypothesis of the study is:

      - Coronary calcium subtraction CCTA will improve diagnostic accuracy as compared to
      conventional CCTA on a per-patient basis

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CCTA is a very important clinical method for the clinical evaluation of patients with chest
      pain of potential cardiac ischemic origin. However Coronary calcification and/or previously
      implanted coronary stents may limit the diagnostic accuracy of CCTA. A novel approach -
      coronary calcium subtraction - has been developed to potentially overcome this limitation.

        -  Study Objective: To assess diagnostic accuracy using coronary calcium subtraction
           coronary CT angiography (CCTA) as compared to conventional CCTA.

        -  Material and Methods: A total of 200 patients with suspected or known coronary artery
           disease (CAD) who have been referred for invasive coronary angiography (ICA) will prior
           to ICA undergo additional research CCTA with the newly developed coronary calcium
           subtraction protocol. Based on the coronary calcium scan (CS), coronary calcium score
           will be calculated according to the Agatston score. Conventional contrast enhanced CCTA
           studies will be analyzed for image quality and the presence and extent of coronary
           stenosis. Using a dedicated algorithm, subtraction will be performed on all datasets to
           obtain CCTA subtraction images. Subtracted images will be analyzed similar to the
           conventional CCTA images. ICA will serve as the gold standard. Image quality will be
           compared between conventional and subtracted CCTA. In addition, diagnostic accuracy in
           the evaluation of coronary stenosis as determined on ICA will be compared. Finally,
           factors influencing the performance of coronary calcium subtraction will be evaluated.
