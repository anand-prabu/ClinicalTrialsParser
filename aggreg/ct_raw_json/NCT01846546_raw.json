Recent studies have suggested that endogenous\n      angiogenesis inhibitor endostatin/collagen XVIII might play an important role in the\n      secondary brain injury following TBI. The aim of this study was to investigate early changes\n      in the concentrations of CSF endostatin/collagen XVIII after TBI and evaluated the relations\n      of endostatin/collagen XVIII to injury severity and clinical outcome. Endostatin/collagen\n      XVIII concentrations were measured serially for 1 week after hospitalization by using the\n      enzyme linked immunosorbent assay method in the cerebrospinal fluid of 30 patients with TBI\n      and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8 or less on admission. Comparative analysis were used to\n      determine if its serial changes correlate with the GCS score and prognosis. Receiver\n      operating characteristic curve was used to appraise the value of CSF endostatin/collagen\n      XVIII levels in predicting the prognosis of patients with severe head injury."

Demographic data, including age, gender, mechanism of\n      trauma and GCS score at admission were documented when the patients arrived at the emergency\n      room. The control group comprised 20 patients whose cerebrospinal fluid was examined via\n      lumbar puncture for investigation of suspected neurological disease. All patients had normal\n      neurological examination, negative imaging studies, and none had evidence of trauma or\n      preexisting neurological disease, including tumors, vascular anomalies, or abnormalities of\n      cerebrospinal fluid. The study had approval from the hospital ethics committee and informed\n      consent for participating in the study was obtained from an appropriate member of each\n      patient's family before performance of lumbar drainage."
