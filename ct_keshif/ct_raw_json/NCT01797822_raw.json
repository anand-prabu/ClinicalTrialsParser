The prescription eye drop, dexamethasone, can\n      also improve eye irritation by decreasing the inflammation that develops in dry eye. Thus,\n      the investigators hypothesize that the use of these conventional dry eye treatments will\n      improve the eyes' response to a low humidity environment."
