            "textblock": "Background:\n\n        -  The human T-cell leukemia virus 1 (HTLV-1 causes adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). Infection\n           does not immediately cause ATL, but it can develop over time. ATL is a rare and\n           aggressive type of cancer that disrupts the body   s ability to control the HTLV-1\n           virus. It also affects the growth and reproduction of cells infected with the virus.\n\n        -  Ruxolitinib is a drug that has been approved to treat bone marrow disorders. It can\n           interfere with the proteins that are important to the development and growth of ATL\n           cells. Drugs like ruxolitinib may be able to interrupt important activity in ATL cells.\n           Researchers want to see if ruxolitinib can be a safe and effective treatment for ATL.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To test the safety and effectiveness of ruxolitinib for adult T-cell leukemia.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have ATL caused by HTLV-1.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine\n           samples will be collected. Imaging studies will also be performed.\n\n        -  Participants will take ruxolitinib twice a day for 28 days. They will have blood tests\n           on days 1, 14, and 28. These tests will look at the levels of HTLV-1 in the blood.\n           Participants will have a final blood test about 2 weeks later. Treatment will also be\n           monitored with imaging studies.\n\n        -  Participants who have a partial response during treatment may be able to start taking\n           ruxolitinib again after the final blood test. They will continue to take ruxolitinib\n           for as long as it is effective and the side effects are not severe.\n\n        -  Participants who have a full response during treatment will take ruxolitinib for 56\n           more days, and then stop treatment. If ATL returns, they may restart treatment and\n           continue it for as long as it is effective."

However\n           patients that have both ATL and another HTLV-1 associated disease such as tropical\n           spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) will be included.\n\n        -  No prior treatment with a JAK inhibitor.\n\n      Design\n\n      - This is a phase II open-label, trial of oral ruxolitinib that will enroll 20 patients with\n      smoldering or chronic ATL. The patients will be treated with the standard dosage and\n      schedule (20 mg orally twice daily) approved by the FDA for the treatment of Myelofibrosis."
