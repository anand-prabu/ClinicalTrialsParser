  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vocal Cord Dysfunction (VCD) is characterized by involuntary closure of the vocal cords
      while inhaling. Children and adolescents with VCD may experience multiple symptoms,
      including difficulty breathing, coughing, wheezing, neck tightness, and voice changes. There
      is limited information on optimal management of VCD. In our proposed study, we will use
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques to change how patients respond to their VCD
      symptoms.  Measurements of airflow during breathing as well as symptom frequency and
      intensity will be examined prior to and following a series of four therapy sessions with a
      clinical psychologist that are focused on teaching patients strategies to decrease symptom
      reactivity.

    <description>At the four therapy sessions, subjects will work with the psychologist to identify the triggers of their VCD episodes, learn to self-monitor symptoms and reactions, and be taught breathing retraining/relaxation techniques. The goal is to decrease patterns of subjects' thinking or behaviors that exacerbate  distress from VCD symptoms.</description>
