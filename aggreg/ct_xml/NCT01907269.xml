  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized trial of a tailored intervention
      designed to provide personalized feedback regarding patients' risk of subsequent fractures,
      customized information regarding osteoporosis care, and messaging to activate patients to
      become more engaged in improving osteoporosis treatment and doctor-patient communication.
      This novel content will use &quot;story-telling&quot; delivered via the Internet and digital video
      discs (DVDs). The content will be uniquely tailored to each person based on barriers to
      care, age and race/ethnicity.  We will conduct a controlled, cluster-randomized trial of
      this intervention to determine differences in post-intervention rates of osteoporosis care
      between two randomization arms.

      We hypothesize that participants randomized to the intervention arm, compared to those
      randomized to a control arm, will receive more osteoporosis care at 6 months
      post-intervention, as evidenced by higher rates of: (H1) Prescription osteoporosis
      therapies, (H2) Non-prescription therapy with calcium and vitamin D, and (H3) Bone mineral
      density (BMD) testing.

    <description>We will assess the number of participants that self-report the initiation of an osteoporosis prescription medication.  It will be assessed using a self-completed survey.  Osteoporosis prescription medications that will be assessed include: alendronate, calcitonin, denosumab ibandronate, raloxifene, risedronate, teriparatide, and zoledronic acid.  We will not include initiation of estrogen hormone therapies as part of the primary outcome.</description>
