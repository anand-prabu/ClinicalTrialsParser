  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multidisciplinary team of clinicians and researchers will conduct a pilot feasibility
      study to evaluate whether dietary intake of dry bean powder or rice bran or a combination is
      a helpful dietary recommendation to reduce total cholesterol levels in children with
      identified, modifiable CVD risk factors, elevated total cholesterol and obesity. Consumption
      of dry bean powder and rice bran merit additional investigation to study feasibility and
      acceptability in children and how they influence their lipid levels or obesity.

      Children will be screened prior to participation with the expectation of enrolling 40 to
      randomize equally to either the control arm or one of the three intervention arms. This
      should assure that at least 10 participants would complete each intervention. The four
      groups are placebo (no bean powder or rice bran included), 1/4 cup cooked navy bean powder
      (17.5grams powder)/day, 15 grams rice bran/day, and combination of 9 grams of bean
      powder/day and 8 grams rice bran/day.  Participants will follow this dietary intervention by
      being provided a study snack, such as a banana nut muffin and strawberry-pineapple smoothie.
       Participants will consume one snack on a daily basis for a total of four weeks (28 days).
      The snack options were developed by a professional chef and research dietitian to fit a set
      of requirements for calorie and macronutrient content based on USDA food guide
      recommendations.  The placebo group will be provided the same snacks without the inclusion
      of rice bran or bean powder.

      Randomization of subjects to the dietary intervention groups will be done during the study
      enrollment period.  Randomization will be based on sex of the subject to include equal
      numbers of both genders across all 4 groups.

      All participants will consume the allocated foods daily for a total of four weeks (28 days)
      and will not be required to alter the rest of their diets in any other way.  They will also
      complete a 3-day food and activity log each week, starting the week prior to the study
      intervention (Week 0) and ending the week of their final visit (Week 4).
