No evidence of neurological disorder or urinary tract infection, i.e. clinically\n             diagnosed as idiopathic OAB\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Pregnant women in their late pregnancy phase will be excluded because the increasing\n             size of the baby/uterus may cause overactive bladder.\n\n          2. Patients with implanted electrical stimulators such as pacemaker will be excluded for\n             potential interference with the TENS stimulator.\n\n          3. Patients who are allergic to Cipro or Bactrim will be excluded from the CMG study."
