      The purpose of the proposed project is to develop and test how well an internet-based
      behavioral pain self-management program, the Veterans Pain Management Resource Center
      (VPMRC), can be used for treating low back pain in veterans. Veterans' experiences with
      usability and satisfaction with the VPMRC will also be examined. Behavioral interventions
      such as exercise and cognitive behavior therapy are known to be effective for low back pain
      but are often not readily available or easily accessed. Veterans will be able to access the
      VPMRC via their computer with an internet connection, which will increase access to this
      type of treatment. Study participants will receive 10 weeks of access to the VPMRC, which
      will teach them pain coping skills to manage their low back pain. The primary outcome is
      pain-related functional interference.

      OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives of the proposed study are to: (1) develop an integrative,
      Internet-based, veteran-centered behavioral intervention, the Veteran Pain Management
      Resource Center (VPMRC) for chronic low back pain (CLBP), and (2) examine preliminary
      efficacy, usability, and satisfaction of this intervention in a representative sample of
      veterans with CLBP. The primary hypothesis states that a clinically meaningful reduction in
      pain-related functional interference will be observed following ten weeks of exposure to the
      VPMRC relative to baseline. The secondary hypotheses state that clinically meaningful
      reductions in ratings of average pain intensity on a 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain
      imaginable) numeric rating scale at the ten week post-baseline follow-up assessment interval
      will be observed, in addition to statistically significant reductions in fatigue, sleep
      problems, depressive symptoms, and negative mood at the ten week post-baseline assessment.
      The tertiary hypotheses state that participants will report high levels of interest, site
      usage, and satisfaction.

      RESEARCH DESIGN: A non-randomized pilot study with two phases is proposed to develop and
      evaluate an internet-based behavioral pain self-management program.  Phase I will solely
      involve qualitative data collection. Repeated quantitative assessments during Phase II will
      be conducted at baseline and 10-weeks post-baseline.

      METHODOLOGY: A 24-month pilot study with two phases is proposed. During Phase I, the VPMRC
      will be developed and feedback from 15 Veterans with CLBP and an Expert Panel of pain
      management clinicians will be used to modify the program. During Phase II, a pilot
      feasibility trial of the VPMRC with 55 veterans with CLBP will be conducted. Subjects will
      be a total of 70 patients receiving care at the VACHS who report chronic low back pain. The
      primary criteria for inclusion are constant pain of at least three months duration with at
      least a moderate level of average pain (i.e., scores of 4 or greater on a 0 [no pain] to 10
      [worst pain imaginable]) on a numerical rating scale of pain and indication of the
      &quot;preparation&quot;, &quot;action&quot;, or &quot;maintenance&quot; stage of readiness to change on a brief five item
      staging checklist. All patients must have access to a computer with an internet connection.
      Excluded will be patients with life threatening or acute physical illness, current alcohol
      or substance abuse or dependence, current psychosis, suicidal ideation, dementia, and
      individuals seeking surgical pain treatment. All participants will continue to receive their
      usual care from VHA providers. During the 10-week therapeutic window, weekly telephone calls
      from research staff will serve to cue and monitor participants' use of the Internet program.
      At ten weeks post-baseline, participants will be formally reassessed. Primary and secondary
      hypotheses involving quantitative data will be analyzed using an intent-to-treat principle
      and will employ t-tests and non-parametric analogs and regression analyses.
