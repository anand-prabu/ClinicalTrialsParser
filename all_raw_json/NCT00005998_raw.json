Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer\n      cells. Combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy with peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation using specially treated stem cells may allow the doctor to give higher doses\n      of chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy and kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of peripheral stem cell transplantation\n      using specially treated stem cells in treating patients who have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or\n      Hodgkin's disease."

Patients receive\n      cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours, mitoxantrone IV, and cytarabine IV every 12 hours for 2\n      doses on day 10, and dexamethasone every 12 hours for 4 doses on days 10 and 11. Patients\n      receive G-CSF SC for the next 10-20 days. Additional PBSC are collected on days 25-28 or 29.\n      Beginning 7 days before PBSC transplantation, patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2\n      hours on days -7 and -6 and total body irradiation (TBI) twice daily on days -4 to -1.\n      Patients unable to tolerate TBI receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -6 to -3,\n      carmustine IV over 1 hour on days -6, and etoposide IV over 1 hour every 12 hours on days -6\n      to -4. Retrovirally transduced PBSC are reinfused on day 0 followed by another course of\n      G-CSF SC until hematopoietic recovery.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-15\n      months."
