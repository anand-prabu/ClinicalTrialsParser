            "textblock": "The prognosis for patients with advanced oesophago-gastric cancer is poor. Approximately\n      16,000 patients in the UK die from the disease. In spite of new chemotherapy regimens, the\n      average survival for these patients is around 9 months from diagnosis.\n\n      Omegaven is an infusion comprising omega-3 fish oils. There is evidence that omega-3 fish\n      oil supplementation can improve general well-being and quality of life in patients receiving\n      palliative chemotherapy for a number of different cancer types. It has also been suggested\n      that omega-3 fish oil supplementation may reduce the toxicity of chemotherapy.\n\n      This clinical trial aims to see whether the addition of Omegaven to EOX chemotherapy, the\n      most widely used regimen for patients with advanced oesophago-gastric cancer, will make this\n      drug regimen more effective at killing oesophago-gastric cancer cells, such that disease\n      progression is delayed. Forty-five patients who have been diagnosed with advanced\n      oesophago-gastric cancer will be recruited over a two year period to receive standard\n      chemotherapy and omega-3 fish oil supplementation. The results in these 45 patients will be\n      compared to a matched historical control group of patients who have received identical\n      chemotherapy. If results suggest that the combination of EOX and Omegaven is sufficiently\n      effective, tolerable and feasible then it will be the intention of the trial team to take\n      the combination forward to treat patients with advanced oesophago-gastric cancer in a\n      randomised study."
