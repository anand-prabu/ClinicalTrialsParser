Patients are randomized to one of three\n      treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive palliative therapy alone comprising non-chemotherapeutic\n           therapy (e.g., radiotherapy, painkillers, steroids, relaxants, and special pain relief\n           techniques).\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive palliative therapy as in arm I and chemotherapy comprising\n           mitomycin IV (courses 1, 2, and 4 only), vinblastine IV, and cisplatin IV over 4 hours\n           on day 1. Chemotherapy repeats every 21 days for a total of 4 courses.\n\n        -  Arm III: Patients receive palliative therapy as in arm I and chemotherapy comprising\n           vinorelbine IV over 5 minutes once weekly on weeks 1-6 and 9-14.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline for all patients; at weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12 for arm\n      I; at weeks 4, 7, 10, and 13 for arm II; at weeks 3, 6, 10, and 13 for arm III; at weeks 21\n      and 29, and then every 8 weeks thereafter for all patients.\n\n      Patients are followed every 8 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (20 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 1 year."
