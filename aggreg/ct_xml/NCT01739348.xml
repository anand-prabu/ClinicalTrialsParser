      This study consists of two parts, Part I and Part II. The purpose of Part I of the study is
      to assess the efficacy and safety of MK-8931 compared with placebo administered for 78 weeks
      in the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The primary study hypotheses for Part I are
      that at least one MK-8931 dose is superior to placebo at 78 weeks of treatment with respect
      to change from Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale
      (ADAS-Cog) score and that at least one MK-8931 dose is superior to placebo at 78 weeks of
      treatment with respect to change from Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study
      Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL) score. The first approximately 400
      participants entering Part I of the study are identified as the Safety Cohort. Participants
      who complete Part I of the study may choose to participate in Part II, which is a long term
      double-blind extension to assess efficacy and safety of MK-8931 administered for up to an
      additional 260 weeks.

      Two substudies are included in Part I of the study: 1) a medical imaging substudy to
      evaluate changes in brain amyloid protein load using positron emission tomography (PET) and
      an amyloid tracer ([18F]flutemetamol); and 2) a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker substudy
      to evaluate changes in CSF concentrations of amyloid-β related peptides, total tau, and
      phosphorylated tau (p-tau). The substudies will be conducted only at designated
      investigational sites. Participants are not required to take part in a substudy in order to
      take part in the larger trial.
