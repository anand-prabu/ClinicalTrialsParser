Patients with acute myeloid leukemia who respond to therapy may\n      receive a second course approximately 10 days after the end of the first. Subsequent courses\n      in these patients, and all additional courses in all other patients, are repeated every 21\n      to 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study."
