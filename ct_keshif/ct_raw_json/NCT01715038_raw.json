Data\n      collection is longitudinal, starting with the identification of women in early pregnancy who\n      are eligible to enter the study, and continuing, with follow-up of the child, until 24\n      months post-partum. The investigators are evaluating the effect of providing LNS-PLW to\n      mothers during pregnancy and lactation on maternal health and nutrition outcomes (including\n      anthropometric and micronutrient status), morbidity and birth outcomes in comparison to\n      mothers who receive iron-folic acid tablets during pregnancy and lactation. The\n      investigators are also evaluating the effect of three different home-fortification\n      approaches (arms a-c, below) on child health and nutrition outcomes including anthropometric\n      status, micronutrient status, anemia, and motor and cognitive development, in comparison to\n      a control arm not receiving a home fortification intervention.\n\n      Additionally, the cost of implementation and delivery of the LNS-PLW, LNS-child or MNP\n      interventions as part of the CHDP compared to standard CHDP program delivery will be\n      documented. Willingness to pay (private demand) for LNS-PLW, LNS-child and MNP products by\n      selected caregivers and male heads of households will be assessed at baseline and again at\n      various points during the intervention period.\n\n      A process evaluation of the LNS and MNP interventions, and of the services provided to the\n      control group, within the CHDP will be conducted to: 1) Document and evaluate the processes\n      needed for implementation of interventions that provide a nutrient supplement such as LNS or\n      MNP in the context of the CHDP; and 2) Explain and interpret program effectiveness study\n      results and identify important facilitators and barriers to success of the nutrition\n      intervention, which can be used to improve the effectiveness of current CHDP programs and\n      future similar programs that include the scaling-up of LNS or MNP."
