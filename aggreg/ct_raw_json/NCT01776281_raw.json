            "textblock": "- Hypothermia, infections ,and ineffective breastfeeding are some of the commonest causes of\n      deaths among premature and low birth weight LBW infants. Even if the infants are born in\n      facilities, incidences of cold stress are possible due to insufficient resources, space and\n      incompetent practices to manage hypothermia in the immediate postnatal period. Kangaroo\n      Mother Care is a well-known intervention to address the issues related to preterm births,\n      such as hypothermia, infection and prolong hospitalization.Besides significant outcome of\n      KMC interventions for preterm infants, no interventional study has been found in literature\n      in Pakistani context. Looking at the potential benefits of KMC in reducing the related\n      complications of prematurity, the study aims to identify the effectiveness of KMC among\n      preterm and LBW infants born in secondary hospital of Aga khan University hospitals.\n\n      Hypothesis I Ha: KMC is effective in reducing the incidences of hypothermia among preterm\n      and LBW infants as compared to the usual care.\n\n      Hypothesis II Ha: There is a difference in breastfeeding behavior and breastfeeding outcome\n      among experimental and control group.\n\n      Secondary Hypothesis Hypothesis I Ha: There is an association between KMC and frequency of\n      suspected infections during hospitalization.\n\n      Hypothesis II Ha: There is a difference in length of stay among experimental group and\n      control group.\n\n      Hypothesis III Ha: There is a relationship between KMC and weight gain of infants till four\n      weeks.\n\n      Hypothesis IV Ha: There is difference in rate of hypothermia among experimental group and\n      control after discharge from hospital."
