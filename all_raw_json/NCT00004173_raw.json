Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin and paclitaxel until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more\n      than 1 of 6 patients experiences dose limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
