Apples are among the most frequently consumed fruits in the\n      world. Epidemiological studies have linked frequent apple consumption with several health\n      benefits including a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Apples are an important source\n      of polyphenols and fiber and their beneficial effects could be attributed to this content;\n      however, their impact on our health is not clear. Although, there are some studies that have\n      reported cholesterol lowering effects the results are inconsistent. Furthermore, few studies\n      have explored the impact on vascular function and gut microbiota. The objective of the\n      current study is to assess whether a regular apple consumption, reduces total cholesterol\n      levels, improves vascular function and gut microbiota profile in mildly hypercholesterolemic\n      subjects compared with a control, sugar matched commercial clear apple juice squash."
