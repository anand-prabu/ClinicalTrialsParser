Azacitidine is an\n      approved drug used to treat patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).  The second part\n      of the study will assess if treatment with rigosertib (at the dose determined in the first\n      part), in combination with azacitidine, has measurable effects in patients with MDS and\n      other diseases.
