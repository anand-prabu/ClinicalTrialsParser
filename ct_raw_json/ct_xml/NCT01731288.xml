  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess conception, pregnancy, childbirth, and pain
      experiences among women who have been diagnosed with vulvodynia. Specifically, this study
      aims to examine the following among women who have been diagnosed with vulvodynia: 1) rates
      of pregnancy/childbirth and desire for children; 2) fear of pregnancy and childbirth; 3)
      potential difficulties experienced while attempting to become pregnant and during
      pregnancy/childbirth; 4) methods used to become pregnant and deliver; 5) methods used to
      manage vulvodynia symptoms during pregnancy; and 6) pain outcomes associated with pregnancy.

      Very little research has examined pregnancy/childbirth experiences among women with
      vulvodynia, or the natural history of vulvodynia. As such this is a preliminary
      investigation that will provide descriptive information regarding many of the proposed
      research questions. Based on the clinical experience of the investigators, it is expected
      that women with vulvodynia will report lower rates of pregnancy and higher levels of fear
      about pregnancy and childbirth in comparison to women without such pain. It is also expected
      that women with vulvodynia will report more difficulties becoming pregnant as compared to
      women without such pain, and that women with vulvodynia will report more elective nonvaginal
      births in comparison to vaginal births.
