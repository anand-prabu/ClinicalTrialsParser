In order to prevent\n      loss of muscle mass and remain physically independent, it is utmost important for elderly to\n      maintain their body protein mass. A sufficient protein supply according to their needs is\n      therefore highly important. Especially for frail elderly, it is not easy to realize an\n      increased protein intake by simply eating more. It is hypothesized that protein enriched\n      food products that fit in a habitual diet (dairy and bread), result in a higher protein\n      intake compared to regular products."
