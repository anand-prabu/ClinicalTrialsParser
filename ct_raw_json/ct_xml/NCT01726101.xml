  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will be divided into two parts: Part 1 will evaluate the safety and
      pharmacokinetics of three doses of YN968D1 after a single administration followed by up to
      28-Days of continuous therapy; Part 2 will evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy in
      an open-label administration of YN968D1 at the MTD or a maximum of 750 mg. All subjects in
      Part 1 and Part 2 of this study will be permitted to continue therapy with only safety
      monitoring and bimonthly assessments for progression, if the product is well tolerated and
      the subject has stable disease or better.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 will include a sequential evaluation of 3 subjects per cohort; cohort 1 at a dose of
      100 mg YN968D1, followed by a cohorts 2, 3 and 4 at doses of 250 mg, 500 mg and 750 mg
      respectively. Initially, each subject will receive one dose of YN968D1 followed by an
      observation period at least 7 days, during which single dose PK assessments and safety
      monitoring will be performed. If the initial dose is well tolerated, the subject will return
      on Day 8 and receive up to 28-Days of continuous YN968D1 oral administration daily. Each
      subject will subsequently be assessed for safety and disease progression on Day 35±2 and
      steady state pharmacokinetic sampling will be obtained. Patients may continue on therapy for
      an additional cycles up to 28-Days without dose interruption if the therapy is well
      tolerated. Efficacy assessments (biomarkers) and disease progression (RECIST imaging) will
      be assessed every two 28-Day cycles (±3 days). The subjects will be assessed for safety for
      at least 28-Days after the last dose of YN968D1.

      For Part 1 of this study, a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) event is defined as any of the
      following events that are assessed by the Investigator as probably or possibly related to
      YN968D1 and occur during or after the initial dose on Day 1 through Day 35 (±3) of the first
      cycle of therapy.  DLT is defined as:

        -  CTCAE Grade 4 event

        -  Grade 3 febrile neutropenia (&lt;1,000 neutrophils/mL)

        -  Grade 3 hematologic toxicity with duration &gt; 7 days

        -  Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity (except for nausea, vomiting, diarrhea that continues
           despite optimal medical management)

      If a DLT is experienced in any cohort, the cohort will be expanded to 6 subjects. If two (2)
      DLTs are experienced in any cohort, the study will be paused until the safety events are
      evaluated and discussed with the FDA to determine if the trial may continue.

      Part 2 of this study will include up to 30 subjects. Each subject will receive a 750 mg dose
      or the maximum tolerated dose of YN968D1 from part 1 of the study for up to 28-Days
      continuous cycles of therapy. If a subject experiences an intolerable side effect a dose
      reduction or a dose interruption for up to Days is allowed at the discretion of the
      investigator. Subjects will be evaluated for RECIST (version 1.1) response at the end of the
      second cycle of therapy on Day 56±3 of the Part 2 study. Safety reporting will be continued
      for up to 28-Days from the last dose of study medication.

      All subjects in Part 1 and 2 of this trial will be eligible to continue therapy provided
      they have a least stable disease or better and are, in the opinion of the investigator,
      adequately tolerating treatment with YN968D1.
