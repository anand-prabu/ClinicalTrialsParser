Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so\n      they stop growing or die. Combining SU5416 with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of SU5416 and paclitaxel in treating\n      patients who have recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic cancer of the head and neck."

Treatment continues weekly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of paclitaxel and SU5416 until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2\n      of 3 or 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 34 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-15 months."
