  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies examining the sex differences in the epidemiology and morbidity patterns of asthma
      show that the rates of disease severity, healthcare utilisation, and poor quality of life
      are considerably higher in women than in men, and this has been attributed to endogenous and
      exogenous sex hormonal factors. Studies examining the impact of use of hormonal
      contraceptives on the risk of asthma and asthma-related conditions are few, yet findings are
      conflicting.

      In the present study, the investigators utilize data from the Scottish Health Survey, a
      national representative sample, to investigate the associations between current use of
      hormonal contraceptives and the prevalence of self-reported doctor-diagnosed current asthma
      and wheezing symptoms in Scottish women. The investigators hypothesize that while current
      use of any hormonal contraceptives and combined oral pills are associated with higher
      prevalence of asthma and asthma outcomes, current use of progesterone-only contraceptives is
      not associated with asthma. A secondary aim of the current study is to examine whether there
      is evidence of any biological interaction between use of hormonal contraceptives and BMI in
      relation to the risk of asthma and asthma outcomes.
