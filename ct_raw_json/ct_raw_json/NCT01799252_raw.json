            "textblock": "Medical abortion (MA) consists of administering medication, typically a combination of\n      mifepristone and misoprostol, to induce an abortion without any invasive procedures.  Early\n      first trimester MA is effective1,  highly acceptable to women, and safe.  The risk of\n      infection following medical abortion is small, at less than 1%.  In rare circumstances,\n      pelvic infection with clostridia bacteria following medical abortion has resulted in death.\n      Since 2000, when mifepristone was registered in the United States,  8 such deaths have been\n      recorded in the US.\n\n      Following the publication of case reports of four clostridium-associated deaths after\n      medical abortion in 2005, the reproductive health community reacted swiftly.  Medical\n      abortion protocols were altered in an effort to curb these drastic and rapidly fatal\n      infections.  Antibiotic treatment, typically a seven-day course of doxycycline, has become\n      widespread in the United States.\n\n      The effectiveness of antibiotic treatment at reducing post-abortion infection is unclear.\n      The experiences of women prescribed routine antibiotics after medical abortion is missing\n      from the existing evidence.  This study seeks to add to the literature evidence of the side\n      effects associated with antibiotic treatment that women experience and their adherence to\n      prescribed regimens."
