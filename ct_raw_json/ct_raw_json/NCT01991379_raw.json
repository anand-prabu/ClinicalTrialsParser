In the phase Ib portion of the study, patients will receive imatinib at 400 mg once daily and MEK162 at the standard 3+3 escalation doses. In the phase II portion of the study, patients will receive imatinib at 400 mg once daily (standard of care first line imatinib dose) and MEK162 at the RP2D twice daily. One cycle is 28 days. If no progression of the tumor is seen, patients will continue on therapy. Those patients who have progression of disease will proceed directly to second line therapy as per standard of care."
