Randomization\n      will be done using 3:1 ratio and will be performed by our research pharmacy using a random\n      assignment in blocks of 4- 3 will be assigned to active medication and 1 to placebo.\n      Medication will be titrated over a 6 week titration phase followed by a 6 week treatment\n      phase.  All veterans will receive E-CPT-C therapy for the 12 weeks of treatment; E-CPT-C\n      will be provided by trained and qualified clinicians with extensive experience providing\n      E-CPT-C. Veterans will be recruited primarily through advertisement, but also through the\n      clinical facilities at the VA and from other collaborators."
