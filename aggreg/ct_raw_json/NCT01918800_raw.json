            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to compare two different educational programs for people with\n      multiple sclerosis (MS), which is a common and often disabling disease of the central\n      nervous system. MS causes many symptoms including difficulty walking, loss of balance or\n      muscle coordination, fatigue, numbness and tingling and stiffness. The investigators want to\n      determine which program is better at helping improve quality of life and MS symptoms. Both\n      programs use material from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS). Both programs\n      include 6 weekly 2-hour class sessions. Up to 600 participants will be enrolled total in 4\n      VA sites, with about 150 at each site. There will be 10 study visits, all to occur within 11\n      months. These include 1 baseline visit, 6 two-hour class visits, and 3 follow-up data\n      collection visits. Participants will be randomly (by chance) assigned to be part of either\n      group education program. They will have a 1:1 or 50% chance of being in either program. The\n      primary outcome will be the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale. Secondary outcome measures will\n      be the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale and changes in medication usage, physical\n      activity level and health-related quality of life."

            "textblock": "Treatment of MS-related fatigue represents a significant challenge in providing symptomatic\n      therapy for people with MS. In 1998 the MS Council for Clinical Practice Guidelines\n      published Fatigue and MS, the first evidence based treatment guideline for MS recommending\n      comprehensive treatment for fatigue. This guideline is widely distributed, but does not\n      include a program for implementation. Fatigue: Take Control, is the first formal program\n      modeled on the MS fatigue guidelines. This proposal entails performing a four-center single\n      blind intent-to-treat randomized controlled two-arm parallel design trial of Fatigue: Take\n      Control with MS participants to accomplish four Specific Aims.\n\n      Specific Aim #1: Demonstrate that Fatigue: Take Control reduces fatigue in people with MS\n      who are ambulatory and not depressed at the end of the intervention and at three and six\n      months after the intervention compared to a general MS group education program. The primary\n      outcome measure will be the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) chosen for its\n      multi-dimensional nature, recommended use in the Fatigue and MS guideline and sensitivity to\n      change in the pilot study.\n\n      Specific Aim #2: Demonstrate that Fatigue: Take Control increases self-efficacy in people\n      with MS who are ambulatory and not severely depressed. Fatigue affects a person's sense of\n      control over his/her life. We will use the MS Self Efficacy Scale (MSSE) for this secondary\n      objective. This measure also demonstrated improvement in the pilot study.\n\n      Specific Aim #3: Demonstrate that Fatigue: Take Control results in changes in medication\n      utilization, exercise participation, sleep and health-related quality of life in people with\n      MS who are ambulatory and not depressed. Fatigue affects body functions/structure, activity\n      and participation in all aspects of daily life. Fatigue: Take Control emphasizes the\n      importance of medication optimization for managing all MS symptoms and regular exercise\n      participation.\n\n      Recognizing that treatment of MS-related fatigue is complex, Fatigue: Take Control was\n      created to provide a framework for people with MS to learn about their fatigue and empower\n      them with knowledge to take steps toward self-management in partnership with their\n      healthcare providers. It specifically addresses management of all the secondary causes of\n      fatigue as well as accepted principles such as employing energy conservation strategies to\n      manage primary MS fatigue. It was not designed to identify which single treatment should be\n      emphasized for a given participant, but rather to enable individuals to identify those areas\n      most applicable to themselves and implement those identified behavioral and lifestyle\n      changes. A basic premise of the program is that information on all aspects of MS fatigue\n      will allow each individual to find those areas most helpful to their situation and make the\n      necessary changes or request appropriate referrals to other healthcare providers, such as a\n      physical therapist to help manage difficulty walking and falling. Fatigue: Take Control was\n      created with the expectation that fatigue can be reduced by guiding individuals to make the\n      environmental, behavioral and lifestyle changes necessary to manage MS fatigue."
