Both capsules will be compared to the intended final market capsule. The comparison\n      will be performed looking at the pharmacokinetic parameters that define the rate and extent\n      of absorption, those are Cmax and AUC. A statistical analysis will be performed comparing\n      these parameters calculated after a single 125 mg dose of the 3 capsules identifying like\n      that if there are significant differences between these 3 formulations."
