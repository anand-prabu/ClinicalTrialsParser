  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Response-guided triple-therapy with boceprevir (BOC) in combination with pegylated
      interferon (PEGIFN) and ribavirin (RBV) is the current standard of care for HIV-negative
      patients infected with hepatitis C genotype (HCV-GT) 1. In contrast, in HIV-positive
      patients, a fixed treatment duration of 48 weeks is used.

      The aim of this study is to assess efficacy and safety of response-guided triple-therapy
      with BOC in combination with PEGIFN and RBV in HIV-positive patients. Thus, treatment
      duration will be individualized based on HCV-RNA negativity at treatment week 8 (W8). All
      patients will receive 4 weeks of PEGIFN/RBV lead-in. Patients with undetectable HCV-RNA at
      W8 will be treated with 24 weeks of BOC/PEGIFN/RBV triple-therapy resulting in a total
      treatment duration of 28 weeks, while patients with detectable HCV-RNA at W8 will receive 44
      weeks of BOC/PEGIFN/RBV triple-therapy and a total treatment duration of 48 weeks.
