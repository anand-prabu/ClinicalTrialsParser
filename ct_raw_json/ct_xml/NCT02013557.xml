      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to see whether a text-message reminder system will
      increase the number of women who complete their diabetes screening after delivery.

      Study Design:  Prospective randomized control trial

      Hypothesis: Gestational diabetics will be significantly more likely to follow up with their
      postpartum screening for diabetes if they receive text-message reminders to set up their lab
      appointment compared to those who receive usual care.

      Eligible participants will be recruited after delivery while on the postpartum ward.
      Recruitment will be conducted by the PI or a member of the study team. After informed
      consent is obtained, the patients will be randomized into one of two study groups: the
      intervention group or the control group. Women in the intervention group will receive a test
      text-message reminder at the time of enrollment. They will then receive a text-reminder to
      schedule their oral glucose tolerance test at 6 weeks postpartum, with further reminders at
      3 months and 6 months if they have not completed their testing. Women in the control group
      will only receive the test text-message reminder. The PI or member of the study team
      obtaining the informed consent will verify the participant has received the text-message
      prior to completing enrollment. A computer-generated randomization list will be generated
      according to intervention vs. control group. Simple randomization will be used for the
      purposes of this study. 316 participants will be recruited based on the sample size
      calculations already performed. One group of 316 randomized opaque envelopes will be
      prepared. These sealed envelopes will be stored in a secured designated area at Tampa
      General Hospital. Once a patient has agreed to participate and is consented an envelope will
      be selected from the next sequentially numbered envelope and the number on the envelope will
      be recorded on their study sheet. Enrollment will continue until 316 participants have been
      recruited.
