But most of the studies have involved participants who are in\n      average in their mid 30s, and little is known about the efficacy of CRT in adolescents with\n      early-onset schizophrenia (EOS). The aim of this study is to investigate efficacy of CRT in\n      improving cognitive performance and functional outcome in adolescents with EOS. We expect to\n      find that CRT improves cognitive and functional outcomes in adolescents with schizophrenia."

            "textblock": "Early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) is associated with worse course and poor outcome than\n      adulthood schizophrenia. Cognitive deficits are known to be a core feature in EOS, with\n      large deficits on almost all cognitive domains. Importantly, cognitive deficits are known to\n      be strong predictors of psychosocial and functional outcomes in schizophrenia and also in\n      the early-onset form of the illness. Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT) is a behavioral\n      training based intervention that aims to improve cognitive processes (attention, memory,\n      executive function, social cognition or metacognition) with the goal of durability and\n      generalization. It has been demonstrated that CRT improve cognitive deficits and functional\n      outcome in adult patients but there are very few studies with adolescent samples.\n\n      A controlled randomized study will be carry out with two groups: patients receiving\n      treatment as usual plus CRT, and patients receiving treatment as usual (TAU). The\n      independent variable is the cognitive remediation treatment. The CRT will be applied\n      according to the manual of Wykes and Reeder (2005). The program has a duration of 40\n      sessions, with two session for week. It is carried out individually and utilizes paper and\n      pencil tasks. The main technique utilized is the scaffolding in a context of learning\n      without errors.\n\n      The main dependent variable is the cognitive performance measured through neuropsychological\n      tests. Other secondary dependent variables are functional outcome and clinical symptoms\n      obtained from the psychometric evaluation.\n\n      All participants will be evaluated before and after the experimental intervention in several\n      neurocognitive domains, clinical symptoms and functional outcome. The evaluations will be\n      carried out by expert evaluators. Intention-to-treat analysis will be carry out using the\n      statistical package SPSS v 18."
