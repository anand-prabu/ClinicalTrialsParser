The control group will receive a contraceptive implant at the usual 6 week\n      postpartum clinic visit.  During prenatal care, participants will be consented and screened\n      for enrollment. After delivery, these women will be assessed and consented for enrollment\n      into the study. Women who consent for enrollment will be randomized.  Women will be followed\n      up at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 1 year after contraceptive implant insertion. At\n      each follow up, women will be assessed for continuation of and satisfaction with this method\n      of contraception."
