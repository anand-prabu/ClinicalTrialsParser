Although data on arginine\n      metabolism exist in literature, data are limited to young healthy male subjects. Since\n      patients with suspected changes in arginine metabolism, e.g. sepsis and cancer patients are\n      often elderly and also women, knowledge of arginine metabolism in these groups is needed."
