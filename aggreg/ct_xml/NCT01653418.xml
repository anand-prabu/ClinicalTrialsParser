  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BEAM regimen (BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan) is the most commonly used
      conditioning regimen for relapsed/refractory lymphoma patients needing autologous stem cell
      transplantation. Since these components are all effective in myeloma and bortezomib has
      shown promising results in the transplant setting, here the investigators propose a phase II
      study to investigate the combination of bortezomib and BEAM as a new conditioning regimen
      for patients who relapse or progress after the first autologous transplantation and for whom
      a second autologous transplant is considered.

             physicians.

          -  Patient must receive induction chemotherapy including 2 to 4 cycles of anti-myeloma
             therapy including bortezomib, with or without immune modulating agents and/or
             corticosteroids, Completion of induction therapy will occur within 30 days of first
             study drug dose.

          -  Patient must have ≥ 2x106/kg CD34+ autologous stem cells available for
             transplantation.

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry
             through Day +100 visit. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  Patient must be able to understand and willing to sign an IRB approved written
             informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must not be refractory to induction therapy. Refractory is defined as disease
             progression while on therapy or within 30 days following completion of therapy.

          -  Patient must not have had disease progression requiring active treatment within 12
             months of previous autologous stem cell transplant. Maintenance therapy is not
             considered active treatment.

          -  Patient must not have peripheral neuropathy ≥ grade 3 based on NCI CTCAE v 4.0
             (Appendix D).

          -  Patient must not be receiving renal replacement therapy, hemodialysis, or peritoneal
             dialysis.

             to the first dose of study drug.

          -  Patient must not have known brain metastases.  Patients with known brain metastases
             must be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because
             they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the
             evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  Patient must not have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of
             similar chemical or biologic composition to bortezomib, carmustine, etoposide,
             cytarabine, and melphalan, or other agents used in the study.

          -  Patient must not have an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited
             to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Patient must not be pregnant and/or breastfeeding.
