Patients are stratified according to\n      inpatient status (yes vs no), disease type (breast vs lung vs other), and concurrent\n      systemic chemotherapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo placement of a standard pleural chest tube. Within 36 hours of\n           chest tube placement, patients undergo pleurodesis comprising intrapleural\n           administration of talc slurry once followed by clamping of the chest tube for 2 hours\n           while different patient positions are used to distribute the talc. The chest tube is\n           then unclamped to allow continuous drainage. When the chest tube drainage is less than\n           150 mL over 24 hours, pleurodesis is assumed and the chest tube is removed.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo pleurodesis comprising placement of a small (PleurX) catheter\n           followed by pleural drainage for up to 90 minutes once daily. When the catheter\n           drainage is less than 30 mL per day for 3 consecutive days, pleurodesis is assumed and\n           the catheter is removed.\n\n      Quality of life and dyspnea are assessed at baseline and then at 7-14 and 30-37 days after\n      treatment.\n\n      Patients are followed at 30 and 60 days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 530 patients (265 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 3.5 years."
