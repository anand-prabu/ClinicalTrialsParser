Efficacy will be evaluated\n      by comparing symptoms assessment during and post radiotherapy: erythema, desquamation,\n      edema, moist desquamation and ulceration in the KAM1403 Gel treated group versus a group of\n      subjects treated with the Aloe vera Gel (the control group).  In addition, a comparison will\n      be made between subjects' self evaluation in the treatment group versus the control group.\n      Safety will be determined by the number and severity of Adverse Events Device-Related."
