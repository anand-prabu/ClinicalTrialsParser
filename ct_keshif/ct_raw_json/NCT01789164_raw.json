In the Experimental Group (Group 1) we will enroll adult participants\n      with TBI with persistent post-concussion symptoms or abnormalities on neuropsychological\n      testing. In Group 2 we will enroll adult participants to serve as age and gender-matched\n      healthy controls. Our goal is to recruit 100 subjects total in two groups of age and gender\n      matched subjects, as follows: TBI (n = 50) and non-TBI (n = 50).\n\n      Participants in both groups will undergo NIRS testing with hypercapnia challenge, to measure\n      the increase in hemodynamic flow signal during hypercapnia challenge via 2 methods, the\n      breath holding and the Douglas bag methods.  We will test intersessional validity of the\n      NIRS-hypercapnia challenge in the first 20 (10 TBI and 10 non-TBI) subjects who are willing\n      to return for a second visit of repeat testing.\n\n      The NIRS system is composed of 4 light sources and 10 detectors with a 16 point\n      configuration system applied on the forehead of the subject. In our experiment, light\n      intensity collected at each detector will be transformed into a signal related to the local\n      concentrations of oxy- and de-oxyhemoglobin during the challenge. Each experiment will give\n      a set of subject data, consisting of the peak amplitude and time-to-peak of the hemodynamic\n      signals measured."
