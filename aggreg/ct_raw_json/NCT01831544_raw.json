Left ventricular ejection fraction \u226425%.\n\n          4. Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraceptive\n             precautions (defined as oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices, surgical\n             contraceptives or a combination of condom and spermicide) for the duration of the\n             study.\n\n          5.

Existence of any ongoing mechanical circulatory support (MCS) other than an\n             intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP).\n\n          4. Prior cardiac transplant or cardiomyoplasty.\n\n          5. History of confirmed, untreated abdominal or thoracic aortic aneurysm (diameter > 5\n             cm).\n\n          6. Acute myocardial infarction within 14 days of implant as diagnosed by ST or T wave\n             changes on the electrocardiogram (ECG), diagnostic biomarkers, ongoing pain and\n             hemodynamic abnormalities.\n\n          7. On ventilator support for > 72 hours within the four days immediately prior to\n             implant.\n\n          8.

A total bilirubin > 3 mg/dL within 72 hours of implant, or biopsy proven liver\n             cirrhosis or portal hypertension.\n\n         18.
