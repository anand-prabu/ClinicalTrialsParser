            "textblock": "This project concerns the rehabilitation of nonspecific chronic low back pain patients\n      (CLBP), in particular conservative rehabilitation by means of exercise therapy. Exercise\n      therapy covers a broad spectrum of different kind of therapy approaches in daily practice.\n      For example stabilization therapy, isometric muscle training, general exercises to improve\n      general fitness... In the European guidelines  and the Belgian report on chronic low back\n      pain of the \"Federaal Kenniscentrum voor de gezondheidszorg (KCE)\" supervised exercise\n      therapy and multidisciplinary rehabilitation (bio-psycho-social) are recommended, due to the\n      high level of evidence. The content or type of exercises are not specified. An important\n      recommendation of the European guideline is the need for development of tools to improve the\n      classification and identification of specific clinical sub-groups of low back pain patients\n      to determine the effectiveness of specific exercise interventions.\n\n      Consequently, we will investigate three active rehabilitation approaches for back pain:\n      stabilization therapy, general active exercise therapy and isometric training devices, well\n      known in Flanders and described in international peer reviewed journals. For each type of\n      exercise therapy a clinical prediction rule (CPR) will be determined. Recent systematic\n      reviews show the lack of CPR for exercise therapy in low back pain patients. The methodology\n      to develop a validated and applicable CPR contains 3 different phases: 1. derivation phase,\n      2. validation phase, 3. impact phase.\n\n      Phase 2: validation phase. The CPR will be applied in a new but comparable test group to\n      confirm findings of phase. The RCT design with 3 treatment groups (stabilization therapy/\n      general active exercise therapy/ isometric training devices) that was accomplished in phase\n      1 will be repeated. The prediction rule will be applied after at random assignment of the\n      patients to an intervention group. Within each intervention group treatment success will be\n      compared between \"matched treatment subgroup\" and \"unmatched treatment subgroup\" according\n      to the phase 1 prediction rules for each of the three intervention types.\n\n      Phase 3: Impact analysis. Patient satisfaction will be analyzed (SF36, patient satisfaction\n      questionnaire, return to work). Work field will be informed on completed CPR and changes in\n      therapists behavior will be evaluated.\n\n      Our scientific goal is to:  Develop a validated CPR that is applicable in nonspecific CLBP\n      resulting in a better choice of active rehabilitation  therapy, tailor fit for each\n      individual patient."

            "textblock": "State of the art:\n\n        1. Efficacy of active rehabilitation  in chronic low back pain (CLBP): Conclusion: There\n           is strong evidence that active rehabilitation  is more effective than general\n           practitioner care for the reduction of pain and disability and return to work in at\n           least the mid-term (3-6 months) (level A of evidence). Little consensus has been\n           reached on the type of exercises. The conclusion in most RCT's is that there is need\n           for identifying specific subgroups of patients to determine effectiveness of specific\n           exercise interventions.\n\n        2. Existing clinical prediction rule (CPR) for active rehabilitation  in LBP patients: A\n           systematic review of Haskins et al, published in 2012 describes 23 studies on clinical\n           prediction rules in low back pain patients. Of those 23 studies only two handled the\n           development of clinical prediction rules for active rehabilitation in low back pain\n           patients. One of those two was on a McKenzie approach, which is not our point of\n           interest. Secondly Hicks et al developed two preliminary clinical prediction rules in\n           recurrent LBP patients, one for success of stabilization therapy and a second for the\n           absence of success (no success) of stabilization therapy. In the study of Hicks a\n           Multivariate regression analysis resulted in 4 prediction factors for success with\n           therapy. Presence of 3 or more of the predicting factors leads to a positive LR of 4,0\n           (95CI: 1,6 - 10,0) and increases the chance of success with stabilization therapy from\n           33% pre-test to 67% post-test. Secondly 4 predicting factors for no success with\n           stabilization therapy were detected. Presence of 2 or more predicting factors leads to\n           a negative LR of 0,18 (95%CI: 0,08 - 0,38). These existing CPR are only useful when\n           they lead to better therapy outcome. Brennan et al. investigated the application of the\n           Hicks prediction rule in 123 acute and sub acute nonspecific LBP patients. The\n           conclusion of the study was that patients who were assigned to the correct therapy\n           group showed significant larger improvement on the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire\n           compared to the control patients. This difference was measured 4 weeks after finishing\n           the therapy as well as in a one year follow up.\n\n      Added value to the current knowledge/state-of-the-art:\n\n      Up till this moment the CPR for stabilization therapy is developed by a single arm\n      intervention study. It should be repeated in an RCT design to confirm and reinforce\n      findings. Besides stabilization therapy, general exercise therapy and/or isometric training\n      devices are used in back rehabilitation in Flanders. RCT's that compare these different kind\n      of interventions using a between group analysis don't find a difference in effectiveness.\n      They conclude that the heterogeneity of the population is responsible for this \"wash out\n      effect\". Therefore it is important to create a CPR not only for the stabilization group but\n      also for other commonly used exercise therapies.\n\n      Primary objectives:\n\n      Our scientific objectives to be reached within the 42-month period are to obtain clear and\n      reliable answers on the following questions:\n\n        -  Can we determine prognostic indicators for \"success\" and for \"no success\" for applying\n           a specific form of active rehabilitation  (stabilization therapy or general exercise\n           therapy or isometric training devices)?\n\n        -  Can we validate our findings by repeating the intervention trial and applying the\n           drafted CPR?\n\n        -  Does the use of the CPR lead to increased patient satisfactory?\n\n        -  Will the instruction of the new CPR lead to changes in clinician behavior of (a sample)\n           therapists in Flanders?\n\n      Secondary objectives:\n\n        -  Are the CPR for the 3 types of active rehabilitation  diverse?\n\n        -  Is there a domain within the ICF framework that is more relevant in predicting therapy\n           outcome?\n\n        -  Can we determine with a baseline measurement which patients are therapy resistant for\n           an intervention program containing an active rehabilitation ?\n\n        -  Can we determine prognostic factors for recurrence of low back pain within one year\n           after entering the revalidation program?\n\n      Utilisation of the project:\n\n      Number of patients with chronic low back pain:\n\n      Low Back Pain (LBP) can be considered as epidemic. The European Guidelines mention a\n      lifetime prevalence of low back pain of 84%. About 5 to 10% of LBP patients develop chronic\n      low back pain (CLBP), 85% of these patients have non-specific low back pain. According to\n      the latest  report on chronic low back pain of the \"Federaal Kenniscentrum voor de\n      gezondheidszorg (KCE)\" 5% of all consultations of a general practitioner are low back pain\n      patients. One out of four people between 18 and 75 years old has consulted the general\n      practitioner the last 10 years.\n\n      Overview of different scientific steps of the project:\n\n      I.Preparation:\n\n      First 3 months will be spend at operationalising working processes. For example training the\n      testers and treaters of the patients. This will be coordinated by the project leader. We\n      already have performed a pilot study and know the organizational pitfalls, most frequently\n      asked questions by patients and referring doctors. These have to be approached in order to\n      have an optimal work environment for this project.\n\n      II. Phase 1:\n\n        1. In and exclusion criteria subjects:\n\n           Patients are recruited by the doctors at the service of physical medicine UZA.\n\n           Inclusion criteria:\n\n           > 3 months low back pain LRP, consulted a medical doctor because of the persistent low\n           back pain the last month, age between 18 and 60.\n\n           Exclusion criteria :\n\n           Vestibulare dysfunction, spine fractures, spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis,\n           radiating pain below the knee, muscle-, nerve-, skin-, or joint diseases, pregnancy\n\n        2. Power analysis:\n\n           A pilot study shows that the standard deviation of our primary outcome measure, the\n           Oswestry score, is comparable to the results of Brennan et al. Given these estimates,\n           120 patients should suffice to detect a minimum clinically important difference of 6\n           points on the Oswestry (effect size _ 0.43) with 80% power using a two-tailed\n           hypothesis.\n\n           This means that in total 3 X 40 patients should complete the whole trial. Based on Van\n           der wouden et al. we know that we can expect a drop out of 54% of the patients during\n           the whole process. This means that initially 260 patients should be included.\n\n           Each year 300 patients enter the multidisciplinary back revalidation program\n           (containing amongst other 30 physiotherapy sessions) at the University hospital of\n           Antwerp. About 220 patients enter the polyclinic because of low back pain receiving\n           between 1 and 18 sessions of physiotherapy.\n\n        3. Information form and informed consent After evaluation of in- and exclusion criteria we\n           will inform the patient about the trial. Information form and informed consent are made\n           and have been approved by the ethics committee of the UZA.\n\n        4. Baseline testing:\n\n           As primary outcome measure (dependant variable) the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire\n           is used. This variable is reliable, valid and responsive.\n\n           As secondary outcome measures (independent variables) the following tests are used:\n\n           - Measurement of impairments: Duration of the LBP, prone instability test, Straight Leg\n           Raise, Beighton scale, Active Straight Leg Raise, sitting knee extension test, waiters\n           bow, pelvic tilt, side support test, extensor endurance test, active sit-up, active ROM\n           (3D motion analysis), isometric strength (Tergumed), visual analogue scale for pain,\n           evaluation of postural control\n\n           - Measurement of limitations in activities and participation: SF36, hours of physical\n           activity/week.\n\n           - Measurement of contextual factors: Tampa scale for kinesiophobia, Fear avoidance\n           belief questionnaire, age, weight, smoking, comorbidity\n\n        5. Randomisation After baseline testing patients will be assigned to one of the three\n           treatment groups ad random. Randomization will be done by a computer. The tester will\n           be aware of the treatment group of the patient. The practitioners who give treatments\n           are blinded for the baseline and follow-up measurements.\n\n        6. Intervention\n\n             -  Specific stabilization therapy: The participants in this group follow specific\n                stabilization training based on the work by Richardson et al. The treatment will\n                be given by two trained physiotherapists. To make sure all therapists will give\n                the same exercises a protocol is set up and a treatment diary will be filled in\n                during each session. Patients will receive 2 treatment every week during 9\n                following weeks.\n\n             -  General active exercise therapy: These participants receive a global form of\n                exercise therapy existing of all kinds of active exercises that do not have the\n                direct purpose of contracting the m. multifidii or m. transversus abdominis. In\n                general the active therapy consists of:1.warming up (home trainer) 2.aerobe\n                conditioning exercises for lower and upper limbs, strength training of the back-\n                and abdominal muscles and advice in relation to their complaints. 3. Cooling down\n                (hometrainer + stretching). To make sure all therapists will give the same\n                exercises a protocol is set up and a treatment diary will be filled in during each\n                session. Patients will receive 2 treatment every week during 9 following weeks.\n\n             -  Isometric training devices: Tergumed protocol is followed. It contains progressive\n                resistance isometric training of trunk muscles on devices  in following\n                directions: flexion, extension, rotation and lateral flexion.\n\n        7. Retesting and follow-up:\n\n           Retesting will take place after finishing the treatment program at 9 weeks. All\n           independent and dependent variables of the baseline testing will be measured.\n\n           Follow-up: at 6 months and 1 year after entering the study the dependent variable will\n           be measured. The patients will be contacted by mail initially and by phone if they\n           don't respond to the mail within 2 weeks.\n\n        8. Data analysis:  We will search for predictors for \"success\" and \"no success\" for the\n           three types of active rehabilitation exercises (stabilization therapy/ general active\n           exercise therapy/ isometric training devices). First an univariate regression analysis\n           will select potential predictors. Secondly these predictors will be entered in a\n           multivariate regression analysis.Since the dependant variable is continuous (the\n           Oswestry Disability Index), a linear regression analysis will be used. First the\n           predictors determined in the study of Hicks et al. are entered in the analysis. When\n           discrete variables are entered in the multivariate analysis the Oswestry score will be\n           dichotomized (responders/ non responders) and a logistic regression analysis will be\n           used. A mediator analysis as described by Baron and Kenny and Preacher and Hayes will\n           be used to examine why the dependant variable is influenced by one or more independent\n           variables. Consecutive regression analysis are performed, this calculates the effect of\n           a variable (mediator) on the relation between two other variables. When more than one\n           mediator is determined a multiple mediator model can be calculated.\n\n      III.Phase 2:\n\n      In Phase 2 we will investigate validation of the prediction rules determined in phase 1.\n      Again we will work according to procedure of phase 1 (see steps 1- 7 above).\n\n      Step 8: data analysis will be different: Using the baseline measurements the CPR determined\n      in phase 1 of our research will be applied to divide each treatment group into 2 subgroups:\n      \"matched therapy\" vs \"unmatched therapy\". The patients that are assigned to an intervention\n      group that according to the CPR is not the best suitable therapy (unmatched) are considered\n      as control patients. The patients that are assigned to an intervention group that according\n      to the CPR is indeed the best suitable therapy are considered as test patients (matched).\n      Baseline variables will be compared between groups using an anova, Kruskall Wallis, or chi2\n      tests of independence based on the nature of the data. To examine the principle hypothesis\n      of phase 2 development op the CPR, a three-way repeated- measures analysis of variance will\n      be performed with treatment group (stabilization vs. general exercise vs. isometric\n      training) and classification subgroup (stabilization vs. general exercise vs. isometric\n      training) as between-subject variables and time (baseline, 9 weeks, 6 months and 1 year) as\n      the within-subject variable. The dependent variable is disability (Oswestry score). The\n      hypothesis of interest is the three-way interaction, and the two-way interactions between\n      time and treatment group, and between time and classification subgroup. We hypothesize that\n      outcome over time will not differ based on the randomized treatment group, or the\n      classification subgroup, but will depend on the interaction between the treatment group and\n      classification subgroup, such that patients randomized to treatment matched to the subgroup\n      will have better outcomes than patients randomized to an unmatched treatment. This\n      hypothesis will be supported if the three-way interaction is significant, but the two-way\n      interactions are not. Pairwise post hoc comparisons will be performed at each follow-up\n      period to further explore any significant interaction terms.\n\n      IV.Phase 3:\n\n      The goals of phase 3 of this project are: Analyze patient satisfactory, inform work field on\n      completed CPR, evaluate change in therapists behavior.\n\n        1. Patient satisfaction: During phase 1 and 2 we will evaluate patient satisfactory\n           concerning the applied treatment at the retest moment at 9 weeks. Patient satisfaction\n           will be based on 3 outcome measures: 1. the SF36 and 2. Return to work and 3. A patient\n           satisfaction questionnaire. An ordinal 5 point Likert scale for following items will be\n           used: 1 Overall quality, 2 Humanness, 3 Competence, 4 Outcome, 5 Facilities, 6\n           Continuity of care, 7 Access, 8 Informativeness, 9 Cost, 10 Bureaucracy, 11 Attention\n           to psychosocial problems (based on Verbeek et al). A comparison will be made between\n           matched subgroup (patients that are assigned to a treatment group that according to the\n           CPR is the best suitable therapy) and unmatched subgroup (patients that are assigned to\n           a treatment group that according to the CPR is not the best suitable therapy).\n\n        2. Inform work field on prediction rules and changes evaluate therapists behavior: We will\n           organize courses at the end of phase 2 of this project to inform clinicians about the\n           CPR. This will be done at the University of Antwerp, at the University Hospital of\n           Antwerp and we will candidate to give lectures at local physiotherapy associations. At\n           the end of these courses (T0) we will inform the participants on the survey on changes\n           in therapists behavior after introduction of the CPR. We will hand out information form\n           and informed consent. Volunteers will leave their contact information (mail, telephone\n           number) on the informed consent. After 3 (T3) and 6 (T6) months we will contact the\n           clinicians who volunteered and evaluate changes in therapists behavior between T0 and\n           T3 and T6 using an online survey. Following items will be inventoried: baseline testing\n           according to CPR, change in choice of exercise program based on CPR, usability, change\n           in number of consultations of the nonspecific CLBP due to CPR."
