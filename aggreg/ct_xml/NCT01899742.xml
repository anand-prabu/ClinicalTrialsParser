      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of UMEC/VI Inhalation Powder (62.5/25
      mcg once-daily) with tiotropium (18 mcg once-daily) over 12 weeks, in subjects with moderate
      and severe COPD, who are receiving tiotropium and continue to have symptoms.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIIb multicentre, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of UMEC/VI Inhalation Powder (62.5/25 mcg) when
      administered once-daily via a novel dry powder inhaler (DPI) compared with tiotropium (18
      mcg) administered once-daily via the HandiHaler over a treatment period of 12 weeks in
      subjects with COPD who continue to have symptoms while on tiotropium.

      The key objective of the study is to recruit those subjects who continue to have symptoms
      while on tiotropium and to ensure that their symptoms are not associated with poor
      adherence. The study will screen approximately 1300 subjects who continue to have symptoms
      whilst on tiotropium. After a 4 week run-in period on open label tiotropium, those subjects
      who continue to have symptoms and have adhered to the treatment schedule will progress into
      the double-blind treatment phase.

      At the end of the run-in phase approximately 666 subjects will be randomised 1:1 to UMEC/VI
      Inhalation Powder (62.5/25 mcg), or tiotropium (18 mcg) in order to achieve 283 evaluable
      subjects per arm at the end of the 12 week double-blind phase. During the double-blind
      phase, each subject will receive two inhalers, a preloaded novel DPI and a HandiHaler dry
      powder inhaler with capsules, for once-daily administration of one active treatment and one
      placebo treatment for 12 weeks.

      There will be a total of 9 study clinic visits conducted on an outpatient basis. Subjects
      will sign the informed consent form (ICF) at either Visit 0 or Visit 1 and will be assigned
      a subject identifier. See Time and Events Table (Table 4) for further details. Subjects who
      meet the eligibility criteria at Screening (Visit 1) will enter the open label tiotropium
      run-in phase. After 4 weeks all subjects will be reviewed (Visit 2) and if they satisfy the
      randomisation criteria they will be randomised and enter the double-blind phase.

      After Visit 2, there will be a further 6 study clinic visits. Further visits are scheduled
      at Day 2, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 and Week 12 +1 day (Visits 3 to 8 respectively).
      Vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate) will be obtained at all clinic visits.

      Trough FEV₁ and trough FVC will be performed at Visit 3 and Visit 8. Pre-dose and post dose
      FEV₁ and FVC measurement at 15 mins and 3 hrs will also be performed at Visit 2, Visit 5,
      Visit 6 &amp; Visit 7.

      At selected study sites, a subset of approximately 400 subjects will be assessed using body
      plethysmography to determine effects of UMEC/VI and tiotropium on lung volumes and
      hyperinflation.  At these sites, the evaluation of trough lung volumes at Visit 3 and Visit
      8 will be performed.  In addition, pre-dose and 3 hrs post-dose assessments at Visit 2,
      Visit 5 &amp; Visit 7 will also be performed.

      An assessment of dyspnea will be obtained using the Baseline and Transition Dyspnea Index
      (BDI/TDI).  At Visit 2, the severity of dyspnea at baseline will be assessed using the BDI.
      Change from baseline will be assessed using the TDI at Visit 5, Visit 6 and Visit 7.

      In addition to the baseline assessment at Visit 2, health status will be captured using the
      St. George Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD (SGRQ-C) scale at Visit 5and Visit 7.

      The impact of COPD on the subjects wellbeing and daily life is measured with the
      self-assessment CAT and the EQ5D.  In addition to the baseline assessment at Visit 2, the
      COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and the Euroqol-5D (EQ-5D) is also completed at Visit 5 and Visit
      7. Furthermore, the CAT is also completed during screening.

      The Patient Reported Global Severity Impression and Global Impression of Change is a
      self-reported global assessment of severity of illness (see Appendix 5) and are performed at
      Baseline during Visit 2 and at Visit 5 and Visit 7.

      A safety Follow-Up assessment will be conducted either by phone call or clinic visit where
      required (e.g., Germany) approximately 7 days after the end of the study treatment (Visit 9
      or Early Withdrawal, if applicable).  The total duration of subject participation, including
      follow-up, will be approximately 18 weeks. All subjects will be provided with
      albuterol/salbutamol for use on an &quot;as-needed&quot; basis throughout the run-in and study
      treatment periods.

                  cigarettes per day for 20 years)]. Previous smokers are defined as those who
                  have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1.

          -  Other Respiratory Disorders: Known α-1 antitrypsin deficiency, active lung infections
             (such as tuberculosis), and lung cancer are absolute exclusionary conditions. A
             subject who, in the opinion of the investigator, has any other significant
             respiratory conditions in addition to COPD should be excluded. Examples may include
             clinically significant bronchiectasis, pulmonary hypertension, sarcoidosis, or
             interstitial lung disease.

          -  Other Diseases/Abnormalities: Subjects with historical or current evidence of
             clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic,

             in remission for &lt;5 years prior to Visit 1 (localized carcinoma of the skin that has
             been resected for cure is not exclusionary). Significant is defined as any disease
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk
             through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the
             disease/condition exacerbated during the study.

          -  Exacerbations: Has had more than 1 COPD exacerbation in the past 12 months. Subjects
             with an exacerbation within 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 are excluded from study.

        COPD exacerbation is defined as worsening symptoms of COPD requiring the use of any

        antibiotics, systemic corticosteroids, and/or emergency treatment or hospitalisation.

          -  Contraindications: A history of allergy or hypersensitivity to any
             anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist, beta2-agonist, lactose/milk protein
             or magnesium stearate or a medical condition such as narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic
             hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction that, in the opinion of the study physician
             contraindicates study participation or use of an inhaled anticholinergic.

          -  Lung Resection: Subjects with lung volume reduction surgery within the 12 months
             prior to Screening (Visit 1).

          -  12-Lead ECG: An abnormal and significant ECG finding from the 12-lead ECG conducted
             at Visit 1, including the presence of a paced rhythm on a 12-lead ECG which causes
             the underlying rhythm and ECG to be obscured.  Investigators will be provided with
             ECG reviews conducted by a centralized independent cardiologist to assist in
             evaluation of subject eligibility. Specific ECG findings that preclude subject
             eligibility are listed in Appendix 3.

        The study investigator will determine the medical significance of any ECG abnormalities
        not listed in Appendix 3.
