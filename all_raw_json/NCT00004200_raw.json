Compare the one year survival rate and progression free survival of patients\n      with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme treated with prinomastat (AG3340) or placebo\n      and temozolomide following radiotherapy. II. Compare the safety of these regimens in these\n      patients. III. Compare the quality of life in these patients on these regimens.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients\n      receive oral prinomastat or placebo twice daily in combination with oral temozolomide daily\n      on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 100 patients will be accrued for this study."
