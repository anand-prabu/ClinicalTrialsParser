  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot study is to develop and test a behavioral intervention to improve the
      health of adults with refractory chronic low back pain (CLBP) and reduce pain medication,
      especially prescription opioid use. CLBP is one of the most common, costly and disabling
      conditions, and is often refractory to treatment. Mindfulness meditation is a promising
      treatment for chronic pain, mental health and addictive disorders. This randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) will test the hypotheses (H) that at 26 weeks, meditation group
      participants (meditation + standard of care, SOC) compared to those in a wait-list control
      group (SOC alone) will:

      H1: improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL) &amp; reduce pain medication use.

      H2: reduce alcohol and drug use and misuse

      H3: show favorable benefit/cost ratio.

      H4: improve stress-sensitive measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is one of the most common, costly and disabling conditions.
      Treatment for refractory CLBP often includes opioid therapy even though it is often only
      marginally effective. Prescription opioid abuse is a national epidemic; development of safe,
      effective non-addictive therapies for chronic pain is a national priority. Mindfulness
      meditation is a promising, safe treatment for chronic pain, mental health and addictive
      disorders. No study has evaluated the potential of meditation to improve health, decrease
      daily pain medication, including opioid, dose or modify CLBP on a biological level in adults
      with opioid-treated refractory CLBP.

      This unblinded 26-week pilot RCT will test methods feasibility and potential efficacy of
      meditation in improving health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and reducing daily pain
      medication, including opioid, use among opioid-treated CLBP adults. Up to 50 adults with
      daily CLBP, treated with daily opioids for at least 3 months, will be recruited from
      outpatient clinic and community settings, and randomly assigned to one of two balanced study
      arms: meditation + standard of care (SOC) or SOC alone (wait-list control). The
      CLBP-tailored meditation intervention will consist of a) therapist-led group training in
      meditation and evidence-based cognitive therapy strategies (two-hours/week for 8 weeks), and
      b) at-home meditation (30 minutes/day, 6 days/week). Controls will be offered meditation
      training after study completion.

      Outcome measures at 0, 8 and 26 weeks will gather data on potential efficacy and mechanism
      of action of meditation intervention; stress reduction is hypothesized to be the primary
      mechanistic pathway: 1. CLBP-related HRQoL and self-reported pain medication use (primary
      outcomes); 2. Alcohol and drug use, and misuse; 3. Benefit/cost measures; and 4.
      Stress-responsive measures (self-reported psychological health measures, serum profile of
      stress-responsive biomarkers, and pain sensitivity and regulation measures).

      This innovative study directly addresses national priorities aimed at development of an
      effective, safe treatment for CLBP and reduction of opioid use. Potential benefits accruing
      from positive findings include improved quality of life and reduced pain medication,
      especially opioid, use among patients with refractory CLBP which may result in decreased
      individual and societal harms that can be associated with opioid therapy; reduced pool of
      circulating opioids may help alleviate the growing problem of prescription opioid abuse.
