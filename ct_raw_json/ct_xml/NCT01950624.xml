  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: The development of a patient registry for Down syndrome (DS) was identified as a
      priority in the 2007 Down Syndrome Research Plan. Under the auspices of the Down Syndrome
      Consortium, founded in 2011 as a public-private partnership between the NIH and DS advocacy
      organizations, NICHD awarded a contract in 2012 to create a patient-focused online registry
      to facilitate research participation by individuals with DS. Two advisory boards, composed
      of advocates, family members, clinicians, researchers, and other relevant parties, have been
      involved in the development of the registry materials.

      Study Population: Individuals with DS (including those with mosaic DS and partial trisomy
      21)

      Design: DS-Connect (TM) is an online survey tool designed to collect demographic data and
      health information from individuals with DS.

      Outcome measures: The purposes of DS-Connect (TM) are:

        1. To identify the various phenotypic manifestations of DS.

        2. To identify individuals with DS who may be eligible for research studies or new
           clinical trials, based on specific information about their diagnosis and health
           history.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Adults (at least 18 years of age) with a diagnosis of DS (including mosaic DS or
             partial trisomy 21) who are capable of providing consent to participate, or for whom
             a legally authorized representative or legal guardian may give permission on behalf
             of the individual to participate.

          -  Children (up to age 18 years of age) with a diagnosis of DS (parents/guardians may
             enter registry information and give permission to participate on behalf of their
             child). (Note: Once a child has reached age 18, he or she will be prompted to
             re-enroll into the registry as an adult, if he/she is able to provide informed
             consent.)

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  A person who does not have a diagnosis of DS (or mosaic DS or partial trisomy 21)

          -  Adults who are not capable of providing informed consent to participate and do not
             have a legally authorized representative or legal guardian.

          -  A person with DS who has passed away.

          -  No individuals with DS will be excluded from taking part in DS-Connect (TM) based on
             age, race, ethnicity, or gender.
