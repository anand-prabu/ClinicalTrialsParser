Home exercises for all sessions consist of following individualized diet and exercise goals, and keeping a food and exercise log to determine areas for future healthy changes."

            "textblock": "Obesity is a major US public health problem. Few obesity prevention programs have reduced\n      risk for weight gain over follow-up and those that have are very intensive, making\n      dissemination difficult and costly. A brief 3-hr selective prevention program (Healthy\n      Weight) targeting young adults with body dissatisfaction involving participant-driven\n      healthy dietary and physical activity lifestyle changes significantly reduced increases in\n      body mass index (BMI) and obesity onset relative to alternative interventions and\n      assessment-only controls through 3-yr follow-up, though effects were small in magnitude. To\n      enhance efficacy, the investigators added dissonance-inducing activities regarding unhealthy\n      dietary and activity practices, drawing from a highly efficacious dissonance-based eating\n      disorder prevention program. A pilot trial found that this new Project Health intervention\n      significantly reduced increases in BMI relative to both the Healthy Weight intervention and\n      an educational brochure condition from pre to post. The investigators propose to conduct a\n      rigorous multisite effectiveness trial that will test whether adding the\n      dissonance-induction elements to the originally Healthy Weight intervention improves weight\n      gain prevention effects. 360 college students at risk for future weight by virtue of their\n      age and weight concerns will be randomized one of three conditions: (1) a refined 6-hr\n      group-based dissonance-based Project Health, (2) a 6-hr group-based Healthy Weight\n      intervention, or (3) a psychoeducational video (\"Weight of the World\") condition.\n      Participants will complete assessments of % body fat, mediators (including objectively\n      measured physical activity), moderators, and other outcomes at pre, post, and 6, 12, and 24\n      month follow-ups."

The\n      investigators will also compare Healthy Weight to video controls.\n\n      Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that Project Health participants will experience increased\n      cognitive dissonance (an uncomfortable psychological state) regarding eating unhealthy foods\n      and engaging in sedentary behaviors, and that changes in dissonance mediate the program's\n      weight gain prevention effects.
