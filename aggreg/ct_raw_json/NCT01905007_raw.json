            "textblock": "Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are the most effective treatment for the\n      primary and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD). At the time of ICD\n      implantation, ventricular fibrillation (VF) is typically induced to demonstrate effective\n      arrhythmia termination by the implanted device.  Although defibrillation threshold (DFT)\n      testing with induction of VF at time of ICD insertion is currently considered the \"standard\n      of care,\" and instructions for usage of devices approved by the Food and Drug Administration\n      (FDA) include labeling with DFT testing, the value of defibrillation testing with modern-day\n      devices has been questioned.  Defibrillation testing can be associated with serious\n      complications and may add to the cost of the procedure.\n\n      It is hypothesized that patients who do not undergo defibrillation testing will have\n      outcomes similar to those who do undergo defibrillation testing at the time of initial\n      implantation.  This pilot study is being performed to determine the feasibility of\n      performing a larger, multi-center clinical trial with longer follow-up to investigate\n      whether or not defibrillation testing will have any impact on overall mortality, implant\n      complications, or long-term first shock efficacy during clinical follow-up."
