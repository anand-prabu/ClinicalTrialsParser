Vitamin D (VD) insufficiency affects as many as half of otherwise\n      healthy adults in developed countries (Holick, 2007). VD is implicated in the control of\n      blood pressure (BP) through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (Yamshchikov, 2009),\n      although the role of VD supplementation for prevention and treatment of the HTA is\n      controversial.The purpose of this study was to investigate if VD supplement in elderly\n      people reduces the levels of BP."

            "textblock": "Study population Adults aged \u2265 60 years with essential hypertension were recruited through\n      nursing homes and physical activity groups in the state of Colima, M\u00e9xico. 45 subjects were\n      assessed for eligibility at our out-patient clinic. We excluded subjects with impaired renal\n      or hepatic function; also subjects who had been treated with vitamin D within the last three\n      months.\n\n      None were on hormone replacement therapy, but we included subjects on anti-hypertensive for\n      more than 10 years and the dosages were unchanged during the study. Before randomization,\n      two subjects withdrew the informed consent because of personal reasons, and two subjects\n      were excluded due to the diagnosis of severe hypertension.\n\n      Design The design was a double-blind, placebo controlled randomized clinical trial. The\n      participants were randomly assigned using a computer-generated randomization code into two\n      groups: group 1 (calcitriol group)with 22 subjects whom were enrolled for 6 weeks of\n      treatment with a daily dose of 1000 IU of cholecalciferol (administered as 1 capsule of 25\n      \u03bcg each) and group 2 with 23 subjects (control group) whom received a similar placebo tablet\n      for also 6 weeks.\n\n      During treatment, nine subjects (20%) left the trial due to personal reasons. All patients\n      provided written informed consent. The study was conducted in accordance with the\n      Declaration of Helsinki II and the guidance on Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Approval was\n      obtained from the bioethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine from the University of\n      Colima (FM014/2012).\n\n      Measurement At the screening visit prior to randomization, subjects had a routine clinical\n      examination and data concerning medical history. BP was measured 3 consecutive days at the\n      same time, using a kit integrated aneroid sphygmomanometer with stethoscope (medimetrics\n      5769) with the patient seated and with at least 5 min rest. The subjects with average BP\n      >140/90 mm Hg  were included in the study.\n\n      Once enrolled in the study groups, anthropometrics measurements were collected. The\n      measurements performed were weight and height with light clothing and no shoes, and the\n      indicator body mass index (kg/m2) was calculated. For the determination of serum 25(OH)D,two\n      blood samples were collected in the morning after an overnight fast of minimum 8 h on the\n      day of the randomization and at the end of the study.\n\n      The patients attended control visits every week for safety measures, adverse event\n      registration and assessment of compliance.Returned pills were counted at each visit, and\n      compliance was calculated as the percentage of used pills compared to the expected number.\n\n      Biochemistry Serum 25(OH)D concentration were measured with the use of competitive\n      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA: immunodiagnostic, Bernheim, Germany) after\n      solid-phase extraction (reference range: 17-53 pg/mL). The intra- and interassay CVs for the\n      2 Vitamin D metabolites were <7,0% and 9,0%, respectively.\n\n      Statistical Analysis The data were analyzed with the SPSS version 21. The variables studied\n      were described as frequencies, percentages and as median (interquartile range); inferential\n      statistics were performed with non parametric tests (Mann Whitney and related sample\n      Wilcoxon test), and correlations between variables were analyzed by bivariate correlation\n      analysis by Pearson's correlation. Statistical significance was set at a p value < 0.05."
