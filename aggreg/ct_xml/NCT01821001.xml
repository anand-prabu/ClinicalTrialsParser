  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adenomyosis is a rare non-malignant disease of the uterus that causes significant symptoms
      including heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic pain.  The only widely accepted treatment for
      adenomyosis is hysterectomy. The investigators will use a dopamine agonist, bromocriptine,
      as a therapy based on animal models of the disease and our prior clinical research to
      observe any objective improvement in the extent of the disease using Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (MRI)and standard measurements for other gynecologic diseases to measure
      symptomatology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women with adenomyosis proven with MRI will be considered for the intervention with
      bromocriptine. They will be reassessed at 1, 6 and 9 months. Patients will get a stipend for
      each visit they complete. The study will end for the enrolled subject at 9th month follow-up

    <description>All patients will get a baseline imaging of the uterus with MRI and a brief procedure, similar to a pap smear, to obtain tissue from the uterus and also a blood draw. Patients will then receive vaginal bromocriptine twice daily and will be reassessed at 6 months with an MRI to see objective improvement in the extent of the disease.  This 6 month visit is the only one that would require an in person visit to the research site (Mayo Clinic in this case)</description>
