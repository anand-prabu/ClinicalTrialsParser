Thus, there has been a scarcity of data on serial changes of storage symptoms\n      in the postoperative period after PVP or HoLEP and data on predicting factors that influence\n      improvement in storage symptoms postoperatively. The aim of this study was to compare serial\n      changes of postoperative storage symptoms between PVP and HoLEP, and to identify the\n      predictors that influence improvement of storage symptoms postoperatively."
