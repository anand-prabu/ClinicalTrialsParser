The 4 clinic personnel in each site will include: the physician-in-charge, a nurse, one peer educator, and a nurse or community counselor from the VCT clinic.  A semi-structured interview guide will be used to query respondents about: procedures for enrolling new clients, conducting active testing, identifying and initiating patients on ART, CD4 monitoring, tracking clients who have missed appointments, support programs, and peer education. We will also aim to understand how each respondent views her/his role, how s/he counsels patients on pre-ART care, and the challenges faced from each one's perspective."

            "textblock": "The availability of HIV care and treatment programs is increasing in sub-Saharan Africa.\n      However more than half the patients who need HIV medicines are still not receiving this\n      antiretroviral therapy (ART), and this can lead to early death from AIDS. One of the\n      problems in this region is that patients start ART late, after the HIV disease is very\n      advanced.   This results in high death rates soon after ART initiation. The way clinic-level\n      factors, such as the way services and referrals are organized, how referrals are regarded,\n      counseling messages and record-keeping, contribute to late ART initiation is unclear. As the\n      second phase of a 3-phase NIH-sponsored project, this study will identify clinic-level\n      enablers and barriers to timely enrollment into HIV care and ART initiation.  A\n      cross-sectional qualitative study will be conducted at 4 selected HIV care and treatment\n      clinics and the health facilities in which they are located in Ethiopia. Data will be\n      collected using 4 methods:\n\n        1. Data abstraction\n\n        2. Key informant interviews with clinic personnel\n\n        3. Observation of post-test counseling sessions in the VCT clinic\n\n        4. Observation of provider-patient interactions in the care and treatment clinic\n           Identifying modi\ufb01able health facility-level predictors of late ART initiation will\n           facilitate implementation of interventions, programs and policies that will increase\n           the number of patients who enroll in HIV care and initiate ART early.  Additionally,\n           results will inform the design of the third phase of the NIH-project referenced above."

One major challenge in this region is high rates of late ART initiation\n      (i.e., in the advanced stages of HIV disease) which results in high rates of mortality soon\n      after ART initiation. The clinic-level factors that contribute to late ART initiation are\n      unclear.\n\n      Objective: As the second of a 3-phase NIH-sponsored project, this study aims to identify\n      clinic-level enablers and barriers to timely ART initiation.\n\n      Methods: A cross-sectional qualitative study will be conducted at 4 purposively selected HIV\n      care and treatment clinics in Ethiopia. Data will be collected using 4 methods:\n\n        1. Data abstraction\n\n        2. Key informant interviews with clinic personnel\n\n        3. Observation of post-test counseling sessions at the voluntary counseling and testing\n           (VCT) clinic\n\n        4. Observation of provider-patient interactions in the care and treatment clinic\n           Descriptive statistics will be produced from the data abstraction. Content analysis of\n           key informant interviews will be conducted. Descriptive summaries will be produced from\n           observations.  All analyses will focus on identifying within- and across-clinic themes,\n           and include triangulation across data collection methods to identify clinic-level\n           enablers and barriers to timely ART initiation.\n\n      Expected use of results: Identifying modi\ufb01able clinic-level enablers and barriers to timely\n      ART initiation will facilitate implementation of interventions, programs and policies to\n      reduce late ART initiation. Additionally, results will inform the third phase of the\n      NIH-project referenced above."
