Only when vitality in the contraction impaired segments\n           will be established based on 2D-Strain Analysis, PCI (Percutaneous Coronary\n           Intervention) will be performed.\n\n        -  Second Group: Coronary angiography by patient will be canceled. Patients will get\n           viability assessment using MRI(Magnetic resonance imaging) within the next 7 days. When\n           vitality will be established with MRI, patient will get PCI (Percutaneous Coronary\n           Intervention).\n\n      In addition, as part of a feasibility analysis, the possibility of a consolidation of data\n      of coronary angiography with the ultrasound images will be researched by first group of\n      patients. The aim is to simplify the visualization of the intraprocedural vitality\n      detection. For this purpose, a position sensor based on electromagnetic fields (EMT) will be\n      used during coronary angiography."
