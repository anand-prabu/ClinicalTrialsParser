  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The program effectiveness study aims to assess the effect of a lipid-based nutrition
      supplement (LNS) and micronutrient powder (MNP) provided in a programmatic context for
      improving maternal nutritional status during pregnancy and lactation (LNS only), and
      preventing malnutrition in infants and young children (LNS and MNP) in Bangladesh.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a cluster-randomized controlled trial with four study &quot;arms&quot;, implemented
      within the context of the Community Health and Development Program (CHDP) run by the World
      Mission Prayer League, which also has a hospital in the area and is known as LAMB. Data
      collection is longitudinal, starting with the identification of women in early pregnancy who
      are eligible to enter the study, and continuing, with follow-up of the child, until 24
      months post-partum. The investigators are evaluating the effect of providing LNS-PLW to
      mothers during pregnancy and lactation on maternal health and nutrition outcomes (including
      anthropometric and micronutrient status), morbidity and birth outcomes in comparison to
      mothers who receive iron-folic acid tablets during pregnancy and lactation. The
      investigators are also evaluating the effect of three different home-fortification
      approaches (arms a-c, below) on child health and nutrition outcomes including anthropometric
      status, micronutrient status, anemia, and motor and cognitive development, in comparison to
      a control arm not receiving a home fortification intervention.

      Additionally, the cost of implementation and delivery of the LNS-PLW, LNS-child or MNP
      interventions as part of the CHDP compared to standard CHDP program delivery will be
      documented. Willingness to pay (private demand) for LNS-PLW, LNS-child and MNP products by
      selected caregivers and male heads of households will be assessed at baseline and again at
      various points during the intervention period.

      A process evaluation of the LNS and MNP interventions, and of the services provided to the
      control group, within the CHDP will be conducted to: 1) Document and evaluate the processes
      needed for implementation of interventions that provide a nutrient supplement such as LNS or
      MNP in the context of the CHDP; and 2) Explain and interpret program effectiveness study
      results and identify important facilitators and barriers to success of the nutrition
      intervention, which can be used to improve the effectiveness of current CHDP programs and
      future similar programs that include the scaling-up of LNS or MNP.
