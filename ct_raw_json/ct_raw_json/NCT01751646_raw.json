Subjects must have\n      at least one documented viral load that is below 200 copies/mL that is collected following\n      initiation of TDF containing cART and greater than 90 days prior to screening; no viral load\n      above 200 copies/mL if measured within the 90 days prior to screening; and a viral load\n      obtained at screening that is below 200 copies/mL.\n\n      Treatment assignments will be balanced by subject sex at birth, age (<20 years vs. >=20\n      years), and race (African American vs. other). Enrolled subjects will be randomized to\n      receive vitamin D3 50000 IU or matching placebo, given orally every four weeks by DOT. In\n      addition to the randomized study agent, all subjects will receive a MVI to be taken orally\n      once daily. This \"standard\" MVI will contain ingredients not to exceed 600 IU of vitamin D3\n      and 200 mg Ca.\n\n      DXA measurement of whole-body BMC, and BMD at spine and hip,   will be performed at baseline\n      and study weeks 24, 48, and 96. Blood and urine sampling to assess the Ca-PO4 axis,\n      PTH-FGF23-vitamin D signaling, bone turnover, and renal glomerular and tubular function will\n      occur at baseline and study weeks 12, 24, 48, and 96. Blood samples to measure Gluc\n      homeostasis will be drawn at baseline and weeks 48 and 96, and will be run by batch\n      analysis.\n\n      Safety, measured by SCa and SCr, will be monitored by subject's record review at study sites\n      since these labs will generally be measured as a part of routine clinical care.  The ATN109\n      study will use the SCa and SCr values obtained within 10 weeks at the time of the visit\n      beginning at the baseline visit. If these evaluations were not performed within the prior 10\n      weeks they will be drawn at the time of the visit. Viral load and CD4 cell count results\n      will be recorded for the ATN109 study at screening, baseline and study weeks 12, 24, 48, and\n      96 provided the evaluations were done within the protocol specified timeframe. If the\n      evaluations are not performed within the protocol specified timeframes they will be drawn at\n      the time of the visit (see section 7.0 for additional details)."
