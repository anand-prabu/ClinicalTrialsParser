During the screening phase, participants will be evaluated to\n      determine if they meet the study eligibility criteria. A target of 14 healthy Japanese and\n      14 healthy Caucasian adult participants (20 to 55 years of age inclusive) will be enrolled\n      in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, respectively.\n\n      The participants in each cohort will self-administer each of the 3 different single-dose\n      regimens of intranasal esketamine (Treatments A, B, and C) over the 3 treatment periods (ie,\n      1 treatment per period) in an open-label manner (both the investigator and the participant\n      knows which intervention the participant receives). The participants will be randomly (like\n      the toss of a coin) assigned to receive Treatment A and Treatment B in the first two periods\n      (ie, Treatment A in Period 1 and Treatment B in Period 2, or the reverse order). All\n      participants will receive Treatment C in Period 3. The regimens differ in the number of\n      sprays to achieve the total dose and the total esketamine dose administered.\n\n      Safety and tolerability will be evaluated throughout the study and will include assessment\n      of adverse events, targeted nasal examinations, laboratory tests, electrocardiogram,\n      physical examination, pulse oximetery, and vital signs."
