          -  Availability of fixed tumor specimen (block or slides) for exploratory biomarker
             analysis. If no slides or block are available, fresh tumor biopsies should be
             obtained and used for these assessments

             first dose of study treatment

          -  Systemic antineoplastic therapy within 21 days before the first dose of study drug

          -  Radiotherapy within 14 days preceding the first dose of study treatment

          -  Prior treatment with radiation therapy involving ≥ 25% of the hematopoietically
             active bone marrow
