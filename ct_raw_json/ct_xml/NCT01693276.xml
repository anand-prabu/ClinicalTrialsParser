  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will analyze the effects, good and/or bad, of the drug Abraxane in combination
      with gemcitabine and gemcitabine with concurrent radiation therapy for patients with locally
      advanced pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.  All of the medications used
      in this study are FDA-approved for use in patients with pancreatic cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long term goal is to improve survival of patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer.
      Additional potential benefits include increased probability of local control and decreased
      distant metastases.

    <description>Patients will receive 2 cycles of gemcitabine and abraxane prior to the start of chemoradiation. Chemoradiation will commence 2 week after the completion of second cycle of gemcitabine/abraxane. Patients will receive an additional 2 cycles of gemcitabine and abraxane to start 2-4 weeks after the completion of chemoradiation. After the last two cycles of chemotherapy, if well tolerated with continued tumor response additional cycles of chemotherapy may be given.</description>

          -  Adequate labs

          -  No prior abdominal radiation therapy

          -  No other concurrent clinically evident malignancy, except inactive nonmelanoma skin
