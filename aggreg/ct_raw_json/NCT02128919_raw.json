It assesses smoking with CO mentoring, nicotine and cotinine\n      levels, and  craving with QSU scale and response to craving slides. Cognition is measures by\n      MATRICS  battery, symptoms are measured by PANSS scale and hallucination scale.\n\n      This is double-blind sham-controlled study, with active  tDCS 2ma or 20 minutes over 5 days,\n      and sham tDCS for 40 seconds on each  sham occasion."
