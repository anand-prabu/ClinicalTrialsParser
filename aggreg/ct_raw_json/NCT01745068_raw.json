            "textblock": "During their lifetime, approximately 50% of Canadian women and 30% of Canadian men will\n      experience at least one fracture due to bone fragility (FF). Evidence is growing regarding\n      prevention programs' effectiveness to prevent falls, but prevention of fractures through\n      fall prevention programs has enjoyed limited success. Falls prevention programs and\n      post-fracture screening programs leading to pharmacological treatment are very different\n      strategies, with a shared ultimate goal. Coordination between those who repair fractures and\n      those who manage the patient to prevent the next fracture is critical. The overarching aim\n      of this proposal is to generate evidence-based knowledge about the effectiveness and\n      cost-effectiveness of an integrated FF prevention program, as well as a portrait of the\n      barriers and facilitating factors for such programs. More specifically, the objectives are:\n      1) to combine existing fall prevention and post-fracture management programs in the province\n      of Quebec into integrated FF prevention programs; 2) to compare the performance of these\n      integrated programs to control sites, using a pragmatic study design; 3) to identify\n      barriers as well as factors that improve effectiveness across different implementation\n      milieu; and 4) to develop and engage in active knowledge transfer activities in Quebec\n      regions where integrated FF prevention programs are neither adequately nor successfully\n      implemented. Drawing upon the literature on integrated healthcare, fall and fracture\n      prevention, we hypothesize that an integrated FF program can reduce the risk of a subsequent\n      fracture by at least 30% in the population of interest. The proposed team is poised to\n      develop new interdisciplinary collaborations among healthcare practitioners and decision\n      makers involved in the prevention of FFs. The program is built upon existing healthcare and\n      structures and programs and in turn, will truly measure the effectiveness of an integrated\n      FF prevention program. The results will ultimately lead to improvements in the existing\n      knowledge base, address policy-relevant and health systems problems, and assist in the\n      design and implementation of FFs prevention programs."
