However, management of bleeds in these patients can be\n      challenging due to variation in response and lack of standardized methods to monitor the\n      effect. We hypothesized that significant increase in whole blood clot stability could be\n      achieved when tranexamic acid was given concomitantly with bypassing-agents while thrombin\n      generation remains unaffected. In this prospective crossover study the effect of aPCC and\n      rFVIIa with and without TXA on clot stability and thrombin generation capacity (ETP) were\n      studied, using thromboelastography (ROTEM) and thrombin generation assay (TGA),\n      respectively. In addition, the risk of thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation\n      (DIC) was assessed."
