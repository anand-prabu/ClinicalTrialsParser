Patients are stratified according to\n      center, type of surgery (mastectomy vs local excision), and breast boost (yes vs no).\n      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive radiotherapy 5 times a week for 5 weeks for a total dose of 50\n           Gy.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive radiotherapy 5 times a week for 3 weeks for a total dose of 40\n           Gy.\n\n      A breast boost is recommended in both arms for patients with microscopic evidence of\n      invasive or in situ cancer at, or within 1 mm of, a resection margin. These patients receive\n      radiotherapy for 5 fractions in 1 week for a total boost dose of 10 Gy.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then at 6, 12, 24, and 60 months.\n\n      Patients are followed annually for up to 20 years.\n\n      Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1840 patients (920 per arm) will be accrued for this study."
