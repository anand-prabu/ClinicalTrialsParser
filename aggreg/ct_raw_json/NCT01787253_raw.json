Measurement of\n      perceived sensitivity in the gut will be evaluated by pain-response under mechanical stress\n      using a barostat. The HIT (Human intestinal Tissue)-Chip array will be used to characterize\n      the diversity, stability and functionality of the intestinal microbiota on mucosa level,\n      giving a clue to the interactions with the host and insight to changes leading to the\n      development of the two diseases.\n\n      Immunohistochemistry and flowcytometry will be used to analyse the location, frequency and\n      phenotype characteristics of lymphoid- and mast cells. Functional analysis of mucosal\n      lymphocytes activated in vitro by products from the intestinal microbiota will be examined\n      by cytokine production using the LuminexTM system. The Ussing chamber technique will allow\n      investigation of the impact of the microbiota and its metabolites on intestinal barrier\n      functions. In this method the sample has access to stressors under standard conditions."
