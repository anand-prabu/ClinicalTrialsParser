Subjects will be randomly assigned to the intervention\n      (GF-CBT)or control (symptom monitoring) groups. GF-CBT is based on a cognitive\n      neuropsychiatric model of delusions, and incorporates recent developments in learning and\n      cognitive theories. GF-CBT consists of individual, group, and family group sessions. The\n      three-part program teaches adolescents and family members Cognitive Behavioral skills that\n      they can continue using on their own after completion of the program. Preliminary efficacy\n      of the intervention will be evaluated using standardized measures by blind evaluators\n      conducted at baseline, post-treatment, and post-termination follow-up over the next 2 years.\n      Hypotheses: (a) GF-CBT will be associated with: high rate of remission from \"at risk status\"\n      and low rates of transition to psychosis (defined by CAARMS criteria); greater improvements\n      in severity of symptoms; and improved functioning; (b) decrease in family members'level of\n      stress, and improved coping; (c) Family members will demonstrate proficiency in CBT Skills."
