            "textblock": "Body weight excess, from overweight to overt obesity, is associated with adverse health\n      outcomes. In view of the time-trends of the obesity epidemic and the related cost burden,\n      the search for effective strategies for weight reduction and long-term maintenance of weight\n      loss (WL) is at the top of the agenda of  public health systems.\n\n      The current first-line strategy includes  several treatment options  and dietary\n      interventions to be implemented together with an exercise program. Unfortunately, compliance\n      with intervention in the long-term is difficult. It is not infrequent to observe people\n      following one diet after another  and experiencing multiple failures which, in turn, lead to\n      higher body weight and adverse consequences on body composition and fat distribution. The\n      higher the number of attempts, the more difficult the adherence to further interventions.\n      In the presence of severe (body mass index >40 kg/m2) or complicated obesity, bariatric\n      surgery could be proposed. This therapeutic option is effective, but is not devoid of\n      complications and may be irreversible. Obesity-related complications, such as diabetes,\n      hypertension or sleep apnoea are likely to occur more frequently with increasing body mass\n      index (BMI) and rapid and considerable WL is mandatory to curtail such risks.\n\n      In this scenario, alternative treatment options are warranted. About 40 years ago, after the\n      introduction of protein-sparing modified fasting (PSMF) achieved through the use of oral\n      high-protein foods or liquid formula diets by Blackburn and Bistrian, several studies\n      evaluated its effectiveness and safety. They  showed that responsible and supervised\n      very-low calorie diets (VLCDs) could be considered  safe and appropriate therapy for\n      obesity.\n\n      The purpose of the present study was to investigate the potential role of a 2-week course of\n      enteral treatment with a very low-calorie protein-based formula in the management of severe\n      obesity.\n\n      The rationale of this treatment option rests on the following considerations: 1) VLCDs\n      appear to be able to reduce cardiovascular risk rapidly and effectively; 2) VLCDs induce\n      considerable short and long-term WL; 3) optimal compliance with the intervention, as active\n      participation of the patient is not required; 4) continuous administration of the\n      intervention formula by  enteral route enables the  the maintenance of the body amino acid\n      pool.\n\n      Before being proposed for clinical use, a new WL program should be scientifically evaluated.\n      Accordingly, in the present study, attention was focused not only on efficacy in terms of\n      improving the cardiometabolic risk profile, but also on the feasibility and safety of the\n      procedure."
