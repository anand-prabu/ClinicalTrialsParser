For that purpose the investigators use the SWORD system that combines 3D\n      motion quantification wearable sensors and a vibratory module.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that vibratory stimuli during a motor rehabilitation task\n      increase significantly the number of correct movements performed per unit of time.\n\n      The design of the study is a cross-over randomized clinical trial. With the SWORD system in\n      place each patient will perform the hand-to-mouth task twice (with vibratory feedback and\n      without it), the order being random. The number of correct movements and other motor\n      outcomes will be assessed continuously under both conditions."
