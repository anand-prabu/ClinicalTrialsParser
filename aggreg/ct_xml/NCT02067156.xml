  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma (GBM) comprises about 16% of all malignancies of the nervous system and over
      50% of all gliomas.  Standard of care for newly-diagnosed GBM is a combination of surgical
      debulking followed by concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide.  Efforts
      to improve second-line therapy in GBM have met with only marginal success and there is a
      large unmet medical need for new therapies.  G-202 is an example of prodrug chemotherapy. It
      is activated by Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA), which is expressed by some cancer
      cells and in the blood vessels of most solid tumors, including GBM, but not by normal cells
      or blood vessels in normal tissue. It is believed that activation of the prodrug G-202 will
      allow the drug to kill cancer cells. This study will evaluate the activity, safety and CNS
      exposure of G-202 in patients with recurrent or progressive GMB receiving G-202 by
      intravenous infusion on three consecutive days of a 28-day cycle.
