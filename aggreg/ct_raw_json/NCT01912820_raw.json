In preclinical studies, green tea polyphenols have\n      anticancer and cancer preventative effects in a number of malignancies. Likewise, in\n      preclinical studies quercetin was found to enhance the anticancer effects of green tea. This\n      trial is designed to translate these findings forward in a short-term human intervention\n      trial."
