The study duration is 36 weeks.This study also tests that a low fat,\n      plant-based (vegan) diet free of foods commonly identified as triggers improves mood, using\n      the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised (CESD-R), and the Beck\n      Depression Inventory II (BDI-II)."
