            "textblock": "This study is Phase II of a project by the University of Arizona Center for Integrative\n      Medicine (AzCIM). Collaborating with AzCIM is the Health Outcomes and Pharmacoeconomics\n      (HOPE) Center and the RAND Corporation, Inc. Phase II is a prospective evaluation of the\n      clinical and cost effectiveness (outcomes) of an integrative medicine professional practice\n      model for adult primary care delivery (the University of Arizona Integrative Health Center -\n      UAIHC in Phoenix, AZ). Data will be gathered from eligible and consenting members of UAIHC.\n      In addition, a fidelity evaluation will assess whether the practice model was implemented as\n      planned.\n\n      The specific aims are to: 1) Recruit, consent, and enroll a sample of eligible patient and\n      staff participants from UAIHC; 2) Conduct outcome evaluation of UAIHC care using patient\n      data from medical records abstractions, self-report assessments, clinic administrative and\n      service utilization/encounter data, and health insurance claims data; and, 3) Conduct\n      fidelity evaluation of the implementation of the UAIHC model as described in its business\n      plan using patient- and staff-reported fidelity assessments, random chart audits, and\n      abstracted clinic administrative data.\n\n      Participants. 1) Participants from the clinic patient population for whom clinical and cost\n      outcomes will be tracked (n=500); 2) Clinic patients from whom fidelity data will be\n      collected (n=180); and, 3) Clinic personnel from whom fidelity data will also be collected\n      (n=14).\n\n      Data Collection. For outcomes evaluation, data will be collected at baseline (initial clinic\n      visit), and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow up periods. Sources include clinical symptoms and\n      biomarkers from medical records abstractions; patient reported outcomes and satisfaction\n      questionnaires; clinic service encounter logs; and, cost data from health insurance claims\n      information and clinic financial data. For fidelity evaluation, data will be collected\n      monthly for 6 months after study start, quarterly for the next 6 months, and semi-annually\n      from then on. Patient data for fidelity will be gathered on a single randomized day of the\n      week using a self-administered patient feedback questionnaire. For personnel, fidelity data\n      will be collected at the same intervals using a self-administered provider perceptions\n      questionnaire of inter-professional team and integrative medical care. Data from audits of\n      randomly selected patient charts and administrative records will also be used."
