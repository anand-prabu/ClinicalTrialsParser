            "textblock": "This population based pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims at optimizing\n      cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention through accurate identification of individuals at\n      high risk of CVD and accurate perception of the risk, and better compliance to preventive\n      treatments and reduced premature CV morbidity and mortality\n\n      Background: Myocardial infarction and stroke are the primary causes of deaths. Around 50%\n      present with potentially life-threatening symptoms or unexpected death. The majority\n      (90-95%) are caused by modifiable factors. Statistical screening models for risk assessment\n      to identify individuals at high CVD risk are widely used clinically and basis for\n      pharmacological prevention and life style modification. However, the life time risk of CVD\n      is underestimated, the accuracy in differentiating between high and intermediate risk is\n      only modest, the majority of events (that occur in individuals at only intermediate risk)\n      are not predicted by such models, and randomized trials which show improved results of\n      prevention of CVD are lacking\n\n      Generally, the association between CVD risk factors and perceived risk is weak. Adherence to\n      preventive medications and risk factor control are poor. Health care providers are unaware\n      of this problem, and their compliance with guidelines for prevention suboptimal. The\n      perception of risk depends on psychological and cultural factors and level of health\n      literacy. Risk communication is increasingly recognized as important for CVD management.\n      Visual risk messages might be more effective than verbal information\n\n      Increased carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) and carotid plaques, assessed by\n      ultrasonography, are early signs of atherosclerosis and associated with myocardial\n      infarction and stroke. Their contributory role for risk stratification is unclear, and also\n      if imaging-based identification of at-risk subjects improves the compliance to life-style\n      modification and pharmacotherapy. Few studies have systematically evaluated image-based risk\n      stratification and its effect on clinical outcomes and results are conflicting. Therefore\n      large-scale RCTs targeting low or intermediate-risk adults and focus on the impact of\n      imaging results are needed\n\n      Project description: The V\u00e4sterbotten Intervention Programme (VIP), Northern Sweden, is\n      integrated in primary care services with assessment of traditional CV risk factors and\n      individual health promoting counselling for all 40-, 50- and 60-year olds (n=6500/year).\n      Those with diabetes, hypertension, family history of premature CVD and/or\n      hypercholesterolemia are referred to treatment according to clinical guidelines\n\n      VIP participants with at least one conventional CV risk factor (60% of participants) are\n      eligible for inclusion in VIPVIZA. During 2013-2015, 3200 participants will be enrolled.\n      Portable carotid ultrasound machines will be used for ultrasound examinations at rural\n      health centres and in hospitals in the towns. CIMT and plaque formation will be visualized\n      and measured. Individuals with a stenosis \u226550% of the carotid lumen will be excluded. In a\n      pilot study October 2012 (95 participants) 47% were classified as \"high risk\" of CVD based\n      on CIMT \u226575th percentile for age and sex, or \"very high risk\" based on the presence of\n      plaque\n\n      Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two groups; 1/ Intervention: Written\n      information to patient and physician, including graphic presentation in colour of CIMT\n      (1-100 percentile by age and sex) and of plaque, vascular age, an ultrasound image, general\n      information about atherosclerosis as a dynamic process, and recommendation to follow\n      clinical guidelines for risk factor control. 2/ Control: No information from the baseline\n      ultrasonography\n\n      Determinants of behavioural change will be explored using psychometric questionnaires and\n      level of health literacy. Deep interviews at the time point for the ultrasound examinations\n      will explore how the screening relates to risk perception, quality of life, coping\n      strategies, attitudes to and skills of self-care\n\n      Both groups will be managed according to clinical guidelines within the usual health care.\n      CV risk factors and life style will be monitored after one and three years. After three\n      years (2015-2017), the ultrasonography will be repeated and information given to all\n      participants and their physicians. Total follow-up will be five years, i.e. until 2020.\n\n      Primary outcome variables: After 1 and 3 years: CVD risk factors and lifestyle. Secondary\n      outcome variables: 1/ After 1, 3 and 5 years:  pharmacological treatments for CVD\n      prevention. 2/ After 3 years: quality of life, CIMT and  plaque parameters 3/ Within 5\n      years: Myocardial infarctions, stroke, revascularizing surgery, and deaths (all-cause and\n      CVD specific). Data will be collected from all computerized medical records in the county,\n      the national Pharmaceutical, the In-patient, and Causes of Deaths registers.\n\n      An International Advisory Board is established"
