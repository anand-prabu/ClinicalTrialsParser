It has shown superior survival against mitoxantrone (MTX) plus\n      prednisone in docetaxel pre-treated hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer patients\n      leading to registration of the compound. It showed a favorable toxicity profile with an\n      interestingly low rate of alopecia. In the Genevieve study it will be compared against\n      weekly paclitaxel which is currently most widely used treatment of breast cancer patients. A\n      head-to-head comparison in the neoadjuvant setting will allow a rapid and precise comparison\n      of efficacy and tolerability of cabacitaxel versus paclitaxel to decide in how far further\n      development of this taxoid in breast cancer is reasonable."
