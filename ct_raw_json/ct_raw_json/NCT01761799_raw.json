The intervention package will include evidence-based components aimed at the\n      practice-level, provider-level, and patient level and will be tested through a\n      cluster-randomized trial design.  The primary outcome measure is influenza vaccine receipt\n      during pregnancy.  The secondary outcomes include 1) receipt of pertussis (Tdap) vaccination\n      during pregnancy, and 2) changes in maternal knowledge, attitudes and beliefs regarding\n      maternal and infant vaccination. The primary hypothesis is that implementation of a\n      comprehensive vaccine promotion package in the obstetric setting will increase the\n      likelihood that a pregnant woman receives an influenza and/or pertussis vaccination."
