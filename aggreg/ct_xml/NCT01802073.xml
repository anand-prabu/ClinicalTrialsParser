      The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in the fecal and salivary microbiota during
      vancomycin treatment of children and adults with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC),
      identify features of the host microbiota that are associated with disease activity and/or
      response to treatment and further delineate the immunological effects of oral vancomycin
      treatment of PSC.  This study will correlate changes in microbiota with the immunological
      effects of oral vancomycin in children and adults with PSC.  The results of this proposal
      will lead to new and validated targets for diagnosis and treatment of PSC that will have
      high impact in the short and long term for patients and their families.

    <description>Determine the benefit of oral vancomycin therapy for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis. 	Blood tests(liver enzymes - ALT and GGT), imaging studies (MRI, ERCP) and/or liver biopsy changes before and while on oral vancomycin will assess the benefit of the therapy.</description>

    <description>1) For children who weight &lt; or = 30 kg, the vancomycin dose will be 50 mg/kg/day given orally 3 times per day for the 1st month and continue with the same dose for subsequent months if the clinical laboratory studies improved and are normal. If the laboratory studies are not normal the dose will be increased to 75 mg/kg/day given orally 3 times per day for the 2nd month and 100mg/kg/day given orally 3 times per day the 3rd month. If the laboratory studies do not improve by the end of the 3rd month since starting the vancomycin, the vancomycin will be stopped and the child will not continue the study. 2) For adults and children who weigh &gt;30 kg, the vancomycin dose will be 500 mg given orally 3 times per day for the 1st month and continue with this dose if the clinical laboratory studies improve and are normal. If the laboratory studies are not normal the dose will be increased to 750 mg 3 times per day for the 2nd month and 1000 mg 3 times per day the 3rd month.</description>
