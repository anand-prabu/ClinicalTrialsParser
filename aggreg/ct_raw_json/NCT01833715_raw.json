Our hypothesis is that methadone is more effective than\n      morphine for postoperative pain treatment."

This came down to 36 randomized patients into each group,\n      so 86 patients will be recruited considering a 15% loss to follow up.\n\n      Before signing an informed consent, we will explain to them how to classify pain intensity\n      numerical rating scale (NRS) and this will be evaluated periodically during the first 24\n      hours after surgery.\n\n      General anesthesia will be based on Remifentanil and Propofol, titrated to achieve\n      bispectral index (BIS) between 40 and 60. Patients will be randomized into methadone group\n      (ME) and morphine group (MO), they will receive 0.08 mg / kg bolus of methadone or 0.08 mg /\n      kg bolus of morphine as applicable at the time of beginning surgery. Postoperative analgesia\n      will be standard for both groups. Patient\u00b4s demographic data will be filed as well as\n      surgical timings.\n\n      All patients will remain in the anesthetic recovery room for the first two hours , to get a\n      record taken of vital signs and measurement of NRS at 5, 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes. If NRS\n      is greater than or equal to 4, 1 mg of morphine ev will be used as analgesic rescue. In room\n      measuring NRS continue hospitalized at 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours postoperatively and were used\n      as rescue analgesia if ketorolac 30mg ev NRS is greater than or equal to 4. The amount of\n      morphine is registered and ketorolac rescue of both groups as well as pain assessment\n      scores. The occurrence of adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, pruritus, urinary\n      retention and respiratory depression is also recorded in both groups, to be compared later\n      as a secondary objective."
