The investigators propose a randomized pilot study testing\n      the development, implementation and evaluation of a parallel patient and streamlined\n      provider version of a personalized Survivorship Care Plan (SCP) with lung cancer patients.\n\n      Participants: 60 lung cancer patients at Rex Cancer Center.\n\n      Procedures (methods): Participants will be recruited and randomized to the standard of care\n      (30 patients) or intervention (30 patients) arm. Patients randomized to standard of care\n      will receive a tailored survivorship care plan at the end of cancer treatment. Patients\n      randomized to the intervention will receive a care plan and coordinating visit with their\n      primary care provider. Patients will be invited to complete baseline and follow-up\n      assessments regarding care needs and confidence in post cancer care.\n\n      All patient primary care providers will receive condensed provider versions of the care\n      plan. Providers will be asked to evaluate how the SCP and coordinated care visit\n      (intervention only) facilitated communication and coordination of care."
