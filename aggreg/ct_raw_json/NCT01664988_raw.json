So, this study aimed is study the effect of progressive muscular\n      relaxation and breathing control technique on blood pressure during pregnancy.\n\n      this 3-groups clinical trial has been done in Mashhad Health Centers and Governmental\n      hospitals. 60 pregnant women with systolic blood pressure less than 135 mm Hg or diastolic\n      blood pressure more than 85 mm Hg who met inclusion criteria were assigned into three groups\n      of progressive muscular relaxation, breathing control and control. In tow experiment groups,\n      exercises were controlled by one day personally and the rest by CD, BP before and after\n      interventions was controlled for 4 weeks. In control group blood pressure was measured\n      before and after 15 minutes with no intervention."
