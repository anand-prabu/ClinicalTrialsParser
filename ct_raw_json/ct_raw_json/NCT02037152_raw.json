Users are prompted to complete all other questionnaires at weekly or four-week intervals.  The app includes access to a graphical display showing changes in average pain level.

Research participants use a 20 minute app-guided audio program six days per\n      week.  The study hypothesis is that training in this technique over a period of four weeks\n      will reduce pain interference with daily life activities.  This study does not require any\n      travel or in-person contact with research staff-- all elements of the study are completed on\n      the participant's smartphone."

Subjects have equal chance of entering either group.\n\n      The active treatment group is instructed to use the app-guided \"body scan\" exercise daily\n      for six days per week.  The waitlist group is instructed that the research intervention will\n      be made available to them in four weeks time.  On a weekly basis, all subjects complete a\n      Brief Pain Inventory scale.  At the end of four weeks, subjects again complete a Brief Pain\n      Inventory as well as the questionnaires measuring secondary outcomes.  Upon completion of\n      the control condition, waitlist subjects are invited to begin using the \"body scan\" exercise\n      as described above.  From this point forward, subjects receive the same protocol as the\n      active treatment group.
