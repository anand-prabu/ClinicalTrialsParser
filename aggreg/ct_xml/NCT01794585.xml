    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectivenes of a home-based physical therapy
      program designed to improve balance following traumatic brain injury by incorporating the
      use of a virtual reality system.

    <description>A structured, individually tailored, protocol driven, reproducible therapeutic intervention.  The study intervention will consist of individually prescribed selections from three off-the-shelf VR games that target the type and severity of balance deficits elicited during the completion of a baseline assessment.  Participants randomized to receive this intervention will be assigned a home balance program that utilizes an Xbox Kinect system to provide balance activities.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has sustained a documented TBI that required an inpatient rehabilitation program;

          -  is at least one year post TBI;

          -  is at least 18 and no more than 64 years of age at the time of enrollment;

          -  is English or Spanish speaking

          -  is at least three months beyond completion of formal PT, including acute inpatient
             rehabilitation, outpatient and home-based therapy;

          -  provides written medical clearance for participation in an in-home balance exercise
             program;

          -  ambulates independently within the home (with assistive devices and/or orthotics as
             needed);

          -  has active range of motion of bilateral upper extremities of at least 90 degrees of
             abduction to allow for control of the VR system;

          -  completes a 15 minute trial using a VR system in the absence of a negative physical
             or  behavioral reaction;

          -  self-reports ongoing balance deficits and demonstrate such deficits by scoring at or
             below one standard deviation above the mean (75 or below) on the CB&amp;M; and

          -  provides informed consent, or has a guardian available to provide consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  has a history of another medical illness or neurological disorder which may affect
             balance;

          -  has experienced a seizure within the last year;

          -  has a history of psychiatric disorder requiring hospitalization;

          -  is currently participating in another RCT;

          -  is currently using VR technology to address specific balance goals;

          -  is unable to travel to Craig for assessments throughout the study period;

          -  is unable to communicate effectively to complete standardized assessments;

          -  has cognitive impairment that precludes completion of baseline testing;

          -  is unavailable to participate in 12 continuous weeks of therapy;

          -  has no access to television able to connect to VR-gaming system; and

          -  reports inadequate space required for VR-gaming system sensors.
