The purpose of this study is to\n      find out the efficacy and side effect between two different dosages of irinotecan combined\n      with cisplatin scheme in extensive disease-small cell lung cancer with UGT1A1 gene *28 (6/6\n      and 6/7)and *6 (G/G and G/A), based on the hypothesis that the UGT1A1 gene *28 (7/7) and *6\n      (A/A)is few in the Chinese population and increasing the dose of irinotecan can improve the\n      efficacy without increasing the side effect in the patients with UGT1A1 gene *28 (6/6 and\n      6/7)*6 (G/G and G/A)."
