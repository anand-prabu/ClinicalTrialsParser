            "textblock": "Severe clinical complications including acute rejection and opportunistic infections in\n      solid organ transplantation (SOT) are mainly caused by inadequate impairment of\n      cell-mediated immunity (CMI) by immunosuppressive therapy. In particular CMV is responsible\n      for increased morbidity and mortality revealing the need for either prophylactic or\n      preemptive antiviral treatment. Recipients with negative CMV serology (R-) receiving a graft\n      from a seropositive donor (D+) are at highest risk of developing CMV-associated\n      complications. Therefore, these patients usually receive antiviral prophylaxis whereas\n      patients at intermediate risk (D+/R+ or D-/R+) are treated either prophylactically or\n      preemptively. Although prophylaxis is efficient, it is also accompanied by harmful side\n      effects and high costs. Thus, there is a need for a personalized antiviral as well as\n      immunosuppressive therapy to optimally treat the patient and to improve long-term patient\n      and graft survival. The detection of a protective threshold of functional CMV-reactive cells\n      may help to predict the onset of viral complications, thereby minimizing harmful side\n      effects. Currently available tools to measure CMV-specific cellular immunity reveal striking\n      limitations including a lack of standardization necessitating a commercially available\n      standardized test system. The Lophius kit T-Track\u00ae CMV represents a highly standardized and\n      sensitive diagnostic tool to assess the functionality of a network of clinically relevant\n      CMV-reactive effector cells. It is based on the stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear\n      cells (PBMC) with urea-formulated immunodominant CMV proteins, pp65 and IE-1, and the\n      subsequent quantification of CMV-specific CMI (spot forming colonies) using a highly\n      sensitive IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot. This study aims to assess the suitability of the Lophius\n      Biosciences kit T-Track\u00ae CMV to determine the CMV-specific CMI in renal transplant\n      recipients scheduled for a preemptive antiviral treatment strategy. Furthermore, it will be\n      investigated if the results obtained with T-Track\u00ae CMV are suitable to define a cut-off\n      value of CMV-specific CMI mediating protection from CMV reactivations and related\n      complications. Moreover, possible associations between CMV-specific CMI measured with\n      T-Track\u00ae CMV and clinical complications including acute rejection episodes and opportunistic\n      infections will be analyzed as well as the influence of the immunosuppressive treatment and\n      the patient`s HLA type on viral immunity."
