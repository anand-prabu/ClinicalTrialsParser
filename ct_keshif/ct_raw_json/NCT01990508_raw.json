            "textblock": "Approximately 15% of the US population is enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance\n      Program (SNAP), and 50% are children.  Although the goal is to improve nutritional health,\n      preliminary data suggest that enrollment in SNAP is associated with obesity and metabolic\n      risks and that SNAP reimburses $4 billion annually for sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs).\n      This pilot project tests an innovative strategy to reduce purchase of non-nutritive, SSBs by\n      low-income families with children by combining targeted point-of-purchase education with a\n      randomized trial of financial incentives to discourage purchase of unhealthy beverages. The\n      study will take place at a mid-size grocery store that is located in a low-income, Latino\n      community and where 30% of purchases are made with SNAP.  Targeted beverage education will\n      be provided to all study subjects with a traffic-light system to identify healthy and\n      unhealthy beverages at the point-of-purchase.  Individual beverage purchases will be tracked\n      by electronically stored cash register sales.  Supplementary validation of beverage\n      consumption will be assessed by 24 hour dietary recall.  Aim 1 is to conduct a randomized\n      controlled trial to compare purchase and consumption of SSBs by families assigned to a\n      financial incentive to reduce purchase of SSBs with families assigned to control (no\n      incentives). Aim 2 is to compare the purchase of SSBs by families in both arms during the\n      study period when they are exposed to the traffic-light system to a baseline period prior to\n      traffic-light education.  Results of this project will provide pilot data for larger scale\n      interventions to promote healthy choices among low-income families."
