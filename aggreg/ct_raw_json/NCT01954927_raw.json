            "textblock": "This is a phase II double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the effect of\n      gabapentin when added to standard pain management for patients with sickle cell disease\n      experiencing acute pain crisis in the ambulatory care setting.\n\n      Sickle cell pain is different for every patient.  Some patients get complete relief from\n      routine pain medicines, and others need more time or more doses of pain medicines before the\n      pain goes away completely.  It is known that humans have many types of pain, including\n      something called neuropathic pain.  Neuropathic pain in other conditions (such as diabetes)\n      has been treated successfully with a medicine called gabapentin.  The investigators in this\n      study suspect that some sickle cell pain is a combination of pain types.  They would like to\n      see if adding gabapentin to the usual pain medicines makes pain go away faster or more\n      completely.\n\n      Primary Objective:\n\n        -  To assess the analgesic efficacy of gabapentin vs. placebo for pain during\n           vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) in participants with sickle cell disease (SCD).  A response\n           to study drug will be defined by a decrease in pain score of \u2265 33% between presentation\n           to the acute care setting and assessment at 3 hours post administration of study drug.\n\n      Secondary Objective:\n\n        -  To compare the total morphine equivalent dose (mg/kg) used to control pain during VOC\n           between presentation to the acute care setting and assessment at 3 hours post\n           administration of study drug in the gabapentin vs. placebo groups."

The randomization\n      will be stratified by three age categories (1-3 years of age, 4-6 years, and 7 years or\n      older) for which distinct pain assessment tools are applied and for 2 pain score categories\n      at assessment at presentation (4-6 and 7-10, respectively).  A block randomization with\n      block sizes varying randomly between 4 and 6 will be used in each stratum.\n\n      Pain scores will be obtained at presentation to the acute care setting and 3 hours post\n      administration of study drug.  One to three days after taking the study drug, a member of\n      the study team will contact the participant to see if there have been any side effects.\n      After this follow up conversation, participation in the study is complete."
