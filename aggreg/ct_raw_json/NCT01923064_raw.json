When a patient has a bleeding episode, if no further\n      prophylactic treatments is given, it's very likely that he/she will develop another\n      rebleeding event in the future and maybe a terminal event. Gastric varices occur in 18-70%\n      of patients with portal hypertension, which appear to be more severe, to require more\n      transfusion and to have a higher mortality rate than esophageal variceal bleeding, with a\n      high rate of rebleeding(38-89%). It has been recommended to use endoscopic cyanoacrylate\n      injection as the first line treatment for hemostasis and secondary prophylaxis for gastric\n      varices by general consensus. However, the efficacy and prevalence of complications between\n      mixture of cyanoacrylate + lipiodol and cyanoacrylate + lauromacrogol have not yet been\n      explored and reported. We conducted this study to evaluate the effect of endoscopic\n      injection of a mixture of cyanoacrylate and lipiodol versus cyanoacrylate and lauromacrogol\n      in gastric varices."
