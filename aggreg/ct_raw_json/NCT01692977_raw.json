            "textblock": "The disruption of spatial orientation is considered the second most common cognitive symptom\n      of dementia, affecting nearly all activities of daily living. Research in the field of\n      environmental psychology has helped to highlight the influence of the environment on\n      patients with Alzheimer's disease or related syndromes. With regard to spatial orientation,\n      it has been shown that an environment can provide support for cognitive failures in subjects\n      if that particular space is adapted. While numerous studies have focused on the\n      architectural environment (hospital, housing facility), none have explored the ability of\n      patients to orient themselves in a natural environment such as a garden. Yet, in recent\n      years, such gardens, known as healing gardens, have emerged in housing and care facilities,\n      providing genuine support for the care management of patients with Alzheimer-type dementia.\n      Various works have been published outlining recommendations for their management. However,\n      with regard to spatial orientation, none of the available research has explored the basic\n      principles on which to rely on in order to organize the elements of outdoor spaces into\n      itineraries that promote orientation, according to ZEISEL and TYSON (1999). In the absence\n      of such data, these authors recommend relying on five elements, identified by Lynch in his\n      landmark book \"Image of the City\" (1960), that people use to orient themselves and find\n      their way. These are \" paths \", \" edges \", \" districts \", \" nodes \" and \" landmarks \". The\n      hypothesis to verify is that patients with Alzheimer's disease do not rely on the same\n      elements of the garden as non-Alzheimer's subjects in making orientation decisions and to\n      mentally picture this environment."
