    <textblock>
      Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) is one of the key proteins known to inhibit neuronal
      regeneration when released from oligodendrocytes in conditions of neuronal injury, such as
      stroke. GSK249320 is a humanised monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high specificity
      to MAG and antagonises or neutralises MAG-mediated inhibition and has been shown to improve
      functional recovery after stroke in pre-clinical models, possibly by promoting
      neuroregeneration and plasticity. The present study (MAG104615) is designed to establish
      Proof of Concept (PoC) for GSK249320 in ischemic stroke patients. MAG104615 will be a
      placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter, randomized, repeat dose, Bayesian design
      study. PoC will be achieved by demonstrating a clinically meaningful improvement in lower
      limb motor recovery, specifically by evaluating changes in gait velocity from baseline to
      Day 90/Month 3. Subjects will also be followed out to Day 180/Month 6 to further evaluate
      longer term motor recovery and safety. Additional secondary efficacy measures of motor
      recovery will be evaluated to further demonstrate and characterize the extent and duration
      of overall motor recovery after treatment with GSK249320. Changes in disability and
      neurological impairment will be characterized after treatment with GSK249320 and explored
      for how they relate to motor recovery. This PoC study will also further characterize the
      safety, PK, and immunogenicity of GSK249320 will explore pharmacodynamic (PD) markers, and
      will explore use of actigraphy to measure motor recovery. Subjects will be stratified by
      gait velocity at baseline for randomization (1:1 allocation) into one of two treatment
      groups: 15mg/kg GSK249320, or placebo. Each subject will receive 2 repeat IV doses of
      GSK249320 or placebo.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a confirmed diagnosis of stroke according to the World Health Organization
             definition which is, 'a rapid onset event of vascular origin reflecting a focal
             disturbance of cerebral function, excluding isolated impairments of higher function,
             and persisting longer than 24 hours [World Health Organization, 1989].

          -  Stroke onset must be within the last 24-72 hours of the first infusion of
             Investigational Product. Time of stroke onset is defined at the time at which the
             patient/relative is first aware of the stroke deficit. For patients who awake with
             deficits, or who are found unconscious, the time of onset is defined as the time at
             which they were last known to be symptom free.

          -  Have a stroke that is radiologically confirmed to be ischemic and supratentorial. The
             diameter of the ischemic lesion is &gt;15mm in any single direction or the volume is
             &gt;4cc. See the Study Procedures Manual (SPM) for guidance on how to calculate the
             lesion size.

          -  Have a total NIHSS score of 3-21.

          -  Have a lower limb deficit from the incident stroke which is defined as a score of 1-4
             on the NIHSS Motor Leg question (question #6).

          -  Aged 18-90, inclusive.

          -  Expectation the subject will receive standard physical, occupational and speech
             rehabilitation therapy as indicated for the post stroke deficits.

          -  Male subjects and female subjects of non-child-bearing and child-bearing potential
             are allowed to participate in this study. See Section 11, Appendix 1 for definitions.
              Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to
             enrollment and must agree to use one of the contraceptive methods specified in
             Section 11, Appendix 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to walk &gt;0.8m/s as measured by the Gait Velocity assessment.

          -  History of a previous symptomatic stroke within 3 months prior to study entry.

          -  Presence of significant disability prior to the current stroke. Significant
             disability is defined as having a pre-stroke Rankin score of &gt;2.

          -  Subjects who are not alert or are unresponsive as defined by a score of 2 or 3 on the
             NIHSS Level of Consciousness question (Question 1a).

          -  Presence of significant aphasia likely to confound or interfere with completion of
             the study assessments.

          -  Presence of a significant pre-existing gait deficit prior to study entry that is
             likely to confound clinical evaluations

          -  Presence of pre-existing neurologic or psychiatric disease which is active and not
             adequately controlled such that it interfered with major activities of daily living
             immediately prior to the current stroke and is likely to interfere with study
             participation/visits or confound clinical evaluations.

          -  The subject poses a significant suicide risk, in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (except Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones), or known history of hepatitis
             B or hepatitis C infection. A positive hepatitis B or hepatitis C result on the GSK
             labs drawn at baseline/Study Day 1 do not exclude a subject from continuing in the
             study unless there are associated clinical signs/symptoms of liver disease; however,
             the subject should be treated as clinically indicated and the GSK Medical Monitor
             should be contacted for further discussion.

          -  Presence of either a central or peripheral demyelinating disease, such as multiple
             sclerosis or IgM monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS).

          -  Expected death due to the incident stroke, or evidence of a chronic co-morbid
             condition or unstable acute systemic illness which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, could shorten the subject's survival such that it would limit his/her
             ability to complete the study.

          -  Presence of the following ECG values on baseline ECG: QTc &gt; 500 msec (using either
             Bazett's formula (QTcB) or Fridericia's formula (QTcF)); or uncorrected QT &gt;600msec
             (machine or manual over-read). If the ECG indicates a prolonged QTc interval value
             outside these limits, two further ECGs should be performed during the same sitting
             and the average QTc value of these triplicate ECGs calculated. If the average value
             exceeds the stated limits, the subject is not eligible.

          -  Participation in any investigational rehabilitation paradigm targeting stroke
             recovery during the duration of this study.

          -  Have a contraindication to MRI as per local hospital practice/guidelines.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Prior treatment with GSK249320.

          -  History of sensitivity to Investigational Product excipients (acetate buffer,
             polysorbate 80 and sodium chloride) that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates the subject's participation.

          -  Pregnant females as determined by positive urine hCG test prior to enrollment.

          -  Lactating females.

          -  Subjects considered unwilling or unable to comply with the procedures and study
             ﻿visit schedule outlined in the protocol.
