Willing and able to comply with all aspects of the protocol\n\n        Exclusion Criteria\n\n        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from this study:\n\n          1. Have participated in a 14C-research study within the 6 months prior to Day -2. The\n             total exposure from this and any previous study must be within the recommended levels\n             considered safe.\n\n          2. Exposure to clinically significant radiation within 12 months prior to Day -2.\n\n          3. Any laboratory abnormalities considered clinically significant by the investigator,\n             which may require further investigations or treatment\n\n          4. Clinically significant illness which required medical treatment within 8 weeks or a\n             clinically significant infection within 4 weeks of dosing\n\n          5. Any history of gastrointestinal surgery (e.g., hepatectomy, nephrotomy, digestive\n             organ resection) that may affect PK profiles of study drugs\n\n          6. Hypersensitivity to the study drugs or any of their excipients\n\n          7. Known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive\n\n        Restrictions will apply on prior and concomitant medications, food and beverages"
