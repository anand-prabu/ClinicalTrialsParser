            "textblock": "In September 2009 the National Vaccination Council approved the policy for anti-HPV\n      vaccination in 9-year-old girls with an extended scheme of 0, 6, and 60 months, under the\n      following justification:\n\n        -  Antibody induction due to the vaccine is greater than that produced by natural exposure\n           to the virus\n\n        -  Immune response in girls 9 to 11 years of age is similar to the response obtained after\n           three doses in women 16 to 26 years of age\n\n        -  The third dose will be administered at the time when maximum protection is required,\n           near the onset of sexual activity\n\n      Thus the National Institute of Public Health was commissioned to monitor anti-HPV antibody\n      levels in women who received the anti-HPV vaccine to determine non-inferiority of the\n      extended scheme in 9-year-old girls compared with the traditional scheme of 3 doses in women\n      18 to 24 years of age. To this end, a sentinel cohort will be formed to evaluate\n      immunogenicity levels in 3 age groups, and stratified by vaccine type. The hypothesis is\n      that in 9-year-old girls who are administered the amplified HPV vaccination scheme (0-6-60)\n      show immunogenicity levels that are not lower than those of adult women who have been\n      administered the traditional scheme (0-1/2-6). The main objective is to monitor immunity\n      levels induced by the anti-HPV vaccine with two vaccination schemes: amplified (0, 6, 60\n      months) and traditional (0, 1 and/or 2, 6). The study design consists in making a sentinel\n      cohort of women vaccinated against HPV in three comparison groups:\n\n        -  9-year-old females with an extended vaccination scheme (0-6-60)\n\n        -  9-year-old females with a traditional vaccination scheme (0-1/2-6)\n\n        -  Women 18 to 24 years of age with a traditional vaccination scheme (0-1/2-6)\n\n             1. The direct Elisa test and Elisa inhibition test with pseudovirion-based\n                neutralization assay will be used for HPV 16 and 18 and for the Cervarix vaccine\n\n             2. For the Gardasil vaccine a test will be used to determine antibodies by\n                luminometry (cLIA) for VPH 6, 11, 16 and 18 suited for measurement of specific\n                epitopes and total IgG"
