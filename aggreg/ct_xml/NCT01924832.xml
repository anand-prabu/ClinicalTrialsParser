      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of
      monomethyl fumarate (MMF) following delivery of BG00012 120 mg (Part 1) and BG00012 240 mg
      (Part 2) to varying regions within the GI tract in healthy volunteers.  The secondary
      objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability profile following the
      delivery of BG00012 120 mg (Part 1) and BG00012 240 mg (Part 2) to varying regions within
      the GI tract in healthy volunteers.
