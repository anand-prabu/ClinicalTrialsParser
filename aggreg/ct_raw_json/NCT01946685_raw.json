            "textblock": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common and disabling psychiatric disorder. Left\n      untreated or under-treated, it can become a chronic condition associated with significant\n      distress, depression, aggression, family disruption, and substance abuse. There is also\n      accumulating evidence that combat-related PTSD is associated with an increased risk of\n      morbidity and mortality. For the welfare of returning veterans with PTSD and their families,\n      it is critical that this disorder is promptly identified and effectively treated.\n      Considerable advances that have been made in the assessment and treatment of PTSD in recent\n      years; however, psychopharmacological treatments have been shown to be largely ineffective\n      for veterans with PTSD.\n\n      To address this gap, this proposal seeks to test an innovative treatment approach in PTSD -\n      pharmacological manipulation of the body's major stress system (the\n      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis) with mifepristone. At high doses mifepristone is\n      a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist with peripheral and central nervous system\n      effects, making it a compound of interest in the treatment of stress related disorders.\n      There is abundant evidence of enhanced GR sensitivity in veterans with PTSD which is thought\n      to underlie some of the symptoms of PTSD and associated disturbances in mood and cognition.\n      Thus, blockade of the GR receptor with mifepristone may target unique aspects of PTSD and\n      lead to clinically meaningful improvement in symptoms and cognition. There is preliminary\n      evidence that short-term mifepristone treatment has sustained beneficial effects on mood,\n      cognition and sleep disturbance in some neuropsychiatric conditions (major depression,\n      bipolar disorder, primary insomnia). That there can be sustained clinical and\n      neuropsychological effects of mifepristone and normalization of basal HPA axis activity\n      after drug discontinuation in these disorders, has led to the view that mifepristone's\n      actions include recalibration of a dysregulated HPA axis. Accordingly, we propose to study\n      the effects of mifepristone in veterans with chronic PTSD to determine if it is efficacious\n      in improving PTSD symptoms and associated clinical outcomes. To better understand the\n      mechanism of action of mifepristone we propose to assess the effects of mifepristone on HPA\n      axis activity and their relationship to treatment outcome and clinical response.\n\n      To achieve these objectives, we propose to conduct a Phase IIa, multi-site, double-blind,\n      placebo controlled trial of mifepristone in veteran outpatients with military-related PTSD\n      through the VA's Cooperative Clinical Trial Award program. We propose to enroll 136\n      unmedicated male veterans with military related PTSD at four VA sites (Albuquerque, NM,\n      Bronx, NY, Durham, NC, and San Diego, CA). Eligible veterans will be randomly assigned in\n      parallel groups to treatment with 600 mg/day mifepristone or placebo for one week and\n      followed for up to three months. Using statistical selection theory, we propose to determine\n      whether 600 mg of mifepristone yields a sufficiently high proportion of clinical responders\n      after one month to warrant more extensive and definitive research as part of a Phase III\n      trial. Secondarily, we seek to determine the effect of the dose of mifepristone compared to\n      placebo on the trajectory of CAPS scores and the time to addition of rescue medication, as\n      well as compare rates of adverse events and serious adverse events across the three groups.\n      We will also describe the effects of mifepristone on several other clinical parameters\n      including PTSD symptomology, depression severity, sleep quality, and functional impairment.\n      Several measures of neuroendocrine functioning will also be obtained to explore the\n      relationship of plasma cortisol and ACTH levels to clinical response and the time to\n      addition of rescue medications."

            "textblock": "Novel approaches to the treatment of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in veterans are\n      urgently needed. This proposal seeks to test an innovative approach, one that involves\n      careful pharmacological manipulation of the body's major stress system, the\n      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, using the dose level of the FDA-approved drug,\n      mifepristone (600 mg/day).\n\n      The rationale for a treatment trial of mifepristone in PTSD is based on the wealth of\n      knowledge available about persistent alterations of the HPA axis in PTSD and their\n      interactions with the central and autonomic nervous system and the immune system. The most\n      consistent HPA axis findings in PTSD, taken together, suggest there is increased sensitivity\n      to the effects of glucocorticoids in the presence of increased central activation of the HPA\n      axis. Among the most replicated neuroendocrine findings have been of elevated levels of CRF\n      in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (Bremner et al., 1997; Baker et al.,1999; Baker et al.,\n      2005), an exaggerated cortisol response to emotional stressors (Elzinga et al., 2003;\n      Bremner et al., 2003), and an exaggerated suppression of cortisol to the synthetic\n      glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX). The earliest studies of the effects of dexamethasone\n      (DEX) using the standard 1.0 mg dose, found that PTSD, unlike major depression, was not\n      associated with higher rates of cortisol non-suppression and there was a trend for lower\n      cortisol levels post-DEX in PTSD (Kudler et al., 1987; Kosten et al., 1990; Dinan et al.,\n      1990). A lower dose (0.5 mg) was employed to test the hypothesis of enhanced suppression of\n      cortisol to DEX in Vietnam veterans with PTSD, which was confirmed (Yehuda et al., 1993;\n      Yehuda et al., 1995).  Since then, with few exceptions (Lipschitz et al., 2003; Bachmann et\n      al., 2005),  greater suppression of cortisol to low-dose DEX has been found in PTSD\n      subjects, compared to unexposed and/or  trauma-exposed controls without PTSD, in diverse\n      samples, including samples of persons exposed to combat, natural disasters, domestic\n      violence, the Holocaust, and childhood physical and sexual abuse (Goenjian et al., 2005;\n      Stein et al., 1997; Yehuda et al., 2002; Duval et al., 2004, Newport et al., 2004; Griffin\n      et al., 2005). Furthermore, the extent of cortisol suppression is associated with PTSD\n      symptom severity (Yehuda et al., 1995; Yehuda et al., 2004). The finding of a greater\n      down-regulation of lymphocyte GR post-DEX suggests that the DST findings may be attributable\n      to more responsive glucocorticoid receptors (Yehuda et al., 1995). More recent studies have\n      demonstrated increased suppression of ACTH to DEX (Yehuda, Golier, Halligan et al., 2004;\n      Newport et al., 2004) confirming increased glucocorticoid responsivity at the level of the\n      pituitary (Miller et al., 1992). The studies of the effects of DEX on HPA axis activity\n      suggest there is enhanced negative feedback inhibition of the HPA axis in PTSD. Such\n      inhibition could help to explain why despite evidence of central HPA axis activation and an\n      exaggerated response of cortisol to stressors (Elzinga et al., 2003; Bremner et al., 2003)\n      and to ACTH stimulation (Rasmusson et al., 2001) in PTSD, 24-hour basal cortisol levels are\n      not typically elevated and indeed are even sometimes low (reviewed in Yehuda, 2002).\n\n      We therefore seek to examine the effects of glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, mifepristone\n      (Mifeprex\u00ae), on clinical and cognitive outcomes in veterans with posttraumatic stress\n      disorders. Mifepristone is a selective type II glucocorticoid receptor antagonist with a\n      favorable safety profile (Bertagna et al., 1994). It binds to the same site as the synthetic\n      glucocorticoid dexamethasone and blocks the negative feedback control of cortisol on the\n      pituitary (Gallard et al., 1984; Bertagna et al., 1984; Healy et al., 1985; Pomara et al.,\n      2006). Thus, mifepristone, because it directly antagonizes the glucocorticoid receptor,\n      which has been found to be more sensitive in PTSD in several models, is ideally suited for\n      use in determining the pathphysiological significance of increased glucocorticoid receptor\n      sensitivity in PTSD and whether its attenuation is of therapeutic value."
