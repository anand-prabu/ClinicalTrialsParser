            "textblock": "BACKGROUND:  Fibrosis assessment by Transient Elastography or Fibro scan is validated in\n      chronic hepatitis C, however limited data are available in chronic hepatitis B and in non\n      alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). AIMS: Document the prevalence and severity of\n      fibrosis in patients with different chronic liver disease (elevated liver enzymes) who are\n      being followed up in the liver unit and to find associated factors with significant fibrosis\n      and cirrhosis at ziv medical center, Safed,Bar Ilan University. Israel. METHODS: Fibro scan\n      will be performed to all patients with abnormal liver enzymnes who attend the liver clinic.\n      Liver stiffness measurement, age, gender, BMI, will be measured. Questionaire on soft drink\n      consumption, Coffee drinking, use of herbs, and a history of cancer or heart disease will be\n      distributed. Expected  RESULTS:  we expect that the liver stiffness (normal 1-6 Kpa) will be\n       higher in NAFLD patients than in viral hepatitis patients for the same age ,same BMI, and\n      the same duration of disease. More over, we expect serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST)\n      values will emerge as the most important independent predictive variable of fibrosis and not\n      serum ALT. A significant correlations between soft drink and coffee consumption with the\n      extent of liver fibrosis is also expected. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study will confirm\n      that screening patients with elevated liver enzymes is beneficial and detect earlier the\n      presence of liver fibrosis mainly in patients with NAFLD."
