            "textblock": "Rationale: The construction of esophageal anastomoses is associated with considerable risk\n      at postoperative anastomotic leakage. Application of TachoSil\u00ae, a tissue sealant with human\n      fibrinogen and thrombin, can improve strength of the esophageal anastomosis and potentially\n      prevent anastomotic leakage.\n\n      Objective: Evaluation of feasibility and safety of TachoSil\u00ae application on esophageal\n      anastomoses.\n\n      Study design: Non-randomized, non-blinded, single-center intervention study. Study\n      population: Patients, 18-80 years old, undergoing an elective total gastrectomy with an\n      esophago-jejunostomy or esophagectomy with a planned esophagogastric anastomosis will be\n      enrolled. A total number of 15 patients will be included in the study.\n\n      Intervention: Gastric or esophageal resection will be executed according to the common\n      procedures used in the UMC Utrecht. After construction of the esophageal anastomosis, all\n      enrolled participants will receive a TachoSil\u00ae patch, which will be applied on the\n      esophageal anastomosis intra-operatively. Hence, TachoSil\u00ae is used as an add-on therapy.\n      TachoSil\u00ae will be degraded enzymatically in a period of approximately 24 weeks after\n      application.\n\n      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is feasibility, which is assessed by\n      evaluation of adherence of the patch. A time-action analysis of the application of the\n      Tachosil patch will be performed.\n\n      Nature and extent of the burden associated with participation: The burden for the patient is\n      minimal. The total surgical procedure will be prolonged with 10-15 minutes. Postoperative\n      care and outpatient visits do not differ from regular protocol. TachoSil\u00ae is approved and\n      registered for supportive treatment in surgery for improvement of haemostasis and to promote\n      tissue sealing by the European Commission."
