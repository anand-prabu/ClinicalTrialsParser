            "textblock": "This study is designed to increase knowledge and awareness to prevent Fetal Alcohol Syndrome\n      in Russian children through development of printed FAS education materials targeting women\n      of childbearing age in Russia. Alcohol abuse is a major public health problem in Russia. The\n      rates of FAS and Alcohol Related Neurodevelopmental Disorders (ARND) in Russia are not\n      precisely known. At this time, there are no programs to prevent FAS in Russia. The results\n      of our previous study, focus groups with health professionals, pregnant women and their\n      partners, non-pregnant women, and women with alcohol dependency, indicated limited knowledge\n      about FAS, misconceptions about alcohol use during pregnancy, and a lack of materials and\n      print resources related to this topic.  Based on the initial findings, this proposal aims to\n      develop and evaluate in a clinical trial informational brochures for women to increase\n      knowledge and reduce drinking during pregnancy in Russia. The main hypotheses to be tested\n      are:\n\n        -  1. Compared to the control group (CG) of women who receive a standard locally available\n           flyer with health recommendations, women in the experimental groups who are exposed to\n           printed information on FAS will show significantly more knowledge about FAS,\n           significantly less acceptance of any alcohol use during pregnancy, and reduced drinking\n           at one month follow-up assessment.\n\n        -  2. The group exposed to a brochure with negative images (IGN - Intervention group with\n           a \"negative brochure\") regarding drinking during pregnancy will show significantly\n           greater change in the predicted directions compared to the group exposed to positive\n           images (IGP - Intervention group with a \"positive\" brochure) at the one month follow-up\n           assessment."

After that, the\n      intervention will be conducted. The women in the two experimental groups will receive a\n      brochure with either positive (IGP) or negative (IGN) images.  The women will be asked to\n      read one of two brochures in the presence of the data collector. If the participants ask\n      questions, the data collector will redirect the participants to material in the brochure.\n      Following the intervention, the women in the experimental groups will complete a brief\n      questionnaire to assess their emotional responses to the materials and perceived effects.\n      The women assigned to the control group (CG) will be asked to read a brochure on general\n      aspects of women's' health. At a one-month follow-up, women in all three groups will\n      complete a post-test of self-reported alcohol consumption, knowledge about prenatal effects\n      of alcohol and FAS, and attitudes to drinking during pregnancy."
