            "textblock": "Cervical carcinoma is one of the most common gynecologic cancers worldwide. Early stage\n      cervical cancer can be treated effectively with either radiotherapy or radical hysterectomy\n      plus pelvic lymph node dissection. However, several pathological risk factors, such as lymph\n      node metastasis, the involvement of vaginal resection margin, and the parametrial invasion,\n      have been identified to compromise the patient prognosis.\n\n      Concurrent radiotherapy with cisplatin-based chemotherapy has become the standard treatment\n      for patients with cervical cancer. However, many patients with pathological risk factors\n      treated with concurrent radiotherapy plus single agent cisplatin still suffered from the\n      local or distant relapse. How to improve the treatment outcome of these patients is a very\n      important issue and requires further clinical investigation.\n\n      Paclitaxel has been demonstrated to be a good radiosensitizer. In addition,\n      paclitaxel/cisplatin combination chemotherapy was demonstrated to have superior\n      progression-free survival than platinum alone in some phase \u2161 studies. In addition, it is\n      not yet known whether chemotherapy and radiation therapy are more effective when given with\n      consolidation chemotherapy in treating cervical cancer.\n\n      Therefore, the investigators are going to perform the efficacy and safety study of\n      postoperative concurrent paclitaxel/cisplatin chemotherapy and radiotherapy with\n      consolidation chemotherapy in high-risk patients with early-stage cervical cancer following\n      radical hysterectomy."
