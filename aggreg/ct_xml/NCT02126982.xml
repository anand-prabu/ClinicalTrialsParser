      Clopidogrel besylate differentiated relative to the clopidogrel bisulfate in the
      pharmacokinetics and in antiplatelet activity in healthy volunteers in patients with a
      history of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and in patients with ACS undergoing angioplasty.
      However there is a lack of data on the clinical efficacy of this salt to the original salt
      in patients with cardiovascular disease. Therefore in this study will investigate the
      clinical efficacy and safety of clopidogrel besylate in relation to that of clopidogrel
      bisulfate in patients with cardiovascular disease.

    <textblock>
      It is now well documented that platelets play an important role in the pathogenesis of acute
      coronary syndromes. This phenomenon has significantly strengthened the position of
      antiplatelet drugs in treatment, and prevention of these syndromes. In terms of
      administration, antiplatelet drugs are divided into two categories, the oral and intravenous
      medications. Of these, oral medications are the choice for long-term or prophylactic
      treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome. Among them, is clopidogrel, which
      together with aspirin is now the cornerstone of antiplatelet therapy. Indeed, clopidogrel is
      a widely used antiplatelet drug. It is second in sales worldwide after atorvastatin and has
      been prescribed to more than 100 million patients worldwide. Can be used as monotherapy or
      in combination with aspirin. The efficacy in reducing ischemic events in patients with ACS
      has been shown in more than 15 major clinical studies involving more than 200,000 patients.
      These studies also proved the safety of clopidogrel to the bleeding complications (only 1-2%
      per year).Clopidogrel is a second generation thienopyridine that inhibits the binding of ADP
      to purinergic receptors of platelet membrane. The ADP activates platelets through different
      receptors coupled to G-proteins. The main receptor for platelet activation by ADP is P2Y12,
      associated with the adenyl cyclase and cause deactivation of the resulting reduction in the
      levels of c-AMP. The identification of this receptor led to the complete elucidation of the
      mechanism of action of clopidogrel, which proved to be an irreversible antagonist P2Y12.

      Clopidogrel is a prodrug that, once granted, is absorbed in the intestine by a process in
      which an important role is played by the protein carrier ABCB1/MDR1. Then clopidogrel is
      converted in the liver to the pharmacologically active metabolite by the action of
      cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and mainly isoform CYP2C19 and isoforms CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP1A2,
      CYP2B6 and CYP2C9. It should be noted that 85% of clopidogrel absorbed, hydrolyzed by
      esterases in the intestinal mucosa and blood to form biologically inactive products while
      only 15% of the administered drug is converted to its active metabolite, which is a potent,
      irreversible, selective inhibitor of receptor P2Y12 ADP. The inhibition of binding of ADP
      receptor P2Y12 of the active metabolite of clopidogrel have the effect of increasing the
      levels of cyclic AMP (c-AMP) in the cytoplasm of platelets, which inter alia induces
      phosphorylation phosphoprotein VASP (vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein ), resulting in
      the inhibition of the activation of receptor GPIIb / IIIa and thereby preventing platelet
      aggregation. The end result of the administration of clopidogrel (inhibition of platelet
      stimulation by ADP) is affected by multiple levels of interactions. The absorption
      (intestinal mucosa) and the metabolism of clopidogrel (esterases and cytochrome isoforms) is
      a sequence of steps that determine the final amount of active metabolite produced. Also
      close correlation between the concentration of the active metabolite and the speed and the
      degree of inhibition of platelet activation. Finally factors affecting the affinity of
      clopidogrel with ADP receptor on the membrane of platelets can modify the action.The
      importance of these stages that determine the rate and quantity production of the active
      metabolite, acquires particular relevance today as clopidogrel generic forms are available
      in the market. Indeed, in 2010 and after 10 years of circulation of the original formulation
      (clopidogrel bisulfate) under the trade names Plavix or Iscover, released new generic
      formulations of clopidogrel (generic) due to expiration of the period of exclusive marketing
      using the original formulation. Main difference of generic forms of clopidogrel to the
      original formulation (clopidogrel bisulfate) is pharmacochemical recommendation salt of
      clopidogrel, which in the case of generic formulations is benzenesulfonic (besylate) or
      hydrochloride salt. Generic formulations of clopidogrel have received marketing approval
      from the health authorities of the European Union. Studies in healthy volunteers have
      demonstrated the bioequivalence of generic salt of clopidogrel (clopidogrel besylate) in the
      original clopidogrel bisulfate. However, there is lack of pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic data on the bioequivalence of different salts of clopidogrel to the original
      salt in patients with a history of ACS or in patients undergoing angioplasty. The lack of
      data regarding the full therapeutic equivalence of generic forms of clopidogrel and original
      form of ACS in patients as well as in patients undergoing angioplasty, cardiac led national
      companies to initially propose the use of generic drugs only in secondary prevention of
      atherothrombosis after acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or established peripheral
      arterial disease. A similar approach has been adopted by the Greek Medicines Agency as well
      as the European authorities. Recently, studies have shown that clopidogrel besylate
      formulations exhibit similar antiplatelet activity to that of the original salt, both in
      patients with a history of ACS and in patients with ACS who underwent angioplasty. Recently,
      clopidogrel besylate formulations got approval for use in patients with ACS and in patients
      undergoing angioplasty. Given the plurality Proprietary clopidogrel besylate is currently
      commercially available, they should any clinical data or research results arising from the
      use of such preparations in patients with cardiovascular disease can refer to this product
      which has not generally used in the salt besylate clopidogrel.
