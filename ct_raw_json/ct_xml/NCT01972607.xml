  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has been designed in order to know the effect of 12 weeks of aerobic exercise
      training for migraine prevention. We hypothesized that the exercise training could reduce
      the number of days with migraine and the number of attacks per month in the treated group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will cover 16 weeks. The first 4 weeks has been designed as &quot;baseline&quot; period, to
      assess the migraine status and classification, colect blood exam, perform a cardiopulmonary
      exercise test to determine the maximal oxygen uptake, and fill psychometric questionnaires.
      The remaining 12 weeks will be the &quot;intervention&quot; period, where participants after
      randomization will be allocated to perform an aerobic exercise training (on treadmill)
      performed on a 3 times per week-based program of 40-min duration each session, or will wait
      for the equal period to repeat all the assessments, then  begin the same exercise protocol.
