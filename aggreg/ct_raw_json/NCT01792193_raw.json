            "textblock": "In previous work, the investigators analyzed the concentration of gut-derived peptides\n      (ghrelin, pancreatic polypeptide [PP]) in serum of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\n      The investigators have shown that the secretion pattern differs between PD patients and\n      controls. Beside ghrelin and pancreatic polypeptide other gut-derived peptides (e.g.\n      Glucagon-like-Peptide 1[GLP-1], Amylin, etc.) might be relevant for PD as well. The rational\n      to investigate gut-derived peptides in the neurological disorder Parkinson's disease (PD) is\n      based on the following considerations:\n\n        -  Receptors for gut-derived peptides are expressed in Central Nervous System (CNS)\n           structures that are affected by the neurodegenerative process underlying Parkinson's\n           disease\n\n        -  Gut-derived peptides are involved in the modulation of higher brain functions (mood,\n           cognition, reward-related behaviour) that are frequently altered in Parkinson's\n           disease.\n\n        -  The secretion of gut peptides is (co-)regulated by the vagal nerve that is\n           dysfunctional in Parkinson's disease.\n\n        -  Certain gut-derived peptides (ghrelin, GLP-1) stimulate neurogenesis and might be able\n           to prevent cell death in neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease.\n\n      Objective:\n\n      Collection of CSF and serum samples in a standardized way in order to quantitatively measure\n      the concentration of gut-derived peptides (ghrelin, leptin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic\n      peptide [GIP], GLP-1, amylin, PP, peptide YY [PYY], and insulin). Scientific questions:\n\n        1. Do CSF (and serum) concentrations of these gut peptides differ between PD patients and\n           controls?\n\n        2. Do CSF (and serum) concentrations of the investigated peptides correlate with clinical\n           and / or epidemiological characteristics of the investigated subjects (age, gender,\n           BMI, disease duration, severity of motor impairments, presence of non-motor symptoms,\n           co-morbidities, medication, etc.)?"
