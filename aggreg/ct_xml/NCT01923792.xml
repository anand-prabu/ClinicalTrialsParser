  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      House Dust Mites (HDM) are arachnids that infest bedding, carpet, upholstered furniture and
      fabric. Like many other allergens, exposure to HDM allergens in sensitised patients is
      associated with poorer lung function, greater medication requirements and more asthma
      symptoms as well as chronic rhinosinusitis symptoms. In contrast to other allergens, there
      is evidence that HDMA leads to the development of asthma, in addition to exacerbating
      pre-existing asthma in HDM-sensitised patients.

      ToleroMune HDM is currently being developed for the treatment of HDM allergy.

      The Purpose of this optional observational follow-on study is to evaluate the continued
      efficacy of TM-HDM in HDM allergic subjects based on change in TRSS from TH002 baseline
      approximately two years after the completion of the baseline EEC visit in TH002 following
      challenge with HDM allergen in an EEC.

      Subjects who completed all dosing visits and the post treatment challenge (PTC) in study
      TH002 will be invited to attend the Screening visit for TH002a. Subjects will attend for 3
      visits to the EEU on successive days. Following the last EEC visit a follow-up visit will be
      performed 3-10 days later.
