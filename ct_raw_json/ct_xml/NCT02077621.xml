  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PG2 has been approved in Taiwan to treat cancer-related fatigue for advanced cancer
      patients. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of PG2 on fatigue
      relief in patients undergoing palliative abdominal surgery for cancer. The secondary
      endpoints,    including the length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, HRQL,
      inflammatory biomarkers, the duration of antibiotic therapy, mortality during the hospital
      stay, weight loss and body composition, will be evaluated among these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled study. At least 40 evaluable
      patients who are scheduled for palliative abdominal surgery for cancer will be randomly
      assigned to the control or treatment group. Each group will have at least 20 patients and be
      treated as follows: 1) control group: patients will accept placebo 1 dose a day (POD-1)
      before surgery and 1 dose a day for 3 days after surgery (POD+0 to POD+2); 2) treatment
      group: patients will accept PG2 1 dose a day (POD-1) before surgery and 1 dose a day for 3
      days after surgery (POD+0 to POD+2).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have cancer and are scheduled for palliative abdominal surgery for
             cancer

          -  Age &gt; 20 years older

          -  Patients who signed the informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients, at screening, has levels greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal
             liver function of alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase.

          -  Patients has a severe renal impairment (defined as serum creatinine greater than 2
             times the upper limit of normal or BUN greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of
             normal for range); or the subject is on dialysis.

          -  Patients have ongoing infection, respiratory tract dysfunction, cardiac dysfunction
             or immune disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with
             conduct of the study.

          -  Patients who are not suitable for undergoing surgery (e.g. congenital hemostatic
             disorders) by the investigator's judgment.

          -  Patients have enrolled or have not yet completed other investigational drug trials
             within 1 month before screening.

          -  Female patients are pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Patients who require preoperative nutritional support

          -  Patients with serious comorbidities (American Society of Anesthesiologists Risk Class
             of 4 or 5).

          -  Patients who is unwilling or unable to answer the quality of life questionnaires i.e.
             the BFI-T and EORTC QLQ-C30.
