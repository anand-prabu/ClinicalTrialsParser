            "textblock": "BKM120 is a PI3K inhibitor. The PI3K/AKT signalling pathway deregulation is frequently\n      observed in Head and neck cancer. In addition to its role in tumor genesis, the PI3K/AKT\n      pathway seems to be involved in resistance to cetuximab.\n\n      In this context, the study proposal is to evaluate the clinical interest of a monotherapy\n      with a PI3K inhibitor (BKM120, Novartis) in patients with metastatic head and neck cancers\n      refractory or relapsing under platin and cetuximab based- chemotherapy. Since resistance to\n      cetuximab can result from PIK3CA mutation, PIK3CA amplification or mutation upstream in the\n      PI3K pathway, BKM120 activity will be evaluated in two parallel independent cohorts of\n      patients: patients presenting a PI3KCA mutation and patients without a PI3KCA mutation."
