  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the
      effectiveness and the cost effectiveness of an on-line eLearning program (entitled
      Employment and Arthritis: Making it Work) designed to help people with inflammatory
      arthritis stay employed. The program also includes assessments with 1) an occupational
      therapist, and 2) a vocational rehabilitation counsellor at the end of the program to help
      participants identify and obtain necessary changes at work. People from three provinces will
      be recruited from collaborators' patient and program recipient lists. The study group will
      receive the program intervention and the control group will receive &quot;usual care&quot; and printed
      educational material. All participants will be followed for five years. The effectiveness of
      the program at improving at work productivity and reducing work cessation will be evaluated
      compared to a control group receiving printed material on employment and arthritis.
