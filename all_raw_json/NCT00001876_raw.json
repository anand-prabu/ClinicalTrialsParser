It has been known to occur in as many as 40% of patients diagnosed with rheumatoid\n      arthritis (RA).  The cause of the pulmonary fibrosis in patients with RA is unknown.\n\n      Patients participating in this study will undergo a series of tests and examinations before\n      and throughout the study.  The tests include blood and urine tests, electrical measures of\n      heart function (ECG), chest x-rays, CAT scans, nuclear medicine scans, breathing tests,\n      exercise tests, and fiberoptic bronchoscopy.\n\n      The goals of this study are to:\n\n        1. Estimate how common pulmonary fibrosis is in patients with rheumatoid arthritis,\n\n        2. Describe the natural course of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with rheumatoid\n           arthritis,\n\n        3. Estimate the survival rate of patients with pulmonary fibrosis and rheumatoid\n           arthritis, and\n\n        4. Learn more about the factors that contribute to the development or progression fibrotic\n           lung disease."
