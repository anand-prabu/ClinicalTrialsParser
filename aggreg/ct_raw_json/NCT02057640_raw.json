Among\n      patients who tolerate at least one cycle of study therapy but experience progression or do\n      not reach partial remission after 4 cycles, this study will define the safety of addition of\n      lenalidomide at doses increased to GFR-adjusted standard dose over two cycles. The study\n      will determine response and clinical benefit response rates in patients who require addition\n      of lenalidomide. Finally, the study aims to assess PFS in patients who require addition of\n      lenalidomide."
