There will be obtained samples of blood (5 mL) of the\n      mothers in the moment of the capture, in the childbirth and to 3 postpartum months.

The samples will be preserved in freezer\n      of-80\u00baC and sent to the different laboratories due preserved participants in order that\n      there does not break the cold chain ( dry ice). In the first year of life of the child there\n      will be practised tests of motive and cognitive development (Bayley's test and Fagan's test)\n      in order to evaluate the influence of the dietetic intervention on the mother in the\n      development of the child."
