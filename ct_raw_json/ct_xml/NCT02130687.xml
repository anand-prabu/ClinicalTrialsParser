  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will test the hypothesis that dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4)
      inhibition attenuates the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
      inhibition but not angiotensin receptor blockade. The investigators further hypothesize that
      this effect is mediated by substance P.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4) inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes
      (T2DM) is growing rapidly. The majority of patients with T2DM are also taking ACE inhibitors
      or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in order to reduce cardiovascular and renal
      morbidity and mortality. DPP4 and ACE inhibitors share the common vasoactive substrate
      substance P. Substance P acts as a vasodilator but also activates the sympathetic nervous
      system. Understanding the interactive effects of DPP4 and ACE inhibitors on blood pressure
      and neurohumoral activation has important implications for the millions of patients with
      T2DM who take these drugs concurrently.
