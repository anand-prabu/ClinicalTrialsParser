            "textblock": "Anemia is one of the most common health problems all over the world with around half of\n      preschool-aged children (<5 years) and one third of women affected. Nutritional iron\n      deficiency is a major reason for anemia in infants, young children and women of reproductive\n      age who have especially high iron requirements that are difficult to meet in regions where\n      the major diet is based on plant foods. So in Ethiopia, where injera is the major staple\n      food. Despite high levels of iron in tef, the most favored cereal for injera, the iron\n      bioavailability is assumed to be very low due to the high levels of phytic acid found in\n      tef.\n\n      The aim of this study is to determine the iron bioavailability in women from injera prepared\n      in a traditional way and investigate the potential of methods to improve the bioavaiability.\n       Therefore, a 50/50 and a 25/75 blend of FeSO4 and NaFeEDTA for iron fortification will be\n      evaluated. Further the potential positive impact of phytic acid reduction on the iron\n      bioavailability will be investigated. The phytic acid reduction will be achieved in two\n      different ways, by addition of whole grain wheat as source of phytase and addition of a\n      commercially available microbial phytase. The studies will be conducted in healthy women\n      using stable isotope techniques."
