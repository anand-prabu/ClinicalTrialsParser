            "textblock": "The prevalence of intracranial aneurysms is high (between 2 and 3%). The major risk of an\n      intracranial aneurysm is its rupture leading to intracranial bleeding (subarachnoid,\n      parenchymal and/or intraventricular) associated with mortality and morbidity.\n\n      Endovascular treatment is now the first line treatment for both ruptured and unruptured\n      aneurysms. One major limitation of this treatment is aneurysm recanalization observed in\n      approximately 20% of aneurysms and leading to retreatment in approximately 10% of aneurysms.\n\n      CARAT trial has shown that the risk of rebleeding after aneurysm coiling is significantly\n      associated with the quality of aneurysm occlusion. The risk of rebleeding is 1.1% in case of\n      complete occlusion, 2.9% when aneurysm occlusion is between 91 and 99%, 5.9% when aneurysm\n      occlusion is between 70 et 90%, and 17.6% when aneurysm occlusion is less than 70%. However\n      it should be outlined that few studies have clearly analyzed the relation between\n      recanalization and rebleeding.\n\n      Several factors are probably associated with aneurysm recanalization. Ruptured aneurysms are\n      more prone to aneurysm recanalization than unruptured aneurysm. Age, elevated blood\n      pressure, smoking probably play a role in aneurysm recanalization. Anatomical features are\n      also probably key factors for aneurysm recanalization. Aneurysm and neck sizes are probably\n      important factors for aneurysm recanalization. The role of aneurysm location is more\n      controversial. Therapeutic factors certainly play also an important role, but precise\n      analyses are still missing. The quality of post-operative aneurysm occlusion is probably\n      important for the future evolution of the aneurysm. Surface-modified coils have not\n      demonstrated any efficacy to prevent aneurysm recanalization. The role of adjunctive\n      techniques has also not precisely be evaluated (remodeling, stenting)."
