        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has histologically or cytologically proven adenocarcinoma of the breast
             that is HER2+

          -  The subject has AR+ and ER-/PgR- breast cancer

          -  The subject has metastatic disease or has locally advanced disease that is not
             amendable to curative treatment

          -  The subject has measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1

          -  The subject has received at least 1 but no more than 4 lines of therapy in the
             metastatic or locally advanced disease (a line of therapy is defined as a course of
             treatment, at the end of which there was disease progression)

          -  The subject has adequately recovered from toxicities due to prior therapy.

          -  The subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance (ECOG) status ≤ 1
             at Screening and Day 1

          -  The subject has available at the site a representative, formalin-fixed,
             paraffin-embedded, tumor specimen that enabled the definitive diagnosis of breast
             cancer with adequate viable tumor cells in a tissue block (preferred) or ≥ 10 (20
             preferred) freshly cut, unstained, serial slides and the associated pathology report

          -  The subject has an estimated life expectancy of at least 6 months at Day 1

          -  The subject must be able to swallow study drug and comply with study requirements

          -  The subject agrees not to participate in another interventional study while on
             treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a severe concurrent disease, infection, or comorbidity that would
             make the subject inappropriate for enrollment.

          -  The subject has current or previously treated brain metastasis or active
             leptomeningeal disease. Brain imaging is required during screening in all subjects to
             exclude the presence of unequivocal central nervous system disease.

          -  The subject has a history of a non-breast cancer malignancy with the following
             exceptions:

               -  The subject with a previous history of a non-invasive carcinoma is eligible if
                  he/she has had successful curative treatment any time prior to Screening.

               -  For all other malignancies, the subject is eligible if they have undergone
                  potentially curative therapy and they have been considered disease free for at
                  least 5 years prior to Screening.

          -  The subject has inadequate marrow, hepatic, and/or renal function.

          -  The subject has a history of seizure or any condition that may predispose to seizure
             (e.g., prior cortical stroke, significant brain trauma).

          -  The subject has a history of loss of consciousness, cerebrovascular accident, or
             transient ischemic attack within 12 months before the Day 1 visit.

          -  The subject has had a hypoglycemic episode requiring medical intervention while on
             insulin (or other anti-diabetic) treatment within 12 months before Day 1.

          -  The subject has clinically significant cardiovascular disease.

          -  The subject has significant respiratory disease, including severe dyspnea at rest due
             to complications of advanced malignancy or requiring supplementary oxygen therapy.

          -  The subject has an active gastrointestinal disorder affecting absorption (e.g.,
             gastrectomy, active peptic ulcer disease) within the 3 months prior to the Day 1
             visit.

          -  The subject had a major surgical procedure, substantial open biopsy, or significant
             traumatic experience within 28 days before the Day 1 visit, or anticipation of need
             for major surgical procedure during the course of the study.

          -  The subject has had palliative radiation therapy to bone metastases within 14 days
             prior to the Day 1 visit (side effects from radiation must be resolved).

          -  The subject has received chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or any other systemic
             anticancer therapy, with the exception of anti-HER2 therapy (e.g., trastuzumab),
             within 14 days prior to the Day 1 visit.

          -  The subject has been treated with any investigational drugs within 14 days prior to
             the Day 1 visit.

          -  The subject has received treatment with any approved or investigational agent that
             either blocks androgen synthesis or targets the AR (e.g., abiraterone acetate,
             bicalutamide, enzalutamide, TAK-448, TAK-683, TAK-700, ARN-509, ODM-201, BMS-641988).
              Subjects who received treatment for &lt;28 days or placebo on an investigational study
             are acceptable.

          -  The subject received pertuzumab in the most recent line of therapy.

          -  The subject has a known history of positive test for Hepatitis B surface antigen
             (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibody or history of positive test for Human
             Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

          -  The subject has shown a hypersensitivity reaction to the active pharmaceutical
             ingredient or any of the enzalutamide capsule components, including Labrasol,
             butylated hydroxyanisole and butylated hydroxytoluene.

          -  The subject has had a severe infusion reaction to trastuzumab or hypersensitivity to
             trastuzumab, and excipients including murine proteins, L-histidine, L-histidine
             hydrochloride monohydrate, α,α-trehalose dehydrate, L-methionine, and polysorbate.

          -  The subject has any other condition or reason that would make the subject ineligible
             to receive trastuzumab, interferes with the ability of the subject to participate in
             the trial, places the subject at undue risk, or complicates the interpretation of
             safety data.
