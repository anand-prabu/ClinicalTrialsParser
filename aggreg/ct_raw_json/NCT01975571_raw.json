            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to determine if individuals with residual low-frequency hearing\n      in the severe range can develop improved speech perception by combining their residual\n      acoustic hearing with electrical processing through a cochlear implant designed to stimulate\n      the high-frequency basal and middle turn of the cochlea while preserving useful\n      low-frequency acoustic hearing.  To accomplish this, we propose to implant individuals with\n      severe hearing with a Cochlear\u00ae Nucleus\u2122 Hybrid L24 Implant or a Cochlear\u00ae Nucleus\u2122 Hybrid\n      S12 in the poorer ear. We believe these devices will do less damage to the Organ of Corti\n      structures, than longer, more invasive standard cochlear implant electrodes.\n\n      Two different populations will be studied under this IDE.\n\n      Population 1: 15 Adults who have a severe sensorineural hearing loss with a pure-tone\n      average (PTA) between 60-90 decibels (dB) hearing level (HL) between 125-1500 Hz and\n      profound loss at higher frequencies will be implanted with the Cochlear\u00ae Nucleus\u2122 Hybrid L24\n      Implant. The potential subject will present with Consonant-Nucleus-Consonant (CNC)\n      monosyllabic word scores between 0-35% in the ear to be implanted and up to 60%\n      understanding in the contralateral ear in the best-aided condition.\n\n      Population 2:  30 Children (ages 5-12 years) and adolescents (ages 13-15 years) who have a\n      sensorineural hearing loss with a pure-tone average (PTA) between 60-90 dB HL between\n      125-1500 Hz and profound loss at higher frequencies will be implanted with the Cochlear\u00ae\n      Nucleus\u2122 Hybrid L24 Implant or the Cochlear\u00ae Nucleus\u2122 Hybrid S12 Implant. Those that have\n      hearing thresholds between 60-90 dB HL at 1500 Hz would be implanted with the less invasive\n      shorter 10 mm Hybrid S12 in attempt to better preserve the middle frequency range.  Those\n      with hearing thresholds >90 dB HL at 1500 Hz would receive the longer 16 mm Hybrid L24\n      electrode.  The potential subject will present with Phonetically Balanced Kindergarten\n      (PB-K) monosyllabic word scores between 0-50% in the ear to be implanted and up to 60%\n      understanding in the contralateral ear in the best-aided condition.\n\n      Through the preserved acoustic hearing, we believe the subject will experience better signal\n      to noise ratios for speech perception in noise, better localization of sound and an\n      improvement music perception.  Histological evidence from patients implanted with standard\n      arrays and our experience with a short electrode array for implantation of individuals with\n      significant residual hearing both support this assumption (Nadol, Shiao, Burgess, Ketten,\n      Eddington et al., 2001).  The duration of this study will be 2 years (24 months) for adults\n      and for 5 years (60 months) in children and adolescents."

Previous research with children and adults who use CIs has shown that while adults with traditional long-electrode cochlear implants are able to perform successfully in three of the four formats (performing poorly on the isochronous condition), adults with short-electrode cochlear implants are able to perform successfully on all formats. Conversely, children with long-electrode devices are only able to perform well on those that include lyrics and perform at or below change on the other two conditions.",
