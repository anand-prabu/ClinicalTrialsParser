Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose, dose\n      limiting toxicities, and safety of BMS-188787 in patients with nonhematologic malignancies.\n      II. Determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of BMS-188797 in these patients. III. Describe any\n      antitumor activity of this treatment in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive BMS-188797 IV over 1 hour.\n      Treatment continues every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-188797 until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Patients are followed every 4 weeks until\n      toxicities resolve, and then at the investigator's discretion.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study over 12-18\n      months."
