This will eventually be correlated with the degree of hepatic fibrosis\n      present within different geographic sites in the cirrhotic liver.  Tissue samples will be\n      obtained from the patient's liver explant as well as hilar lymph nodes.  Upon the removal of\n      the cirrhotic liver at the time of transplantation, the explant will be biopsied multiple\n      times in different segments of the liver and preserved for viral detection studies as well\n      as analysis of the degree of fibrosis.  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be\n      obtained for viral detection at the time of transplantation.  Serum HCV RNA levels will also\n      be obtained at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months post liver transplantation.\n\n      Study Hypotheses:\n\n        -  Virological relapse or non-response is higher is patients with cirrhosis due to failure\n           of antiviral medication to concentrate adequately in a fibrotic liver having an altered\n           sinusoidal micro-architecture\n\n        -  HCV may persist in different geographic regions of the fibrotic liver in part\n           predicated on blood supply to that area and this may have an effect on overall\n           virological response.  These differences in viral persistence and detection may exist\n           in different lobes of the liver or even within a few centimeters within the same\n           portion of the liver parenchyma.\n\n        -  PBMC and hilar lymph nodes may be extrahepatic reservoirs of HCV viral persistence in\n           patients receiving antiviral therapy and may account for virological relapse\n           post-therapy\n\n        -  There may be varying degrees of fibrosis within the same cirrhotic liver which may\n           impact on hepatic synthetic function and antiviral response to treatment."
