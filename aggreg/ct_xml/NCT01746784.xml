    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      N6022, and to obtain descriptive information on the effect of N6022 on biomarkers of CFTR
      function and inflammation in adult cystic fibrosis subjects who are homozygous for the
      F508del-CFTR mutation.

      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, sequential
      dose-escalation study which will occur in two parts. All selection criteria, assessments and
      procedures described in this protocol will be applied to both parts. Up to 5 cohorts will be
      studied with a total of 67 patients at approximately 18 clinical sites in the United States.
