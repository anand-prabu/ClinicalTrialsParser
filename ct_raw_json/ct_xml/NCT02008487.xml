    <textblock>
      This study will test a special powder for ulcers caused by a variety of conditions such as
      pressure that sometimes happen when a person is at the end of life. The powder will be
      applied to these ulcers to see if it helps with pain, odor and drainage (leakage). People
      who are being cared for by hospice or palliative care organizations will be invited to be in
      the study. The study will also find out if the powder is easy to use by caregivers as well
      as improving the comfort and quality of life of the person who has the ulcer.

    <description>In both hospice settings, a registered nurse establishes the wound protocol per principles of wound care and agency guidelines. The cover dressing will be removed and the wound cleansed according to agency protocol (usual care) or as needed. The RGN107 powder, contained in a small squirt bottle, will be squeezed/sprinkled on the wound at each dressing change after cleansing or until a crust is formed. Once formed, the powder will be applied only minimally to reinforce crust integrity. The peri-wound skin will receive care and the cover dressing will be applied. Minimal manipulation of the crusted area will ensue once it has formed. Frequency of dressing changes depends on wound characteristics such as exudate.</description>
