II. Determine post-immunization changes in PSA levels and\n      other objective parameters or disease (radionuclide bone scan and/or measurable disease if\n      present) in these patients after receiving this therapy.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive glycosylated MUC-1 antigen containing MUC-1 (106) with keyhole\n      limpet hemocyanin conjugate subcutaneously (SQ) plus immunological adjuvant QS21 SQ on weeks\n      1-3, 7, 15, and 27 for a total of 6 vaccinations.
