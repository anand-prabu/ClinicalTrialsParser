  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and the we have new
      scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical
      activity a person does. However, we do not measure sitting time very accurately and when we
      ask people to tell us how much they do, their answers are unreliable. Our study will use
      small sensors to objectively measure when people sit or do physical activity, and we will
      use sophisticated computational techniques to summarize these movement patterns.

    <description>Using an annotated data set of SenseCam images in three free-living population subgroups, we will compare sensitivity, specificity and percent agreement between behavioral classifiers derived from: (a) single axis vs. multi axis accelerometers; (b) aggregated movement counts vs. raw acceleration data; (c) hip vs. wrist mounted accelerometers.
Determine (a) the extent to which adding GPS data improves discrimination accuracy over accelerometer only behavior classification (i.e., best classifier resulting from Aim 1); and (b) the extent to which adding GIS data improves discrimination accuracy over accelerometer and GPS behavior classification alone (i.e., best classifier resulting from Aim 2a).</description>

        We will recruit 210 volunteer participants over a 2-yr period. Fifty percent of the sample
        will be women, and we will quota sample three specific age groups: 6-10 year olds (n =
        70); 16-55 year olds (n=70); and 65-85 year olds (n= 70).
