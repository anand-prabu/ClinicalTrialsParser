            "textblock": "The proposed research will develop, demonstrate the feasibility of, and pilot test in a\n      randomized controlled trial a prescription opioid taper support intervention. This\n      intervention aims to prevent opioid misuse and adverse events among patients receiving\n      chronic opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain without evidence of current substance\n      abuse.\n\n      The project will yield information essential to planning a future, larger-scale RCT designed\n      to evaluate: 1) the efficacy of the intervention in preventing prescription opioid abuse,\n      misuse, overdose and other adverse events among patients receiving chronic opioid therapy\n      for chronic non-cancer pain, 2) the effects of the intervention on opioid use, pain,\n      painrelated activity interference, and mood. Participants in our pilot study will be limited\n      to those without current opioid abuse or other substance abuse, but past substance abuse\n      will be allowed. This will provide a sample of patients at risk for opioid abuse, misuse and\n      overdose, but who may be able to taper their opioids successfully. Hypothesis: Patients\n      receiving chronic opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer painwho are randomized to the opioid\n      taper support intervention, as compared with patients randomized to usual opioid prescribing\n      care, will have lower opioid average daily doses at 22 and 34 weeks."
