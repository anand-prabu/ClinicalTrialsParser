Cognitive behavior\n      therapy (CBT) has been shown to be an effective treatment of these disorders. Despite the\n      strong evidence for CBT there is a lack of evidence-based psychological treatment in primary\n      care. For various reasons, the progress of research has not affected clinical practice. For\n      successful implementation of CBT in primary care cost-effective therapies, access to\n      therapists with proper training and supervision, evidence-based manuals and management that\n      support the implementation is needed.\n\n      Aim: The aim of this trial is to evaluate a stepped care model with CBT in primary care. All\n      patients are first treated with self-help CBT (N = 400). Patients that do not improve after\n      treatment (9 weeks) are randomized  to individual CBT or continued self-help treatment.\n      Based on published studies  2/3 is expected to be improved after self-help and therefore do\n      not undergo randomization. 1/3 (n = 133) who didn\u00b4t respond to treatment is randomized to\n      individual CBT (N = 67) or continued self-help treatment (N = 67)."
