            "textblock": "The role of vitamin D in skeletal health is well established.  More recently, vitamin D has\n      been implicated in multiple other disease states and is currently a topic of much discussion\n      in the pediatric and adult medical literature.  Individuals with gastrointestinal or\n      hepatobiliary diseases that limit the absorption of dietary vitamin D and those individuals\n      with limited sunlight exposure or darker skin color are at risk for suboptimal vitamin D\n      status.  Recent joint guidelines from the North American and European Societies of Pediatric\n      Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN and ESPGHAN, respectively) have\n      recommended routine surveillance and treatment for vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency in\n      children affected by inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), namely Crohn's disease (CD) and\n      ulcerative colitis (UC).  Current recommendations are for prolonged daily dosing of oral\n      vitamin D, but studies in children with other chronic diseases have demonstrated the benefit\n      of improved compliance with less frequent, higher doses of vitamin D.  The primary goal of\n      this pilot study is to establish whether weekly dosing of vitamin D can correct suboptimal\n      vitamin D status in children with inflammatory bowel disease.  A secondary goal is to\n      evaluate whether pediatric IBD patients with darker skin respond differently to vitamin D\n      therapy than do their lighter-skinned counterparts."
