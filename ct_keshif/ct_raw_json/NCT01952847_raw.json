You will have an equal chance of being\n      assigned to either group:\n\n        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive glutamine.\n\n        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive a placebo.\n\n      Neither you nor the study staff will know if you are receiving the study drug or the\n      placebo. However, if needed for your safety, the study staff will be able to find out what\n      you are receiving.\n\n      Study Drug Administration:\n\n      Glutamine or the placebo will be taken as a sugary drink by mouth. You will take the drink\n      twice daily starting the day you first receive your anti-cancer therapy or radiation\n      treatment.\n\n      You will mix one scoop of powder with 25-100 milliliters (about 2-6 tablespoons) of water.\n      If you are in the chemotherapy group, you will swish the drink for 10 seconds and swallow.\n      If you are in the radiation group, you will swallow the drink in small amounts several\n      times.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      At every visit, you will be asked about any side effects you may be having and about any\n      other drugs you may be taking.\n\n      Chemotherapy Group:\n\n      On Days 1, 8, and 22 of Cycle 1:\n\n        -  You will have a mouth exam.\n\n        -  Your weight will be recorded.\n\n      On Day 15 of Cycle 1:\n\n        -  You will have a mouth exam.\n\n        -  Your weight will be recorded.\n\n        -  You will complete a quality of life questionnaire.\n\n      On Day 1 of Cycle 2 and beyond:\n\n        -  You will have a mouth exam.\n\n        -  Your weight will be recorded.\n\n        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine\n           tests.\n\n        -  You will complete a quality of life questionnaire.\n\n        -  You will complete a survey about how you feel about the study drug. This should take\n           about 5-10 minutes to complete.\n\n        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a photograph of your mouth taken.\n\n      After 3 months of chemotherapy:\n\n      -You will complete a quality of life questionnaire.\n\n      After 6 months of chemotherapy:\n\n        -  Your weight will be recorded.\n\n        -  You will complete a quality of life questionnaire.\n\n      Radiation Therapy Group:\n\n      On Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6 of Radiation:\n\n        -  You will be asked if you have inflammation of your esophagus.\n\n        -  Your weight will be recorded.\n\n        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine\n           tests.\n\n      On Weeks 3 and 5 of Radiation:\n\n        -  You will be asked if you have inflammation of your esophagus.\n\n        -  Your weight will be recorded.\n\n        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine\n           tests.\n\n        -  You will complete a quality of life questionnaire.\n\n        -  You will complete a survey about how you feel about the study drug.\n\n      On Week 7 of Radiation:\n\n        -  You will be asked if you have inflammation of your esophagus.\n\n        -  Your weight will be recorded.\n\n        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine\n           tests.\n\n        -  You will complete a quality of life questionnaire.\n\n           1 month after your radiation has ended:\n\n        -  You will be asked if you have inflammation of your esophagus.\n\n        -  Your weight will be recorded.\n\n        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine\n           tests.\n\n        -  You will complete a quality of life questionnaire.\n\n           3 months after your radiation has ended:\n\n        -  You will complete a quality of life questionnaire.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best\n      interest.\n\n      If you stop chemotherapy or radiation before completion of the intended study period, you\n      will continue to take the study drug for 4 weeks.\n\n      If you develop severe sores, blisters, or inflammation in your mouth or esophagus, you will\n      be removed from the study, and the doctor will give you another medication for your sores\n      and blisters.\n\n      Your participation on the study will be over after the end-of-study visit.\n\n      End-of-Study Visit:\n\n      After you are off study, you will have an end-of-study visit. For the radiation group, this\n      will be 6 months after radiation therapy. For the chemotherapy group, this is 4 weeks after\n      the last dose.\n\n        -  Your weight will be recorded.\n\n        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine\n           tests.\n\n        -  You will complete a quality of life questionnaire.\n\n        -  If you are in the chemotherapy group, you will have a mouth exam.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Glutamine is FDA approved and commercially available for\n      the treatment of short bowel syndrome. Its use to treat mouth sores and inflammation of the\n      esophagus is investigational.\n\n      Up to 180 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."
