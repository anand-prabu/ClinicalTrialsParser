Furthermore, the combination of Restylane\u00ae with\n      IL triamcinolone acetonide injections may prevent a common side effect, atrophy. With the\n      prevention of scalp atrophy and the preservation of higher concentrations of triamcinolone\n      acetonide for longer periods of time, patients may see a better clinical response for a\n      longer period of time.  Quality of life may improve as the number of clinic visits decreases\n      as would the number of IL corticosteroid injections."
