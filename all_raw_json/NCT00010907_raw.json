The herbal preparation has\n      been used historically in the treatment of alcohol intoxication and is still prescribed in\n      China and Southeast Asia. Efficacy has been documented but awaits the application of current\n      research methods to establish efficacy, safety, and probable mechanisms of action.\n      Preclinical studies have been carried out in alcohol-preferring rats and vervet monkeys to\n      test efficacy in reducing voluntary alcohol intake, measure tolerance effects, and\n      toxicological affects. The proposed human trial will develop a placebo, establish quality\n      control, test methods of administration, and examine compliance issues. Following these\n      preliminary steps, a placebo controlled trial will be conducted using 160 subjects (80\n      subjects per treatment condition with 40 of each gender). Alcohol use, craving, health\n      status, psychological status, and at rates will be assessed using established measures that\n      are current in addiction research."
