The specific aims of this clinical trial are to:\n\n        1. Determine if accommodation with a VC Grip 3 prehensor will result in improved grip\n           force.\n\n        2. Determine if accommodation with a VC Grip 3 prehensor will result in improved movement\n           symmetry and reduced compensatory motion during activity.\n\n        3. Determine if accommodation with a VC Grip 3 prehensor will result in improved function\n           in activities of daily living by self-report."

Non-amputee subjects will perform the same randomization, test, and short surveys\n      as the amputee subjects, except they will have a 1-hour accommodation immediately prior to\n      testing, will have a minimum of 1 week between Phase A and Phase B testing, and will not\n      complete the follow-up survey."
