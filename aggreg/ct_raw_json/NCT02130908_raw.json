Participants consumed\n      750g/week of fillets of fish or meat for 8 weeks.\n\n      Hypotheses:\n\n        1. High intake of either lean or fatty fish would improve serum concentrations of lipids\n           and inflammatory markers as well as improve glucose tolerance during the 4 week\n           intervention period.\n\n        2. High intake of lean meat would not affect the serum levels of lipids, inflammatory\n           markers and glucose."
