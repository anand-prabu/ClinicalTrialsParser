The\n      fluctuations of glucose levels over the lifetime of patients with diabetes can lead to\n      complications such as nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy and cardiovascular diseases.\n      Although diabetes is a chronic disease, it can be controlled with use of medications (oral\n      agents or insulin), and/or changes in life-style and diet.\n\n      With the emergence of the internet, health care professionals are changing the way they\n      approach diabetes management. Internet Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems (IBGMS) are aimed at\n      keeping blood glucose levels normal or in the range of acceptable levels to prevent the\n      complications associated with diabetes.

These data will only be accessed by the\n      investigators and will be inputted into an Excel\u00ae spreadsheet where each patient will be\n      given a unique identifier. All data pertaining to individual patients will be kept locked in\n      the office of the study investigators.\n\n      Calculations and Statistics Statistical analysis will be performed on site by the\n      researchers. Each group will complete the DTSQ.  Questions revolve around satisfaction of\n      treatment and are to be answered on a scale of 1 (very dissatisfied) to 6 (very Satisfied).\n      Frequency of reporting will be determined through number of reports sent in per month.\n      Total strip count will be recorded for each group. Time will be measured for the time it\n      takes to train each patient in their respective meter/platform. All outcome measurements\n      will be analysed using independent samples t-tests. Participants will only be identified by\n      coded initials and a number to protect privacy."
