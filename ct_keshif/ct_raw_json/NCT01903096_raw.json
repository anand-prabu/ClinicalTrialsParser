            "textblock": "The strong demand for primary care (PC) services in Spain exceeds resources. Part of this\n      demand is due to the increasing number of anxiety, depression, and somatization disorders\n      that affect the general population. These disorders, commonly known as emotional disorders,\n      are very common in Spanish PC settings, they are poorly detected by physicians, rarely\n      receive adequate treatment (if they receive treatment it is mostly drugs instead of\n      psychological treatment), they generate a highly frequent use of PC services, a greater\n      burden than physical diseases and tend to become chronic without treatment.\n\n      Other countries have successfully put psychological techniques in PC into practice (in the\n      United Kingdom the program known as \"Improving Access to Psychological Therapies\" has\n      obtained very positive results) in order to correctly diagnose and treat emotional\n      disorders. The results obtained in terms of symptoms, quality of life, diagnosis, etc., have\n      been better than the usual treatment offered in PC services, involving no side effects,\n      fewer relapses, and lower costs in the long term.\n\n      The general aim of this study is to test how well a psychological treatment program for\n      anxiety, depression, and somatization disorders works in PC and to compare the results\n      obtained after seven 90-minute group sessions (every to two to four weeks approximately, for\n      a period of 24 weeks) with the usual treatment offered in Spanish PC services. Similar\n      results to the ones already obtained in other countries are expected to be found.\n\n      Approximately 1130 adults, regardless of their age and sex, with an anxiety, depression\n      and/or somatization disorder (diagnosed with a simple and short questionnaire) will\n      participate in this study.\n\n      Participation will be voluntary and confidentiality will be guaranteed. Half of the\n      participants in the study will be randomly assigned to receive their usual care and the\n      other half will receive psychological treatment, within the same health care centre. Since\n      it is a \"double-blind\" study, neither the health professional nor the patient will know\n      which treatment will be applied. Psychological assessments will be carried out before and\n      after receiving treatment and participants will be followed up at 3, 6 and 12 months.\n\n      Participation will pose no risks different from the typically present when receiving usual\n      treatment. The aim of this study will be to maximize benefits and reduce potential harms\n      (principle of proportionality)."

The study should include 563 patients in each condition, with a\n      total of 1126 patients, accounting for a 20% attrition or dropout. With this sample size,\n      the result will be statistically significant (85% statistical power) when comparing both\n      groups, even if they differ by one point only, with a standard deviation of 5, a range of\n      scores from 0-27 for the PHQ-9, and it will enable us to conclude that the result is\n      different for each group with a 95% confidence level.\n\n      Both groups will be equivalent in all measures before receiving treatment. 2x2 within and\n      between-groups analyses of variance (group x treatment) will be conducted for each dependent\n      variable. The effect size for each dependent variable will be calculated in both groups, as\n      well as the 95% confidence interval, taking into account the number of treatment sessions.\n      Primary analyses will follow the \"intention-to-treat\" principle in such a way that all\n      individuals who participate in the study will be considered as members of one group even if\n      they have not yet completed the protocol. \"Therapeutic success\" will be obtained if the\n      average scores of the experimental group are significantly lower than those of the control\n      group in the dependent variables (anxiety, depression, and somatization symptoms), and when\n      the effect sizes are medium to large and significantly higher than those of the control\n      group (especially in the case of anxiety symptoms). In addition, the results obtained by\n      each group in terms of degree of disability (work, family and social), quality of life,\n      treatment satisfaction, costs and cost-efficiency of both treatments will be compared.\n\n      It will be carried out in eleven Primary Care (PC) centres in Madrid, Valencia, Albacete,\n      Mallorca, Murcia, Vizcaya and Melilla, and may be extended to other centres and cities.\n\n      It is expected to start in September 2013 and posttreatment will end by September 2014. The\n      study will be open to participants until recruitment is completed. The follow-up period will\n      end by September 2015.\n\n      Psicofundaci\u00f3n (Spanish Foundation for the Promotion, Scientific and Professional\n      Development of Psychology) and the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness are\n      funding this three-year project.\n\n      The main contact is Dr. Antonio Cano-Vindel, professor at the Faculty of Psychology of\n      Complutense University of Madrid.
