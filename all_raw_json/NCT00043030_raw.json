Patients complete a questionnaire comprising 24\n      questions over 30-45 minutes. Interviews are conducted within 1 week after enrolling in a\n      phase I clinical trial (prior to the first dose of study agent) and then again 2 months\n      later (or at the time the patient stops treatment). The first 10 patients enrolled complete\n      an additional 6 questions over 15 minutes during the first interview to validate the\n      questionnaire, but do not complete a second interview.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
