            "textblock": "Patients were randomly divided into 4 groups: group G (general anesthesia for Caesarean\n      section, n=21), group S (spinal anesthesia for Caesarean section, n=21), group E (epidural\n      anesthesia for Caesarean section, n=21), group V (normal vaginal birth without anesthesia,\n      n=21). Blood sample of 3 mililiters was taken from all patients 2,5 hours before procedure\n      and oxytocin and prolactin levels in this blood samples were determined.  No patient\n      received premedication.  Group G (general anesthesia for Caesarean section) received\n      preoxygenation with 100% oxygen for 3-5 minutes before intubation. In order to let fetus\n      minimally affected by the anesthetic agents, induction was performed after the disinfection\n      and covering up of surgery area. Induction was performed with propofol  (2 mg/ kg) and\n      rocuronium (0,6 mg/kg). After onset of neuromuscular block, patients were intubated with\n      compression maneuver of cricoid cartilage. Controlled ventilation was provided with\n      anesthesia machine Datex Ohmeda S/5 Avance with tidal volume of 8-10 ml/kg,  respiration\n      frequency of 10-12 min. Anesthesia was maintained with oxygen (50%) , air (50%),\n      sevoflurane of 1 MAC. When necessary rocuronium 0,15 mg/kg was administered. After delivery\n      of the newborn, fentanyl 1-1,5 mcg/ kg was administered.\n\n      Patients in group S (spinal anesthesia for Caesarean section) received 750-1000 mL of 0,9%\n      NaCI solution (10-15 mL/kg) as infusion in 20-30 minutes. Under strict aseptic precautions a\n      25G Quincke spinal needle was introduced into L3-L4 or L4-L5 intervertebral space in midline\n      approach in sitting posture, and, after confirming free flow of CSF, predetermined 10-11 mg\n      of drug solution (hypertonic bupivacaine 0,5%) was injected.  We let the operation begin\n      when sensory and motor blockade were verified. Oxygen of 100% (3 L. min) was administered\n      throughout the operation via nasal cannula.\n\n      Patients in group E (epidural anesthesia for Caesarean section) received 750-1000 mL of 0,9%\n      NaCI solution (10-15 mL/kg) as infusion in 20-30 minutes. We conducted epidural anesthesia\n      with 18-gauge Tuohy needle at L3-L4 or L4-L5 epidural space by midline approach at sitting\n      position.  3 -5 minutes after injection of 3 ml lidocaine as test-dose, when the patient has\n      no sign of subarachnoid injection like prickling in lower extremities or of intravascular\n      injection like nausea, vomiting, tachicardia, tinnitus,  a 20-gauge epidural catheter was\n      inserted to cephalad. We injected 10 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine via epidural catheter.  We let\n      the operation begin when sensory and motor blockade were verified. Oxygen of 100% (3 L. min)\n      was administered throughout the operation via nasal cannula.\n\n      Patients in all 3 groups were monitorised in the operation room with a monitor of\n      Datex-Ohmeda and electrocardiogram (ECG), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood\n      pressure (DBP), mean blood pressure (MBP), heart rate (HR), peripheral oxygen saturation\n      (SPO2) were recorded.  Efedrin 5-10 mg and/or atropin 0,5 mg was administered when\n      significant hypotension and bradicardia occurred. After delivery of the newborn 30 IU of\n      oxytocin in a 1000cc solution of 0,9% NaCI was infused and if patient was not hypertensive,\n      methylergonovine of 0,2 mg was administered intramuscular.\n\n      Patients in group V (spontaneous vaginal birth without anesthesia) were spectated by\n      gynecologists in the Clinic of Gynecology and Obstetrics during the delivery.  They received\n      no anesthesia.\n\n      In all groups blood samples were taken at the 24th hour after delivery and oxytocin and\n      prolactin levels were measured. Plasma of blood samples taken before and after delivery were\n      stored at a temperature of -80\u00b0C.  Prolactin levels were determined with chemiluminescense\n      immunoassay technique Cobas e 601 (Roche\u00ae Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) using a commercial\n      kit (Roche\u00ae). Oxytocin levels were determined with a commercial ELISA kit (Cusabio Biotech\n      CO. Ltd). By all patients onset time of lactation was recorded."
