This study focuses\n      on elderly individuals with MCI because people at a pre-dementia stage may sustain the\n      greatest and most lasting benefit from cognitive-enhancing agents.\n\n      Patients receive either donepezil or placebo for the first 6 months of the study. In the\n      second 6 months of the study, patients are randomized to receive either donepezil plus GBE\n      or donepezil alone. Positron Emission Tomography (PET), which provides a color-coded image\n      of the brain's blood flow in a particular area, is used to assess brain activity during\n      memory tasks. A PET scan is performed at study entry,  6 months, and 1 year. A vasodilator\n      (a drug that dilates the blood vessels) is administered during the PET imaging procedure to\n      determine whether vascular disease affects memory function. A magnetic resonance imaging\n      (MRI) scan is also taken to view the brain."
