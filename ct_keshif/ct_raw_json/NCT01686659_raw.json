From each pair, Anesthesiologists will be randomly allocated to either treat\n      their patients while having access to data from a continuous noninvasive hemoglobin\n      monitoring device (total hemoglobin [SpHb] and Pleth Variability Index [PVI]) (SpHb group)\n      or without access to SpHb/PVI data, under standard of care (control group). Regardless of\n      randomization, all patients will be monitored with the device but the data will be blinded\n      and not be available to the Anesthesiologist to be used in the management of the control\n      group. Only in the SpHb group, the SpHb/PVI data will be provided live to the\n      Anesthesiologist, to be used during management of the patients."
