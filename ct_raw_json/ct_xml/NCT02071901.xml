    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well eltrombopag olamine works in improving the recovery of
      platelet counts in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia undergoing induction (the
      first treatment given for a disease) chemotherapy. Platelet counts recover more slowly in
      older patients, leading to risk of complications and the delay of post-remission therapy.
      Eltrombopag olamine may cause the body to make platelets after chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether eltrombopag (eltrombopag olamine) leads to early platelet recovery
      in older acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients (&gt;= 60 years) who attain morphologic
      remission on day 14 bone marrow assessment following remission induction chemotherapy (IC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of eltrombopag on platelet transfusion requirements in the
      setting of postremission IC - rates of platelet transfusion independence, time to platelet
      transfusion independence.

      II. To determine the effect of eltrombopag on occurrence of clinically significant bleeding
      events (CSBE).

      III. To determine any effect on erythrocytic series - rise in hemoglobin levels, time to red
      blood cell transfusion independence.

      IV. To determine any effect on granulocytic series - time to absolute neutrophil count
      recovery to &gt; 500 /μL.

      V. To determine the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag when given at the optimal dose in
      the setting of postremission chemotherapy - frequency and severity of eltrombopag-related
      adverse events.

      VI. To determine rates of complete remission (CR), rates of partial complete remission
      (CRp), time to attain CR, and time to initiation of postremission consolidation therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive eltrombopag olamine orally (PO) once daily (QD) until platelet counts reach
      &gt;= 50,000/uL or for 8 weeks, whichever comes earlier. Treatment continues in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.
