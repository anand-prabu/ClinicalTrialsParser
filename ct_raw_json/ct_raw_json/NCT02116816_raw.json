For this purpose 16 healthy\n      volunteers will be recruited. All participants will receive all the 3 supplements with and\n      without mixing with pollen shells so they will undergo a total of 3 tests. For each test six\n      blood samples will be taken over an 8 hour period.\n\n      The second part of the study will look at the absorption of the best absorbed polyphenol\n      identified from part 1 to see if absorption is dose linear or may plateau. A total of 30\n      healthy volunteers will be recruited. All participants will receive three different doses\n      (in random order) of the same polyphenol supplement and then six blood samples will be taken\n      over an 8 hour period."
