    <textblock>
      The pentoxifylline used with tocopherol achieves a certain effectiveness in the treatment of
      the fibrosis.

      Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been recommended and used in a wide variety of medical
      conditions including the treatment of delayed radiation injuries (soft tissue and bony
      radiation necrosis). The hyperbaric oxygen therapy increases the formation of granulation
      tissue and produces angiogenesis maintained after use.

    <textblock>
      Patients with head and neck tumors often present superficial radiation induced fibrosis and
      other late complications of radiotherapy that can seriously affect their quality of life.

      The pentoxifylline used with tocopherol achieves a certain effectiveness in the treatment of
      the fibrosis.

      Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been recommended and used in a wide variety of medical
      conditions including the treatment of delayed radiation injuries (soft tissue and bony
      radiation necrosis). The hyperbaric oxygen therapy increases the formation of granulation
      tissue and produces angiogenesis maintained after use.

      Both treatments in combination could produce a synergistic effect because the angiogenesis
      induced by hyperbaric oxygen therapy allow better access to drugs to the injury. The
      magnetic resonance, provides data of the fibrosis and other side effects of radiotherapy.
