This is a\n      proof-of-concept phase 1/2a pilot and endpoint development study that is designed to provide\n      initial evidence of biological activity of (-)-epicatechin.  Primary endpoints include\n      initial assessment of tissue-specific evidence of efficacy from muscle biopsy samples.\n      Secondary endpoints include measures of strength and physical function, and safety and\n      adverse event data.  Pilot endpoints include assessment of mRNA and miRNA peripheral blood\n      profiles and validation of non-invasive near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) muscle perfusion\n      studies during exercise and a recumbent cycle exercise test that may be employed as\n      endpoints in future clinical trials.\n\n      This single center open-label pilot study will enroll 10 adults with genetically-confirmed\n      Becker muscular dystrophy, who will receive the purified nutritional extract (-)-epicatechin\n      100mg/day orally for 8 weeks. After screening visits, participants will be enrolled in the\n      study if they meet all inclusion criteria.  They will be evaluated at baseline and at\n      screening, day 1, and weeks 1, 2, 4 and 8."
