It is well recognized\n           that with an unripe cervix, induction may be difficult and often unsuccessful. The use\n           of an agent to ripen the cervix prior to induction is acceptable in the modern\n           practice.\n\n        -  Misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 analogue, is the most interesting alternative to\n           Dinoprostone because of its effectiveness, low cost, and temperature stability. It\n           ripens the cervix by inducing regular uterine contractions. However, it is associated\n           with several adverse effects especially uterine hyperstimulation, which is painful and\n           may result in fetal compromise.\n\n        -  Testing the efficacy and safety of titrated oral misoprostol versus vaginal\n           dinoprostone may develop a new safe and effective method for labor induction."
