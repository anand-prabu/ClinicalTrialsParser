Eligible participants of this study will be randomly selected to the\n      intervention group or the delayed-intervention group (control group) after an initial health\n      screening for eligibility.\n\n      Participants selected to the intervention group will attend weekly healthy lifestyle\n      education sessions with their parent(s)/guardian(s) and three physical activity sessions /\n      week with other youth. After which, participants will attend monthly booster group meetings\n      for three months.\n\n      All participants will be assessed at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months for insulin\n      sensitivity, glucose tolerance, quality of life, fitness, and nutrition and physical\n      activity behaviors."
