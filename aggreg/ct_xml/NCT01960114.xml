    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen ER 1500 mg
      (two 750 mg tablets) over 10 to 12 hours in the dental pain model following third molar
      extraction(s) and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen ER 1500 mg (two 750 mg
      tablets) in a sub-group of subjects.

    <description>Minutes until confirmed first perceptible pain relief are achieved.  Stopwatch is started after the subject takes the study medication.  The subject is instructed to stop the stopwatch when they first began to feel any pain relief.  The first perceptible pain relief is confirmed if the subject also stopped the second stopwatch indicating meaningful pain relief.</description>
