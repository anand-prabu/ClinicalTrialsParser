It is\n      proven that the amount of free radicals in the skin are increased by UV exposure.\n      Furthermore, it is known that melatonin is a potent antioxidant. It is hypothesized that\n      melatonin can be protective against the UV induced release of free radicals by acting as a\n      radical scavenger and thereby protect against UV-induced cellular damage."
