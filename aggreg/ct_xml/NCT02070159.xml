  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although prasugrel, recently available thienopyridine derivative, exhibits rapid and potent
      platelet inhibition, concerns of low on-treatment platelet reactivity have been suggested
      especially in East Asian ethnicities. The investigators compared the effect of lower loading
      dose of prasugrel with conventional loading dose of clopidogrel and prasugrel.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although clopidogrel together aspirin has been a backbone of anti-platelet therapy in
      coronary artery disease patients, clopidogrel has several limitations. It has delayed onset
      of peak concentration and pharmacodynamic inter-patient response variability resulting in
      high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HPR). Those demerits are known to be associated with
      adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

      Prasugrel has a more effective metabolism pathway than clopidogrel and exhibits more rapid
      and potent platelet inhibition. Recent guidelines recommend prasugrel as a first line
      antiplatelet agent or put precedence over clopidogrel for the patients with acute coronary
      syndrome. However, there have been concerns of different pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic
      response to prasugrel in East Asian ethnicities.

      In addition, lower loading dose of prasugrel exhibited more potent pharmacodynamic effect
      than clopidogrel 600 mg with comparable efficacy compared to conventional loading dose of
      prasugrel in healthy Korean subjects.

      The investigators compare the antiplatelet effect of lower loading dose of prasugrel 30 mg
      with conventional loading dose of clopidogrel 600 mg and prasugrel 60 mg in Korean coronary
      artery disease patients undergoing elective coronary angiography.

    <description>Percent inhibition is calculated using the following fomula: % inhibition = [(baseline reactivity unit - peak reactivity unit) / baseline reactivity unit] × 100.
Percent inhibition is measured at the time of peak platelet inhibition. The platelet reactivity was measured at 6 hours after study drug administration (after 2 hours for the prasugrel groups).</description>
