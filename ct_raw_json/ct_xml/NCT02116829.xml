  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the effects in humans of a moderate butter intake on
      risk markers of cardiovascular disease compared to a diet with the same amount of olive oil
      (refined and therefore without polyfenols).

      The primary parameters are total cholesterol, LDL- and HDL cholesterol and triglycerides.
      The secondary parameters are risk markers of diabetes type 2; plasma glucose and insuling as
      well as the inflammatory marker hs-CRP.
