  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research evaluates the use of online versions of delivering an effective psychological
      treatment for children clinically referred for serious oppositional, aggressive, and
      antisocial behavior. The goal is to develop models of delivery that reach families in need
      that are not being served by in-person treatment. The project has immediate implications for
      the treatment of children but more generally addresses several issues critical to treatments
      that are based on Internet, telepsychiatry, and related technologies.
