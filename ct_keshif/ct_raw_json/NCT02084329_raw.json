At Parkwood\n      hospital we have noticed that balance is improved when patients with mTBI wear a weighted\n      compression vest. This follow up pilot study looks at the immediate effects of weighted\n      compression vests on participants with altered balance after mTBI. Participants will be\n      recruited from the Ministry of Health Outpatient Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) Program wait\n      list. Then each participant will perform a series of balance and walking tests under 2\n      conditions : 1) wearing a weighted compression vest , 2) not wearing a weighted compression\n      vest. It will be randomized whether participants wear the vest on the first or second\n      testing day. Participants will also be asked how confident they are about their balance and\n      how anxious they felt performing the assessments after each testing session. We hypothesize\n      that the weighted compression vest will improve fatigue and anxiety immediately and 24 hours\n      after performing a complex task, and will improve static and dynamic balance, gait\n      variability, and walking speed in patients with mTBI, during the tasks."

Subjects attempt to maintain balance for 30 seconds in different set conditions involving their eyes open or closed, arms across chest, and feet together or in tandem stance. Tandem stance is when one foot's heel is in front of, and in contact with the other foot's toes. The amount of time the subject can maintain balance (up to 30 seconds) is recorded in the set condition. A subject is deemed as \"unable to maintain balance\" if, they step out of their set condition, or if the physiotherapist deems them to be swaying too much.",
