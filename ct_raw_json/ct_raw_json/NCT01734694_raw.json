Reports of\n      vancomycin induced kidney injury (a.k.a vancomycin induced nephrotoxicity or VIN), have\n      waxed and waned throughout the years for various reasons. Recently, VIN has reemerged as a\n      clinical concern. This may be due to various reasons, including new dosing recommendations\n      as well as an increased prevalence of risk factors associated with vancomycin induced\n      nephrotoxicity. This study aims to evaluate a strategy which attempts to reduce kidney\n      damage from vancomycin use."
