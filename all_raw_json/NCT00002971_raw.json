If at least 3 of 10 patients in the first\n      cohort have detectable levels of O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT), then a second\n      cohort of 10 patients receives O6-BG as above at dose level 2. Dose escalation continues\n      until at least 8 of 10 patients have undetectable AGT activity. At this point, 4 additional\n      patients are accrued. If at least 11 of 14 patients at this dose level have undetectable\n      levels of AGT, then this dose level constitutes the biologic modulatory dose of O6-BG. If\n      less than 11 of 14 patients have undetectable levels of AGT, then 10 additional patients are\n      treated at a higher dose. If at any time 3 or more patients at a dose level have detectable\n      AGT activity, accrual is stopped at that dose level and patients are treated at the next\n      higher dose level. (Part I closed to accrual effective 7/10/2000)\n\n      Part II: An additional cohort of 14 patients receives O6-BG at dose level 5 beginning 18\n      hours prior to surgery.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Part I of this study closed to accrual effective 7/10/2000. A total of 14\n      patients will be accrued for part II of this study at a rate of 3 patients per month."
