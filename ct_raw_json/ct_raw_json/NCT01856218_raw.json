Females\n             considered not of childbearing potential include those who have had tubal ligation at\n             least one year prior to Screening, or who have had total hysterectomy.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Has undergone a successful bone marrow or stem cell transplant or has any degree of\n             detectable chimaerism with donor cells.\n\n          -  Any known hypersensitivity to rhGUS or its excipients that, in the judgment of the\n             Investigator, places the subject at increased risk for adverse effects.\n\n          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding at Screening or planning to become pregnant (self or\n             partner) at any time during the study.\n\n          -  Use of any investigational product (drug or device or combination) within 30 days\n             prior to Screening, or requirement for any investigational agent prior to completion\n             of all scheduled study assessments at any time during the study.\n\n          -  Has a condition of such severity and acuity, in the opinion of the Investigator, that\n             it warrants immediate surgical intervention or other treatment or may not allow safe\n             study participation.\n\n          -  Has a concurrent disease or condition that, in the view of the Investigator, places\n             the subject at high risk of poor treatment compliance or of not completing the study,\n             or would interfere with study participation or affect safety."
