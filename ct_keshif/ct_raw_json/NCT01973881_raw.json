Quantitative MRI parameters for diffusion of water and/or fat content in bone marrow will determine extent of disease in patients with myelofibrosis, and changes in these parameters will predict response to therapy. To investigate this hypothesis, the researchers will perform this pilot clinical study of diffusion and fat content (T1 weighted imaging) in patients before and during treatment for myelofibrosis. The researchers expect to identify MRI parameters that determine the extent and severity of bone marrow disease in these patients and determine response to therapy at earlier time points than currently used clinical parameters."
