This prospective cohort study seeks to\n      recruit young women close to time of cancer diagnosis and treatment.  Participants will\n      answer a yearly questionnaire on their current health.  A subset of participants will\n      provide dried blood spots to measure reproductive hormones. The primary goal of the study is\n      to determine the risk of infertility and time to pregnancy in young female cancer survivors."
