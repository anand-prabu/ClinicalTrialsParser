  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project will evaluate two methods of implementation of the new Physical
      Activity Guidelines (PAGs) for Adults with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) living in two Ontario
      communities.  The investigators will also determine if following the PAGs will improve
      aspects of fitness, function, quality of life and risk for cardiometabolic disease in this
      population.  The investigators hypothesize that adherence to the PAGs will be higher in
      people who have been referred directly to a community-based exercise program, and that this
      greater adherence to physical activity will be associated with greater improvements in
      fitness, function and quality of life.

      This randomized controlled trial will provide important information on how best to implement
      physical activity recommendations within the community setting; this information will be
      translated to key stakeholders during the final stages of the project.
