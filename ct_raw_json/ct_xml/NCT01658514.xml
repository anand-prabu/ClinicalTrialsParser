  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate how a single dose delayed-release metformin behaves in subjects
      with normal kidney function, mild kidney dysfunction, moderate kidney dysfunction, and
      severe kidney dysfunction. The safety and tolerability of delayed-release metformin will
      also be examined.

      In addition, this study will compare the behavior of a single dose of delayed-release
      metformin with that of extended-release metformin and placebo in subjects with the varying
      levels of kidney function described above.
