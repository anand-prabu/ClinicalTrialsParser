  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to develop, carry out, evaluate and measure the effects of a new
      patient education program for patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS)in primary
      healthcare.

      In an randomized controlled trial design the effects of the patient education program on
      coping, physical functioning, fatigue, pain, acceptance, anxiety, depression, quality of
      life, self- efficacy, and illness perception will be compared with treatment as usual.

      The results of the main project will lead to the elaboration of the final patient education
      program that can be implemented in primary health care, as well as development of a training
      program for future program-conductors.

      The project is a single blind randomized controlled trial. A total of 150 participants will
      be included in this study and randomly allocated to the intervention- or the control group.
      The 75 participants in the intervention group will be allocated to 6 groups. The control
      group will be offered to take part in the patient education program as soon as they have
      completed the last outcome evaluations.
