  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Feasibility study of using a digital health feedback system (DHFS) to monitor
      medication-taking and physiologic and behavioral parameters in patients with bipolar
      disorder or schizophrenia.  Hypothesis: Using a digital health feedback system to
      characterize medication-taking behavior and activities of daily living is safe and tolerable
      in appropriately selected patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

    <description>Comparison of the detection rate of sensor-enabled placebo tablet ingestion using wireless observation (wirelessly observed therapy) to directly observed ingestion.  Positive detection accuracy (PDA) for wirelessly observed therapy defined as the number of sensor ingestions detected by wireless observation, divided by the number confirmed ingestions using direct observation.  PDA summarized as mean and 95% confidence interval.</description>

    <description>Characterize, using summary (descriptive) statistics, medication-taking behavior in free-living environment.  Taking adherence defined as the number of ingestion sensors detected by the DHFS in the free-living environment, divided by the prescribed (planned) number of ingestions.  Scheduling adherence defined as number of ingestion sensors detected by the DHFS within a ± 2-hour time window around the prescribed (planned) dosing time, divided by the total number of ingestion sensors detected by the DHFS.</description>
