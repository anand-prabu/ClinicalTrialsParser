Adolescent participants will\n      have three study sessions at McLean Hospital, and during two of them, their mothers will\n      also have assessments. Adolescent assessments will include interviews, questionnaires,\n      computer tasks, and collection of a saliva sample for genetic analyses. Their second study\n      visit will include an fMRI scan. Parent assessments will include an interview,\n      questionnaires, and a computer task."
