            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES:\n\n      Increase the remission induction rate to greater than 85% in children with untreated acute\n      myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) by replacing daunorubicin\n      (DNR) with idarubicin (IDA) in intensively timed DCTER chemotherapy (dexamethasone,\n      cytarabine (ARA-C), thioguanine, etoposide, and daunorubicin) in the first 4 days of each\n      course.\n\n      Increase the remission rate further by comparing the efficacy of consolidation chemotherapy\n      with intensively timed IDA DCTER/DCTER vs fludarabine (FAMP), ARA-C, and IDA in maintaining\n      remission and in achieving remission in patients with M2 disease (5%-29% blasts in marrow)\n      at the end of induction chemotherapy.\n\n      Compare overall survival, event-free survival, and disease-free survival in patients who\n      receive consolidation with IDA DCTER/DCTER vs FAMP, ARA-C, and IDA.\n\n      Compare overall survival, event-free survival, and disease-free survival in patients\n      receiving intensification with the Capizzi II regimen (high-dose ARA-C and asparaginase) vs\n      those receiving a matched-related allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.\n\n      Compare overall survival, event-free survival, and disease-free survival in patients treated\n      with interleukin-2 (IL-2) vs standard follow up care after Capizzi II intensification.\n\n      Determine whether multichannel flow cytometry detection of residual AML on a companion\n      biologic study protocol CCG-B942 predicts outcome, and determine whether any of these\n      treatment regimens eliminates minimal residual disease more effectively than another.\n\n      Register all patients with MDS treated or followed at CCG institutions and capture their\n      biologic, historical and outcome data.\n\n      Determine, on a companion biologic study protocol CCG-B972, whether levels of IL-2 soluble\n      receptor (sIL-2R) and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) before, during, and after therapy\n      correlates with outcome.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to\n      center, diagnosis (acute myelogenous leukemia vs other), and response to induction (partial\n      vs complete remission). After induction, patients with M1/M2 marrow are randomized to arm I\n      or II. Patients in complete remission after consolidation who have an HLA-identical or\n      1-antigen mismatched sibling or parent donor are randomly assigned to the allogeneic bone\n      marrow transplantation (AlBMT) regimen; all others in complete remission are nonrandomly\n      assigned to the Capizzi II regimen, then are randomly assigned to arms III or IV. Patients\n      with refractory anemia (RA) or RA with ringed sideroblasts with indolent disease may be\n      registered and followed. Other patients with myelodysplastic syndromes may receive 2961\n      chemotherapy or go directly to AlBMT. Patients with chloromas (granulocytic sarcomas)\n      receive optional radiotherapy on arm V.\n\n      Induction: Patients receive idarubicin IV over 30 minutes on days 0-3, cytarabine and\n      etoposide IV continuously on days 0-3, and oral thioguanine twice a day and oral\n      dexamethasone 3 times a day on days 0-3. Patients then begin course 2, which consists of\n      cytarabine, etoposide, thioguanine, and dexamethasone on days 10-13, daunorubicin IV\n      continuously on days 10-13, and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) beginning on day 16\n      and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients also receive CNS prophylaxis/therapy\n      consisting of cytarabine intrathecally (IT) on days 0 and 14 (if no CNS disease at entry) or\n      on days 0, 5, and 7 (if CNS disease present at entry). Disease is reassessed on day 28-42.\n      Patients with M1 or M2 marrow proceed to consolidation while those with M3 marrow or\n      progressive disease go off study.\n\n      Consolidation:\n\n      Arm I: Patients receive treatment as in induction therapy, plus G-CSF SC beginning on day 16\n      and continuing until blood counts recover. If CSF is clear by day 10 of induction, patients\n      receive cytarabine IT on days 0, 10, and 35. If CSF is not clear, patients receive triple\n      intrathecal therapy (TIT; cytarabine, hydrocortisone, methotrexate) on days 0 and 10.\n\n      Arm II: Patients receive fludarabine IV over 24 hours on days 0 and 1, cytarabine IV over 72\n      hours on days 2-4, and idarubicin IV over 15 minutes on days 0-2. G-CSF begins on day 6 and\n      continues until blood counts recover. Patients also receive TIT on days -1 and 7, if CSF is\n      not clear on day 10 of induction. Patients on both arms are reassessed on day 35. Those\n      patients with M1 marrow proceed to intensification; all others are removed from the study.\n\n      Intensification:\n\n      Capizzi II regimen: Course 1: Patients receive cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours on\n      days 0, 1, 7, and 8 and asparaginase IM on days 1 and 8. Course 2: Patients also receive\n      cytarabine IT or TIT on days 0, 7, and 14.AlBMT regimen: Therapy begins within 2-8 weeks of\n      hematologic recovery. Patients may receive interim therapy consisting of oral thioguanine\n      for about 2 weeks. Patients then receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -9 to -6 and\n      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -5 to -2. AlBMT is infused over 4 hours beginning\n      36-48 hours after the last dose of cyclophosphamide. Patients in complete remission after\n      completing the Capizzi II regimen proceed to maintenance therapy on arm III.\n\n      Arm III: Patients receive interleukin-2 IV continuously on days 1-4 and 9-18.\n\n      Arm IV: No further treatment.\n\n      Arm V: Patients undergo radiotherapy to the chloroma 5 days a week for 2 weeks.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 18 months, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6\n      months until 5 years from diagnosis.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 880 patients with de novo acute myelogenous leukemia will\n      be accrued for this study within 4 years.  It is expected that 178 patients per year will be\n      randomly assigned for consolidation, that 39 patients per year will undergo allogeneic bone\n      marrow transplantation while 120 patients per year will receive chemotherapy as\n      intensification, and that 102 patients per year will be randomly assigned for\n      polychemotherapy immunomodulation. An additional 80 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes\n      will be accrued for this study."
