    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate dose escalation of melatonin in pediatric oncology patients with
      relapsed solid tumors.  The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of melatonin at
      a dose up to 20 mg daily, as well as to determine the maximum tolerated dose of melatonin.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be able to take medication by mouth either by swallowing, chewing or
             sublingual routes.

          -  Patients must have a documented life expectancy of ≥ 8 weeks.

          -  Patients must have histologic or radiographic evidence of a relapsed malignant solid
             tumor.  Intrinsic brain stem tumors or optic pathway gliomas may be diagnosed by
             clinical and radiologic methods.

          -  Patient, parent, legal representative and/or guardian must  sign a written informed
             consent. Assent, when appropriate, will be  obtained according to institutional
             guidelines.

          -  Minimum Weight Requirements: Dose level 1 - 22.2kg, Dose level 2 - 11.1kg, Dose level
             3 - 5.6kg

          -  Patients must be taking a stable dose (with no additions, modifications or deletions)
             of chemotherapy started ≥ 14 days prior study enrollment.

          -  Prescribed Chemotherapy drug(s) must not be known to interact with melatonin

          -  Adequate Bone Marrow Function Defined as:

               1. Patients with solid tumors without bone marrow involvement:

                    -  Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1 x109/L

                    -  Platelet count ≥ 50 X 109/L  (transfusion independent, defined as not
                       receiving platelet transfusions within a 7 day period prior to enrollment)

                    -  Hemoglobin ≥ 80 g/L (may receive RBC transfusions)

               2. Patients with known bone marrow metastatic disease are eligible for study but
                  not evaluable for hematologic toxicity.

                    -  Must not be known to be refractory to red cell or platelet transfusions.

                    -  These patients do not need to meet the bone marrow function requirements,
                       as hematological toxicity will not be measured due to metastatic disease.

          -  Adequate Liver Function Defined as:

               -  Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age.

               -  ALT ≤ 1.5 x ULN for age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chemotherapy: Melatonin inhibits the action of doxorubicin

          -  Growth factors that support white cell number administered ≤ 7 days prior to
             enrollment.

          -  Patients requiring corticosteroids who are not on a stable or decreasing dose of
             corticosteroid for ≥ 14 days.

          -  Patients prescribed immunosuppressant therapy that is not specifically utilized for
             chemotherapy purposes.  Patient prescribed: Cyclosporine, Mycophenolate  Mofetil HCL,
             Tacrolimus, Sirolimus and Azathioprine should be excluded

          -  Patients prescribed anti-coagulation therapy (Warfarin, Low Molecular Weight Heparin
             (LMWH), or System Heparin Therapy)

          -  Concomitant medications that are known CYP1A2 inhibitors interact with Melatonin.

          -  Patients prescribed megace, corticosteroids and periactin started ≤ 14 days prior to
             study enrollment.

          -  Patients taking the following medications:  benzodiazepines, nifedipine, NSAID's, ASA
             and/or Beta Blockers

          -  Patients ≤ 7 days post-operative from any surgical procedure.

          -  Patients with any signs of active post-operative bleeding.

          -  Patients with an infection that is not responding to anti-microbial therapy.

          -  Any condition that would negatively impact effective gut absorption and/or swallowing
             of study medication.

          -  Patients in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with study
             protocol requirements

          -  Patients already receiving melatonin are excluded from the study.

          -  Allergies to the medicinal and/or non-medicinal ingredients of melatonin which
             include: Melatonin, Calcium Salicate, Croscarmellose Sodium, IsoMalt, Magnesium
             Stearate, Microcrystalline Cellulose.

          -  As melatonin can cause fatigue, patients taking melatonin should refrain from driving
             or operating machinery within 5 hours of taking the melatonin.
