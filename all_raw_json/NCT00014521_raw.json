Patients are stratified according to\n      use of anticonvulsants known to be metabolized by the P450 hepatic enzyme complex (yes vs\n      no).\n\n      Patients receive karenitecin IV over 60 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days\n      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of karenitecin according to the continual\n      reassessment method until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined\n      as the dose associated with a dose-limiting toxicity rate of 33%.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
