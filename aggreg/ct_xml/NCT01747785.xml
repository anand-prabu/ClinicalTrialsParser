  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to study how well the heart contracts and relaxes during exercise.
      In addition to traditional measures of heart function, we will use a new computer program
      that may improve understanding of why people feel shortness of breath or fatigue.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Myocardial deformation</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout single visit (less than 1 hour) for healthy controls;  1 hour sessions before and after exercise training (3 months apart) for patients at risk of heart failure.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Myocardial deformation imaging (e.g. strain, strain rate, torsion) requires clear 2-dimensional echocardiography images that will be obtain at rest and during mild and moderate intensity exercise.  Images will be captured during 6-10 minute bouts of exercise on a tilting exercise table.  Comparisons will be made on resting and exercise values between groups. Our hypothesis is that strain rate will not increase in patients at risk of heart failure demonstrating lack of cardiovascular reserve.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke volume</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout each testing session</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Stroke volume can be measured by combined Doppler and 2-dimensional echocardiography. A surrogate measure of stroke volume (oxygen-pulse) can also be obtained during cardiopulmonary exercise testing by dividing the measured oxygen consumption by the heart rate.  Our hypothesis is that stroke volume will plateau early after exercise onset in patients at risk of heart failure and this plateau will correlate with a reduction in strain rate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physiological adaptation to clinical exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after cardiac rehabilitation completion (Patients with heart failure only); one session, lasting 1 hour, following 3 months of cardiac rehabilitation.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Aerobic exercise training has been shown to improve hemodynamics and quality of life in patients at risk of heart failure.  Our hypothesis is that the improvement in aerobic capacity following cardiac rehabilitation will correlate with an improvement in myocardial deformation imaging, specifically strain rate.</description>
