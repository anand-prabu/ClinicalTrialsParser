Endoscopic treatments of\n      achalasia can be provided in the form of dilatation of the LES or cutting of muscle fibers\n      (myotomy) of the esophagus and of the LES under endoscopic viewing.  Dilatation in this\n      trial is accomplished with rigiflex balloons and myotomy via Per Oral Endoscopic Myotomy\n      (POEM).  The effectiveness of treatment of achalasia using each method will be compared in\n      this trial."
