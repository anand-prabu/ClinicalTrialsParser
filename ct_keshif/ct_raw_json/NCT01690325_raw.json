Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (this means patients were treated before the tumor was\n      removed by surgery) with a drug like trastuzumab (monoclonal antibody) which is target to\n      the Her2-protein is much more powerful than with chemotherapy alone because it is\n      normalizing the blood supply and improves tumor delivery of conventional chemotherapy like\n      docetaxel. The HER2 protein is only available in about 30 % of breast cancer types.\n      bevacizumab is another humanized monoclonal antibody like trastuzumab but is effective not\n      only in patients with an positive HER2 status and in combination with trastuzumab it may\n      emphasize the effect in reduction of tumor growth. Bevacizumab is approved in advanced\n      disease, but no major neoadjuvant data available so far for primary breast cancer. As the\n      therapy with monoclonal antibody regimes are expensive and may cause severe side effects\n      predictive factors to select patients who will benefit from such highly specific drugs\n      before therapy start would be medically and economically highly valuable. In this study the\n      efficacy of combined neoadjuvant chemotherapy with bevacizumab, trastuzumab and docetaxel in\n      Arm A and bevacizumab and docetaxel in Arm B should be evaluated and the predictive impact\n      of different imaging methods for tumor response should be shown."
