  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the safety and tolerability of
      ABT-199 in combination with rituximab in up to 50 subjects with Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic
      Leukemia and Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma. The primary objectives of this study are to assess
      the safety profile, to determine the maximum tolerated dose and establish the Recommended
      Phase Two Dose of ABT-199 when administered in combination with rituximab. The dose
      escalation portion of the study will include approximately 30 subjects.  Once the
      recommended phase two dose and schedule have been determined, up to 20 additional subjects
      will be enrolled in an expanded safety portion of the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess the safety profile, to determine the maximum tolerated dose and Recommended Phase Two Dose of ABT-199 when administered in combination with rituximab (R) in subjects with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma.</measure>
    <time_frame>Continuous dosing with study drug at the designated cohort dose level up to Month 6. At the end of combination treatment, ABT-199 monotherapy may continue for up to 2 years following the date of the last subject enrolled.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Protocol-defined events, which are attributed as having a reasonable possibility of being related to the administration of ABT-199 and/or rituximab, or can not be attributed by the investigator to a clearly identifiable cause such as tumor progression, concurrent illness, underlying disease or concomitant medication, will be considered a dose limiting toxicity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess the exploratory efficacy of the combination ABT-199 and rituximab.</measure>
    <time_frame>Tumor Assessments will be performed at: Screening,  Month 1 Day 1, Month 3 Day 1 and Month 7 Day 1 , every 12 weeks thereafter, and at least 2 months after Partial Remission, Complete Remission or Complete Remission with incomplete bone marrow recovery</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determination of peak concentration (Cmax), trough concentration (Ctrough) and/or area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) of ABT-199 and/or Rituximab.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Month 6 for ABT-199 and Rituximab.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Blood samples for analysis of ABT-199 and rituximab will be collected at designated time points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Assess the exploratory pharmacodynamics and pharmacogenetics of the combination of ABT-199 and rituximab.</measure>
    <time_frame>MRD Assessments will be performed at following timepoints: At least 2 months after CR/CRi criteria for tumor response first met, every 12 weeks thereafter until MRD negativity is achieved, and as needed.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Minimal residual disease (MRD) will be assessed in the peripheral blood and bone marrow (BM) either by flow cytometry or real-time PCR.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be greater then or equal to 18 years of age.

          -  Subject must have relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic
             Lymphoma.

          -  Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of less than or
             equal to 1.

          -  Subject must have adequate bone marrow independent of growth factor support per local
             laboratory reference range at Screening.

          -  Subject must have adequate coagulation, renal, and hepatic function, per laboratory
             reference range at Screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma subject has undergone an
