Nail (approx. 1 g) and blood\n      (5 mL)  samples will be collected both before and completion of the study to see the\n      efficacy and safety of the drug. Clinical examinations will be done at regular interval (two\n      weeks). Clinical features and adverse effects will be recorded using a structured data\n      collection sheet. Plasma cholesterol, vitamin E, and total antioxidant, serum transaminase,\n      billirubin, creatinine levels and arsenic level in nail will be measured to evaluate the\n      effectiveness of N. sativa on palmer arsenical keratosis patients"
