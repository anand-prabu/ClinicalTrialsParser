    <textblock>
      While baseline weakness is clearly an important factor that contributes to disability post
      stroke, neuromuscular fatigue (the acute reduction in force production) of the paretic
      musculature likely compounds strength deficits and further exacerbates disability. The
      proposed study aims to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of neuromuscular fatigue
      in people post stroke in order to optimize strength training. In healthy individuals, both
      central (neural) and peripheral (muscle) factors are determinants of neuromuscular fatigue,
      but preliminary data from our laboratory suggests a greater contribution of central
      components to neuromuscular fatigue in the paretic musculature. Although cortical pathways
      are clearly disrupted post stroke, it is likely that brainstem pathways, known to have
      neuromodulatory effects on spinal motor circuitry, are more involved in the sustaining of
      force in the paretic leg, compared to the non-paretic and control legs. Therefore, the
      purpose of this proposal is to examine the role of descending neuromodulatory pathways of
      the brainstem in neuromuscular fatigue post stroke (Aim 1) and to correlate
      brainstem-related changes in neuromuscular fatigue to walking function (Aim 2). The
      investigators propose that stroke survivors' decreased capability to sustain force overtime
      results from the diminished ability of spinal motoneurons to respond to brainstem
      neuromodulatory inputs (serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE)). Aim 1 will quantify
      stroke-related decreases in motor output sensitivity to a 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibitor
      (SNRI), serotonin antagonist, or placebo during sub-maximal intermittent fatiguing knee
      extension contractions. If motoneurons are desensitized to descending monoamines in chronic
      stroke patients, then they will be less sensitive to the effects of drugs that increase
      monoamine levels. The investigators predict that in response to the SNRI or serotonin
      antagonist, the paretic leg will show less change in time to task failure and a smaller
      reduction in strength as compared to the non-paretic and control legs. For Aim 2, the
      investigators predict that stroke subjects with the highest walking function will
      demonstrate the greatest fatigue-related changes in response to the SNRI.  This proposal
      adopts an innovative model of motor impairment post stroke by including the role of
      subcortical structures in neuromuscular fatigue.
