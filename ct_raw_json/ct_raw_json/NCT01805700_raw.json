A different study drink will be\n      administered during each phase. There will be an initial screening visit and a pre- study\n      visit before each study phase.  Each participant will make 10 visits to the research centre.\n\n      There will be a week wash out period between each study phase. Prior to each study phase,\n      there will be a 3 day caffeine and alcohol abstinence run-in period.\n\n      Study drinks will be matched for taste and volume (as far as possible) and will be\n      administered by the use of opaque cups, lids and straws to enable double-blind randomisation\n      for both researcher and participants.  Administration of the study drink to participants\n      will be based on Latin squares to provide a balanced treatment order.\n\n      During the 3 days study period; participants will be required to abstain from all other\n      caffeine containing beverages or confectioneries.\n\n      The secondary aim is to determine if tolerance to cardiovascular effects of\n      caffeine-enhanced energy drinks is developed following acute short term ingestion."
