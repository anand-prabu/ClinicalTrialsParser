      Background:

      - Normal bacteria and other tiny organisms are found in healthy human mouths. These are
      called oral microbiota. It is unclear exactly how the oral microbiota may affect health. For
      example, if the microbial composition is abnormal, it may lead to mouth conditions like
      periodontitis. Researchers want to study how the microbiota changes over time. This can help
      them plan future disease studies.

      Objectives:

      - To see if and how oral microbiota change over time.

      Eligibility:

      - Forty adult employees of the National Cancer Institute Shady Grove.

      Design:

        -  For 12 hours before the first visit, participants will not eat or drink (except water).
           They will not brush, floss, use mouthwash, chew gum, eat lozenges or candies, smoke
           cigarettes, or chew tobacco.

        -  At the first visit, participants will:

        -  Be given a saliva collector. They will spit 2 mL of saliva into it.

        -  Fill out an online questionnaire.

        -  Every 2 months, participants will visit the clinic and repeat visit 1.

        -  The study ends after 1 year.

    <textblock>
      The Human Microbiome Project (HMP), started in 2008, aimed to characterize the microbial
      communities on the skin, in the oral and nasal cavities, and in the gastrointestinal and
      urogenital tracts. This project cross-sectionally described the microbial communities in a
      healthy human population, but did not adequately describe longitudinal stability. Out of the
      236 adults included in the HMP, a second saliva sample was collected on a small subset
      (N=74) with a long interval between collections, an average of 203 days.    Community
      similarity    was calculated between two visits; for saliva samples, the Spearman
      correlation was high (rs=0.8). However, it was unclear which metric of    community
      similarly    was being used for this calculation. When we obtained the HMP data and
      calculated the Spearman correlation for specific    diversity metrics in the saliva samples,
      the correlations were weaker and ranged from 0.225 to 0.524 for the Shannon Index and PD
      tree, respectively. Other studies with fewer people, but more time points, have had
      conflicting conclusions on the temporal variation of the oral microbiome. Given this
      variability, it is vital to establish whether a single measurement is representative of the
        typical    composition of microbiota in a specific body site using more than two time
      points.

      In epidemiological studies, it is often impractical, if not impossible, to collect
      biological samples or measurements multiple times for each participant during the study
      period. However, when a biological sample or a measurement is taken only once, there is
      concern that the single assessment is not representative of the    typical    value. For
      example, serum 25(OH)D levels, which are used to assess an individual   s vitamin D
      exposure, have seasonal fluctuations, but studies have established that a single measurement
      is sufficiently reliable to represent typical exposure. The correlation between samples over
      time is also used to create more accurate power calculations for future studies.

      Since previous work has not adequately addressed temporal variation in the oral microbiome,
      we propose to: 1) establish a cohort of 40 adults willing to provide oral samples
      approximately every two months for one year; 2) process all oral samples and evaluate the
      presence and quantity of microbiota using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing; 3) calculate
      appropriate reliability measures for the sample over time using the intra-class correlation
      coefficient (ICC) for    and  &lt;= diversity metrics; and 4) empirically evaluate the
      efficiency of different longitudinal designs including two or more sample collections with
      an outcome such as body mass index (BMI). Because of the complexity and high prevalence of
      human DNA in saliva, metagenomic analyses of oral samples are not yet feasible, however, the
      samples obtained from this study will be available for use in future metagenomic analyses
      when the technology is operationalized. The current study is essential to establish the
      reliability of a single measure of the oral microbiome to determine appropriate sample sizes
      for future cohort studies considering the effect of the oral microbiome on the risk of
      cancer and other health outcomes.
