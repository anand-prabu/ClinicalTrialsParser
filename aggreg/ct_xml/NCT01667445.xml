  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the contribution of spinal epimorph to patient's
      perioperative pain management in Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA). This study is designed to
      determine whether spinal epimorph and its associated complications is a necessary addition
      to provide adequate analgesia given the multimodal approach to pain management. It is
      hypothesized that perioperative local infiltration with a cocktail of local and systemic
      analgesics will provide equal analgesia to patients who are given both local infiltration
      and spinal epimorph perioperatively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized control trial comparing two patient populations obtained from
      patients who will receive a primary total knee arthroplasty at LHSC University Campus.
      Patient participants will be recruited and consented from the arthroplasty clinic and from
      the preadmit clinic at University Hospital. Both the patients and those measuring the
      primary outcome, namely, visual pain scales will be blinded to the experimental treatment
      received.

      Patients will be randomized to receive either a spinal with epimorph (150ug) or a spinal
      with no epimorph at the time of their total hip arthroplasty. This is determined as a result
      of a computer generated randomization within blocks of 10 (every 10 patients there will be
      an even number of patients within each group). As each patient signs up they are given a
      consecutive study number which will determine which group they are assigned to. Note should
      be made that at the current time patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty may or may not
      receive epimorph preoperatively depending on their anaesthesiologist (personal communication
      with Sue Ganapathy) and so both treatment arms represent the current standard of care at
      LHSC. Again, spinal epimorph is currently being administered for total joint replacement,
      irregardless of whether or not this study is being done. It is an acceptable standard of
      care analgesic that is available to each anesthetist should they choose to use it. Many
      choose to use it as they feel it improves analgesia in patients undergoing total joint
      arthroplasty, which are recognized as very painful procedures (especially total knees). This
      is no different that one anesthetist preferring to use dilaudid for pain control and another
      choosing to use morphine. Both are within accepted standard of care guidelines and it is up
      to the individual staff to utilize the drug they feel is most beneficial. This decision is
      based on each individual consultant's interpretation of the available literature as well as
      their personal practice experience. I hope this justifies our study as we are not
      introducing any new treatment. Patients will receive spinal epimorph whether or not we
      conduct this study. As such, no formal study discontinuation rules are applicable. Both
      patient groups will receive medical treatment as required around the time of their
      procedure.

      Both groups of patients will receive standardized preoperative analgesia including
      gabapentin (600mg), acetaminophen (975 mg) and naprosyn (500mg). Both groups will receive
      local anaesthesia in the form of local infiltration of the wound with a previously studied
      cocktail of morphine, ketoralac, epinephrine and ropivicaine. (3) Post operatively patients
      will remain on PCA until post operative day one and then will be changed to a standardized
      oral protocol including long and short acting narcotics on a PRN basis, acetaminophen (975
      mg Q6h x 48hrs and then on a PRN basis), naproxyn (500mg BID x 7 days) and gabapentin (300mg
      BID x 7 days).

      Postoperatively visual analogue pain scales will be recorded at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48hrs
      as well as at 1 week.  Foley usage, oxygen usage, nausea/vomiting and use of antiemetics and
      antipruritics will also be carefully documented. Both patient groups will receive the
      standard post operative physiotherapy and will be discharged home with a prescription for
      the narcotic or analgesics that were providing them with suitable analgesia during their
      hospital stay.
