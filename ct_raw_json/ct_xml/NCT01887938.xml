    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect long-term safety data in patients with metachromatic
      leukodystrophy (MLD) who are receiving HGT-1110 and have participated in Study HGT-MLD-070
      through Week 40.

    <textblock>
      Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is an inherited, autosomal recessive disorder of lipid
      metabolism characterized by deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme, arylsulfatase A
      (ASA). MLD is a rare disease that occurs in most parts of the world. The estimated overall
      incidence of the disease in the western world is approximately 1 in 100,000 live births that
      varies by geographic location. There are no approved therapies for MLD.

      This study is a multicenter open-label study designed to evaluate safety and efficacy
      outcomes of HGT-1110 administered intrathecally in children with MLD who have participated
      in the dose escalation study, HGT-MLD-070, through Week 40 and are receiving study drug
      every other week (EOW). In this study patients will receive HGT-1110 at the same dose as the
      cohort to which they were previously assigned in Study HGT-MLD-070 (10, 30, or 100 mg).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has participated through Week 40 in Study HGT-MLD-070.

          2. Patient must have no safety or medical issues that contraindicate participation.

          3. The patient, patient's parent or legally authorized representative(s) must provide
             written informed consent and/or assent (if applicable) prior to performing any study
             related activities.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient is unable to comply with the protocol (eg, is unable to return for safety
             evaluations, or is otherwise unlikely to complete the study) as determined by the
             Investigator.

          2. The patient has any known or suspected hypersensitivity to agents used for sedation
             or is thought to be at an unacceptably high risk for associated potential
             complications of airway compromise or other conditions.

          3. The patient is pregnant or breast feeding.

          4. The patient is enrolled in another clinical study that involves clinical
             investigations or use of any investigational product (drug or drug delivery device)
             other than those used in HGT-MLD-070 within 6 months prior to study enrollment or at
             any time during the study.
