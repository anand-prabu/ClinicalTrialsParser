  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      OBJECTIVE: The standard of care for high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 to
      3 (CIN 2-3) has been the excision of the cervical transformation zone by way of a loop
      electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) or cold knife conization (CKC). However, it has
      been recognized that these procedures can increase the risks for pre-term labor in women who
      still desire to conceive. Recent studies have shown that medical treatment with Imiquimod, a
      topical immune response modulator, has significant effects on histological regression of CIN
      2-3 when compared with placebo. The investigators propose that treatment with Imiquimod may
      be preferable offering similar outcomes on histological regression when compared with
      excision or ablation while potentially avoiding or reducing the number of surgical procedure
      that places them at risk for future pregnancies.

    <description>HPV clearance will be determined by pathology and HPV testing, followed by colposcopy.
Descriptive statistics will include numbers and rates of occurrence with confidence intervals of regression, pre and post-treatment HPV including Human Papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) and HPV 18/45 typing, and adverse effects.  A non-inferiority type design is used in which the difference between treatments is defined as medical treatment being preferable if the regression rate is not more than 10% below that of the excisional treatment.  Comparison of the regression rates of the two treatments will be made by a non-inferiority Fisher's exact test.</description>

    <description>Patients will be seen in dysplasia clinic at Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) every 4 weeks while in treatment to determine tolerability of the Imiquimod Arm.  Patients with significant symptoms will be asked to delay using Imiquimod until symptoms resolve before resuming.  Patients unable to complete at least 4 weeks of treatment (1 treatment per week), will be offered immediate LEEP or surveillance at the 6 month follow up.</description>

    <description>Patients will be provided a daily phone number to a qualified nurse regarding any symptoms experienced while on the Imiquimod arm of the study.  Patients will be instructed to  be evaluated in the Emergency Department after clinic hours if needed for up to 6 months after study initiation.</description>
