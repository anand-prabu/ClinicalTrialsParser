A direct correlation could exist between the number of such cells and their\n      available released growth factors. To test this assumption, this study was designed to\n      evaluate levels of bone morphogenetic protein-2 in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) during\n      the early stages of healing for sites treated by MPM compared to that of the occlusive\n      barrier membranes."
