A complete medical history, neurological and opthamological examination will be\n      performed, including measurements of vital signs (heart rate and blood pressure), as well as\n      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), EDSS, and Visual Evoked Response test (VER's) to document\n      status of disease.  A Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite Score (MSFC) consists of the\n      Timed 25 Foot Walk, Nine Hole Peg Test (9HPT), and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test 3\n      (PASAT3) will be performed at screen as well.  At months 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 the tests\n      and evaluations will include MRI, MSFC, VER's and blood tests of immune cells.  Other safety\n      evaluations (previously mentioned blood and urine tests) will be conducted according to the\n      date of treatment.  These tests include a laboratory test (methotrexate level) two days\n      following treatment, as well as routine lab tests 2 weeks following the methotrexate\n      treatment. This treatment would be under the supervision of Dr. Rowe.\n\n      The patients will continue their AVONEX\u00ae intramuscular injections of 30 micrograms\n      (administered by patient or caregiver) on a weekly basis.  The methylprednisolone treatment\n      and methotrexate infusion will be performed in our outpatient infusion center.  The patient\n      will be required to complete a patient diary during the course of the trial, participate in\n      and keep all scheduled appointments, and to inform the research staff and physician of any\n      change in concomitant medications or adverse events that they may experience."
