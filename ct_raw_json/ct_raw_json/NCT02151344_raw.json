Participants will remain in the isolation\n      unit for at least 9 days after receiving the vaccine, but possibly longer, depending on\n      their test results.\n\n      Participants in Cohorts 1 and 2 will return to the isolation unit 4 to 8 weeks after\n      receiving the first vaccine (at approximately Day 28). They will receive the second dose of\n      the H7N9 A/Anhui/13 ca influenza virus vaccine and repeat all of the same procedures that\n      occurred after the first vaccination.\n\n      Participants will then receive one dose of the inactivated subvirion H7N9 vaccine 1 month\n      (Cohort 1) or 2 months (Cohort 2) after receiving the second vaccine.\n\n      Participants in Cohorts 3 and 4 will receive the inactivated subvirion H7N9 vaccine either 1\n      month (Cohort 4) or 2 months (Cohort 3) after receiving one dose of the live attenuated\n      vaccine. For Cohorts 1-4, participants study visits will occur 7, 14, 28, and 90 days after\n      receiving the vaccine and will include a medical history review, physical examination, and\n      blood collection at select visits.\n\n      Participants in Cohort 5 will receive one dose of the inactivated subvirion H7N9 vaccine at\n      Day 0 and one dose at Day 28.
