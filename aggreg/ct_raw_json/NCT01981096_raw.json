The purpose of this study\n      is to evaluate whether CBT can be enhanced with specialized neuromuscular training, in the\n      new fibromyalgia integrative training (FIT Teens) intervention, to produce stronger pain\n      reduction than CBT alone.  Neuromuscular training originates from the field of pediatric\n      sports medicine and has been successfully used for injury prevention but has never before\n      been utilized for pain management in JFM. This type of training emphasizes education and\n      proper training in fundamental movement skills prior to the initiation of more vigorous\n      physical activity and exercise.  It is expected that the neuromuscular training integrated\n      with established CBT techniques will enhance patients' ability to engage in exercise and to\n      achieve better JFM pain control. Adolescents with JFM will be randomly assigned to receive\n      either the 8-week FIT Teens intervention or an 8-week CBT program with assessments at\n      baseline, post-treatment and 3-month follow-up."
