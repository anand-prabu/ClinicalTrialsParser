On Day 4, the\n      multiple dose phase will begin at the same dose level (5 mg, 10 mg, or 25 mg), with subjects\n      receiving OCA once daily for 14 days. PK, safety, and tolerability will be assessed for 2\n      weeks at the clinical site following the last investigational product (IP) dose on Day 17.\n      Subjects will be confined at the inpatient trial site from Day 0 until the morning of Day\n      30.
