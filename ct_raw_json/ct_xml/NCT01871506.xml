  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are currently over 11 million cancer survivors in the U.S. and survival rates are
      increasing. Unfortunately, 10% to 30% of cancer patients are current smokers at the time of
      cancer diagnosis, and many of these patients have elevated socioeconomic, medical, and
      psychosocial vulnerabilities. Documented risks associated with continued smoking following
      cancer diagnosis include decreased survival time; increased complications from surgery,
      radiation, and chemotherapy; and increased risk of second primary tumors. U.S. Department of
      Health &amp; Human Services Public Health Service evidence-based tobacco treatment guidelines
      exist but have not been integrated into the cancer care setting. This is a tremendous missed
      opportunity to address a modifiable risk factor. In recognition of this tobacco treatment
      gap, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) sponsored a conference in 2009 to address how to
      increase the readiness and capacity for delivery of tobacco treatment in Cancer Centers. The
      American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommends identification, advice, and
      counseling of all smokers by their second oncology visit as a core quality indicator;
      however, currently only half of cancer patients report being asked about tobacco use.

      Specific Aim: To conduct a randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial of two
      strategies to promote smoking cessation in suspected or newly diagnosed cancer patients.

      Study Design: A dual-site randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial will enroll
      295 current smokers with suspected or newly diagnosed thoracic, breast, genitourinary, or
      gastrointestinal cancer. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two strategies, an
      Intensive Treatment (IT) or a &quot;Standard of Care&quot; Treatment (ST). Both groups will be offered
      an initial motivational counseling session, delivered by a trained tobacco counselor, and 3
      weekly follow-up counseling sessions that will be provided in-person or by telephone. The IT
      group has the option to also receive:

        -  Smoking Cessation Medication: Up to a 12-week supply of FDA approved smoking cessation
           medication (varenicline or combination NRT) at no cost to the participant.

        -  Extended Counseling: An additional 4 biweekly and 3 monthly proactive counseling
           sessions with a tobacco treatment counselor (total of 11 counseling contacts).

      All participants will complete 1 baseline and 2 follow-up surveys, at 3 months and 6 months.
       Self-reported abstinence will be biochemically confirmed at 3 and 6 months.

      Specific Aims

      Aim 1: To compare the effectiveness of two tobacco treatments that are integrated into
      cancer care in producing tobacco abstinence at 6 months.

      Aim 2: To explore: a) mechanisms through which treatment promotes abstinence; b)
      subpopulations in which abstinence is promoted; and c) which aspects of treatment promote
      abstinence.

      Aim 3: To compare the incremental cost effectiveness (cost per quit) of two tobacco
      treatments.

      Exploratory Aim: To identify the percentage and associated characteristics of smokers who 1)
      enroll in tobacco treatment and 2) adhere to tobacco treatment.

          4. if they have been treated previously for other types of cancer, they are currently
             faced with a new form of cancer.]

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        In an effort to be as inclusive as possible, a patient will be excluded only if he/she:

          1. Is NOT currently receiving care at one of two participating cancer treatment centers:
             Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center; or the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
             Center.

        he/she may decide not to use any smoking cessation medication and still participate in the
        study.  Patients deemed ineligible will be referred to the state quit line.

        Patients interested in participating in the study should contact the appropriate contact
        person, based on whether they are a current patient at either MGH or MSKCC.
