  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chlorzoxazone is a centrally acting muscle relaxant used to treat muscle spasm and the
      resulting pain or discomfort. It acts on the spinal cord by depressing reflexes. Our purpose
      is to investigate the effect of chlorzoxazone on moderate to severe postoperative pain after
      spine surgery. Our hypothesis is that chlorzoxazone can reduce postoperative pain and reduce
      opioidconsumption and side effects compared to placebo.
