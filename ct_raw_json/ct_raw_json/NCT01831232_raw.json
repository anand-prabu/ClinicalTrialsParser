To determine the toxicity (death within 28 days of starting therapy = treatment related\n      mortality or \"TRM\") with IAP in newly-diagnosed AML.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To determine rates of complete remission (CR), remission with incomplete blood count\n      recovery (CRi), partial remission (PR), relapse-free survival and overall survival.\n\n      II. To identify biomarkers (ie. changes in serum cholesterol) associated with clinical\n      responses.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive pravastatin sodium orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-8, idarubicin\n      intravenously (IV) over 10-15 minutes on days 4-6, and cytarabine IV continuously on days\n      4-7.
