Prior to entry and randomization to the\n      study, each subject must have tumor Merlin status(high or low) established by\n      immunohistochemistry performed at a central laboratory. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1\n      ratio to receive oral VS-6063 400 mg twice per day, or matched placebo. Randomization will\n      be stratified by tumor Merlin status (high versus low). Progression will be assessed both\n      locally and by central review using the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors\n      (RECIST) Version 1.1. Subjects will continue to receive treatment until disease progression\n      or other discontinuation criteria are met. Following documentation of nonfatal disease\n      progression, all subjects will be followed for overall survival by telephone contact every 2\n      months until end of life or the close of the study."
