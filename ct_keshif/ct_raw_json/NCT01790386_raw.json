The purpose of the study is to validate the CORA system by\n      comparing the results of this test to that of the standard of care device called the TEG\n      system. Both systems evaluate hemostasis, a highly complex and interactive process involving\n      many protein and cellular elements, especially platelets, occurring in a series of\n      interrelated phases, which results in either normal hemostasis or a tendency toward bleeding\n      or clotting complications."

Reference ranges will be constructed following the guidelines specified\n      in CLSI Standard C28-A3c.\n\n      All blood samples drawn for this study will use venous blood. Whole blood is not used for\n      these studies; only citrated or heparinized samples are used.  All samples are repeated\n      twice (run in duplicate tests).  Quality Controls are run on both instruments at a frequency\n      specified by the manufacturers.  Results obtained from this testing are not used to make\n      treatment decisions."
