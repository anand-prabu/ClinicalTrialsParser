Systematic\n      screening for depression in high-risk patients is recommended to be included as a usual\n      practice but its effectiveness in this context remains controversial. In this study, 35\n      primary care physicians (PCPs) in Spain were assigned to intervention (receive one day\n      training in depression screening guidelines and use guidelines for six months) and 34 PCPs\n      were assigned to a control group (manage depression in the usual way for six months).  There\n      were a total of 525 patient participants with MDD."
