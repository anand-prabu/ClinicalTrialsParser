    <textblock>
      The study will enroll low risk MDS patients who need red blood cell transfusions and who are
      refractory to or are not using erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. The purpose of the study
      is to determine whether oral rigosertib treatment   results in hematological improvements
      according to the 2006 International Working Group criteria in these patients. The study will
      also record any side effects that may occur during the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase II, single-arm, multicenter study (approximately 15 centers). Up to 40
      transfusion-dependent patients with Low- or Int-1 risk MDS by IPSS will be enrolled and
      treated with 560 mg oral rigosertib BID taken intermittently (2 weeks on/1 week off
      regimen). Cycles will be 3 weeks in length.

      Enrollment will proceed as follows:

      In the first cohort, 6 patients will be enrolled initially. If no more than 1 drug-related
      Grade 3 toxicity (based on NCI CTCAE) is observed during the first 21-day cycle in the first
      6 enrolled patients, 4 additional patients will be enrolled to complete the first cohort. Up
      to 3 more successive cohorts of 10 patients each will be enrolled, provided there are at
      least 1 response in the first cohort (10 patients), 4 responses total in the first and
      second cohorts (20 patients), and 6 responses total in the first, second and third cohorts
      (30 patients).

      The study will be stopped if any one of these responses is not met.
