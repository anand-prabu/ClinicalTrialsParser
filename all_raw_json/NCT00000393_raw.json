The dysfunction of the CNS may be either a direct or an indirect\n      result of HIV infection. One method to prevent HIV infection is to block entry of the virus\n      into the cells of the body. Peptide T shows laboratory evidence of blocking the entrance of\n      HIV into cells that are susceptible to HIV infection. Studies that have been done indicate\n      that peptide T is nontoxic in the doses that are used in this study.\n\n      AIDS patients with minimal (group 1) or moderate (group 2) cognitive dysfunction (mental\n      impairment) receive an increasing schedule of three dosage levels of peptide T.  All\n      patients receive an intravenous (IV) dose of peptide T for 10 days followed by the\n      intermediate dose and then the highest dose, each intravenously for 10 days. Following\n      successful completion of 3 IV doses, four patients participate in an intranasal\n      pharmacokinetic (blood level study) dosage trial of 3 doses (different from IV) of peptide T\n      once for each of 3 successive days. Follow-up continues for up to 1 year."
