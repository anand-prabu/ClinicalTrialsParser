This implantation rate is lower when\n      compared to data from other observational studies. Retrospective studies have shown that\n      artificial shrinkage of the blastocoelic cavity (also called collapse) and dehydration of\n      the blastocyst just before vitrification can have a positive effect on the survival after\n      warming. This collapse can be induced by using a laser.  The study of Iwayama et al. 2010\n      has shown a similar survival rate but an increase in the implantation rate of collapsed\n      blastocysts compared to non-collapsed blastocysts.\n\n      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of artificial shrinkage by laser-induced\n      collapse on the implantation potential of vitrified-warmed day 5 or day 6 blastocyst stage\n      embryos in a prospective randomised controlled trial."
