Viral reactivation was associated with increased morbidity and\n      mortality in intensive care units. In clinical practice, they are searched at the onset of\n      organ failure or unexplained fever. The investigators wish to conduct this research in the\n      stroke patients to assess the predictive power of these viral reactivations on the duration\n      of mechanical ventilation."
