Determine the CSF and serum pharmacokinetics of\n      L-PAM administered via an Ommaya reservoir to these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive melphalan (L-PAM) intrathecally\n      (IT) via lumbar puncture or Ommaya reservoir twice a week for 2 weeks. Cohorts of 3-6\n      patients receive escalating doses of melphalan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is\n      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 4 of 6 patients\n      experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 3 patients receive L-PAM via Ommaya reservoir at\n      the MTD. Patients with objective or significant clinical response may receive additional\n      L-PAM IT once a week for 2 consecutive weeks, every other week for 2 doses, and then monthly\n      thereafter. Patients are followed every 12 weeks for 1 year or until disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 3 children and 3 adults per dose level will be accrued for\n      this study."
