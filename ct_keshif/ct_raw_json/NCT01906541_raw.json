X-CGD patients suffer from\n      recurrent and life-threatening infections and severe hyperinflammatory complications.\n\n      The only curative treatment for X-CGD is allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,\n      but this procedure implies severe risks and many patients lack an appropriate donor.\n      Therefore alternative curative approaches are urgently needed. In this study, patients will\n      be treated with gene-corrected autologous CD34+ cells, using a SIN gammaretroviral vector\n      for ex-vivo gene-therapy."
