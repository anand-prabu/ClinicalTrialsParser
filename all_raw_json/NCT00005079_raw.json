Beginning 24 hours prior to surgery and continuing until the onset of the next\n      menses, patients complete a menstrual cycle journal indicating the start and length of\n      menses.\n\n      Patients undergoing mastectomy are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1\n      year, and then annually thereafter. Patients undergoing adjuvant therapy are followed every\n      3 months for 3 years and then every 6 months thereafter or every 4 months for 2 years and\n      then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 400 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5\n      years."
