  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled study. About 200 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who
      underwent radical resection will be included. The patients will be randomized to group A
      (receive CIK treatment) or group B (just regularly follow up) without any anti-cancer
      treatment after resection of HCC, and the randomize ratio will be 1:1.

          -  Cirrhotic status of Child-Pugh class A only.

          -  The following laboratory parameters:

          -  Patients who give written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known Central Nervous System tumors including metastatic brain disease.

          -  Patients with clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding within 30 days prior
             to study entry.

          -  History of organ allograft.

          -  Known or suspected allergy to the investigational agent or any agent given in
             association with this trial.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding patients.

          -  Any condition that is unstable or which could jeopardize the safety of the patient
             and his/her compliance in the study.

          -  Excluded therapies and medications, previous and concomitant:

        Prior use of any anti-cancer treatment for HCC, eg. chemotherapy, radiotherapy. Antiviral
        treatment is allowed.
