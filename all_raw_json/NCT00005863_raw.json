Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the\n      number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's\n      immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. It is not yet known whether\n      combination chemotherapy with filgrastim and/or tretinoin is more effective than combination\n      chemotherapy alone for acute myeloid leukemia.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying combination chemotherapy with\n      filgrastim and/or tretinoin to see how well they work compared to combination chemotherapy\n      alone in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia."

Patients are stratified\n      according to type of disease (resistant vs refractory vs relapsed vs adverse cytogenetic),\n      age (under 15 vs 15 to 29, vs 30 to 49 vs 50-59 vs 60-69 vs 70 and over), performance\n      status, and de novo and secondary leukemia. Patients with relapsed disease are further\n      stratified according to duration of first remission (less than 6 months vs 6 to 12 months vs\n      12 months and over), and prior transplantation (yes vs no).\n\n      Patients are randomized into one of two treatment arms for induction chemotherapy.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive induction chemotherapy consisting of cytarabine IV every 12\n           hours on days 1-10, daunorubicin IV on days 1, 3, and 5 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on\n           days 1-5. Patients receive a second course of therapy with cytarabine IV every 12 hours\n           on days 1-8 and daunorubicin and etoposide as in course 1.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive 2 courses of induction chemotherapy consisting of fludarabine\n           IV over 30 minutes followed by cytarabine IV over 4 hours on days 1-5.\n\n      Patients are further randomized into one of two treatment arms for colony stimulating factor\n      therapy.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously or IV daily beginning on day\n           1 of each course of induction chemotherapy and continuing until blood counts recover,\n           for up to a maximum of 28 days.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive no G-CSF during and following induction chemotherapy. Patients\n           are further randomized into one of two treatment arms for retinoid therapy.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral tretinoin daily beginning on day 1 of induction\n           chemotherapy and continuing for up to a maximum of 90 days.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive no retinoid therapy during and following induction\n           chemotherapy.\n\n      Following completion of induction chemotherapy, patients achieving complete remission and\n      blood count recovery may receive subsequent therapy consisting of consolidation chemotherapy\n      and/or autologous or allogeneic transplantation.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 800-1,000 patients will be accrued for this study within\n      4-5 years."
