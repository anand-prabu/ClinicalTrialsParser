A lavage with saline is not\n      necessary. The decision to start postoperative antibiotic is left at the discretion of the\n      surgeon. The decision to leave an abdominal drain is left at the discretion of the surgeon.\n\n      The use of a preoperative single dose administration of antibiotics has been extensively\n      studied and found beneficial in the prevention of SSI in appendicitis. However, the use of\n      continued postoperative antibiotics has barely been studied. The sparse evidence that exist\n      does not seem to support its systematic use. During appendectomy the surgeon frequently\n      encounters turbid free fluid, even in non-perforated appendicitis. It is common practice in\n      Belgium to continue antibiotic prophylaxis for 5 days after aspiration and lavage. Although\n      the aspect often seems purulent, it is unknown in what percentage this fluid is\n      contaminated. Also, it is unknown whether after aspiration and lavage intra-abdominal drains\n      are necessary."
