      Justification and background Ventilator-associated complications (VACs) are those
      complications that develop during a period of intubation of a patient . Pneumonia is the
      second most frequent infectious complication in the hospital, and ranks first in ICU, whose
      risk is increased more than 20 times by the presence of invasive mechanical ventilation and
      is called ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) . Whereas the information published
      regarding VAP in terms of diagnosis, treatment and impact on the outcome of critically ill
      patients is enormous.Ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) incidence is lacking and
      complicated in part, since the definition remains controversial. In addition, the
      significance of tracheobronchial colonization as a risk factor for subsequent lower
      respiratory tract infection remains unclear . The upper and lower airways can become
      colonized . Several factors have been taken into account and do not differ from those
      involved in VAT and VAP development in patients under mechanical ventilation.

      Definition VAT diagnosis is controversial and represents an actual problem in order to
      define the real incidence of VAT ,  There is currently no valid, reliable definition for
      VAT, and even the most widely-used VAT criteria and definitions are neither sensitive nor
      specific. The diagnosis of VAT is considered when a patient under invasive mechanical
      ventilation starts with fever, leukocytosis and new or increased purulent secretions by the
      endotracheal tube. A particular difficulty with much commonly used VAT definition (in order
      to distinguish from VAP) is the key point of the absence of pulmonary consolidation.
      Evidence suggests that chest radiograph findings do not accurately role out VAP. A taskforce
      on hospital-acquired pneumonia, and VAP has been recently published (European Respiratory
      Society (ERS), European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID)
      and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM)). Nosocomial tracheobronchitis
      definition includes occurrence of purulent tracheal secretion after ≥48 h of hospitalisation
      or mechanical ventilation plus ≥2 of the following: fever (≥38.5°C) or hypothermia (&lt;36°C),
      leukocytosis (≥12 × 109/L), significant bacteriologic counts in respiratory secretions (≥103
      cfu/mL for protected brush specimen (PBS) and ≥105 cfu/mL for endotracheal aspirates);
      absence of new pulmonary infiltrates compatible with pneumonia and absence of other causes
      of fever are mandatory. This definition needs to be further validated and can overdiagnose
      the incidence of VAT (and overuse of antibiotics) because the positive culture of
      respiratory secretions is not a mandatory item RATIONALE Given the possible high incidence
      of VAT, and its importance as a risk factor for VAP, and a potential target to treat in
      order to reduce VAP incidence, a large multicentre

      METHODS This prospective international multicentre observational study will be conducted in
      5 countries (Spain, Argentina, France, Portugal, Brazil) Inclusion criteria 10-20
      consecutive admissions with a predictive duration of intubation and mechanical ventilation &gt;
      48h.

      Exclusion criteria Predicted duration of intubation and mechanical ventilation ≤ 48h.
      Tracheostomy at ICU admission. Primary objective To determine the incidence of VAT in
      patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation &gt;48h.

      Secondary objectives To determine risk factors for VAT. To determine incidence and risk
      factors for transition from VAT to VAP. To determine microorganisms associated with VAT. To
      determine the impact of VAT on outcome.
