Following successful screening, use of all topical\n      glaucoma medications will be stopped for a period of \"washout\" to establish a qualifying\n      medication-free intraocular pressure (IOP) value.\n\n      Clinical follow up will be scheduled over the course of the 24 month study, and examinations\n      will be repeated to monitor eye health. At the 1 and 2 year follow up, those patients on\n      ocular hypotensive medications will be instructed to washout, and then have the diurnal (IOP\n      taken in the morning, mid-day, and afternoon in the same day) IOP evaluation. Annual follow\n      up will occur up to 2 years. The primary effectiveness endpoint is a decrease in diurnal IOP\n      from baseline compared to the 24 months diurnal IOP following medication washout."

A partial thickness scleral flap with its base at the corneoscleral junction after cauterization of the flap area, and a window opening is created under the flap with a Kelly-punch to remove a portion of the sclera, Schlemm's canal and the trabecular meshwork to enter the anterior chamber.
