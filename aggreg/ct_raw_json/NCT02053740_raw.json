The\n      inclusion criteria were 18 years or older, with at least 3 months maintenance HD. The\n      exclusion criteria were malignancy, acute infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, pregnancy,\n      and inability to comply with the requirements of study.\n\n      69 respondents were enrolled in this trial. A single-center quasi-randomized controlled\n      clinical trial was designed based on the patients in the care of one attending physician.\n      Eligible subjects were allocated to study and control group, and the basic characteristics\n      between the experimental group and control group were matched. There was no significant\n      difference regarding gender, aged, education level, comorbidities between these two groups.\n      The experimental group was treated with Ren Shen Yang Rong Tang (R-S-Y-R-T) combined routine\n      western medicine, and the control group was treated with WM alone. The experimental group\n      had 32 respondents and the control group had 37 respondents. The duration of use of\n      R-S-Y-R-T was 6 months. Finally, there were 27 patients in the experimental group and 32\n      patients in the control group completed the study. Blood investigation, including\n      biochemical profiles and inflammatory markers were checked at intervals 0, 2, 4 and 6 months\n      form routine HD. The questionnaire, for the assessment of quality of life (QOL) was\n      evaluated at interval 0, and 6 months."

This was a concentrated\n      decoction made by water extraction in 1:13 ratio from single batched roots of the 14 plants\n      in proportions: Radix Paeoniae alba (Bai Sau) (90 g), Radix Angelicae sinensis (Dang Guay)\n      (30 g), Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae (Chenpi) (30 g), Radix Astragali (Huangqi) (30 g),\n      Cortex Cinnamomi (Rougui) (30 g), Radix Ginseng (Renshen) (30 g), Rhizoma Atractylodis\n      Macrocephalae (Baizhu) (30 g), Radix Glycyrrhizae (Gancao) (30 g), Radix Rehmanniae\n      praeparata (Soe Dee Huang) (20 g), Fructus Schisandrae (Wuweizi) (20 g), Poria cocos\n      (Fuling) (20 g), Cortex et Radix Polygalae (Yuanzhi) (15 g), Zingiber officinale Roscoe\n      (Jiang) (30 g)\uff0cFructus Jujubae (Dazao) (10 g) as prepared according to the original\n      pharmacopoeia. The plant origins in China were known to the buyer of the pharmaceutical\n      company and the final product was free of E. coli, Salmonella and pesticide residues. The\n      levels of heavy metals were 1.238 ppm for lead, 0.228 ppm for arsenic,0.10 ppm for cadmium,\n      and <0.0022 ppm for mercury, all within regulated limits (5, 5, 0.5, and 0.5 ppm,\n      respectively). Each pack weighed approximately 500 mg in aluminum packets.\n\n      The investigators determined the dosage of 1 pack a time for 3 times a day with warm water\n      for 6 months. The exact number of packs taken was recorded in clinic visits and any\n      unfinished packs were brought back to the study nurse at the next clinic visit."
