      The investigators proposed a preliminary randomized control trial of Family Based
      Interpersonal Psychotherapy (FB-IPT), a family-based adaptation of Interpersonal
      Psychotherapy for Depressed Adolescents (IPT-A; Mufson et al., 2000). Forty-five
      preadolescent children (ages 8-12) diagnosed with a depressive disorder will be randomized
      to receive a 14-week course of FB-IPT or Client Centered Therapy (CCT), a supportive
      nondirective psychotherapy that closely approximates treatment at usual in community mental
      health clinics. In addition to assessing the feasibility and acceptability of randomization
      and each of the treatment conditions, this project will evaluate the effects of FB-IPT and
      CCT across multiple domains, including symptomatology and psychosocial functioning.
      Preadolescents will be assessed prior to treatment, during treatment (Weeks 3, 7, 11), one
      week post-treatment, and at 3 and 6 months post-treatment to compare changes in depressive
      symptoms, global, social, and family functioning. Data on psychosocial risk factors
      associated with onset and recurrence of preadolescent depression will be collected prior to
      treatment and at specified intervals post-treatment in order to conduct exploratory analyses
      on correlates of positive and negative treatment outcomes for Family Based IPT. This data
      will be used to generate future hypotheses about potential mediators and moderators that
      will be incorporated into an R01 application for an efficacy study of Family Based IPT.

    <description>Family Based Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depressed Preadolescents (FB-IPT) is a promising psychosocial treatment for preadolescent depression. It is conceptually rooted in an interpersonal model of depression that focuses on how stress in interpersonal relationships is often related to the onset or maintenance of depressive symptoms.  In keeping with adult and adolescent models of IPT, FB-IPT focuses on improving the interpersonal functioning of individuals as a means to improve their depressive symptoms.  FB-IPT addresses two domains of interpersonal impairment in depressed preadolescents, parent-child conflict and interpersonal avoidance, and focuses on family relationships, the primary context for children's social and emotional development.</description>

    <description>Child Centered Therapy (CCT), a supportive and nondirective treatment that closely approximates the standard of care for pediatric depression in community mental health.  CCT is a manualized treatment for children between the ages of 8-14 based on a Rogerian counseling model.  In that model, changes in children's mood and behavior are initiated through their experience of a therapeutic relationship marked by unconditional positive regard, empathic understanding, and therapeutic genuineness.</description>
