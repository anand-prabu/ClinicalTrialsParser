  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this three-armed dose-finding trial 3 AK 3012 topical formulations shall be investigated
      with respect to safety and efficacy in order to identify the optimal concentration in the
      topical formulation.

      The main objective of the trial is to determine the optimal concentration of the active
      agent in the topical formulation as quantified by the change of the number of skin
      alterations in pre-defined areas in a time period from inclusion in the trial until the end
      of treatment (3 months) or prior complete healing.

          -  Presence of immunosuppression

          -  Treatment with 5-fluorouracil, cyclosporine, retinoids, glycolic acid, imiquimod,
             trichloroacetic acid during the trial or 12 weeks before inclusion in the trial
