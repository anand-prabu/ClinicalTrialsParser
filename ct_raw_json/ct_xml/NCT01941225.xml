  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of the pulmonary vasculature in the
      development and progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To accomplish
      this, an inhaled prostacyclin (iloprost) will be given to patients with COPD and changes in
      oxidative stress and lung volumes during exercise will be measured.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the 3rd leading cause of death in the US, is a
      progressive disorder for which new treatments are urgently needed, as existing therapies are
      focused primarily on symptom relief. Oxidative stress, in part arising from inducible nitric
      oxide synthase (iNOS) released by the pulmonary vasculature, is critical for the development
      and progression of COPD; a treatment strategy focused on the pulmonary vasculature is
      hypothesized to be beneficial in COPD patients.  This will be studied with the use of an
      inhaled prostacyclin analogue, iloprost, which has been approved for pulmonary hypertension
      and investigated in small studies of COPD patients.  Potential mechanisms include reductions
      in dynamic hyperinflation during exercise in COPD patients or improvements in oxidative
      stress
