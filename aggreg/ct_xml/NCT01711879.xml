  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 52 week study will assess the use of intravitreal aflibercept injections in patients
      with neovascular glaucoma (NVG) compared to standard of care panretinal photocoagulation.

      The investigators hypothesize that the neovascularization of the iris and angle present in
      neovascular glaucoma will resolve more quickly in eye treated with intravitreal aflibercept
      injection alone and result in increased comfort and preservation of visual field as compared
      to current standard of care utilizing pan-retinal photocoagulation. The advantages to
      intravitreal aflibercept injection use could include resolution of NVI/NVA leading to
      quicker pain relief and quicker lowering of IOP.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of neovascular glaucoma  (Stage I-II)

          -  Individuals who are ages 21-90 years old; male or female of any race

          -  Presence of neovascularization of the iris and/or angle

          -  At least 90 degrees of &quot;unzipped&quot; anterior chamber angle as noted by gonioscopy.  (a
             &quot;zipped angle is the term used for a drainage angle that is slowly closing due to
             scar tissue from the neovascularization process)

          -  Visual acuity of light perception or better in the study eye

          -  Willing and able to comply with clinic visits and study-related procedures

          -  Provide signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of intravitreal anti-VEGF agents in the study eye in the past 3 months.

          -  Full PRP in the study eye

          -  Prior vitrectomy in the study eye

          -  Prior trabeculectomy or other filtration surgery in the study eye

          -  Active ocular or periocular infection in the study eye

          -  Ocular conditions (Cataract or vitreous hemorrhage) that might require surgery in
             next 12 months

          -  Allergy to fluorescein dye

          -  Any past use of systemic anti-VEGF medication

          -  Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to study enrollment

          -  Stroke within 6 months prior to study enrollment

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women

          -  Sexually active men or women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to practice
             adequate contraception during the study
