Determine the safety of OvaRex monoclonal antibody B43.13 in patients with\n      elevated CA 125 and histologically proven epithelial adenocarcinoma of the ovary, fallopian\n      tube, or peritoneum, but without other evidence of disease. II. Determine the time to\n      disease progression, overall survival, CA 125 levels, immune responses, and quality of life\n      of these patients treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2\n      treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive placebo IV during weeks 1, 3, 5, 9, 13, 25, 37, and\n      49. Arm II: Patients receive OvaRex monoclonal antibody B43.13 (MOAB B43.13) IV during weeks\n      1, 3, 5, 9, 13, 25, 37, and 49. Patients in either treatment arm who have no disease\n      progression after week 49 receive MOAB B43.13 once every 12 weeks until week 121. Patients\n      with disease progression after week 49 may receive MOAB B43.13 alone, in combination with,\n      or following chemotherapy. Quality of life is assessed during the study.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 102 patients will be accrued for this study."
