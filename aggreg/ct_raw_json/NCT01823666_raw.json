Others with MCI later have test results that return to normal for\n      their age and education.\n\n      To develop a new drug for the prevention of dementia(dementia due to Alzheimer's disease or\n      vascular dementia), investigators need a sensitive and specific tool for recognizing\n      patients who will converse to dementia.
