  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension (HTN) is the single most prevalent risk factor for cardiovascular disease,
      diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome. Recent American Heart Association (AHA) statistics
      indicate that one-third of all adults in the United States of America suffer from HTN.
      Despite advances in life style modification and multi-drug therapies, 20-30% of all
      hypertensive patients remain resistant.

      These individuals exhibit autonomic dysregulation due to elevated sympathetic activity and
      norepinephrine spillover, and low parasympathetic activity. It is generally accepted that
      this uncontrolled, resistant HTN is primarily &quot;neurogenic&quot; in origin, involving over
      activity of the sympathetic nervous system that initiates and sustains HTN. A surgical
      approach such as the recently developed &quot;Simplicity Catheter&quot; assisted renal denervation
      remains one of the few options available to these patients. Thus, a mechanism-based
      breakthrough is imperative to develop novel strategies to prevent and perhaps eventually
      cure neurogenic hypertension (NH). This study is designed to evaluate a low and high dose of
      minocycline to test the hypothesis that minocycline treatment would produce antihypertensive
      effects in drug-resistant neurogenic hypertensive individuals. Minocycline has been selected
      because of its demonstrated effects on inhibiting microglial activation and its ability to
      penetrate the blood brain barrier. There is no other compound available that is safer and
      displays specificity better than Minocycline in inhibiting microglial activation. Thus, the
      potential therapeutic benefits of this inexpensive, well tolerated, already FDA-approved
      drug that has minimal side effects would be enormous.

      Fifty-six (56) subjects who will be randomized to receive either Minocycline 100 mg or 200
      mg b.i.d. (twice a day). At baseline, subjects will undergo blood tests (lipid panel, high
      sensitivity-C reactive protein, high sensitivity troponin, glucose, metabolic profile, lipid
      panel, Cystatin C and albumin).

      Patients will have ambulatory BP monitoring completed. Systolic BP greater than 160 mm Hg
      will result in randomization. Patients will be dispensed study medication and asked to
      return every 12 weeks till the end of the study.

      At each visit, a brief physical examination will be performed, an update of medical history,
      an assessment of medication compliance and tolerance, and measurement of blood pressure and
      other vital signs will be completed. Study drug will also be dispensed. At the six month
      visit, a repeat pregnancy test will be performed. Prior to the patient returning for the 52
      week visit, subjects will be mailed an ambulatory BP cuff to wear for the 24 hours prior to
      returning for the final visit. At the final visit the same blood tests and urine studies as
      done at baselines will be repeated. When they complete 52 weeks of treatment and come in for
      their final visit, this will complete participation in the trial.
