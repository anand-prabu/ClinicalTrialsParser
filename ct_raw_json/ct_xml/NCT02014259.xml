  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of the trial is to investigate the
      pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the trial drug in the body), safety and tolerability of
      oral semaglutide in subjects with various degrees of impaired renal function compared to
      subjects with normal renal function.
