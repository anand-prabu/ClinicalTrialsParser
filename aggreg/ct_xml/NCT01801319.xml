    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind cross-over trial evaluating the
      safety, efficacy, daily functioning, and health-related quality of life of Subcallosal
      Cingulate Gyrus Deep Brain Stimulation (SCG DBS) for participants with Treatment-Resistant
      Depression (TRD). A total of 40 eligible participants will be randomized to four treatment
      sequences (10 participants per sequence). Each participant will be treated over a 6-month
      period with active or sham stimulation in which both the participants and the attending
      psychiatrists will be blinded to treatment allocation.
