  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thoracic spine thrust manipulation (TSM) has been shown to be an effective intervention in
      the management of patients with neck pain.  However the mechanisms for pain relief
      associated with this intervention remain largely unexplained.  Recent evidence suggests
      structures within the brain may have a role in creating responses of pain relief.  This
      study aims to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine if there is a
      change in blood flow to structures within the brain following TSM in patients with neck
      pain. All patients will undergo fMRI while receiving painful stimuli directed to two
      separate sites, the cuticle of the index finger and the great toe.  Subjects will then
      receive either TSM or sham-manipulation and then immediately undergo a second fMRI scan
      receiving the same painful stimuli.    The primary outcome of interest is the shift in blood
      flow within the brain before and after TSM or sham manipulation as measured by Blood Oxygen
      Level Dependent (BOLD) technology.  This study will be the first to examine this type of
      response to manual therapy within the brain in patients with neck pain.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary complaint of mechanical neck pain of less than 6 weeks in duration as
             identified in the patient's initial physical examination.  Mechanical neck pain is
             defined as generalized neck and/or shoulder, peri-scapular pain with symptoms
             provoked by neck postures, neck movements, or palpation of the cervical musculature

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any medical red flags suggestive of non-musculoskeletal origin of pain, such as
             metabolic disorders, osteoporosis, tumor, and/or rheumatoid arthritis

          -  No contraindications to spinal mobilization

          -  No contraindications to MRI (claustrophobia, presence of cardiac pacemakers, cochlear
             implants,   metal implants, implanted hearing aids, and previous injuries caused by
             bullets or shrapnel, pregnancy or thought to be pregnant
