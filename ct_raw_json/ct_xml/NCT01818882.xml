  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of our study is to compare the effects of two care strategies for
      dyspneic patients on the length of hospital stay: (1) standard care (=contextual analysis +
      conventional clinical chest radiography) versus (2) standard care + pleuropulmonary
      ultrasound.

    <textblock>
      The secondary objectives of this study are to assess the following for both arms:

      A-fatality rate, B-degree of concordance between the diagnosis orientation in the emergency
      department and final diagnosis determined by an expert committee using patient records one
      month later (blind evaluation by a panel of experts) C-clinical improvement between early
      emergency care and later care outside the emergency department (clinical parameters = blood
      gases and other biological parameters) D-imaging parameters.
