To meet this goal several airways\n      technologies to maintain the ETT free from debris/bacteria have been developed in order to\n      improve the current ventilator-liberation standards in intubated critically ill patients.\n\n      Based on preliminary laboratory, animal and clinical data, The investigators now wish to\n      test the hypothesis that a novel commercially available ETT cleaning device can be effective\n      in targeting two specific issues:\n\n        -  Specific aim 1: To evaluate the mean difference in ETT luminal volume of ETTs cleaned\n           with the novel cleaning device (EndOclear) vs. ETT cleaned in the standard manner.\n\n        -  Specific aim 2: To determine whether ETTs cleaned with the novel device show a lower\n           degree of microbial colonization for the entire period of mechanical ventilation.\n\n      Data about in-vivo respiratory mechanics measurements, microbial diversity and antibiotic\n      resistance analysis, users' feedbacks and safety of the device will also be collected.\n\n      The investigators will conduct a clinical trial on 74 intubated patients randomized to\n      receive standard ETT cleaning or cleaning with the EndOclear."

It consists of an endotracheal tube cleaning apparatus with a flexible central tube and a cleaning device at its distal end. The cleaning device has a mechanically expandable mesh structure which can be adapted to selectively move between a radially-collapsed position and a radially-expanded one. In operation, the collapsed cleaning apparatus is inserted into the ETT through a Y-shaped connector. The device is then expanded by a safety toggle protected trigger mechanism that, when fired, presses the device's smooth silicone disc against the inside surface of the endotracheal tube. The cleaning apparatus is then pulled out of the endotracheal tube removing mucus deposits and secretions.\nWe plan to add the use of endOclear to the standard ICU practice, scheduling the systematic use of the device every 8 hours for the whole intubation period.",

The whole ETT will be analyzed through hig-definition CT slices, with detection of the plastic-mucus-air interfaces resulting in multiple measurement of the ETT cross-sectional area (CSA). The investigators will calculate the luminal residual air volume, the total volume of mucus and all the associated measurements, such as lowest CSA. Comparing the volume of the used ETT to a blank clean same-size one, the investigators will also measure the relative loss of volume (%) due to mucus accumulation.",
