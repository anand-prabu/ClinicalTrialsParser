      This is a non-inferiority trial of Engage, a new intervention for late-life depression, and
      problem solving therapy (PST).  Patient participants will be randomized to either Engage or
      PST and receive 9 weeks of either intervention.   Interview assessments will be collected at
      baseline and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 26, and 36. Clinician participants, social workers from
      mental health agencies, will be randomized to receive training and certification in either
      Engage or PST.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Policy reports document that evidence-based psychotherapies are rarely employed and
      sustained in the community. Several causes of this science to service gap have been
      identified. One cause, specific to behavioral interventions, is the complexity of
      interventions and the competencies community clinicians must acquire and sustain over time
      in order to deliver them. A realistic solution is to streamline behavioral interventions and
      tailor them to the settings and therapist skill level available in the community. In
      response to this need, we have developed Engage, which: 1) is streamlined on the basis of
      concepts and findings on the neurobiology of depression; 2) consists of psychotherapeutic
      and ecosystem management components of known efficacy; 3) has distilled and simplified these
      components so as they can be accessible to most depressed older patients and taught to
      larger numbers of clinicians than available therapies, e.g., Problem Solving Therapy (PST);
      and 4) is personalized through a structured stepped approach focusing on &quot;reward exposure&quot;.
      Problem Solving Therapy is an evidenced-based intervention shown to be effective in treating
      late-life depression.

      Three hundred (150 per site) patient participants will be randomly assigned to receive 9
      sessions of either Engage or PST.  Forty-two clinician participants will be randomly
      assigned to receive training and certification in either Engage or PST.  Once certified,
      clinicians will be assigned a patient participant and administer their assigned
      intervention.

    <description>Problem solving therapy is an evidence based psychotherapy for depression, with 30 years of research supporting its efficacy.  PST focuses on the patients themselves and helps them develop skills in identifying, prioritizing, and solving problems, and thereby creates a sense of empowerment.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Engage</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Engage utilizes reward exposure consisting of the reintroduction of activities that patients once found rewarding and enjoyed, but have abandoned after they developed depression. Engage uses basic problem solving through which patients learn how to form &quot;action plans&quot; for pursuing rewarding activities of their choice.</description>
