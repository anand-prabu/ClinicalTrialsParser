  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility study is being conducted to determine potential associations between a
      broad range of clinical neurological symptoms and magnetic resonance images (MRI), data, and
      clinical findings involved in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).

      These associations will be examined over the acute and sub-acute period (approximately 3
      months) following injury to provide information useful for optimization of MR pulse
      sequences for mTBI applications.

      Correlations exist over the sub-acute period in clinical neurological and MR data (images,
      image reads, and RAW data), which may indicate temporal evolution patterns. The intent of
      this study is to broadly generate potential biomarkers of temporal evolution of mTBI
      detectable in MR images and data (&quot;MR mTBI biomarkers&quot;).
