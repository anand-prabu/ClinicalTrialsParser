One such protocol, entitled dose-adjusted EPOCH-R,\n      utilizes two major new strategies. First, the treatment approach utilizes continuous\n      infusion of chemotherapy over four days, instead of being administered over minutes or\n      hours. Secondly, the doses of some medications involved are increased or decreased based on\n      how the drugs affect the subject's ability to produce blood cells, which is used as a\n      measure of how rapidly the body is processing drugs.\n\n      Using this approach in adults, researchers have shown improved cure rates in these cancers.\n      Additionally, the harmful effects experienced by patients has been mild, with mucositis,\n      severe infections, and tumor lysis syndrome occurring rarely. However, this new dosing\n      method has never been used in children, and the effectiveness and side effects of this new\n      method are unknown in children.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to look at the safety of dose-adjusted EPOCH-R in the treatment\n      of children with mature B-cell cancers, and to see if we can maintain cure rates (as has\n      been shown in adults). This study represents the first trial of dose-adjusted EPOCH-R in\n      children."
