All  antipsychotics currently   registered in Czech Republic will be allowed in this study. All patients  will remain on  antipsychotic treatment adjusted prior enrollment,  so that dose adjustment will be based on their ordinary medication. Participants will be instructed to complete the 10-item EWS Questionnaire upon SMS request sent automatically weekly to their mobile phones. EWSQ detects proportional worsening of the symptoms compared to the last week's score of the questionnaire. Individual EWSQ scores will be sent  by participants back to the ITAREPS system as a SMS. If the total score exceeds the given score threshold, an immediate ALERT would be declared and announced to the investigator as an e-mail message and a therapeutic intervention is requested. After detecting the early warning signs by ITAREPS, an immediate 20% increase in the dose of antipsychotic will be required."
