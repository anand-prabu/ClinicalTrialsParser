  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resident duty hour requirements in the U.S. are still evolving as stakeholders continue to
      debate how best to (re)structure postgraduate medical education.

      There is concern that current restrictions may be detrimental to patient care and resident
      training. To investigate these issues, the investigators will be conducting a one-year,
      prospective randomized trial to examine how flexibility of duty hour requirements affects
      patient care when compared to current resident duty hour requirements. Further information
      about the study is available on the FIRST Trial website http://www.thefirsttrial.org/.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Residency programs will be randomized to either (1) an intervention arm that eliminates
      several Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) duty hour requirements
      or (2) to a usual care arm where programs will continue adhering to current ACGME
      requirements. Programs in the intervention arm will be granted a waiver from current duty
      hour requirements by the ACGME and allowed to eliminate all resident duty hour rules with
      the following exceptions: Duty hours limited to 80 hours/week averaged over 4 weeks, minimum
      of one free day (no duty)/week averaged over 4 weeks, may not take in-house call more
      frequently than every 3rd night, averaged over 4 weeks, allowed to increase duty requirement
      flexibility for chief residents. The intent of the intervention arm is to allow flexibility
      in surgical resident duty hours and improve continuity of care. Subsequently, the
      investigators will compare multiple postoperative outcomes between the two study arms using
      data collected through the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality
      Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP). The results of this study will provide high-quality
      empirical evidence upon which to base resident duty hour requirements in the future.
