With the advent of new LED-based (light emitting diode)light sources,\n      the need of further clinical experiments aiming to compare the effectiveness between them is\n      paramount. Method: This study proposes an evaluation of analgesic effect in TMD\n      (temporomandibular disorders) using two different LEDs systems, one emitting at the spectral\n      band of red (630 +/-5 nm) and the other at infrared band (850 +/-5 nm), and compare the\n      results with a laser treated control group (780nm diode laser using 105.7 J/cm2). Mandibular\n      range of motion and report of pain were evaluated via appropriate equipment developed to do\n      this end. Power output was 150mW, tip area was 0.5 cm\u00b2 for both sources. Fluency or dose\n      chosen was 18 J/cm\u00b2 for each point of application, around the TMJ, on both sides. Five\n      points were irradiated on TMJ, temporal and masseter muscles. Eight irradiation sessions\n      were done and follow up was performed 7 and 30 days, after last session. Thirty patients\n      were enrolled and they were selected randomly for each treatment, resulting in 10 patients\n      per group (infrared LED, red LED and Control Group using infrared Laser)."
