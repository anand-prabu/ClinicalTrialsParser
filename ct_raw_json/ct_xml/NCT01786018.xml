      The purpose of this study is to evaluate progression free survival, transplant-related
      morbidity (TRM) at day +100 and at +365, overall survival and incidence of acute and chronic
      GVHD in refractory/early relapsed aggressive B-cell non Hodgkin lymphomas patients treated
      with allogeneic Transplantation after a conditioning with Thiotepa, Busulfan and fludarabin.

        Patient inclusion criteria:

          -  Patients with refractory/relapsed aggressive B-cell non Hodgkin lymphomas after
             frontline therapy.

          -  Patients with stable disease or partial or complete remission (PET-negative) after
             salvage therapy

          -  Patients younger than 65 years old

          -  A fully HLA-identical sibling or matched unrelated donor is available. Patients with
             one antigen mismatched donors can be considered

          -  Patient must be competent to give consent.

        Patient exclusion criteria:

          -  Patients treated with an autologous transplant as salvage therapy

          -  Patients with progressive lymphomas despite conventional therapies

          -  Patients with progressive lymphomas despite conventional therapies

          -  Uncontrolled CNS involvement with disease

          -  Fertile men or women unwilling to use contraceptive techniques during and for 12
             months following treatment

          -  Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Organ dysfunction defined as follows:

               -  Cardiac function: ejection fraction &lt;30% or uncontrolled cardiac failure

               -  Pulmonary: DLCO &lt;40% predicted

               -  Liver function abnormalities: elevation of bilirubin to &gt; 3 mg/dl and/or
                  transaminases &gt;4x the upper limit of normal

               -  Renal: creatinine clearance &lt;50 cc/min (24 hour urine  collection)

          -  Karnofsky performance score &lt; 60%

          -  Patients with poorly controlled hypertension despite multiple antihypertensives

          -  Documented fungal disease that is progressive despite treatment

          -  Viral infections: HIV positive patients.

          -  Positive serology for Hepatitis B (HB) defined as a positive test for HBsAg. In
             addition, if negative for HBsAg but HBcAb positive (regardless of HBsAb status), a
             HBV DNA test will be performed and if positive the subject will be excluded.

          -  Positive serology for hepatitis C (HC) defined as a positive test for HCAb, in which
             case reflexively perform a HC RIBA immunoblot assay on the same sample to confirm the
             result

          -  Psychiatric disorders or psychosocial problems which in the opinion of the primary
             physician or Principal Investigator would place the patient at unacceptable risk from
             this regimen.

          -  Patients with active non-hematologic malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancers).

          -  Patients with a history of non-hematologic malignancies (except non-melanoma skin
             cancers) currently in a complete remission, who are less than 5 years from the time
             of complete remission, and have a &gt;20% risk of disease recurrence.

        Donor inclusion criteria:

          -  Related or unrelated HLA identical donors who are in good health and have no
             contra-indication to donation. One antigen HLA-mismatched (9/10 match) donors will
             also be considered.

          -  No contra-indication for the donor to collection by apheresis of mononuclear cells
             mobilized by G-CSF at a dose of 10-12 mg/kg of body weight.

          -  Donor must have adequate veins for leukapheresis or agree to placement of central
             venous catheter (femoral, subclavian).

        Donor exclusion criteria:

          -  Age &lt; 18 years.

          -  Identical twin.

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Infection with HIV.

          -  Inability to achieve adequate venous access.

          -  Known allergy to filgrastin (G-CSF).

          -  Current serious systemic illness.
