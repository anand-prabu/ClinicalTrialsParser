  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn more about eating practices of survivors of
      childhood Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors (including brain and spinal cord tumors).

      Recent research shows that childhood cancer survivors are experiencing many health issues
      months or even years after active cancer treatment (for example, irregular blood sugar
      levels, overweight/obesity, and heart disease).  To address this growing concern,
      researchers at MD Anderson Children's Cancer Hospital and Texas Children's Cancer Center
      have joined forces to learn more about how to design a program that would promote healthy
      lifestyles among survivors of childhood cancer.

      A one-time assessment will be conducted for all participants through the Assessment Center
      website.  No treatment or intervention will be provided.  Two websites will be set up (Site
      A and Site B).  The only difference between the two sites is the order that the questions
      will appear.  The actual questions will remain the same.  Only the adolescent and young
      adult (AYA) survivors of CNS tumors eligible after screening will be invited to respond to
      the survey.  Following the final screening, the eligible participants will be randomized to
      Site A or Site B.

      Each participant will complete the web-based questionnaire that has a total of 53 questions.
       For site A, the order of the questions will be TFEQ-R18v2, multifactor screener, and
      EQ-EMA.  For site B, the order of the questions will be EQ-EMA, multifactor screener, and
      TFEQ-R18v2.  The 53 questions came from the original TFEQ-R18v2, the multifactor screener
      used in the National Cancer Institute's Observing Protein and Energy Nutrition Study, and
      the adapted TFEQ-R18v2 for use via EMA methodology.

      Multifactor screener is a short assessment tool used to evaluate dietary intake of fruits,
      vegetables, percentage of energy from fat, and fiber.

      Eating Questionnaire-EMA (EQ-EMA) was adapted based on the original TFEQ-R18v2 for use via
      EMA methodology.  The changes made were related to a change in verbiage to reflect our goal
      of assessing a participant's current behavior before and after an eating episode.

        Adolescent and young adult (AYA) males and females (15 to 39 years old) who survived
        childhood CNS tumors from MD Anderson Cancer Center, Texas Children's Cancer Center, and

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adolescent or Young Adult (AYA), 15 to 39 years old who has survived a primary CNS
             tumor

          2. Has been off therapy without relapse for at least 6 months

          3. Able to speak, write, and read in English

          4. Has access to the internet

          5. Has telephone access

          6. Currently lives in the United States

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is in foster care

          2. Is experiencing severe cognitive impairments that do not allow them to engage in
             basic conversations [We are excluding individuals who may experience severe cognitive
             impairments because participants will need to provide assent (if &lt;18 years old) or
             consent (if &gt;=18 years old) and will need to have the ability to independently
             complete the TFEQ-R18v2, Multifactor screener, and EQ-EMA. Through the phone
             screening conducted by the MDACC graduate research assistant (GRA), a person is
             determined to not be severely cognitive impaired if the participant is able to
             respond to basic questions such as their age, whether or not they have internet
             access, and telephone.]

          3. Is incarcerated at the time of enrollment.
