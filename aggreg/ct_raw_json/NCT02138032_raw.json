Positively framed health\n      messages contain potential gains of participating/refraining in specific health behaviour.\n      Alternatively, negatively framed health messages contain potential losses of\n      participating/refraining in specific health behaviour (Verlhiac, Chappe, & Meyer, 2011). The\n      primary aim and rationale of this study will be to investigate which type of framing has the\n      greatest effect on intentions to quit smoking in patients with vascular arterial disease.\n      The secondary aim is to investigate what other factors may have an effect on intention to\n      quit and also what factors play a part in a patient's intention to quit smoking."
