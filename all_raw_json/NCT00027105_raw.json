Participants will be drawn from patients referred to the National Naval\n      Medical Center for diagnosis and treatment during 2000-20001.\n\n      Participants will be interviewed and their medical records reviewed for past medical\n      history, history of the present illness and social and recreational history. They will be\n      seen five times over a 1-year period (initial visit and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months), for\n      30-minute visits, which will include the following:\n\n        -  Interview about past medical history and present illness, social and recreational\n           activities, functional independence at work and during activities of daily living.\n\n        -  Complete health survey and upper limb disability questionnaire; physical activity\n           questionnaire to be completed at 6 and 12 months after medical treatment begins. The\n           questionnaires take about 30 to 40 minutes to complete.\n\n        -  Upper body examination, including pain measurement using a 10-point scale, an upper\n           limb lift test, and measures of upper limb volume and girth."

            "textblock": "This retrospective (case-control) outcome study will investigate the frequency and severity\n      of morbidities in a population of approximately 160 patients diagnosed with breast cancer\n      before and after medical and surgical treatment.  Subjects will be followed for one-year\n      with quarterly examinations (baseline [pre-medical treatment] and at 1, 3 months, 6 months,\n      9 months and 12 months after treatment).  In order for cancer survivors to understand the\n      risk of impairment and functional limitations, and disability; and for health care providers\n      to determine the risk of physical impairment, functional limitations, and loss of\n      independence (morbidity) in patients with breast cancer; it is necessary to study these\n      patients from the point of diagnosis (before surgery) to a reasonable period following the\n      completion of the primary treatment program (1 year after medical treatment).  Although\n      pain, numbness, fatigue, lymphedema and diminished physical function are described as\n      prevalent and debilitating conditions, remarkably few clinical studies are published\n      describing the associated physical impairments, functional limitations or on methods for\n      their control with measures prior to medical intervention and long-term follow-up.  While\n      several past reports have identified the impact of medical and surgical intervention on\n      symptom distress and functional capacity of these patients, these studies do not provide\n      sufficient evidence to identify the: 1) level of physical impairment that predicts morbidity\n      in these patients, 2) individual factors that are specific predictors of morbidity in these\n      patients, or 3) time period in which these morbidities occur.  The majority of previous\n      studies investigating morbidity of patients with breast cancer following medical and\n      surgical intervention are cross-sectional, case series, retrospective analysis without a\n      comparison/control group and without baseline measures prior to intervention.  The proposed\n      outcome study will include:  1) a retrospective review of specific medical record\n      information such as staging conference information and the standard clinical quarterly\n      examination during a one year period, and 2) administration of a follow-up outcome\n      questionnaire, a physical activity questionnaire and a quality of life questionnaire at the\n      6 and 12 months time points.  The outcome survey is an upper limb disability questionnaire\n      developed as an outcome measure for this project.  Data available in these measurement\n      domains will allow the researchers to determine the: 1) frequency and severity of: a)\n      symptom distress (fatigue, pain including chronic pain, aching, weakness, burning, tingling,\n      numbness, anxiety, and depression) and pathological conditions (adhesive capsulitis,\n      weakness and atrophy, neuropathy, scar/skin adhesions, lymphedema), b) physical impairments\n      (diminished upper extremity and trunk range of motion/flexibility, strength, coordination\n      and increased girth), and c) functional imitations and disabilities during the course of the\n      medical treatment (loss of independence in or ability to perform routine activities of daily\n      living i.e., grooming, bathing, dressing, driving an automobile, and in some cases, return\n      to their regular work, recreational and social activities).  2) level of impairment at which\n      these patients have lost independence in function and identity those patients at higher risk\n      for the loss of independence in function (e.g., ADL's)."
