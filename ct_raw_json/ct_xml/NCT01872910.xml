    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have at least 2 third molars which are clinically indicated for extraction. At least
             1 molar should be a mandibular third molar with partial or complete bony impaction

          -  Are overtly healthy as determined by medical history and limited physical examination

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have chronic pain (eg, fibromyalgia) or are experiencing episodic pain not related to
             the wisdom teeth (eg, migraine pain) that could affect pain measurements as judged by
             the investigator

          -  Have temporomandibular joint disease or other condition which could affect pain
             processing or sensation, affect recovery from dental surgery, or otherwise affect
             ability to assess pain signal, in the opinion of the investigator

          -  Have substantial anxiety regarding dental or medical procedures as measured by the
             Corah Dental Anxiety Scale

          -  Are currently using or have recently used drugs that may confound assessment of the
             inflammatory response or pain including, but not limited to, nonsteroidal
             anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin and other analgesics, antihistamines,
             steroids, antidepressants, attention-enhancing drugs, or herbal supplements
