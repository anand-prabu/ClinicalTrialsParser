Delivery\n      of very high radiation doses is needed to obtain local control, but due to the large tumor\n      and nodal volume this is often impossible without causing unrepairable damage to the normal\n      tissue of the mediastinum, spinal cord, esophagus and lung.\n\n      Although every tumor is different with respect to the speed with which it grows and spreads,\n      it is obvious that time plays an important role in cancer therapy. Recently it was reported\n      that disease progression or increase of tumor volume occurred during the time interval\n      between diagnosis and treatment.(1, 2) This could lead to a less optimal radiation treatment\n      and consequently have an impact on overall survival. Moreover, the increasing number of\n      diagnostic procedures, aimed at obtaining more accurate information about the tumor\n      extension and biology, as well as the use of more sophisticated but labor intense radiation\n      techniques could prolong the time interval between clinical symptoms and the start of the\n      treatment. However, the influence of new diagnostic procedures or the applied radiotherapy\n      techniques on waiting times is not yet known.

The diagnostic delay for NSCLC patients has increased during the last 12 years.\n\n        2. The preparation time for radiotherapy of NSCLC patients has increased during the last\n           12 years.\n\n        3. Prolonged waiting times are associated with worse overall survival outcome."
