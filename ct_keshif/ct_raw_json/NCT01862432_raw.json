Skin-to-skin contact (STSC) with mother is known to\n      provide numerous virtues and World Health Organisation (WHO) recently supported the\n      introduction of such care among healthy, term-born neonates. Here, the investigators\n      hypothesized that immediate STSC could reduce neonatal, birth-evoked stress and pain. This\n      randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to compare the pain and stress response of C-section\n      born neonates that received either immediate STSC with mother (intervention) or classical\n      support and monitoring (control)."
