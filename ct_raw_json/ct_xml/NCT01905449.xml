  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with speech sound disorders will receive speech therapy using real-time images of
      the tongue from ultrasound. These images will be used to cue the child to change the tongue
      position when producing speech sounds.

    <description>One sound in error is treated with ultrasound visual feedback while also cueing prosodic variation (7 one-hour sessions). Another sound in error is treated with the ultrasound visual feedback with no prosodic variation (7 one-hour sessions). Prosodic variations are cues to coordinate production of the target sound with intonation patterns such as questions (rising intonations), commands (loud/emphatic), or statements (neutral)</description>

    <description>One sound in errors is treated with ultrasound visual feedback for approximately half of each session and traditional treatment for half of the session (7 one-hour sessions). Another sound in error is treated with no ultrasound visual feedback, using traditional treatment for the entire session (7 one-hour sessions). These traditional cues include verbal instructions on how to move the tongue to achieve a particular speech sound.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must be native English-speaking children with no known hearing or vision
             deficits. Participants must be within the specified age range  and have been
             identified as having speech production difficulties by a local speech-language
             therapist.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will be excluded if there is a history of oral structural impairment
             (e.g., cleft palate), hearing or vision impairment, history of neurological
             impairment or injury, developmental disabilities such as Down Syndrome or Autism, or
             intellectual disability.

        During initial testing, participants must score below a standard score of 75 on the
        Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation-2 and also score below 20% accurate on a probe list
        of words assessing accuracy of the /r/ sound
