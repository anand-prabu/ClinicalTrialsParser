Examine whether a combination of decitabine given for 10 days (days 1-10), rather than\n      the usual 5, + \"standard dose ara-C (cytarabine) (100 mg/m2 daily days 1-7) might improve\n      6-month survival probability from the historical 65% to 80% in patients age >= 60 with newly\n      diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\n\n      II. Test whether this combination might maintain complete response (CR) rate at our historic\n      45% in these patients.\n\n      III. Study factors that lead physicians to escalate or maintain ara-C doses in those\n      patients who have had an \"intermediate response\" short of CR to the first 2 cycles of the\n      combination.\n\n      IV. While maintaining awareness of confounding covariates, examine the effect of such dose\n      escalation on CR rate.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) daily on days 1-10 and cytarabine IV once\n      daily (QD) on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 28-35 days for 2 courses in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After course 3, patients achieving remission\n      will receive 1-2 more courses of therapy at the same dose. Patients in remission with\n      significant side effects will receive decitabine and cytarabine at decreased doses. Patients\n      not achieving remission will not receive any more treatment.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically."
