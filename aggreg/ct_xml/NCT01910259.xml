  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disabling and progressive neurological disease that affects
      approximately 100,000 people in the UK. Many patients with MS experience two phases of
      disease; early MS (also called relapsing remitting MS, RRMS) and late MS (also called
      secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Early MS is due to inflammation of the nerves and the
      insulation (called myelin) that surrounds the nerves. Early MS is often characterised by
      periods of &quot;attacks&quot; interspersed with periods of &quot;remission&quot; with no or low disease
      symptoms. Late or progressive MS, which affects the majority of patients and typically
      emerges after 10-15 years of disease, results from actual nerve death (also called
      neurodegeneration). The progressive stage of disease results not in individual attacks but
      slow, cumulative and irreversible disability affecting walking, balance, vision, cognition,
      pain control, bladder and bowel function. Critically, and unlike early disease, there is no
      proven treatment for the late stage of MS. This is therefore an urgent and major unmet
      health need. MS-SMART directly addresses this need and will evaluate in this clinical trial
      three drugs (ibudilast, riluzole or amiloride), all of which have shown some promise in MS,
      and in particular in SPMS. The trial is randomised and blinded. Randomisation means patients
      can get any one of the three active drugs or the inactive placebo/dummy; blinded means that
      neither patients nor the doctors will know which drug or placebo patients are receiving.
      Randomisation and blinding are standard approaches in clinical trials to ensure unbiased
      testing of drugs. All patients in MS-SMART will have periodic MRI (magnetic resonance
      imaging) brain scans and after 96 weeks these will be analysed. We will then compare the
      scans of each drug to the placebo or dummy to see if any of the drugs slow the rate of brain
      shrinkage that normally occurs in SPMS. This measured change in brain size is the primary
      (major) outcome of MS-SMART.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MS-SMART will test the efficacy and mechanism of action of three repurposed drugs
      (Ibudilast, Riluzole and Amiloride). All three drugs are in human use and have a good safety
      record. Critically for the purpose of MS-SMART they all have shown promise in early phase
      human MS clinical trials and target one or more of the pivotal neurodegenerative causing
      pathways implicated in SPMS. This is a Type B trial, as the IMPs are all in human use, have
      a good safety profile but are not currently used for this patient population.

      The major need for patients with established and progressive MS is neuroprotective or
      disease modifying treatments that will slow or even stop disease progression. This study
      will evaluate three highly promising putative neuroprotective drugs as well as
      comprehensively address several of the current knowledge gaps related to the understanding
      of neuroprotection and neurodegeneration in SPMS through MRI and CSF examination.

      MS-SMART is a multicentre, multi-arm, double blind, placebo-controlled phase IIb randomised
      controlled trial. A total of 440 patients with SPMS, with an entry criteria of an EDSS score
      of 4.0-6.5 will be equally randomised to receive placebo or one of the three active agents
      (amiloride 5mg bd, riluzole 50mg bd and ibudilast 50mg bd). Patients will be followed up for
      96 weeks with outcome-data collected after 0, 24, 48 and 96 weeks. That is, the duration of
      the trial for a trial participant is 96 weeks (a telephone assessment at week 100, 4 weeks
      post completion will be conducted). This is standard practice for phase II trials in SPMS.
