  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first purpose of this study is to is to compare metabolic control of type 1 diabetes
      among children under the age of 7 years who use an insulin pump and a real-time (RT) glucose
      sensor, and children who use only insulin pump; the investigators will also determine
      dietary habits, their knowledge of type 1 diabetes management and emotional aspects of
      experiencing illness in the family, in both groups of children.
