            "textblock": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common infection. Approximately 20 percent of all\n      episodes of pneumonia result in hospitalization. It is the leading cause of\n      community-acquired infection requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. In pulmonary\n      infections, the release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators from alveolar\n      macrophages serves as a mechanism by which invading pathogens are eliminated. However, this\n      reaction of the innate immune system can be potentially harmful when excessive release of\n      circulating inflammatory cytokines causes damage to the patient, particularly the lung.\n      Interest in the role of corticosteroids in the pathophysiology of critical illness has\n      existed since the early part of the 20th century. On ICU, early treatment with\n      corticosteroids to attenuate systemic inflammation is widespread. At the same time, outside\n      the ICU little evidence is available on the effect of treatment with corticosteroids in\n      patients diagnosed with CAP. Theoretically, early initiated administration of\n      corticosteroids in the course of a CAP can lower systemic and pulmonary inflammation. This\n      may lead to earlier resolution of pneumonia and a reduction of complications (sepsis,\n      mortality)."
