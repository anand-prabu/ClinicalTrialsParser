Women who receive\n      GnRH agonist will be further randomized to no exercise or a supervised exercise program.\n      Thus, the 3 treatment groups are: placebo, GnRH agonist, GnRH agonist+exercise. The\n      investigators will measure changes in calories burned during physical activity, sleep, rest,\n      and after a meal after 3 and 6 months of hormone suppression using doubly-labeled water and\n      room calorimetry. Other measures include food intake estimated from food records; body\n      composition measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA); glucose and insulin\n      responses to an oral glucose tolerance test; and markers of inflammation in the blood."
