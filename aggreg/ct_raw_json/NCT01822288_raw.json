Hormone therapy (HT) is widely used for controlling menopausal\n      symptoms. Common HT for menopausal syndrome with intact uterus includes tibolone, estradiol\n      valerate (E2V) 1mg & medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 2.5 mg, and conjugated equine\n      estrogens & MPA.\n\n      However, only a few literatures mentioned about the therapeutic effect of tibolone, but lack\n      of comparison research about their therapeutic effect on somatic symptoms, psychosomatic\n      symptoms, sexual dysfunction and even urinary symptoms. The knowledge of the above\n      therapeutic effects should be important for choosing a suitable medication. Therefore, the\n      aim of this study is to assess the therapeutic effect on somatic symptoms, psychosomatic\n      symptoms, sexual dysfunction and even urinary symptoms between tibolone and E2V/MPA."
