The sessions will explore parents'\n      feelings about participation in a weight management program, explore their reasons for\n      wanting to make behavioral changes, and enhance motivation.  All parents will participate in\n      monthly parent support groups while their adolescents are participating in the intervention\n      phase of the study.  The 6-month adolescent intervention will include biweekly sessions with\n      a registered dietitian for dietary education; biweekly interactive group discussion sessions\n      on topics pertaining to motivation, strategies for changing health behaviors, setting and\n      keeping goals and dealing with peer pressure; and exercise sessions three times a week with\n      30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise and 30 minutes of strength training each session.\n      Comprehensive assessments, including nutrition, behavior and exercise assessments,\n      laboratory work, body composition measurements and medical assessments will be conducted at\n      baseline, 6 months and 12 months."
