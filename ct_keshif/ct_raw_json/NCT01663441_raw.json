            "textblock": "The investigators recently developed a mutant form of rhIL-11 with improved stability. In in\n      vitro experimental systems, mIL-11 was shown to endure chemical and proteolytic stresses\n      more effectively, while retaining the biological activity of the original rhIL-11. The\n      improved stability of mIL-11 was also demonstrated in the comparative pharmacokinetic study\n      of subcutaneously delivered mIL-11 and rhIL-11 in the rodent and primate models. Based on\n      its improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features. In Phase II study shows that\n      mIL-11 is well tolerated and has thrombopoietic activity equivalent to one third of the\n      clinical dose of rhIL-11, indicating the potential of mIL- 11 for use in the treatment of\n      CIT. This study is a phase III, single-blinded, randomized,multicenter,cross-over study\n      designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of low-dose mIL-11 on CIT patients receiving\n      suitable chemotherapeutic regimen for treating cancer."
