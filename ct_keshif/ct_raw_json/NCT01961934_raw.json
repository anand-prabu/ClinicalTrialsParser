Non-responders (those who do not respond\n      clinically, radiographically, or both) will be referred for an FDG PET/CT and initial AC\n      PET/CT within 3 weeks, and subsequently referred for stereotactic biopsy of their lesion\n      followed by focal laser treatment (in the same operative setting) within 3 weeks of AC\n      PET/CT.\n\n      Specific Goals/Questions:\n\n        1. What is the yield (sensitivity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive value) of\n           state-of-the-art PET/CT with C-11 Acetate in detecting recurrent disease versus post\n           treatment effects and pseudo-progression in this patient population?\n\n        2. How does the performance of PET with C-11 Acetate compare with that of PET using F-18\n           fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) and with that of MRI?\n\n        3. Evaluate the optimal timing for post injection imaging."
