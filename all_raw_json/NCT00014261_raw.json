PEG-interferon alfa-2B may interfere with the growth of cancer\n      cells. Combining temozolomide with PEG-interferon alfa-2B may be an effective treatment for\n      advanced solid tumors.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining temozolomide and\n      PEG-interferon alfa-2B in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors."

Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 1-9 patients receive escalating doses of temozolomide and PEG-interferon alfa-2b\n      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose\n      preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 24 patients will be accrued for this study."
