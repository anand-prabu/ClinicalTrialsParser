    <textblock>
      A study to evaluate levosimendan compared with placebo in reducing the composite event rate
      of all-cause death, perioperative MI, need for new dialysis, or use of mechanical assist
      (IABP or LVAD) in subjects with reduced ejection fraction undergoing cardiac surgery on
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).

      This study is being done to evaluate the efficacy of levosimendan compared with placebo in
      reducing the co-primary endpoints of 30-day composite of all-cause death or use of
      mechanical assist device (IABP or LVAD) or the composite event rate of all-cause death,
      perioperative MI, need for dialysis, or use of mechanical assist (IABP or LVAD) in subjects
      with reduced ejection fraction undergoing cardiac surgery on CPB.

             days.

          -  Known allergic reaction or sensitivity to Levosimendan or excipients.

          -  Received commercial Levosimendan within 30 days before the planned start of study
             drug.
