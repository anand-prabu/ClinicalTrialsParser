    <description>The immunogenicity potential of FSH in healthy volunteer will be assessed by analysing serum samples collected at different timepoints during two treatment cycle for oocytes donation: cycle 1, serum samples will be collected before treatment start (baseline), after 7-13 days and after 28 days of treatment; Cycle 2: serum samples will be collected before starting the second cycle (baseline 2), after 7-13 days and after 28 days of treatment. Cycle 1 and cycle 2 will be separated by a wash-out period of two months.</description>
