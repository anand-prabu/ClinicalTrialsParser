To date, there is no guideline for PIG and no direct comparison of two PIG\n      techniques. The proposed pilot study is to compare the two different types of PIG techniques\n      in head and neck cancer patients who require prophylactic enteral feeding by PIG. The\n      purpose of the study is to assess the feasibility of a large randomized clinical trial to\n      compare these two PIG techniques."
