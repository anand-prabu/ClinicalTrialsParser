  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early intervention refers to the provision of early detection, early diagnosis, and early
      intervention for infants and young children with special needs. The implementation of home
      programs is very important for children with developmental delay (DD). Therefore, the
      purposes of this study are to: (1) design the preschool home program activities(PHPA), (2)
      investigate the immediate efficacy of PHPA for children with DD, (3) investigate the
      long-term efficacy of PHPA for children with DD.The second year is to investigate the
      immediate efficacy of PHPA for children with DD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 36 children with DD, aged 2-6 years, were randomly assigned to the
      professional-based group (professional therapists delivering the PHPA, total n=13),
      parents-based group (parents executing the PHPA, n=12) and control group (health education
      only, n=11). Outcome measures included clinical assessments and subjective questionnaires.
      The clinical assessments were Comprehensive Developmental Inventory for Infants and Toddlers
      (CDIIT). The subjective questionnaires were Chinese Child Developmental Inventory (CCDI),
      Assessment of preschool children's participation (APCP), TN0-AZL Preschool quality of life
      (TAPQOL) and parent stress index (PSI). Tests were administrated before and after the
      intervention.
