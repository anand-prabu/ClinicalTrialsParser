Laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) is a standard\n      step prior to the GFA procedure but has not been a standard step prior to LM. Incorporating\n      laparoscopic ultrasound as a first step prior to both treatments allows the surgeon to have\n      equal access to valuable imaging information and to plan treatment accordingly. By\n      randomizing the subject immediately after laparoscopic ultrasound, selection bias toward one\n      treatment or the other following the LUS is eliminated."
