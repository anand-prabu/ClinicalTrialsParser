T cells expressing 1st generation anti-GD2 chimeric\n      antigen receptors (CARs) were safe and mediated modest antitumor activity in some patients\n      with refractory neuroblastoma.\n\n      A 3rd generation anti-GD2-CAR (GD2-CAR.OX40.28.z.ICD9) has been produced and holds promise\n      for increased activity compared to the 1st generation GD2-CAR already studied in clinical\n      trials. As an added safety measure, the vector includes a suicide switch comprising a\n      caspase dimerization domain (ICD9) that can be activated by a small molecule to induce death\n      of the genetically engineered cells if they were induce untoward toxicity.\n\n      Objectives\n\n      Primary: Determine the feasibility of producing anti GD2-CAR cells meeting the established\n      release criteria and to assess the safety of administering escalating doses of anti-GD2-CAR\n      engineered T cells in children and young adults with non-neuroblastoma, GD2+ solid tumors\n      following cyclophosphamide-based lymphodepletion.\n\n      Secondary:\n\n      1) Determine if administration anti-GD2-CAR engineered T cells mediate antitumor effects in\n      children and young adults with GD2+ solid tumors; 2) Measure persistence of adoptively\n      transferred anti-GD2-CAR T cells and correlate this with antitumor effects; 3) Extend\n      information regarding the prevalence and intensity of GD2 expression in non-neuroblastoma,\n      non-osteosarcoma solid tumors in children and young adults; 4) If unacceptable toxicity\n      occurs that is possibly, probably or likely related to anti-GD2-CAR T cells, assess the\n      capacity for AP1903, a dimerizing agent, to mediate clearance of the genetically engineered\n      cells and resolve toxicity; and 5) Assess toxicity of AP1903 if administered to mediate\n      clearance of anti-GD2-CAR T cells.\n\n      Eligibility\n\n      Patients 1-35 years of age, at least 15 kg, with osteosarcoma or a GD2+ solid tumor\n      (excluding neuroblastoma) that has recurred after or not responded to standard theapy and is\n      deemed incurable by standard therapy.\n\n      Design\n\n      After apheresis to collect T cells for transduction, patients receive cyclophosphamide\n      1800mg/m(2)/d as a lymphodepleting regimen. A phase I cell dose escalation scheme will used\n      at 4 dose levels (1 x 10(5) transduced T cells/kg; 1 x 10(6) transduced T cells/kg; 3 x\n      10(6) transduced T cells/kg; and 1 x 10(7) transduced T cells/kg), using a standard 3 plus 3\n      dose escalation design. An expanded group of a total of 12 patients will be treated at the\n      highest dose, comprising at least 6 osteosarcoma patients.\n\n      Patients will be monitored for toxicity, antitumor effects and persistence of anti-GD2-CAR T\n      cells.\n\n      Patients with a PR, SD may receive a 2nd cycle at the next higher dose level a minimum of 28\n      days following completion of the first cycle if eligibility criteria are met.\n\n      A maximum of 36 patients may be treated on this study. Given that there is likelihood that\n      some patients with non-osteosarcoma will not meet the criteria for GD2 expression to be\n      eligible for enrollment, up to 72 subjects will be screened to enroll a maximum of 36\n      patients for treatment. Up to 2-3 patients will be accrued per month, and therefore this\n      study may require up to 2-3 years to complete enrollment and treatment."

(Gilbert   s syndrome is found in\n                  3-10% of the general population, and is characterized by mild, chronic\n                  unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the absence of liver disease or overt\n                  hemolysis). NOTE: Adult values will be used for calculating hepatic toxicity and\n                  determining eligibility, as is standard on POB phase I trials.\n\n               8.

Concurrent Illnesses\n\n             Clinically significant systemic illness (e.g. serious active infections or\n             significant cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction), that in the\n             judgment of the PI would compromise the patient   s ability to tolerate protocol\n             therapy or significantly increase the risk of complications.\n\n             Peripheral nerve symptoms from prior therapies or from tumor compression >  grade 1.\n\n          2. Untreated CNS metastasis\n\n             Extradural masses that have not invaded the brain parenchyma or parameningeal tumors\n             without evidence for leptomeningeal spread will not render the patient ineligible.\n             Patients with previous CNS tumor involvement that has been treated and is stable for\n             at least 6 weeks following completion of therapy are eligible.\n\n          3. Prior Therapy\n\n             Previous treatment with genetically engineered GD2-CAR T cells. Previous vaccine\n             therapy, anti-GD2 mAb therapy or therapy with other genetically engineered T cells is\n             not an exclusion criteria.\n\n          4.
