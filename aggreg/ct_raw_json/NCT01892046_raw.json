Inhibitors of the chaperone protein Hsp90 are of current interest because of the\n      central role of Hsp90 in the maturation and maintenance of numerous proteins that are\n      critical for tumor cell viability and growth. SNX-5422 is a pro-drug of SNX-2112, a potent,\n      highly selective, small-molecule inhibitor of the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90\n      (Hsp90). The study will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SNX-5422 when combined\n      with carboplatin plus paclitaxel in selected solid tumors and assess the safety and efficacy\n      of SNX-5422 alone dosed at the MTD as maintenance therapy in selected solid tumors\n      treatment."
