  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that the natural supplement Capros will decrease LDL levels,
      platelet aggregation, and serum concentrations of high sensitivity C-reactive protein in
      humans at risk for cardiovascular disease.

  <detailed_description>

      A non-randomized, longitudinal study to determine the effect of Capros supplementation on a
      lipid profile, platelet aggregation and high-sensitivity C - reactive protein in 30
      volunteers at risk for cardiovascular disease.

      -Herbal Polyphenols/Antioxidants: Role in Cardiovascular Disease Prevention: Phenolic
      compounds are dietary antioxidants found in plants that are shown to inhibit LDL oxidation,
      inhibit platelet aggregation and adhesion, decrease total and LDL cholesterol, and induce
      endothelium-dependent vaso-relaxation. [Lapointe, Vita, and Mendes]. Epidemiologic studies
      suggest that higher polyphenol intake from fruits and vegetables is associated with
      decreased risk for cardiovascular disease. Among the numerous plausible mechanisms by which
      polyphenols may offer cardiovascular protection, improvement of the endothelial function and
      inhibition of angiogenesis and cell migration and proliferation in blood vessels have been
      the focuses of recent studies. Antioxidants in polyphenols, in addition to protecting LDL
      cholesterol against oxidation, may act at a vascular cell level by limiting cellular
      production of reactive oxygen species, and, thus, cell-mediated LDL oxidation. In
      traditional Indian medicine, the gooseberry (Phyllanthus emblica) has been used for
      thousands of years as an effective source of polyphenols and antioxidants. &quot;P. emblica is
      considered beneficial against various diseases namely cancer, diabetes, liver treatment, and
      various other diseases.&quot;[Hiraganahalli]. CaprosÂ®, from Natreon, Inc., is a cascading
      antioxidant ingredient derived from Phyllanthus emblica. It has been used in cosmetics and
      food-and-beverage formulations in many countries, and, based on extensive scientific
      research, also shows particular promise as a dietary supplement.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients 21-70 years of age

          -  BMI 25-35

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  BMI &gt; 35 OR &lt; 25

          -  Smokers

          -  Individuals who are deemed unable to understand the procedures, risks and benefits of
             the study, i.e. Informed consent will be excluded

          -  Females who are pregnant as well as individuals who are therapeutically
             immuno-compromised will also be excluded in order to minimize the risk to such
             individuals (and fetus) and to decrease statistical variability and to minimize
             potential of confounders.

          -  Candidates for inclusion into the study will not include individuals as defined in 45
             CFR 46 Subparts B, C and D, nor from any other population which may be considered
             vulnerable. Pregnant women are excluded to minimize the risk to such individuals (and
             fetus) and to decrease statistical variability and to minimize potential of
             confounders.
