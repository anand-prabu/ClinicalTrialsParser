  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, Phase IV prospective, observational study will evaluate patients, who have
      been diagnosed with Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration and have previously
      received either a standard intravitreal injection of ranibizumab or aflibercept, in order to
      get and compare information regarding post-injection inflammatory (irritation in the eye)2-3
      days post-injection.

      Additionally, patients will be evaluated for visual acuity and pain 2-3 days post-injection.

      THIS IS AN OBSERVATION STUDY AND NOT AN INTERVENTIONAL STUDY AS TO ENTER THIS STUDY SUBJECTS
      WILL HAVE HAD TO RECEIVED EITHER RANIBIZUMAB 0.5 MG OR AFIBERCEPT 2MG PRIOR TO ENTERING THE
      STUDY AND SIGNING CONSENT.  THIS STUDY IS TO OBSERVE THE SUBJECT POST-INJECTION RECEIVED
      BEFORE ENTERING THIS STUDY.

    <textblock>
      Patients, age 65 to 90, with Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration who present for
      treatment with intravitreal ranibizumab or aflibercept will be selected in this study.  300
      subjects from one site in the United States will be enrolled.

    <description>All eyes will be evaluated 2-3 days after injection and graded in terms of (a) aqueous cells, graded subjectively on a scale of 0-4, (b) aqueous flare, graded subjectively on a scale 0-4, (c) aqueous flare graded objectively with the FM-600 Kowa flare meter and (d) vitreous haze, graded subjectively on a scale of 0-4.</description>
