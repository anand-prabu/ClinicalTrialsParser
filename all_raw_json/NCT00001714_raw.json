The technique measures the difference in MT\n      effect between two symmetrically positioned off-resonance MT pulses in the positive and\n      negative frequency ranges.  Prior research with this technique in the kidney show a\n      difference in the macromolecular lineshape that correlates to a specific metabolite.  The\n      second approach, utilizing a subset of the acquisitions from the first approach, will test\n      newly developed formulation to calculate the macromolecular fraction, or fraction of proton\n      density that accounts for MT.  We foresee these measurements may significantly develop our\n      understanding of MT and introduce diagnostic and quantitative tools to study human tissues."
