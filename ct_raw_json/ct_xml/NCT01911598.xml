  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics an d antitumor
      activity of MEHD7945A in patients with recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the
      head and neck. Patients will receive MEHD7945A intravenou sly every 3 weeks in combination
      with a maximum of 6 cycles of either cisplatin plus 5-FU or carboplatin plus paclitaxel.
      Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity
      occurs.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head
             and neck (SCCHN) of mucosal origin (e.g., oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx,
             larynx) that is not amenable to further curative local therapy (e.g., surgery,
             radiation including re-irradiation) (1L R/M)

          -  Patients with unknown primary SCCHN presumed to be of head and neck mucosal origin
             are eligible if they meet all other entry criteria.

          -  For patients who present with de novo metastatic disease, no prior systemic
             chemotherapy is allowed.

          -  For patients with recurrent SCCHN, prior systemic therapy is allowed if it was given
             as part of their definitive therapy. If patients have received prior combined
             chemo-radiation therapy, they must be off therapy for at least 3 months.

          -  Consent to provide archival tumor tissue for biomarker testing

          -  Life expectancy &gt;/= 12 weeks

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of  0, 1, or 2

          -  Adequate bone marrow and organ function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Nasopharyngeal cancer

          -  Prior treatment with an investigational or approved agent for the purpose of
             inhibiting HER family members

               -  This includes, but is not limited to, cetuximab, panitumumab, erlotinib,
                  gefitinib, and lapatinib.

               -  Prior treatment with an EGFR inhibitor is allowed if it was administered as part
                  of definitive therapy for locally advanced disease and completed/terminated &gt;/=
                  3 months before study enrollment.

          -  Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to Day 1

          -  Leptomeningeal disease as the only manifestation of the current malignancy

          -  Active infection requiring antibiotics

          -  Active autoimmune disease that is not controlled by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
             drugs (NSAIDs)

          -  Symptomatic hypercalcemia requiring continued use of bisphosphonate therapy

          -  Current severe, uncontrolled systemic disease

          -  History of cardiac heart failure of New York Heart Association Class II or greater or
             serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment (except for atrial fibrillation and
             paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia)

          -  History of myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to Cycle 1, Day 1, or history
             of unstable angina

          -  Clinically significant history of liver disease, including viral or other hepatitis,
             current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis

          -  History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy other than that due to anticoagulation
             therapy

          -  Clinically significant GI bleeding within 6 months prior to Cycle 1, Day 1

          -  History of ILD

          -  History of severe (Grade 3 or 4) allergic or hypersensitivity reaction to therapeutic
             antibodies that required discontinuation of therapy

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

          -  Untreated/active CNS metastases (progressing or requiring anticonvulsants or
             corticosteroids for symptomatic control)

          -  Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or lactation

          -  Malignancies other than SCCHN within 5 years prior to randomization, with the
             exception of adequately treated basal or squamous cell skin cancer and carcinoma in
             situ of the cervix or skin (e.g., melanoma in situ)
