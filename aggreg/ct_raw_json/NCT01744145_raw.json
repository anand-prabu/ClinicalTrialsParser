This study will use a randomized, controlled clinical\n      trial design. The total number of patients enrolled will be 120, divided into two groups of\n      60 patients each. One group will have patients age 40 to 60 and second group will have\n      patients age 60 and above. Stratified randomization will be done to divide these into two\n      (control group and intervention group) equal groups with 30 patients each. The primary\n      endpoint is improvement in quality of life indices. Secondary endpoints are improvement in\n      functional status, change in 6 minute walk test, exercise intolerance, immunization, occult\n      desaturation and change in body weight of patients hospitalized for community acquired\n      pneumonia with a multi-disciplinary program of exercise, education and, psychological\n      support. Eligibility includes age 40 and above at the time of admission, diagnosis of CAP\n      and HCAP via radiographic and PNA symptoms, discharge to home, ability to read and sign\n      informed consent to participate, ability to perform procedures/exercises involved in the\n      study and ability to comprehend educational component of program."
