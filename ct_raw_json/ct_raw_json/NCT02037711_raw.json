These effects may result in the irritation of\n      peritoneal nerves causing visceral pain, as commonly reported after laparoscopic procedures\n      in pediatrics.\n\n      The study hypothesis is that Intraperitoneal local anesthetic (levobupivacaine)\n      instillation can provide pain relief after laparoscopic surgery, but local anesthetic\n      distribution may not always be uniform throughout the peritoneal surface. Many methods were\n      tried for intraperitoneal application of local anesthetics in laparoscopic surgery such as\n      local anesthetic (LA) instillation and LA nebulization.\n\n      -But these methods are not widely used in pediatrics upon our knowledge"
