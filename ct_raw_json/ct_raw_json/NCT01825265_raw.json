            "textblock": "Docetaxel is a drug approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who\n      are either newly diagnosed or have failed earlier chemotherapy. RAD001 is an investigational\n      drug that has shown to have anticancer properties. It also works by weakening the immune\n      system. RAD001 works by blocking some of the steps required for cancer growth. The\n      researcher hopes that RAD001 may increase the anticancer activity  of docetaxel.\n\n      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive docetaxel by\n      vein on Day 1 over one hour. RAD001 will be given by mouth on Days 1 and 8. RAD 001 will be\n      given on an empty stomach or after a light meal. You will repeat this treatment every 21\n      days.  Three (3 ) weeks equals 1 cycle.\n\n      Patients who participated on the first phase of study numbered 2004-0758 will be eligible\n      for the study. The study will done using the highest dose of RAD001 and docetaxel that was\n      found to be safe and effective during the first phase of the study.\n\n      Dexamethasone will be given by mouth twice a day for 3 days, starting the day before you\n      receive docetaxel.  Dexamethasone helps decrease the risk of and control nausea, vomiting,\n      and fluid retention.\n\n      Blood (between 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests at each visit.  X-rays and\n      scans (CT or MRI) will be done every 6 weeks to see if the tumor is responding to treatment.\n\n      After 6 cycles of the combination, docetaxel will be stopped and you will continue to take\n      RAD001 alone. However, you may be able to take more than 6 cycles of the combination if you\n      are not having any side effects and is found to be of benefit by your primary doctor.\n\n      Once you go off treatment, you will have a physical exam, including routine blood tests (1-2\n      teaspoons).\n\n      This is an investigational study.   Docetaxel is approved by the FDA and commercially\n      available for the treatment of breast cancer. RAD001 is authorized for use in research only.\n      About 65 patients will take part in the study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson."
