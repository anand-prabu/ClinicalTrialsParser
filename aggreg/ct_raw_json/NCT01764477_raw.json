PRI-724 is being developed as a potential antineoplastic agent.\n\n      Purpose:\n\n      To determine the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) of sequential escalating doses per cohort of PRI-724 administered in\n      combination with gemcitabine to patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas that is locally\n      advanced, metastatic, or otherwise inoperable, who are candidates for second-line therapy\n      after failing first-line therapy with FOLFIRINOX (i.e., folinic acid [leucovorin],\n      fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin)\n\n        -  PRI-724:  320, 640, 905 mg/m2/day, continuous intravenous (CIV) infusion over 24 h,\n           daily \u00d7 7 days, 1 week on with 1 week recovery \u00d7 2 (4 weeks equals 1 cycle)\n\n        -  Gemcitabine:  1000 mg/m2 IV over 30 minutes; 3 weeks on with 1 week recovery (4 weeks\n           equals 1 cycle)\n\n      Patients with documented, measurable or evaluable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas that is\n      locally advanced, metastatic, or otherwise inoperable, who are candidates for second-line\n      therapy after failing first-line therapy with FOLFIRINOX, will be entered into this phase\n      1b, multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation per cohort study.  The trial is\n      designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, DLT(s), and MTD of escalating doses of\n      PRI-724, a CBP/ \u03b2- catenin inhibitor, when administered in combination with a standard dose\n      of gemcitabine.  Correlative studies include characterization of the PK profiles of PRI-724\n      and gemcitabine, evaluation of the utility of potential PD markers of PRI-724 activity, as\n      well as preliminary assessment of the antineoplastic activity of PRI-724 plus gemcitabine in\n      this patient population."
