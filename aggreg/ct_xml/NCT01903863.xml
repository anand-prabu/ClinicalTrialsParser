  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of scheduled fresh frozen plasma (FFP)
      administration on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) pump longevity in critically
      ill pediatric and neonatal patients. Almost all ECMO patients receive multiple FFP
      transfusions during their ECMO course. The investigator proposes that scheduled FFP may
      maintain pro and anticoagulation balance thus mitigating the need for expensive and
      dangerous ECMO pump changes. In addition, this may lead to less overall transfusion with all
      products (red blood cells, platelets, and FFP) if coagulation homeostasis is maintained. The
      subjects will be neonatal and pediatric patients requiring ECMO support for any reason in
      the pediatric and pediatric cardiac critical care units. Subjects will be randomized to
      receive every other day FFP infusions or FFP administration per current standard of care.
      ECMO pump longevity (hours) and FFP use will be compared between the two groups There is a
      small risk that study subjects may receive more FFP transfusions and therefore have the
      increased associated risks however it is also possible that these subjects may benefit from
      less ECMO circuit changes and/or fewer transfusions of all blood products.

    <description>Fresh frozen plasma is a pooled blood product containing both pro and anticoagulation factors.  Patients enrolled in the intervention arm will receive scheduled fresh frozen plasma treatment every 48 hours.  Patients in the control arm will receive fresh frozen plasma per current institutional standard of care.  This includes supplementation for clotting/bleeding diatheses, volume replacement, or after 3 red blood cell transfusions in a 24 hour period.</description>
