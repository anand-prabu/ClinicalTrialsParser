      The purpose of this study is to assess the utility of FDG PET/CT in evaluating response of
      bone dominant breast cancer to therapy. Eligible patients with bone dominant ER+ breast
      cancer will undergo baseline FDG PET/CT for evaluation of their disease, after the start of
      therapy they will undergo an FDG PET/CT scan at 4 weeks and again at 12 weeks. PET/CT
      results will be compared to clinical measures of response, time to progression and overall
      survival.

        A total of up to 75 subjects, age 18 years, with a diagnosis or estrogen receptor positive
        (ER+) breast cancer, with clinical evidence of bone dominant stage IV disease will be
        enrolled in this study. This study will enroll both women and men but it is anticipate
        that the majority of subjects will be women due to the small percentage of breast cancer
        patients that are male.

             (with the majority of the disease burden in the bone)

          -  Patients planning to start new endocrine targeted therapy (any line of therapy is
             acceptable and any endocrine therapy is allowed)

          -  Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits and serial imaging procedures

          -  Agrees to allow access to clinical records regarding response to treatment and long
             term follow up 6. Be informed of the investigational nature of this study and provide
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Women who are pregnant or breast feeding

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (fasting glucose greater than 200 mg/dL)

          -  Inability to tolerate imaging procedures (e.g. claustrophobia, severe pain)

          -  Weight exceeding capacity of imaging table

          -  Previous treatment with radiation or surgery to a significant percentage of bony
             metastatic sites 6. Treatment with marrow stimulating agents (e.g. granulocyte colony
             stimulating factor (GCSF)) within 3 weeks of baseline scan
