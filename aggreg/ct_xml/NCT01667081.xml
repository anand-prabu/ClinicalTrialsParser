  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This three-year multicenter study is being done to follow participants who received at least
      one dose of MK-5172 in a previous study to determine if they remain hepatitis C virus
      (HCV)-RNA negative over time, and to determine if they have developed antiviral resistance.
      The study will also evaluate long-term adverse events in this population.
