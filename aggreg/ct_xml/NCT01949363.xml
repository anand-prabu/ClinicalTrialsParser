    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I, open label, non-randomized, dose-frequency escalation
      pharmacokinetics study among 30 healthy male and female subjects, aged 18 to 45 years to
      determine the pharmacokinetics and safety of high-, multi-dose cefixime for the treatment of
      reduced susceptibility gonorrhea. Stage 1(Cohorts A and B) will examine the pharmacokinetics
      of single 400mg and 800mg dose of cefixime. Stage 2(Cohorts C and D) subjects will take
      800mg of cefixime every 12 hours for 2 doses. If that dosing regimen is well tolerated, the
      dose-frequency will escalate to 800mg every 8 hours for 3 doses, and serum levels of
      cefixime will be measured. Stage 3(Cohort E) will evaluate the highest tolerated dose of
      cefixime co-administered with a single oral dose of azithromycin 1 gram orally once in order
      to determine the tolerability of the regimen and whether there are significant changes in
      cefixime pharmacokinetics when the drugs are administered together. Study duration is
      approximately 49 weeks.

      This study is a Phase I, open label, non-randomized, dose-frequency escalation
      pharmacokinetics study among 30 healthy male and female subjects, aged 18 to 45 years to
      determine the pharmacokinetics and safety of high-, multi-dose cefixime for the treatment of
      reduced susceptibility gonorrhea. The study will occur in three stages as described below.
      Stage 1: Confirm/establish the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 400mg and 800mg doses of cefixime
      tablet. Stage 2: Define dosing frequency necessary to achieve total serum cefixime levels
      that exceed 2.0 mcg/mL for over 20 hours. Stage 3: Evaluate whether co-administration of
      azithromycin with a high, multi-dose cefixime regimen changes the pharmacokinetics of
      cefixime. Stage 1 (Cohorts A and B): Six subjects will be admitted to the Johns Hopkins
      Bayview Clinic Trials Unit to assess each dosing regimen, for a total of 12 subjects. At
      time=0, subjects will undergo baseline serum cefixime levels, followed by ingestion of
      cefixime. Serum collections will occur at times 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours.
      Cohort B will have the same serum collection time points as Cohort A. Cohorts A &amp; B will be
      run nearly simultaneously as logistically feasible. Stage 2 (Cohorts C and D): After
      determining the PK parameters of single dose 800mg, the PK simulation model will be
      repeated, adjusting the model as needed based on findings from study Stage 1. Assuming there
      are no major discrepancies between Figure 2 (above) and the new PK simulations, the
      following regimens will be tested, beginning with Cohort C. Six subjects per dosing regimen,
      Cohorts C and D, will be admitted to the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, for a total
      of 12 subjects. The 800mg q12 hour x 2 regimen (Cohort C) will be tested first. For Cohort
      C, serum cefixime levels will be drawn at 12, 16, and 26 hours.  If the q12 regimen is
      deemed safe and tolerable after review by the SMC, Cohort D will commence with the 800mg q8
      hour x 3 regimen. Total serum cefixime levels will be drawn for Cohort D at 8, 16, 20 and 26
      hours (see Section 7.2).  Stage 3 (Cohort E): After establishing a safe, tolerable and
      effective treatment regimen in Stage 2, Stage 3 will determine if cefixime levels change
      with the addition of azithromycin. Six subjects will be admitted to the Johns Hopkins
      Bayview Medical Center. Cefixime serum levels will be measured following administration of a
      1-gram dose of azithromycin with the chosen cefixime drug regimen established in Stage 2.
      Serum specimen collection times will be determined based on the dosing regimen chosen. All
      Stages, All Cohorts: All samples collected for PK analysis will be shipped to the University
      of Toledo, Dr. Jeffrey Blumer's HPLC lab for processing.  Specimens will be analyzed by high
      performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for total cefixime concentration levels. Targeted
      clinical evaluations will be used to monitor for subject reported side effects. Subjects
      will be asked about specific symptoms they may have experienced, including abdominal pain,
      nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, flatulence, headache, and rash, or any other symptoms.
      Additionally, subjects will be asked to maintain a Subject Diary (Appendix E) from Study Day
      0 through Day 7 to record information about any symptoms experienced or medications taken.
      Study duration is approximately 49 weeks.
