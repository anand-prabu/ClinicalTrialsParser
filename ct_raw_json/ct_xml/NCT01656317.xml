  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study's main objective will be to assess which effect early initiated rehabilitation has
      on the frequency of complications and the level of physical and cognitive functioning after
      aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).

      To this end the following aspects will be investigated:

      The frequency of complications (with special emphasis on pulmonary
      complications,thromboembolic events, cerebral vasospasm, unintended discontinuation of
      drains and lines)

        -  Length of stay in hospitals and socio-economic impact

        -  Physical and cognitive function in the early and chronic phase after SAH

        -  Health-related quality of life and participation in society in the chronic phase

    <textblock>
      Oslo University Hospital (OUS) is the primary hospital for Health Region South-East
      regarding treatment of patients with SAH. Approximately 120 patients are referred annually.
      OUS,Rikshospitalet, Dept of Neurosurgery offers 24/7 service of surgical and vascular
      aneurysm repair performed by a dedicated vascular team.

      Patients admitted in 2012 are treated in accordance to the standard institutional protocol
      plus an early rehabilitation model adapted to SAH, while patients admitted in 2011 who did
      not receive any early rehabilitation, but apart from that were treated identically, serve as
      a  control group.

      All patients admitted to the intermediate unit at OUS in 2011 and 2012 with aneurysmal SAH
      and repaired aneurysm will be invited to participate in this study. Examination of the
      patients from both 2011 and 2012 will be performed as part of routine, neurosurgical follow-
      up which is in the early phase at 3-6 months and in the chronic phase at least 12 months
      post SAH.       Exclusion criteria for participation in the study: unsecured ruptured
      aneurysm, symptomatic aneurysm without rupture, previous SAH or brain injury, diagnosis of a
      neurodegenerative disorder, patients from other health regions or tourists, patients that
      were treated at the intensive care unit (ICU )only.
