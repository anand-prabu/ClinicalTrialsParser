Two  sponge electrodes are placed, soaked in saline solution, fixed by an elastic band, the anode consists of an electrode oblong 8cm2 positioned at M1 area  on the lower limb affection (following the medial sagittal axis, with the center of the electrode positioned at one centimeter laterally to the vertex) while the cathode (48cm2) is placed in the contralateral supraorbitale area as reference electrode.\nThe current reaches 0.5mA and decreases with a ramp of 10 seconds."

            "textblock": "Stroke is one of the major causes of disability in the Western world. Initially gait is the\n      most affected function, 80% of patients lose this ability.\n\n      Rehabilitation in stroke patients improves walking abilities in terms of gait and related\n      gait activities, though six months after stroke many patients are significantly disabled.\n\n      Recently, a prospective study of 205 stroke patients showed that approximately 21% of\n      patients have a significant decrease of mobility between the first and the third year after\n      stroke. The main finding showed that inactivity was the most important factor for the\n      mobility decline.\n\n      Evidence about effects of direct current brain stimulation on motor recovery function of\n      lower limb are still little, some show that quadriceps strength after stimulation of damaged\n      M1 area increased. Another study where tDCS was associated with robotic gait  training did\n      not report any effect compared to treatment alone. It is necessary to define if a different\n      dosage of stimulation or the association of tDCS with gait training can improve walking and\n      if further studies are required to investigate their effectiveness.\n\n      The aim of this clinical trial is to test the possibility of gait improvement through the\n      association of tDCS with a specific task-oriented circuit training for walking abilities,\n      balance and mobility."
