      The aim of this study is to assess the long-term safety of exenatide in patients with type 2
      diabetes who were treated with exenatide in Study H8O-MC-GWAA (6-month study) or Study
      H8O-MC-GWAD (12-month study).  Study H8O-MC-GWAN serves as an open-ended extension to
      Studies H8O-MC-GWAA and H8O-MC-GWAD.
