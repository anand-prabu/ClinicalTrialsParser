Each year 15 million\n      people worldwide are attacked by stroke. In Denmark stroke hits 14.000 people a year and is\n      the third leading cause of death. In this research project, we will examine the heart rate\n      of more than 1,500 patients whom within 1 week has had a blood clot in the brain (ischemic\n      stroke) or have had symptoms of a blood clot in the brain, which has dwindled within 24\n      hours (TIA). There are no clear international or national guidelines regarding the optimal\n      way to detect atrial fibrillation in stroke and TIA patients, though atrial fibrillation is\n      known to increase fivefold the risk of stroke. Holter recording with two days\n      electrocardiogram is considered as the golden standard for investigation of heart rhythm\n      disturbances and is offered at Department of Neurology in Holstebro, where we recruit\n      patients. Holter recording is a resource-intensive procedure in data analysis. Project\n      patients will be mounted with a 2- day Holter and Rtest for either 2 or 7 days. The Rtest is\n      a loop recorder and a new device on the market that continuously monitor and opposite a\n      Holter recorder, automatically analyses heart rhythm. The validity of the Rtest with regard\n      to detect atrial fibrillation compared to Holter is unknown and is what we which to clarify.\n      Additionally we use the 2-day Holter recordings to test whether short-term rhythm disorders\n      as atrial fibrillation <30 seconds, and/or many extra heartbeats (supraventricular extra\n      systoles) increases the risk of stroke recurrence. Patients will be followed in the Danish\n      Stroke Register. If an increased risk is found, these gray area patients who are currently\n      not offered anticoagulant therapy, may prove to have treatment indication. If the study\n      shows that loop recording can replace Holter recording it will mean an economic gain. The\n      study is expected to contribute substantial evidence for the future treatment of stroke and\n      TIA patients.Stroke constitutes a major health problem both nationally and globally.
