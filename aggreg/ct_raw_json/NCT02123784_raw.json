Repair of rotator cuff tears is\n      usually advocated for painful tears with functional impairment. However, high failure rates\n      of 13-68% have been reported for surgical repair of rotator cuff tears, irrespective of the\n      surgical technique employed. Higher rates of re-rupture are associated with larger tears,\n      increased patient age, and increased fatty degeneration of the cuff muscles. There is no\n      general consensus as to the causes of re-rupture; where mechanical factors, the existing\n      techniques of suturing, and biological factors are considered as the main factors of\n      recurrence."
