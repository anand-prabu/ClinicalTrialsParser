In the first treatment period,\n      patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n      Arm I:  Patients receive enteric coated pancrelipase with bicarbonate (PANCRECARB) capsules\n      before meals and snacks for 7 consecutive days.\n\n      Arm II:  Patients receive their usual enteric coated pancreatic enzyme without bicarbonate\n      capsule before meals and snacks for 7 consecutive days.\n\n      Patients receive approximately 50% of their usual lipase dose during treatment.  Food intake\n      is recorded on days 1-3, food intake is weighed and recorded on days 4-7, and stools are\n      collected over 72 hours on days 5-7 to determine fecal fat and nitrogen excretion.\n      Anthropometric measurements including height, weight, and skinfolds are assessed.\n\n      In the second treatment period, patients are switched to the alternate treatment arm after a\n      3 day washout period.  Patients receive the opposing treatment as per protocol."
