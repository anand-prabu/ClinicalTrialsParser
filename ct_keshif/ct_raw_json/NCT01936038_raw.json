            "textblock": "The obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) is a breathing disorder which\n      happens at night and consists of the interruption of airflow for more than five seconds. His\n      current treatment by continuous positive pressure nocturnal machine (CPAP) is not curative\n      and therefore the level of compliance is key to patient improvement. Many patients don\u00b4t\n      tolerate CPAP by the numerous side effects involved. The Upper Airway Toning is a compendium\n      of non-invasive techniques that aim to assist tolerance and compliance with the CPAP. These\n      techniques are: oropharyngeal exercises executed actively by the patient for the muscle\n      toning of the upper airways, electrostimulation of the muscles in the floor of the mouth,\n      correction of the tongue position, nasal and bronchial fogging, execution of respiratory\n      gymnastics, therapy myofascial in the oropharyngeal muscles, manual therapy in the cervical\n      column,and massage in the diaphragm. All the techniques together seek for a greater or\n      lesser impact on the upper airways hypotony, the hypotony of the tongue and the soft palate,\n      the jaw retrognathism, the mouth breathing, the vertebrobasilar syndrome, the\n      gastroesophageal reflux, the excessive accumulation of secretions in the upper and lower\n      airways, the obstructive and restrictive respiratory problems, the sleeping posture, the\n      hypertonia of the diaphragm due to the excess effort in trying to overcome the respiratory\n      obstruction. All these disfunctions will make easier for the patient to show side effects in\n      the use of CPAP. There will be a double-blind randomized controlled study with 110\n      individuals. One group will follow the conventional medical treatment with CPAP and the\n      other group medical treatment plus Upper Airway Toning. After six months, the mean\n      improvement between the two groups will be compared."
