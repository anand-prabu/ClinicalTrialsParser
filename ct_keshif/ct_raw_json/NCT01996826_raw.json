In many cases these blood vessels lead to the graft\n      rejection and eventual failure of the corneal transplant. It is hoped that this treatment\n      will increase the chances of corneal graft survival.\n\n      The medication used in this study is called bevacizumab or Avastin (Genentech, Inc). It\n      works by inhibiting the action of a molecule called vascular endothelial growth factor\n      (VEGF). VEGF is a substance molecule that binds to certain cells to stimulate new blood\n      vessel formation. When VEGF is bound to the drug, it cannot stimulate the formation and\n      growth of new blood vessels. Growth of blood vessels into the cornea is a complication which\n      can worsen the prognosis of your corneal transplant and put the transplant at a higher risk\n      for rejection."
