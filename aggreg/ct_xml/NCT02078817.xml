      This study will test the use of ketamine for treatment of depression in adolescents that
      have not responded to other treatments. We will also examine neurobiological mechanisms of
      treatment.

    <textblock>
      Depression frequently emerges during adolescence and is associated with severe outcomes.
      Current interventions do not lead to remission for many adolescents. Treatment-resistant
      depression (TRD) in adolescence is an ominous prognostic indicator for a lifetime of
      suffering and increased risk for suicide. Efforts should be directed toward novel
      interventions that could alter this perilous course. Theoretically, restoration of healthy
      development during this critical window would substantially improve outcomes over the
      lifespan.

      Ketamine is a noncompetitive, high-affinity antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate type
      glutamate receptor that has long been used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia in
      children and adults, and recently has been investigated for its rapid antidepressant
      effects. Randomized, double-blind, saline-controlled trials in adults with TRD have
      demonstrated that a single, subanesthetic infusion of intravenous (IV) ketamine at 0.5 mg/kg
      over 40 minutes can produce a rapid (within 2 hours) antidepressant response (Ibrahim et
      al., 2011; Zarate et al., 2006). Recent evidence suggests that serial doses of ketamine may
      be even more effective and may lead to more prolonged remission (aan het Rot et al., 2010;
      Murrough et al., 2012). Our current research at using serial dosing of IV ketamine among
      adult veterans with TRD over a 2-week period has shown promising results, with a response
      rate of 92% among the 12 participants to date.

      No results from any studies examining effectiveness of either single-dose or serial-dose
      ketamine have yet been published in adolescents with TRD. Because of the ongoing
      neurodevelopment in adolescence, which is thought to confer enhanced neuroplasticity, it is
      possible that adolescents with TRD could show greater responses and more sustained remission
      than adults with TRD. The biological mechanisms of depression impacted by ketamine are only
      now being uncovered in adults (Zarate et al., 2013). Characterization of the neural
      mechanisms underlying ketamine response or non-response in adolescents with TRD will
      represent a significant advance. The specific aims of this preliminary study are as follows:

      Aim #1: To determine the efficacy of repeated-dose subanesthetic IV ketamine among
      adolescent patients with TRD.

      Hypothesis: Based on previous results in adults with TRD, we predict that response rates
      will improve over the course of six treatments of ketamine.

      Aim #2: To explore durability of antidepressant response to repeated dose of IV ketamine in
      a 4-week observational period.

      Hypothesis:  Based on the inherent neuroplasticity in adolescence due to ongoing
      neurodevelopment, adolescents may show a more durable clinical response than has been seen
      in adults.

      Aim #3: To study the neurobiological mechanisms of response to ketamine. We will examine
      relevant biological systems using several different brain imaging indices and measures of
      intracellular functioning from peripheral blood.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female adolescents aged 12 to 18 years.

          -  Presence of recurrent major depression without psychotic features confirmed by the
             K-SADS-PL (Kaufman et al., 1997).

          -  Current depression severity measured by the Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS)
             (Poznanski, 1985) raw score greater than or equal to 36 at screening and the day
             ketamine is due to be received for the first time.

          -  Current depressive episode resistant to treatment, defined as failure to achieve
             remission (elimination of symptoms and restoration of pre-morbid psychosocial
             functioning) from at least 2 antidepressant trials of different pharmacological
             classes. Systematic evaluation of previous antidepressant trials will be assessed by
             using the Antidepressant Treatment History Form (Sackeim, 2001).

          -  If present, current antidepressant medication treatment must be dose stable for at
             least 2 months prior to beginning the study. (Patients will continue with current
             antidepressant treatment throughout the study. Based on our experience in current
             research at the VA Medical Center using serial ketamine for adult TRD, patients have
             shown positive results while continuing their current antidepressant treatment.)
