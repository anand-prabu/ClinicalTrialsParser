Lifting of the anterior abdominal wall is aimed to increase the distance\n      between the abdominal wall and the intrabdominal structures. Elevation of the anterior\n      abdominal wall is recommended for the access to peritoneal cavity in literatures however the\n      benefit exactly has not proved. This study aimed to determine the distance from anterior\n      abdominal wall to intraperitoneal structures during lifting of the abdominal wall, to\n      represent this distance -on the average- generate the safe range whether or not and compare\n      with this distance and patient's age, BMI and parity."
