Females of childbearing age using contraception for at least 28 days prior to\n             receiving the dose of investigational product, and for 1 year after receiving IP.\n\n          4. Weight \u2265 45 kg and \u2264 110 kg at screening.\n\n          5. Healthy by medical history and physical examination at screening.\n\n          6.

Employees of the sponsor, clinical study site, or any other individuals involved with\n             the conduct of the study, or immediate family members of such individuals.\n\n          3.

Evidence of any systemic disease on physical examination at screening.\n\n         15. Evidence of infection (ie, positive laboratory test result) with hepatitis A, B, or C\n             virus or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at screening.\n\n         16. Any of the following at screening:\n\n               1. Hemoglobin < 12.0 g/dL for males and < 11.5 g/dL for females.\n\n               2. WBC count < 3,800/mm3.\n\n               3.

Other abnormal laboratory values in the screening panel, which in the opinion of\n                  the principal investigator, are judged to be clinically significant or\n                  potentially confound study results.\n\n         17. Pregnant or nursing mother.\n\n         18. Active alcohol or drug abuse or history of alcohol or drug abuse that, in the opinion\n             of the principal investigator, might compromise subject safety, study safety\n             assessments, or ability of subject to comply with study requirements.\n\n         19.
