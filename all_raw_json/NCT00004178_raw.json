PBL are activated in vitro and then\n      modified with recombinant chimeric anti-CEA immunoglobulin T cell receptors (Ig TCR). Ig TCR\n      modified T cells are reinfused over 30-60 minutes.\n\n      The estimated maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients\n      experience unacceptable toxicity. If the MTD is not reached within the first cohort, a\n      second cohort of 3 patients then receives 4 doses of modified T cells at a higher dose.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 weeks for 2 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-9 patients will be accrued for this study."
