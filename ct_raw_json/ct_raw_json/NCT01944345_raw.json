All patients who\n      agree to participate in the registry will sign an informed consent form and subsequently be\n      treated by their surgeon with the VariLift device. Potential treatment procedures include\n      bilateral posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF), unilateral transforaminal lumbar\n      interbody fusion (TLIF), or bilateral anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) for the lumbar\n      spine, or cervical unilateral or bilateral ACDF procedure. Surgical procedures can be\n      performed in either an inpatient or outpatient facility.  It is anticipated that the\n      VariLift devices will improve patient outcomes and lead to the development of treatment\n      pathways to improve patient care."
