Therefore, the investigators aim to adopt this method to\n           further identify the factor(s) from 86 patients with early hepatoma whom fulfill the\n           diagnostic criteria of Milan and accept complete RFA during hospitalization.\n\n        -  After RFA, informed consents are acquired from patients and the follow-up begins.\n           According to the follow-up data, patients are assigned to the recurrence group or the\n           un-recurrence group. The monitoring data of the risk factors was inputted to the Epi\n           Date software and the statistic was analyzed by SPSS 18.0. The statistical method\n           includes: Chi-square test for the comparison of rate, Logistical regression analysis\n           for the related risk factors and the independent risk factors."
