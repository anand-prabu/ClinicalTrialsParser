            "textblock": "It is anecdotally well known that patients snore more when their nose is blocked. However,\n      the therapeutic effect of improving nasal airway patency on snoring indices remains a point\n      of conjecture. Indeed, Braver et al examined the effect of a nasal vasoconstrictor and\n      failed to show any improvement in the number of snores after its application, although\n      apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI)seemed to decrease. Furthermore, Hoffstein et al documented that\n      dilation of the anterior nares in patients without nasal pathology has a relatively weak\n      effect on snoring, and routine use of nasal dilating appliances was not recommended for the\n      treatment of snoring. In contrast to the aforementioned studies, intranasal corticosteroids\n      have been shown to improve sleepiness and reduce AHI in patients with obstructive sleep\n      apnea (OSA) implying that there might be an equivalent result for the use of nasal steroids\n      on snoring indices.\n\n      Additionally, the present authors have demonstrated a strong correlation between\n      apnoea-hypopnoea index and oral/oro-nasal breathing epochs in patients with OSA and normal\n      nasal resistance and that nasal surgery is effective only in OSA patients who preoperatively\n      have decreased nasal breathing epochs.\n\n      It is plausible thus to suggest that snoring severity, in equivalence to OSA severity, might\n      be associated to oral/oro-nasal breathing epochs and that improving nasal patency by nasal\n      steroids might also increase nasal breathing epochs and lead to decreased snoring indices in\n      patients who had decreased nasal breathing before the administration of nasal steroids.\n\n      Patients will be randomized in two groups: the patients of the first group will undergo a\n      one week therapy of nasal budesonide, then two weeks of washout period, and thereafter one\n      week of nasal normal saline. The patients of the second group will undergo a one week\n      therapy of nasal normal saline, then two weeks of washout period, and thereafter one week of\n      nasal budesonide. Before and after each treatment regimen patients will undergo an\n      assessment, which will consist of anterior rhinomanometry and polysomnography with\n      concomitant measurement of snoring indices and breathing route pattern.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that the application for one week of nasal budesonide has a\n      beneficial effect on snoring indices in patients who present before the application\n      decreased proportion of nasal breathing epochs and in whom nasal budesonide succeeded in\n      increasing nasal breathing epochs."

This arrangement allows a non-invasive measurement of snoring that simulates\n      the distance between sleeping bed partners. Before every study the system would be\n      acoustically calibrated using a reference noise produced by a noise generator (86 dB). The\n      signal would be sent at a sampling rate of 12 KHz through an analogue-digital converter to a\n      computer system for subsequent analysis. All digitized signals will be recorded in the hard\n      disk of a personal computer. A noise analyzer (Praat; Boersma 2005) will be used for the\n      intensity analysis of snoring sound (Boersma, 2005)."
