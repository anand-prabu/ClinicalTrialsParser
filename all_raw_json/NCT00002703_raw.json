            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether high-dose radiotherapy using conformal photons with a\n      proton boost produces a 20% increase in the proportion of Stage I/II prostate cancer free\n      from local failure and biochemical relapse at 5 years when compared to results of\n      conventional-dose radiotherapy. II. Determine whether high-dose radiotherapy produces a 33%\n      reduction in the cumulative incidence of a rising PSA (second hormone failure) following\n      hormone therapy given at the time of first PSA/clinical failure when compared with\n      conventional-dose radiotherapy. IV. Assess the relative rectal, bladder, and sexual\n      morbidity of conformal photon doses of 70.2 and 79.2 Gy in these patients. V. Collect, in a\n      prospective manner, paraffin biopsy blocks for subsequent analysis of emerging molecular\n      pathologic predictors of outcome in three patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Arm I: Radiotherapy. Boost to the prostate using high-LET protons\n      followed by irradiation of the prostate, periprostatic tissues, and seminal vesicles using\n      conformal photons with energies greater than 6 MV. Conventional dose. Arm II: Radiotherapy.\n      As in Arm I. High dose.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 390 patients accrued into this study over 3 years. An\n      additional 3.5 years will be required for follow-up."
