Antiretroviral agents do not directly address the problem of immune\n      impairment. Replacement of IL-2 at nontoxic doses may prevent or delay clinical\n      immunosuppression and its attendant opportunistic infections. Also, since patients with\n      HIV-1 infection respond suboptimally to routine protein and polysaccharide immunizations,\n      IL-2 may provide an adjuvant effect on vaccine responses."
