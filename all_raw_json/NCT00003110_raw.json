Determine the objective response rate, response duration and survival of\n      patients receiving bleomycin as salvage therapy for AIDS-related or immunocompetent\n      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Assess the feasibility and toxicity of treatment for this\n      disease. III. Evaluate the quality of life of AIDS and non-AIDS patients with non-Hodgkin's\n      lymphoma.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by number of prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens, prior\n      radiotherapy, and HIV/AIDS status. Patients receive bleomycin by continuous infusion for 72\n      hours every 3 weeks. Induction therapy consists of 3 cycles. Patients who achieve complete\n      remission receive 2 more cycles. Patients with partial remission or stable disease may\n      continue therapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Quality of life\n      assessments are conducted at beginning of therapy, every 3 weeks, and at completion of\n      treatment. Patients are followed every 3 months for overall survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32 patients will be accrued."
