  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the present proposal is to assess whether medical simulation can
      enhance the safety and proficiency profile of paramedics performing prehospital endotracheal
      intubation, and whether feedback from an airway management expert observing the simulation
      enhances skill retention after 12 and 24 months. Since no validated proficiency assessment
      tool currently exists to measure the skill of paramedics in airway management, one will be
      developed and tested. Using this tool, 250 paramedics in central Ohio, will undergo
      simulation training similar to that required for certification. A baseline assessment of
      proficiency will be obtained. One group will be randomized to receive simulation training
      similar to that required for certification, while the other group will receive feedback from
      an airway management expert linked to the simulation test site via a 2-way audio-video feed.
      Both groups of paramedics will be reassessed at 12, and 24 months to determine whether skill
      level was maintained or whether skills deteriorated, and whether expert intervention had any
      impact on skill retention.

    <description>Employing a team of psychometric, human factors, and airway management experts, we propose to make refinements to our assessment tool so that it has objective measurement criteria, takes timing and sequencing of actions into account, provides reproducible scores, has high inter-rater reliability, and can be a valid measure of paramedic airway management proficiency and safety.</description>
