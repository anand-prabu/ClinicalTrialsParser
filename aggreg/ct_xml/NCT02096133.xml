  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have an increased risk of developing a major
      depression. The investigators observed a protective effect of high vitamin D levels on the
      risk of depression in MS. This might be driven by the effect of vitamin D on the
      stress-axis. Therefore, the main goal of the present study is to assess whether high dose
      vitamin D supplementation results in a suppression of the stress-axis, as measured by
      decreased levels of cortisol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The lifetime incidence of a major depression in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is 50%. (Patten et
      al. Neurology 2003; 61(11):1524-7) Our group reported a negative correlation between vitamin
      D status and depression score of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in a
      cross-sectional dataset of Dutch MS patients. (Knippenberg et al. Acta Neurol Scand 2011;
      124(3):171-5) This suggests an interaction between vitamin D and biological mechanisms
      affecting susceptibility to depression. Currently, we have two main hypotheses: 1) Vitamin D
      regulates the hypothalamic stress axis in MS. Based on our findings that cortisol releasing
      hormone (CRH)-positive hypothalamic neurons in the brains of MS patients stained positive
      for the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and 1,25(OH)2D-24-hydroxylase (24-OHase). (smolders et al.
      J Neuropathol Exp Neurol 2013;72(2):91-105) 2) Vitamin D affects T cell cytokine profile and
      hereby the odds of developing depression. Also in non-MS depressed patients increased levels
      of pro-inflammatory cytokines are detected (Maes et al. Metab Brain Dis 2009; 24: 27-53).
      Vitamin D3 has shown to be a potent promotor of T cell regulation both in vitro and in vivo.
      (Smolders et al. J Neuroimmunol 2008;194:7-17 and Smolders et al. PLoS One 2010;5:e15235)
      The main goal of this study is to assess whether supplementation of high doses vitamin D3
      results in a suppression of saliva cortisol day-curves in subjects with multiple sclerosis,
      and we will explore whether the pro-inflammatory cytokine profile of T lymphocytes is
      regulated.
