Each stratum is block randomized.\n\n      Patients are randomly assigned to surgery plus intensive physical therapy versus intensive\n      physical therapy alone.\n\n      The surgical procedure is a selective dorsal rhizotomy. Physical therapy (PT) includes\n      passive and active range of motion, facilitation of isolated muscle control, transitional\n      movements, strengthening, transfer skills, and gait training.  The PT schedule is 2-hour\n      sessions 5 days a week for 1 month, 1-hour sessions 5 days a week for 5 months, then a\n      standard therapy program for the remainder of the study (total of 6 months).  Parents\n      supervise exercise on non-PT days.\n\n      Patients are followed at 6, 12, and 24 months."
