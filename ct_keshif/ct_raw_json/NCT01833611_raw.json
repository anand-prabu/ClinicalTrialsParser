Out of range of\n      clinical recommendations for treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), chronic HBV carriers\n      with persistently normal ALT and viral load more than 10^5 copies/mL have progression of\n      liver disease during long-term follow-up. In addition, certain proportions of these patients\n      do have significant inflammation and fibrosis in liver histology. This study will be able to\n      identify who are at risk of liver disease progression and evaluate efficacy of ETV regarding\n      improvement of liver histology during short-term (1-year) and long-term ETV treatment\n      (3-year)."

Undetectable HBV DNA by the Roche TaqMan\u00ae HBV Test (limit of detection 60 IU/mL); HBV\n           DNA by PCR will also be evaluated as a continuous parameter;\n\n        2. The reduction of HBV DNA from baseline.\n\n      STUDY DESIGN This is a 3-year prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-control study.\n      Enrolled subjects will be allocated according to HBeAg status (HBeAg-positive and\n      HBeAg-negative), then randomized to ETV or placebo group.\n\n      ETV group: 1st year: ETV 0.5mg qd, then open with ETV 0.5mg qd for 2nd, 3rd year Placebo gr:\n      1st year: placebo, then open with ETV 0.5mg for 2nd, 3rd year\n\n      Dose of ETV: 0.5 mg/day Screening period: 6 weeks Timing of liver biopsy: baseline, 52th\n      week, 156th week NUMBER OF PATIENTS 130 (1:1)\n\n      STUDY PERIOD NOV 2007 ~ MAY 2011 DRUG ADMINISTRAITON Route: oral Dose: ETV 0.5 mg/day\n      Comparable placebo\n\n      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Sample size determination:\n\n      An evaluation of the efficacy of entecavir compared to placebo is planned. A test for\n      superiority of entecavir to placebo will be conducted that has high power to demonstrate\n      superiority if there are larger histologic improvements of clinical importance. Histologic\n      improvement after one year is estimated as 50% of entecavir treatment and 25% of placebo.\n      Thus, a sample size of 47 will be required for 90% of confidence level with 5% of error.\n      Finally, we estimate that it will be appropriate to enroll 65 patients in each arm due to\n      probably patients' withdrawal.\n\n      Statistical Analyses The difference in response rates for the Histologic Endpoint\n      (entecavir-placebo) along with its standard error and 95% confidence interval will be\n      computed. Subset analyses defined by prognostic variables [e.g. gender, and HBV DNA level]\n      for the Histologic Endpoint will be performed.\n\n      Change from baseline at Week 52 and 156 in Knodell Scores will also be summarized as a\n      continuous parameter. The secondary efficacy variables will also be summarized and compared\n      between the treatment groups."
