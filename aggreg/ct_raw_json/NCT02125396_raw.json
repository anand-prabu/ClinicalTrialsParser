Various therapies for use after hepatic resection have\n      been reported, but they are associated with adverse side effects or they fail to improve\n      overall survival. Nowadays, adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is recommended\n      as the most effective therapy for postoperative HCC. And the indication is patients with\n      risk factors of recurrence. While more and more prospective studies revealed that\n      radiotherapy is effective for advanced HCC. And the side effects of radiotherapy are\n      controlled. Until now, no prospective or retrospective study compared the efficacy of\n      adjuvant TACE and radiotherapy for postoperative HCC."
