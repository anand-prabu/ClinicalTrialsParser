The time difference in obtaining the two results\n      will also be examined. A total of 100 pediatric patients undergoing spinal surgery will be\n      enrolled and consented per protocol. Blood samples will be obtained simultaneously tested on\n      both the standard laboratory apparatus and the Coagcheck\u00ae device. If the two results are\n      comparable, this could have immediate clinical application and impact in the operating room\n      as POCT results are available within 2-3 minutes compared to 1-2 hours for standard\n      laboratory samples."
