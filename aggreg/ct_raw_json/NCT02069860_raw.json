Device survival probability after one year (product - limit estimator of Kaplan-Meier\n           Analysis).\n\n        2. An event is the primary failure of BAP, defined by necessity to remove the device: for\n           any medical reason (e.g. infections at wound or mastoid, thrombosis, and severe patient\n           discomfort)\n\n      SECONDARY ENDPOINTS\n\n        1.
