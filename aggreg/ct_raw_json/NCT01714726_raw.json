Approximately 120 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to initially\n      receive a fixed IV dose of MEDI2070 or placebo on Week 0(Day1) and Week 4 (Day 29) during\n      the 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, treatment period. At the completion of the\n      double-blind, placebo-controlled, treatment period (Week 12), subjects will have the option\n      to enter a 100-week, open-label, treatment period where they will receive open-label\n      MEDI2070 (SC) Q4W (Week 12 through Week 112). Subjects will be followed for safety at 3\n      visits over 28 weeks after their last dose of IP. Subjects will also be contacted by phone\n      36 weeks after their last dose of IP for safety."
