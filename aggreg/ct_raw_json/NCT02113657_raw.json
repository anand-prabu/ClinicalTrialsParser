            "textblock": "Study Drug Administration:\n\n      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive ipilimumab by\n      vein over about 90 minutes at Weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10.  Your blood pressure will be measured\n      every 30 minutes during the infusion, as well as an hour after you are finished receiving\n      the study drug.\n\n      You will continue to receive your current hormone therapy as scheduled.\n\n      You will be given standard drugs (such as steroids) to help decrease severe side effects.\n      You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      You will have a study visit before each dose of ipilimumab,  then every 4 weeks for 3 months\n      after the last dose of ipilimumab, then once every 12 weeks after that for as long as you\n      are receiving your standard hormone therapy and the your disease does not get worse.  At\n      each of these visits, the following tests and procedures will be performed:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.  This blood\n           will also be used and to measure your protein, PSA levels.\n\n        -  Blood (up to 7 tablespoons) will be collected to test for biomarkers, and to test your\n           immune system. (Weeks 7 and 10 only)\n\n        -  Blood (about 1\u00bd teaspoons) will be drawn to check your testosterone level. (Week 10\n           only)\n\n      If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have additional imaging studies (x-ray, CT\n      or MRI scans, and so on) to check the status of the disease.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You may receive the study drug for up to 10 weeks.  You will remain on study (receiving your\n      standard hormone therapy) for as long as the disease does not get worse.  You will be taken\n      off study treatment if you have intolerable side effects, if the disease gets worse, or if\n      you are unable to follow study directions. If you develop certain side effects or have\n      certain side effects for a long period of time, you may be taken off study. The study doctor\n      will let you know if you need to be taken off study.\n\n      End-of-Study Visit:\n\n      If the disease appears to get worse, you will have an end-of-study visit within 14 days. The\n      following tests and procedures will be performed:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.  This blood will also be\n           used and to measure your protein and PSA levels.\n\n        -  Blood (up to 7 tablespoons) will be collected to test for biomarkers, and to test your\n           immune system.\n\n        -  You will have the same imaging scans that you had at screening.\n\n      Long-Term Follow-Up:\n\n      The study staff will check up on you about every 6 months after your End-of-Study Visit.\n      This will consist of a phone call, an e-mail, or a review of your medical and/or other\n      records. If you are contacted by phone, the call will only last about 5 minutes.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Ipilimumab is FDA approved and commercially available for\n      the treatment of melanoma.  Its use to treat prostate cancer is investigational.\n\n      Up to 20 patients will take part in this study.  All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."
