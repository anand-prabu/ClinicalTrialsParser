After extubation, the administration\n      of intravenous Dexamethasone continued at the same dose every 12 h. for 48 h.\n\n      Another anesthesiologist who is unaware about kind of medication, will evaluate the patients\n      for severity of stridor. We will record the vital sings and grade of stridor every 6 hour.\n      Respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and oxygen saturation (SPO2)\n      were recorded for each patient immediately before aerosol administration (time 0) and at 30\n      and 60 min; and 2,4,8,12,24,36 and 48 hrs.
