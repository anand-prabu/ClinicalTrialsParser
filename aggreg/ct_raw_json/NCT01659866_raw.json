Traditionally prior to prostate biopsy, an antibiotic,\n      ciprofloxacin, has been given to men to prevent biopsy-related infections.  In recent years\n      as ciprofloxacin resistance has increased in the community, more and more men are becoming\n      infected with ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria after prostate biopsy.  This study is being\n      done to determine if obtaining rectal swab cultures and choosing antibiotics based on these\n      culture results will result in fewer infectious complications than giving all men\n      ciprofloxacin.\n\n      The investigators will compare 2 groups: men whose rectal swabs do not show\n      ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria will receive ciprofloxacin prior to biopsy, and men whose\n      swabs do show ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria will receive alternative antibiotics based on\n      their culture results.   Our hypothesis is that these 2 groups will have equal numbers of\n      post-biopsy infectious complications and both groups will have fewer infectious\n      complications than a historical group who received empiric ciprofloxacin without the benefit\n      of rectal swab culture results."
