            "textblock": "Elevation of blood phosphate levels in chronic dialysis patients is associated with\n      increased mortality due to cardiovascular events, and if sustained leads to hyperactivity of\n      parathyroid glands and renal bone disease.  Similarly, increased calcium-phosphate product\n      as a result of elevated levels of phosphate in the blood is an additional risk factor for\n      vascular calcification. Elevated blood potassium levels is another major electrolyte\n      disorder in patients with advanced renal disease which is potentially life threatening.\n      Therefore control of blood phosphate and potassium levels is a fundamental component of\n      treatment for end stage renal disease.  Management of hyperelectrolyte levels in renal\n      failure patients requires restriction of phosphate and potassium intake through dietary\n      measures, promotion of excretion via GI tract through medication delivery (i.e.\n      supplementary binders), and removal through dialysis.  All these strategies come with\n      limitations however, specifically adherence to dietary restrictions and medication\n      compliance is poor due to lack of immediate repercussions, as well as the complex kinetics\n      involved with removal via dialysis given the dependence on duration and frequency of\n      dialysis whose manipulation is limited by time considerations for the patient and scheduling\n      issues in the dialysis unit."
