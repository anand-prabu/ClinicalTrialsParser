  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine whether a theoretically-driven web-based 3-hour intervention
      designed for male college students called RealConsent is effective in increasing prosocial
      intervening behaviors and in preventing sexual violence perpetration. Sexual violence
      programs for this population have been implemented for decades in the United States, but a
      program that is web-based and incorporates the bystander education model has never been
      implemented or tested. In this study, male college students will be recruited online,
      enrolled and randomly assigned to RealConsent or to a comparison condition. Prior to the
      intervention, investigators will ask questions about their intervening and sexually coercive
      behaviors and other theoretical and empirical factors related to the study outcomes.
      Investigators will survey the young men again at post-intervention, and at 6-months
      follow-up to determine whether young men in the RealConsent program intervened more often
      and engaged in less sexual violence compared to young men in the comparison condition. The
      main hypotheses are: (1) college men in the RealConsent program will report more instances
      of prosocial intervening; and (2) college men in the RealConsent program will report less
      sexual violence against women.

    <description>This 3-hour web-based program consists of six 30-minute modules that are interactive and range in number of segments (1-14) and types of activities. Each of the modules involves interactivity, didactic activities and two episodes of a serial drama, which allows for the modeling of positive behaviors and illustrate both positive and negative outcome expectations for intervening and for perpetrating abuse against women. Behaviors modeled include communicating with female sex partners, obtaining informed consent to have sex, and intervening to prevent abuse from taking place.</description>
