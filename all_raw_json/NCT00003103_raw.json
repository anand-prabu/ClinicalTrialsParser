Evaluate the safety and plasma concentration profiles of oblimersen (G3139)\n      administered alone or in combination with docetaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors\n      expressing the bcl-2 oncogene. II. Determine the plasma concentration profiles, maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD), and/or optimal biologic dose (OBD) of this treatment regimen in these\n      patients. III. Determine the antitumor effects of G3139, at the MTD or OBD, in combination\n      with docetaxel in patients with androgen-independent, refractory, or recurrent prostate\n      cancer.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of oblimersen (G3139). Phase I: Patients receive\n      G3139 IV on days 1-5 and docetaxel IV on day 5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6\n      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6\n      patients receive escalating doses of G3139 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is\n      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients\n      experience dose-limiting toxicity. Phase II: Patients receive G3139 continuously over 21\n      days at one dose level below the MTD in combination with weekly docetaxel. Patients receive\n      up to 2 more courses of therapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 57 patients (42 for phase I and 15 for phase II) will be\n      accrued for this study."
