            "textblock": "This is an investigational, single arm, physician-sponsored study that will be conducted at\n      Rabin Medical Center under the direction of Professor Mordechai Kramer.  Patients will\n      receive AeriSeal System therapy using a new treatment algorithm to deliver approved foam\n      sealant components at doses at or below those previously shown to be safe and effective\n      during prior studies. Investigational aspects of this study involve only the method of\n      administration of material, not the material itself. The specific modifications to the\n      treatment method proposed in this study include: 1) lowering the dose per subsegment of\n      AeriSeal System Foam Sealant to 10 mL from the approved 20 mL dose; 2) administering the\n      subsegmental doses at more anatomic locations with the goal of improving distribution of\n      material and achieving more effective lung volume reduction; 3) eliminating the\n      administration of air through the instrument channel of the bronchoscope following Foam\n      Sealant delivery to simply and shorten the procedure, improving safety.\n\n      The study is designed to treat 8 patients. The first 4 patients will receive treatment with\n      10 mL of AeriSeal System Foam Sealant administered at 6 subsegments, 3 in each upper lobe (a\n      dose of 60 mL of AeriSeal Foam Sealant). This group will be followed until all 4 have\n      completed 1 month (28 day) follow-up. A safety review of the data will then be conducted\n      prior to initiating treatment in the next group of 4 patients. This review will include an\n      assessment of adverse events and physiological responses.\n\n      Assuming no emergent safety issues are identified, the next group of 4 patients will receive\n      treatment with 10 mL of AeriSeal System Foam Sealant administered at 8 subsegments, 3 in\n      each upper lobe, one in the upper-most portion of the right middle lobe, one in the\n      upper-most portion of the lingual (a dose of 80 mL of AeriSeal Foam Sealant).\n\n      All patients will be followed for 24 weeks after completion of therapy and receive standard\n      medical treatment in addition to treatment with the AeriSeal System."
