Each treatment consists of an injection of the insulin product followed by a\n      euglycemic clamp with a washout period of 7-15 days between treatments.\n\n      Trial part 2 is a three-period cross-over trial with complete blockdesign in subjects with\n      type 2 diabetes. Each treatment consists of an injection of the insulin product followed by\n      a euglycaemic clamp with a washout period of 7-15 days between treatments."
