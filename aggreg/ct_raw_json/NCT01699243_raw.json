Newly developed algorithms can, in real-time: 1) predict\n      cardiovascular collapse well ahead of any clinically significant changes in standard vital\n      signs, 2) monitor and estimate fluid resuscitation needs, 3) estimate acute blood loss\n      volume, and 4) estimate intracranial pressure. We hypothesize that these same methods can be\n      used to predict functional hypovolemia during regional anesthesia for labor or fetal\n      intervention."

Collect noninvasive physiological waveform data from patients undergoing regional\n           anesthesia for labor or fetal intervention at the University of Colorado Hospital and\n           Children's Hospital Colorado.\n\n        2. Combine the physiological data from patient monitors with clinical and demographic\n           data, including maternal problem list, medications, volume infused, use of\n           vasopressors, arterial and venous pressures, fetal heart rate, fetal umbilical artery\n           Doppler velocimetry, maternal uterine artery Doppler waveform, fetal and neonatal\n           outcomes etc. for use in developing mathematical model for early detection of maternal\n           functional hypovolemia.\n\n        3. Develop robust, real-time, computational models for:\n\n             -  estimating maternal volume status prior to administration of epidural anesthesia\n\n             -  estimating effective intravascular volume loss during maternal regional anesthesia\n\n             -  predicting an optimal, individual specific requirement for IV resuscitation and/or\n                need for vasopressor agents while providing adequate analgesia using regional\n                techniques and optimizing the fetal outcomes\n\n             -  identifying mothers susceptible to epidural induced hypotension"
