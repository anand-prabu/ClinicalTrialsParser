  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare heat and humidified oxygen with cold and dry oxygen
      in children with bronchiolitis.

      The hypotheses are that heating and humidifying inspired low flow supplemental oxygen will
      optimize mucociliary function thereby, 1) improve oxygenation, 2) decrease work of
      breathing, 3) decrease length of hospital stay, and 4) decrease use of inhaled therapies in
      children with bronchiolitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of acute respiratory illness and hospitalization in
      infants and young children. The mainstay of treatment is supportive care, which includes
      frequent nasal suctioning, intravenous fluid hydration, and supplemental oxygen for
      hypoxemia.

      The airways normally heat and humidify inspired ambient air to core temperature amd 100%
      relative humidity at the carina. This environment, at core temperature, allows for optimal
      mucociliary clearance. Supplemental oxygen delivered via wall source is cold and dry, and
      does not reach core temperature and 100% humidity until some point distal to the carina,
      past the main bronchi. This presses on the lower respiratory tract to assist in heat and
      moisture exchange and thus decrease ciliary function. This, in combination with
      bronchiolitis, can impair mucociliary clearance.

      Specific aim 1: Determine the effect of heated and humidified oxygen therapy on clinical
      improvement in children with bronchiolitis, based on Respiratory Distress Assessment
      Instrument (RDAI) and respiratory rate (RR).

      Specific aim 2: Determine the effect of heated and humidified oxygen therapy on length of
      hospital stay, duration of supplemental oxygen requirement, and frequency of inhaled
      therapies in children with bronchiolitis.

    <description>Baseline assessment is done with subject off oxygen. Subsequent assessments are done at 1 hour after starting oxygen and every 4 hours until subject is weaned off oxygen. Assessments are stopped after subject tolerates being off oxygen for minimum 6 hours or if subject requires transition to higher level of care, such as heated high flow oxygen and pediatric intensive care unit.</description>
