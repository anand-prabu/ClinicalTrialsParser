            "textblock": "Two Adult General Medicine Services, which do not have a rounding pharmacist (RPh), will be\n      identified by the investigators. Permission to approach the patients on each service will be\n      obtained from the attending physician of each respective General Medicine Service at the\n      beginning of each attending physician's time on service. The attending physician will be\n      asked to communicate to the study personnel of situations in which patients should not be\n      approached (i.e., patient has communicated disinterested in being approached about study\n      participation opportunities and/or, in the opinion of the attending physician, the patient\n      should not be approached).\n\n      Patients who will be recruited from pre-specified medical services will be screened for\n      eligibility and, if deemed eligible, then will be approached by study personnel and asked if\n      they would like to enroll in this study. If the patient accepts, written informed consent\n      will be obtained and the patient will enter the study. Patients will be randomly assigned to\n      either the intervention or control arm. Patients randomized to the intervention arm will\n      receive discharge medications and pharmacist-provided discharge medication counseling prior\n      to hospital discharge, and patients randomized to the control group will receive standard\n      discharge procedures and obtain discharge medications per their usual process. After the\n      patient has been enrolled in the study, study personnel will collect patient demographic\n      data for study purposes, utilizing patient medical records and/or patient interviews. At\n      discharge, patients will receive either the intervention or standard of care defined by the\n      arm of the study to which each patient has been randomly assigned. After discharge, a\n      maximum of seven attempts will be made via phone to contact all patients in both arms for\n      follow up at 30 (+/- 7) days after discharge. During the follow phone call, a blinded\n      pharmacist will conduct a structured interview to collect data for the study endpoints. The\n      pharmacist conducting the interview will have the most recent discharge medication list (the\n      list the patient received at his/her hospital discharge) from the patient's medication\n      record to be used for comparison to the information gathered from the patient's interview 30\n      days post discharge.\n\n      Intervention Arm - After enrollment, a pharmacy technician not associated with the study\n      will collect information necessary to process and fill the patient's discharge prescriptions\n      by the Duke Outpatient Pharmacy. On the day of discharge, a pharmacist will perform a chart\n      review and medication reconciliation on all patients' discharge medications (for patients\n      randomized to the intervention arm). Any medication discrepancies will be addressed with the\n      patient's primary care team. At the time of discharge, the patient will receive his/her\n      discharge medications dispensed from the Duke Outpatient Pharmacy, along with medication\n      counseling by a licensed pharmacist.\n\n      Control Arm - Patients will receive the standard discharge process provided by nurses and/or\n      physicians. Patients will obtain outpatient medications per usual care.\n\n      Data Evaluation - After a patient has completed the phone follow up interview, two\n      pharmacist co-investigators who have not been involved in the inpatient care of the patients\n      will review the collected data to assess for adverse drug reactions and drug-drug\n      interactions. When there is a disagreement between the pharmacists concerning the occurrence\n      of an adverse reaction (including causality or severity), or a drug interaction (including\n      severity), a third pharmacist co-investigator who was not involved in the inpatient care of\n      the patient will review the patient's data to make a final decision concerning the\n      disagreement. All patients who complete the follow up survey will be evaluated in this\n      manner."
