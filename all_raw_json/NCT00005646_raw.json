Determine the overall\n      and progression free survival of these patients in response to this treatment regimen. III.\n      Determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours weekly for\n      6 consecutive weeks. Treatment continues every 8 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 2 months for 1\n      year, then every 3 months for 2 years, and then annually for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients will be accrued for this study over 8-11 months."
