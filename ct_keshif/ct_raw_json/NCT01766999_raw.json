            "textblock": "Tumescent local anesthesia is a procedure which is frequently performed for plastic cosmetic\n      surgical procedures such as liposuction. The subcutaneous adipose tissue is infiltrated with\n      large volumes of a solution which also contain local anesthetics. However local anesthetics,\n      can also lead to a marked production of methemoglobin. New generation pulse oximeters are\n      able to measure SpMetHb non-invasivly.\n\n      The aim of this study is:\n\n        1. to investigate multi-wavelength pulse oximetry as a monitoring method for patients at\n           increased risk for methemoglobinemia.\n\n        2. to illustrate MetHb concentrations over a course of 24 hours after a liposuction\n           employing tumescent anesthesia has been carried out."
