  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the
      effect of aleglitazar on insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who
      are inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy. Patients will be randomized to receive
      either aleglitazar 150 mcg or placebo orally daily for 16 weeks, in addition to their
      existing dose and regimen of metformin.
