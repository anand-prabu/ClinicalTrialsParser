            "textblock": "Background: Medical abortions in Canada are provided using a standard regimen of\n      methotrexate and misoprostol. After these medications are administered, patients are most\n      commonly checked for termination of the pregnancy with an ultrasound and physical\n      examination at an in-clinic follow-up appointment. These follow-up appointments can be\n      inconvenient, costly, and take away from patient privacy. Furthermore, it has been suggested\n      that these follow-up appointments may not be necessary for patients.\n\n      Objective: To determine whether remote follow-up, using telephone and blood testing is a\n      feasible, safe, and effective method of follow\u2010up after medical abortion, compared to\n      standard care that requires an in-clinic visit and  ultrasound.\n\n      This study offers women the option of remote follow-up by telephone combined with serum\n      Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-hCG) testing or standard in-clinic follow up.  We will\n      determine women's preferences for follow up, and compare adherence to the follow-up\n      schedule, number of clinical contacts, and outcomes of the abortion.  This study will be\n      performed at two clinics in Toronto, the Bay Centre for Birth Control (BCBC) and the Choice\n      in Health Clinic (CIHC).\n\n      Primary Hypothesis: Follow-up will be more successful with RFU, compared to SFU."
