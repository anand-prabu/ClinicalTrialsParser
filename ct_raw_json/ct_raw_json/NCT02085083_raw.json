There a\n      few studies which characterize patterns of healthcare utilization during this critical\n      period and its impact on outcomes.  We hypothesize that uninterrupted healthcare utilization\n      in academic centers and optimized communication with patients during the pediatric-adult\n      transition period is associated with lower hospitalizations and surgery.  This hypothesis\n      will be addressed by a randomized clinical trial to determine the impact of monthly regular\n      telephone contact with an IBD Registered Nurse versus standard of care during the\n      pediatric-adult transition period.   Outcomes will include healthcare utilization,\n      health-related quality of life, patient satisfaction, and treatment adherence over 12 months\n      of follow-up.  Randomization and analyses will be stratified by whether subjects were\n      transferred to adult care in an academic center or in a community practice.  We hope that\n      this research will facilitate optimal delivery of healthcare during the pediatric-adult\n      transition."
