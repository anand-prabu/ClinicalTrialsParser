            "textblock": "Uterine myomas are the most common benign tumor of the female genital tract and the leading\n      indication for hysterectomy. Despite the fact that laparoscopic myomectomy is becoming\n      increasingly popular, laparoscopic myomectomy remains underutilized because of inherit\n      limitations. The limitations include technical challenges such as dissection of the myoma\n      from its bed using the correct plane or multilayer closure of the myoma bed and the concern\n      about the strength of the suturing and the subsequent risk of uterine rupture. As a result,\n      laparoscopic myomectomy is currently performed only by expert surgeons.\n\n      Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) is a unique surgical approach that may overcome\n      the limitations of pure laparoscopic surgery. HALS is not only less invasive than open\n      surgery but also causes less technical challenges than laparoscopic surgery based on its\n      manual nature and ability to use retractors. In gynecologic field, HALS has also been\n      employed in ovarian cancers and large ovarian tumors.\n\n      In theory, HALS seems appropriate procedure, similar to the open approach, for patients with\n      multiple or huge myomas. To date, no report has evaluated the feasibility and usefulness of\n      HALS compared with open surgery (OS)."
