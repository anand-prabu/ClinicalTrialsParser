            "textblock": "Complications related to airway management are the major contributing factor to morbidity in\n      anesthesiology. This risk of complications markedly increases when faced with a difficult\n      airway in an obese patient. Pre-oxygenation creates a safety margin by increasing the\n      patient's oxygen stores, through a higher functional residual capacity (FRC). When\n      pre-oxygenated, the clinician may proceed to intubation after a variable period of apnea,\n      while maintaining oxygen saturation over 92%. In non-obese individuals, pre-oxygenation\n      allows a non-hypoxic apnea time of eight minutes. In the obese population, however, this\n      non-hypoxic apnea time decreases to two to three minutes.\n\n      Different methods of pre-oxygenation have been proposed in order to increase apnea time\n      before significant oxygen desaturation. Amongst these methods, the following are of\n      particular interest: pre-oxygenation to vital capacity, pre-oxygenation with spontaneous\n      ventilation and positive pressure, and pre-oxygenation with elevated head positioning\n      (\"beach-chair\"). These methods have been extensively studied in individuals of normal height\n      and weight.\n\n      The main objective of pre-oxygenation is to raise oxygen levels available at the alveolar\n      level in order to increase the non-hypoxic apnea time, before a significant desaturation\n      occurs. This raised alveolar oxygen concentration can be done by maintaining a higher\n      inspired oxygen fraction and by promoting a larger FRC which is the oxygen reserve build\n      through the pre-oxygenation phase. In morbid obese patients, these parameters are affected\n      by a lower expiratory flow, lower expiratory flow and closing of small radius airways. The\n      final result probably come from a more cephalad position of the diaphragm induced by a\n      larger intra-abdominal volume.\n\n      Actually, different studies demonstrate the advantage of a beach-chair position and\n      non-invasive positive pressure ventilation for pre-oxygenation of obese patients. These\n      advantages are shown by a shorter time of pre-oxygenation to obtain an end-tidal O2 > 90 %\n      and a longer non-hypoxic apnea time (Sat O2 >90%). Up to date, there is no published data on\n      the FRC as a result of different combinations of position and ventilation mode. This study\n      will evaluate FRC by helium dilution technique.\n\n      We propose a crossover randomised trial on volunteers waiting for a bariatric surgery. We\n      want to compare, in pre-oxygenation situation, without induction of general anesthesia, the\n      effect of three positions and two ventilation modes on the FRC measure."
