Resin\n      infiltration is a novel method that has shown its efficacy in improving the esthetics of\n      White spot lesions (WSLs) per say and post orthodontics WSLs in different both in-situ and\n      in-vivo studies. The Resin Infiltration technique is also known to stop the progression of\n      caries in non cavitated lesions in both, smooth surface and interproximal lesions.\n\n      Therefore, the following trial will be conducted to assess the esthetic improvement of\n      fluorosed permanent anterior teeth after resin infiltration and compare it with standard\n      bleaching procedure and a combination of bleaching and Resin infiltration therapy in\n      children with damaged teeth by fluorosis."
