Yet it is\n      noteworthy that despite the increasing evidence showing additional benefits in Blood\n      pressure control and reduction of cardiovascular outcomes with chlorthalidone over\n      hydrochlorothiazide, there is neither a great number of combinations nor studies with\n      Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers plus chlorthalidone whereby the conduction of a trial\n      assessing the efficacy and safety of Valsartan plus chlorthalidone in hypertensive patients\n      is proposed plus the benefits of combination therapy that include, among others, the greater\n      efficacy with lower doses of each individual component as well as reduction in occurrence of\n      adverse events directly related with lower drug doses.With this treatment schedule it is\n      expected to obtain higher control of blood pressure values and greater percentage of\n      patients."
