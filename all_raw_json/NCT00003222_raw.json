Colony-stimulating factors such as GM-CSF may increase the number of\n      immune cells found in the bone marrow or peripheral blood. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a\n      person's white blood cells to kill melanoma cells. Combining vaccine therapy with GM-CSF and\n      interleukin-2 may be kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccines made from melanoma cells with\n      or without GM-CSF followed by interleukin-2 in treating patients with stage III or stage IV\n      melanoma."

Compare the effectiveness of vaccination with synthetic melanoma peptides\n      pulsed on autologous dendritic cells versus vaccination with synthetic melanoma peptides\n      plus sargramostim (GM-CSF) in decreasing tumor burden in patients with high risk melanoma\n      (pulsed autologous dendritic cell arm closed 1/8/2001). II. Determine whether these regimens\n      result in increased tumor specific immune responses as measured in vitro and in vivo. III.\n      Determine whether these regimens stimulate T-cell responses in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients are included in treatment arm II only (arm I\n      closed 1/8/2001): Arm I: Patients undergo leukapheresis to collect dendritic cells. Patients\n      receive a mixture of synthetic melanoma peptides (gp100 antigen, tyrosinase, and tetanus\n      peptides) pulsed on autologous dendritic cells IV and subcutaneously (SC). Arm II: Patients\n      receive a mixture of synthetic melanoma peptides (gp100 antigen, tyrosinase, and tetanus\n      peptides) and sargramostim (GM-CSF) emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 SC and intradermally.\n      Patients receive vaccination during weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 for a total of 6 doses and\n      interleukin-2 SC daily on days 7-49. Patients receive 3 additional vaccinations at different\n      sites not involved with the tumor concurrently with the first 3 vaccinations. Patients are\n      evaluated at 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27-54 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
