Furthermore both neuropathic pain and post surgical pain inhibit weight\n      gain and may have an impact on the patient's nutrition post operatively.  The purpose of\n      this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multimodality pain management protocol on\n      postoperative neurosurgical pain."

High levels of postoperative pain are associated with an increased risk\n      of pulmonary and cardiovascular complications, are the most common reason for delayed\n      discharge or for unexpected hospital admission after ambulatory surgery, and are responsible\n      for prolonged convalescence after inpatient surgery.  Furthermore both neuropathic pain and\n      post surgical pain inhibit weight gain and may have an impact on the patient's nutrition\n      post operatively.  Finally, high levels of postoperative pain have also been associated with\n      an increased risk of chronic pain.  Therefore, the aggressive treatment of postoperative\n      pain may be particularly important in influencing patient outcomes, inadvertent\n      readmissions, and propensity for developing chronic pain."
