Able and willing to provide written informed consent.\n\n          2. 18-70 years of age.\n\n          3. New acute optic neuritis and/or transverse myelitis. A clinical event is defined as\n             an episode of inflammation in the spinal cord and/or optic nerve leading to\n             neurologic symptoms not ascribed to another disease process.\n\n          4. Known or suspected diagnosis of NMO according to the 2006 revisions of the Wingerchuk\n             diagnostic criteria for NMO or AQP4 positive NMOSD per the EFNS Guidelines. For NMO,\n             subjects must have two absolute criteria:\n\n               1. optic neuritis\n\n               2. myelitis and at least two of three supportive criteria:\n\n               3. presence of a contiguous spinal cord MRI lesion extending over three or more\n                  vertebral segments,\n\n               4.

For NMOSD, subjects must have longitudinally extensive\n                  transverse myelitis (LETM) recurrent isolated optic neuritis (RION)/bilateral\n                  optic neuritis (BON), or opticospinal multiple sclerosis (OSMS) that is AQP4\n                  antibody positive\n\n          5. A female subject is eligible to enter the study if she is:\n\n        A. Not pregnant or nursing; B. Of non-childbearing potential (i.e. women who have had a\n        hysterectomy, are postmenopausal, which is defined as >2 years without menses (female\n        subjects who have been post-menopausal for <2 years must be confirmed with Follicle\n        Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels), have both ovaries surgically removed or\n        have current documented tubal ligation); or,\n\n        C. Of childbearing potential (i.e. women with functional ovaries and no documented\n        impairment of oviductal or uterine function that would cause sterility).  This category\n        includes women with oligomenorrhoea (even severe), women who are perimenopausal or have\n        just begun to menstruate.

Cancer diagnoses with a duration of complete response (remission) >5 years\n\n               4. A history of hematologic malignancy excludes a subject from participation,\n                  regardless of response.\n\n          3. Recent major surgery within the last 28 days.\n\n          4.

Use of an investigational drug or other experimental therapy for a condition other\n             than NMO within 4 weeks, 5 pharmacokinetic half lives or duration of biological\n             effect (whichever is longer) prior to screening.\n\n          6.
