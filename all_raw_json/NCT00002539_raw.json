Colony-stimulating factors such as G-CSF may increase the\n      number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's\n      immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. It is not yet known whether\n      chemotherapy and surgery plus G-CSF is more effective than chemotherapy and surgery alone in\n      treating patients with osteosarcoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness combination chemotherapy\n      and surgery with or without G-CSF in treating patients who have newly diagnosed\n      osteosarcoma."

Patients are randomized to 1 of 2\n      treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive conventional doxorubicin (DOX) IV over 4 hours on days 1-3 and\n           cisplatin (CDDP) IV continuously on day 1. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for 2\n           courses. At week 6, patients undergo amputation or local resection based on pretherapy\n           imaging and response to chemotherapy. Beginning 2 weeks after surgery, patients receive\n           4 additional courses of conventional chemotherapy.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive intensive DOX and CDDP as above on day 1 plus filgrastim\n           (G-CSF) subcutaneously on days 4-13. Treatment continues every 2 weeks for 3 courses.\n           At week 6, patients undergo definitive surgery as in arm I. Beginning 2 weeks after\n           surgery, patients receive 3 additional courses of intensive DOX and CDDP with G-CSF.\n\n      Patients who experience disease progression during preoperative chemotherapy undergo surgery\n      earlier than scheduled and complete all scheduled chemotherapy (6 courses) after surgery, at\n      the discretion of the surgeon and oncologist. Within 4 weeks after limb-sparing procedure,\n      patients with inadequate margins undergo amputation, followed 2 weeks later by chemotherapy.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months, every 2 months for 6 months, every 3 months for\n      1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients will be accrued for this study."
