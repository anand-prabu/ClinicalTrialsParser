Certain probiotics have\n      demonstrated inhibition of adherence of pathogenic bacteria and stimulation of systemic\n      immune functions, possibly enhancing the body's ability to eradicate C. difficile in the\n      gastrointestinal tract. However, limited data is available on the efficacy of probiotics for\n      ameliorating C. difficile symptoms and reducing recurrence of C. difficile infection (CDI).\n      The investigators propose a pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical\n      trial in older adult inpatients with a first episode of CDI to evaluate the efficacy of a\n      probiotic combination, in conjunction with standard treatment, for reducing duration of\n      diarrhea and recurrence of CDI."
