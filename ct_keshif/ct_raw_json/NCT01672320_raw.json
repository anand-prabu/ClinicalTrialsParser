IRB approval will be\n      obtained at every study site to evaluate the basic clinical outcomes and post-operative\n      component placement accuracy of each MAKO\u00ae THA patient.\n\n      The hypothesis is that robotic preparation of the acetabulum will significantly reduce the\n      variability and inaccuracy in the component alignment parameters that lead to post-operative\n      complications, including implant failure."
