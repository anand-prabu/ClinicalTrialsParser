    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia. The aim of the trial is to compare the glycaemic control of
      Levemir® (insulin detemir) administered once daily according to two titration algorithms
      after 20 weeks in subjects with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin
      treatment with or without other anti-diabetic drugs (OADs).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus at least 3 months prior to Visit 1 (week -2)

          -  Treatment with at least 1000 mg metformin per day with/without other OADs at a stable
             dose (at either the maximal tolerated dose or at least half of the maximum
             recommended dose according to the package insert) for at least 3 months prior to
             Visit 1

          -  Insulin-naïve subjects

          -  HbA1c above or equal to 7.5% by central laboratory analysis

          -  Body mass index (BMI) below or equal to 35.0 kg/m^2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female of child-bearing potential who is pregnant, breast-feeding or intend to become
             pregnant or is not using adequate contraceptive methods

          -  The receipt of any investigational product within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1

          -  Any contraindication to insulin detemir according to the domestic labelling

          -  Anticipated change of dose of any systemic treatment with products, which in the
             investigator's opinion could interfere with glucose metabolism (such as systemic
             corticosteroids, beta-blockers, monoamine oxidase [MAO] inhibitors)

          -  Clinically significant diseases which, in the investigator's opinion, may confound
             the results of the trial or pose additional risk in administering trial product

          -  Any conditions that the investigator judges would interfere with trial participation
             or evaluation of the results
