            "textblock": "Men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to be the most heavily-impacted risk group in the\n      US HIV epidemic. Studies suggest that the majority of incident HIV infections among MSM are\n      attributable to sex with a main male sex partner; however, HIV prevention interventions that\n      target male-male couples are lacking. Because of this, Couples HIV Voluntary Counseling and\n      Testing (CVCT), an intervention that has been repeatedly shown to reduce HIV transmission\n      within heterosexual couples, has been adapted to US MSM couples. Additionally, novel\n      evidence demonstrates that antiretroviral therapy (ART) not only reduces morbidity and\n      mortality among HIV-positive persons, but also serves to reduce the risk of HIV transmission\n      to a negative partner by 96%. As adherence to ART is modifiable, and levels of peer support\n      have been shown to increase ART adherence, this current study proposes to use CVCT combined\n      with dyadic adherence counseling (\"CVCTPlus\") to improve linkage to care, retention in care,\n      ART adherence and viral suppression among male-male couples using a cohort of 200 couples in\n      Atlanta, Boston, and Chicago. Prospective couples (100 in each arm) will be followed for two\n      years, with study visits every six months. At each visit, they will receive HIV testing, and\n      both partners will complete a study survey measuring social and behavioral factors that may\n      influence adherence, such as a couple's coping ability and their concordance of agreements\n      regarding outside sex partners. Additionally, couples in the intervention arm will receive\n      two additional sessions of Partner-STEPS."

            "textblock": "Since the earliest reports of AIDS in the United States, men who have sex with men (MSM)\n      have been, and continue to be, the most heavily impacted risk group in the US HIV epidemic.\n      In 2009, MSM accounted for 61% of new HIV diagnoses, an increase from 53% of HIV incidence\n      in 2006. The \"test and treat\" strategy for HIV infection entails universal testing with\n      immediate treatment for those who test seropositive, with the aim of achieving viral\n      suppression among positives. The efficacy of treatment as prevention demonstrated in HPTN\n      052 has reinvigorated the discussion over using a \"test and treat\" strategy to reduce the\n      incidence of HIV infection in the US. However, engagement-in-care research raises a note of\n      caution regarding potential pitfalls in the effectiveness of this strategy. The recently\n      published MMWR \"Vital Signs\" Report, showed only 28% of all HIV-infected persons in the US\n      has a suppressed viral load. The estimates published by Gardner show that of the estimated\n      1.1 million persons infected with HIV in the United States, 21% of HIV-infected persons are\n      currently undiagnosed. Of those who are diagnosed, losses occur at initial linkage to care\n      and later in care such that only 50% remain in care, such that only 19% of HIV-infected\n      persons in the US currently having viral load below the limits of assay detection. There is\n      now substantial evidence of the role of couples - or main partnerships - in fueling the HIV\n      epidemic among MSM in the US. A recent CDC analysis found that 68% of new infections among\n      MSM in the US were ascribed to main sex partners, and the proportion of new infections from\n      main sex partners was even higher among younger MSM. Led by Sullivan and Stephenson, recent\n      work has illustrated the feasibility of enrolling couples into HIV prevention efforts,\n      demand for couples-focused services among MSM. A response to the growing demand for\n      couples-focused services has been the adaptation of Couples Voluntary Counseling and Testing\n      (CVCT) for MSM in the US. A recent NIMH-funded RCT of CVCT versus traditional VCT among MSM\n      (Sullivan PI) showed 22% of MSM couples to be sero-discordant. This collective evidence\n      provides the foundation for the proposed activities; we know that a significant proportion\n      of new HIV infections occur within couples, and we know that current levels of linkage to\n      care, retention in care and adherence to ARVs are below par among US MSM. In April 2012, WHO\n      released new guidelines for Couples HIV testing and counseling, including ARV for treatment\n      and prevention among sero-discordant couples [7]. The guidelines report a significant gap in\n      evidence around the uptake and adherence to ARV among couples, and the role of CVCT in\n      shaping uptake and adherence to ARVs: the proposed research has the potential to add\n      significantly to our understanding of these issues. The proposed activities investigate the\n      utility of CVCT combined with dyadic adherence counseling for improving linkage to care,\n      retention in care and adherence to ARVs. Through the screening of 1250 MSM couples and the\n      enrollment of couples in a RCT across 3 cities (Atlanta, Boston and Chicago) the study aims\n      to examine the impact of CVCTPlus (CVCT plus dyadic adherence counseling) versus VCT on\n      linkage to HIV care, retention in HIV care, adherence to ARV and achievement of viral\n      suppression among MSM couples. The specific aims are:\n\n      Primary Aims:\n\n        1. Enroll and screen 1250 MSM couples across 3 cities (Atlanta, Boston and Chicago) for\n           HIV, randomizing 625 couples to receive CVCT and 625 couples to receive VCT.\n\n        2. From the initial screening, identify and enroll a cohort of 200 couples to be\n           followed-up for a period of 2 years: couples in the intervention arm will receive\n           CVCTPlus (couples testing plus a couples-focused adherence intervention).\n\n        3. Compare linkage to HIV care, retention in care, adherence to ARVs and achievement of\n           viral suppression between couples originally diagnosed in the intervention (CVCTPlus)\n           and the control (VCT) arms.\n\n      Hypothesis: Couples who receive a package of CVCT and a dyadic-focused adherence\n      intervention will achieve greater linkage to care, retention in care, adherence to ARVs and\n      viral suppression than couples who receive the standard of care (individualized VCT and\n      adherence counseling).\n\n      With increasing evidence of the role of ARVs in reducing HIV transmission, MSM couples\n      represent a significant target group for new interventions. The proposed activities will\n      provide new information demonstrating the efficacy of using a couples-based approach for\n      increasing ARV adherence and care seeking among couples."
