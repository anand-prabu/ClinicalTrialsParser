Approximately 80 patients presenting with native aortic valve stenosis necessitating\n           valve replacement which are considered unsuitable for Surgical Valve Replacement, with\n           a high surgical risk, as attested to by both the surgeon and the cardiologist are\n           recruited in the study.\n\n        3. Safety and performance will be evaluated at discharge and at 30 days post procedure.\n           Valve safety, performance and placement will be followed up at 6 and 12 months\n           post-procedure."
