            "textblock": "There is a certain gene called sarcoplasmic reticulum gene (SERCA2a), which is found in\n      heart muscle. This gene is also found in blood vessels and skin tissue. When active this\n      gene builds a crucial protein inside the heart muscle called SERCA2a protein. This is\n      responsible for regulating calcium levels inside your heart muscle. When this gene is not\n      activated, studies have shown that it can lead to abnormal electrical currents in the heart\n      that can lead to death. The investigators are conducting this study to prove that SERCA2a\n      gene is inactive in patients with kidney disease. Scientists found that patient at risk for\n      abnormal electrical currents in the heart can be tested by what they called \"microvolt Twave\n      alternans.\" This is a very delicate machine much more sensitive than a regular\n      electrocardiogram that you do at the cardiology office."

To achieve our specific aims: 1) we will\n      screen patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) going for certain vascular procedures.\n      2) obtain an echocardiogram on these patients including only those with isolated diastolic\n      dysfunction or LVH. 3) Patients who has diastolic dysfunction or LVH will be assessed for\n      underlying microvolt (TWA) 4) vessel and skin tissue on these patients will be collected for\n      SERCA2a quantification."
