  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ECT is a well-established and effective method for the treatment of severe depression.
      During the last decades, rTMS has appeared as a potential new non-invasive antidepressant
      method, which may be a potential alternative to ECT due to fewer side effects.

      Both methods expose the brain to an electric current. But while ECT is associated with
      global cerebral stimulation elicited by an epileptic seizure, rTMS implies non-convulsive
      focal stimulation through a time varying magnetic field. Thus, the antidepressant effect of
      rTMS does not depend on seizure activity and consequently requires no anesthesia. In
      addition, rTMS seems not to be associated with cognitive disturbances.

      Previous research indicates that the antidepressant effect of rTMS is associated with
      specific stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The majority of clinically
      controlled studies have used high frequency stimulation of the left frontal cortex (1-4).
      Few have used right prefrontal low frequency rTMS, which has less side effects, such as
      local discomfort and a lower risk of releasing epileptic seizures, than high frequency
      stimulation (5-10). Both models have been used with varying results. Meta-analysis of the
      antidepressant effect of rTMS (11,x)  have found a modest, statistically significant
      antidepressant effect but generally  definite conclusions on the antidepressant effect of
      rTMS has been difficult to draw, probably because of small and selected study populations,
      varying ways of stimulation and other confounding factors in the clinical setting.

      The important clinical question of whether rTMS may substitute ECT in the treatment of
      depression has almost exclusively been elucidated in studies using high frequency
      stimulation of the left frontal cortex. Some of these suggest that the effectiveness of
      rTMS is equal to  that of ECT in non-delusional patients (12-19). However, a recent
      investigation has compared the antidepressant efficacy and side effects of  right prefrontal
      low frequency rTMS with ECT. In this study the mean Hamilton total 17-item (HAM-D score)
      scores were reduced significantly over time in both groups (ECT: p&lt;0.001, rTMS: p&lt;0.001);
      but ECT was more effective than rTMS on a short term after 3 weeks of treatment. The outcome
      did not point to right frontal low frequency rTMS as a first line substitute for ECT, but it
      might have place in the treatment of depression as add on to other types of treatment.

      ECT is normally administered 3 times a week for 3-4 weeks. Daily treatment sessions might
      accelerate remission, but is impossible because of  cognitive side effects. However, rTMS
      seems not to be associated with reduction in cognitive performance and might potentiate the
      antidepressant efficacy of ECT. Therefore the investigators have found it clinical
      interesting to investigate in which degree low frequency right prefrontal rTMS used ad
      add-on may potentiate the antidepressant effect of unilateral ECT and accelerate remission .
