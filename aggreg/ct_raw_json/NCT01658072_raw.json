            "textblock": "The best way to provide analgesia after total hip arthroplasty is hotly debated.  There are\n      two protocols in use at Hospital for Special Surgery(HSS).  Both protocols have their\n      proponents, but there are limited data for making an informed choice of protocols. For total\n      hip arthroplasty at HSS, epidural analgesia is used most frequently as it reduces pain with\n      physical therapy.  However, epidural analgesia can be associated with nausea, pruritis,\n      dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension.  These side-effects can slow physical therapy and\n      may prolong the time until the patient is ready for discharge. Some surgeons at HSS have\n      decided to use a different analgesic protocol, based on a peri-articular injection.  This\n      protocol avoids epidural analgesia and systemic opioids.  However, patients are given oral\n      opioids as part of a multimodal pain therapy. The investigators propose to compare\n      peri-articular injection to epidural patient controlled analgesia (Epidural PCA).   The\n      investigators will enroll 90 total patients (45 per study arm). The enrollment period will\n      be approximately one year and the duration of the follow-up with study patients will be\n      three months following their procedure."
