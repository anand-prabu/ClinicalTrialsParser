            "textblock": "Cancer-related fatigue has been described as a subjective feeling of physical, emotional,\n      and/or cognitive tiredness. Fatigue is frequently identified as one of the most troublesome\n      symptoms in pediatric cancer patients. Fatigue affects children with cancer throughout the\n      trajectory of their disease. Treatment interventions for cancer-related fatigue have been\n      largely unsuccessful. Homeopathy involves treatment of patients with diluted natural\n      substances aimed at stimulating the body's healing system. In the efficacy trial literature,\n      individualized homeopathy shows the most promise over other forms of homeopathic\n      intervention. Individualized homeopathic treatment involves a unique yet established method\n      of case taking. During the consultation, the homeopath asks a series of broad questions to\n      elicit subjective symptoms related to the patient's disease, their medical history, as well\n      as particular characteristics (physical or psychological) related to the individual. This\n      study will recruit children receiving chemotherapy to undergo homeopathic remedies to treat\n      their fatigue. This study hypothesizes that homeopathic treatment will effectively treat\n      fatigue."
