Besides improving fitness, such as lowering\n      blood pressure and improving physical composition, the benefits of sports span across almost\n      all domains of developmental trajectories. Unfortunately, many young people in Hong Kong do\n      not have enough physical activity on a regular basis. Data from government surveys in 2009\n      show that only 34.2% of children ages 7-12 had at least 60 minutes of moderate or vigorous\n      activity five days a week over a 3 month period. According to a more recent representative\n      survey, only 6.6% of secondary school students in Hong Kong met the WHO recommended standard\n      of 60 minutes of moderate and vigorous activity in the past 7 days while 27.1% reported of\n      not meeting the standard in any days of the past week.\n\n      This project will explore the possibility of fostering positive adolescent development\n      through tailoring a community-based youth project in Kwai Tsing district in Hong Kong.\n      Specifically, physical activity would benefit the adolescents in terms of physical,\n      psychological/emotional, social and intellectual development, together of which forms the\n      important foundation for a healthy and productive adult life. The project will incorporate a\n      physical activity intervention guided by behavioral theory in a secondary school-based\n      setting. The role of personality along the effect will also be examined which may enhance a\n      personalised platform to promote physical activity among adolescents.\n\n      A randomized controlled design will be used in intervention. Half of the randomized students\n      will be in the physical activity intervention group, receiving regular physical activities\n      tailor-made to them, while the other half will be receiving another intervention campaign\n      which will not increase their physical activity level. The interventions will take place for\n      about one academic year. Interim and final assessments will be administered to evaluate\n      their developmental growth.\n\n      Trained professionals will administer the physical activity programme which could minimize\n      the chance of sport injury. Personal information and data collected would be kept\n      confidential. A safety protocol will be implemented to ensure safety, confidentiality and\n      privacy of the participants."

            "textblock": "Background :\n\n      Many young people in Hong Kong do not have a habit of practicing physical activity\n      regularly. Data from government surveys in 2009 show that only 34.2% of children ages 7-12\n      had at least 60 minutes of moderate or vigorous activity five days a week over a 3 month\n      period. The lack of physical activity comes with an uprising adolescent health problems such\n      as substance abuse, shoplifting, and mental health problems. Sports related positive youth\n      programmes (PYDs) have been developed and implemented globally to tackle these problems.\n      However, not much studies have been done in putting physical activity participation, PYD,\n      and personality into one framework in Hong Kong and in Asia. According to a meta-analysis\n      conducted in 2011, among the 7 rigorously evaluated PYD in Asia, none has used sports /\n      physical activity as the main theme. The proposed study could answer the research gap\n      identified above by using sports as an intervention in examining its role on youth positive\n      development.\n\n      Aims :\n\n        1. individual-level : to increase participation in physical activity among intervention\n           school students.\n\n        2. school-level : to develop school-based year-round physical activity programs that would\n           expand opportunities for participation in physical activities for all students.\n\n        3. community-level : to provide opportunities for inter-school and intra-community\n           competitions that involved students, families and neighbours.\n\n        4. individual-level : to enhance positive adolescent development including resiliency,\n           social connectedness, and academic performance.\n\n        5. community-level : to foster social network and community development within the\n           community\n\n      Inclusion criteria :\n\n      All Form 1 and Form 2 students in the participating schools will be recruited for the study.\n\n      Outcome measurements :\n\n      Physical development would be measured both objectively and subjectively. The Hong Kong\n      Education Bureau has suggested students to involve in a physical fitness test comprising of\n      skinfolds (triceps and calf), sit-ups, sit-and-reach, push-ups, and 9-minute run/walk[31]\n      every year. These fitness records of each student would be retrieved from the school\n      masters. Other figures such as BMI-ratio, waist-hip ratio, and body fat percentage would\n      also be measured objectively.\n\n      The subjective physical development would be measured by the Physical Component Summary\n      score (PCS-12) of the Chinese (HK) SF-12v2 Health Survey.\n\n      the Adolescent Resilience Questionnaire (ARQ), the Healthy Kids Resilience Assessment\n      (HKRA), the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), the 10-item uni-dimension General\n      Self-Efficacy Scale and the Mental Component Summary score (MCS-12) of the Short Form\n      12-Helath Survey (SF-12) will be used in measuring the psychological / emotional\n      development.\n\n      The Hemingway Measure of Adolescent Connectedness Questionnaire would be used for social\n      development while school academic scores of the main subjects including Chinese, English and\n      mathematics would be the measuring tool for intellectual development."
