External eye photographs taken at each visit will be evaluated by a masked\n      reader who will calculate the eyelid parameters. Dermographic data and intraoperative\n      factors such as operative time and type of procedure will be collected. For statistical\n      analysis, Repeated ANOVA, Paired t-test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, Chi-square test and\n      Pearson's correlation analysis will be calculated with SPSS software."
