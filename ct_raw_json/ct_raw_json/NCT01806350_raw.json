To assess whether pelvic floor muscle training and behavioral therapy in gynecologic\n      cancer survivors results in improvement in incontinence symptoms as measured by a validated\n      questionnaire (Patient Global Impression of Improvement) at three month follow-up when\n      compared to women who do not undergo pelvic floor muscle training.\n\n      II. To evaluate whether women who undergo pelvic floor muscle training and behavioral\n      therapy report greater improvement in validated urinary incontinence symptom severity,\n      pelvic floor distress and quality of life measures than women who do not undergo pelvic\n      floor muscle training.\n\n      III. To evaluate the acceptability of pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) among\n      gynecological cancer survivors and to provide preliminary data to inform a power analysis\n      for a larger randomized trial.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I: Patients receive a handout describing behavioral management tips for urinary\n      incontinence, including information and suggestions about optimal volume fluid intake,\n      constipation management, measures to reduce urgency by spreading fluid intake, and avoiding\n      caffeine and other bladder irritants that have proved effective in other intervention\n      trials.
