The epidermal growth factor\n      receptor (EGFR) adenosine triphosphate-competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib\n      showed success in the treatment of advanced adenocarcinoma NSCLC following the failure of\n      front-line chemotherapy. However, the efficiency of treatment as second or third-line in\n      patients with advanced adenocarcinoma NSCLC is also low. It is necessary to further improve\n      the efficiency of treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC. Biological treatment is an\n      effective adjuvant treatment in comprehensive cancer treatment. Immunotherapy with\n      cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK) characterized as fast amplification, strong anti-cancer\n      activity and broad anti-tumor spectrum, this effect may improve tumor control and survival,\n      as well as a better quality of life.
