    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well radiation therapy and docetaxel work in treating
      patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal cancer. Radiation therapy
      uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving radiation therapy with docetaxel my kill more tumor
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the cumulative incidence of local/regional failure at 2 years after study
      registration.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the rate of acute grade 3 or higher functional mucosal adverse events (up
      to 1 month post-radiation therapy [XRT]) associated with adjuvant docetaxel +
      hyperfractionated radiotherapy (key secondary endpoint).

      II. To assess changes in overall survival, disease-free survival, distant failure rates, and
      quality of life (QOL) associated with adjuvant docetaxel and hyperfractionated radiation.

      III. To characterize other acute adverse events (up to 1 month post-XRT) and late grade 3 or
      higher non-hematologic adverse events (up to 2 years post-XRT) associated with adjuvant
      docetaxel + hyperfractionated radiotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1 and 8 and undergo
      hyperfractionated intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) twice daily (BID) on days 1-5
      and 8-12 (20 fractions).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 14 days, 1 month, every 3
      months for 2 years, every 6 months for 1 year and then annually for 2 years.
