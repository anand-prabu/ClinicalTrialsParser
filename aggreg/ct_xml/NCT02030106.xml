  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort, enriched with women with a prior term birth, of singleton
      pregnancies who will be followed for the outcome of preterm birth. The main exposure of
      interest is the characterization of the cervico-vaginal microbiota. Women will be recruited
      from a population seeking routine obstetrical care at obstetrical practices at Penn. They
      will have three research visits during pregnancy to complete questionnaires and collect
      samples of cervico-vaginal fluid and cervical cells. Outcome data will be collected about
      the prenatal events and timing of  delivery.

      Patients will be recruited around the time of their routine obstetrical visits. They will be
      asked to participate in three visits total. Visit one/enrollment occurs between 16 and 20
      weeks of gestation, visit two at 20-24 weeks, and visit three at 24-28 weeks. At each visit,
      vaginal swabs will be collected.  The patient will also be asked to fill out a series of
      surveys related to stress, anxiety,and depression in pregnancy. Research coordinators will
      perform chart abstraction after delivery.

      Women will self-collect samples of their cervicovaginal fluid using large cotton swabs.

      Subjects who have had a previous preterm birth will also have cervical cells collected in
      the same manner that cells are collected for a routine pap smear.

        Pregnant women will be recruited from three locations: Penn ObGyn Associates, Helen O.
        Dickens Clinic, and Maternal Fetal Medicine at 2000 Courtyard. Potential subjects will be
        identified from clinical schedules and will be pre-screened in EPIC for eligibility. They
        may be approached during a clinical visit, or the research team may call them prior to or
        after a scheduled visit to introduce the study. Women can be enrolled anytime between the
        confirmation of pregnancy and 20 weeks/0 days gestation. For convenience, research visits
        can be conducted at the time of a scheduled clinical visit, or at a separate time.
