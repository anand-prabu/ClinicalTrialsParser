The hypothesis is that strict fluid restriction leads to a\n      larger increase in plasma sodium than standard treatment in patients with decompensated\n      heart failure associated with hyponatremia. A secondary hypothesis is that the neurohormonal\n      change is greater in patients treated with strict fluid restriction versus standard\n      treatment."
