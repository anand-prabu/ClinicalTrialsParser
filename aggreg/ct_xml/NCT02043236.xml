    <textblock>
      This is a phase II randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 2 strategies to improve bone health
      in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this RCT the investigators are comparing 2 strategies to improve bone health to usual
      care. Strategy 1 - Patient and physician-specific written educational material. Pilot-tested
      customized written educational material about bone health for men on ADT will be used for
      this study. A customized letter will be prepared for the patient's primary care physician,
      with specific advice and recommendations for the targeted strategies. Both pamphlet and
      letter will include a list of additional resources. Strategy 2 - patient written material
      and a bone health care coordinator (BHCC). The same written patient material as in strategy
      1 will be used, along with a BHCC who will follow the approach of successful studies and
      contact the patient by phone or arrange an in-person visit at the hospital if preferred by
      the patient. The BHCC will also encourage the patient to pursue a bone mineral density test
      (BMD) with their physician and adopt bone-appropriate diet, lifestyle, and supplement intake
      recommendations, and will follow up with the patient at least twice over the next 3 months
      to facilitate behavioural changes and BMD ordering. Counselling sessions are short,
      typically &lt;15 min. The BHCC will also contact the patient's physician to help facilitate BMD
      testing. Time points in the study are baseline, 3-month follow up, and 6-month follow up.

      Control group The control group consists of a wait-list control for 6 months, during which
      no specific recommendations or interventions will be made by the study team. Prostate Cancer
      (PC) clinicians  can still provide usual care. At the end of 6 months, control group
      participants will be referred to the Osteoporosis Clinic at the University Health Network.
