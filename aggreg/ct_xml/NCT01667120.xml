    <textblock>
      The general purpose of this study is to characterize the safety profile of ketorolac in
      infants age 0-3 months. Our hypothesis is that ketorolac is safe in neonates, and effective
      in controlling pain with less narcotic administration required. Ketorolac 0.5mg/kg
      intravenously every 8 hrs for 72hrs will be administered versus an equivalent volume of 0.9%
      normal saline as placebo.

      Primary: The primary purpose of this study is to compare bleeding events in neonates who
      receive ketorolac and those who do not receive ketorolac. The investigators hypothesize that
      ketorolac is safe and effective in infants &gt; 37wks gestation and at least one week of age.

      Secondary: The investigators intend to evaluate daily creatinine levels, pain scores, urine
      output per shift, platelet counts, hemoglobin levels, number of days on the ventilator,
      amount of narcotic administered, blood pressure, and reintubation events on all patients in
      this study as secondary study points.

      This is a Phase II, single center, randomized controlled pilot study. Hospitalized patients
      one week of age to 3 months of age who undergo an abdominal surgical procedure within the
      moderate or severe degree of pain category (see attached Table 1: postoperative pain
      categories) will be randomized to receive standard pain management regimens plus placebo
      (0.9% saline of equivalent volume) or ketorolac 0.5mg IV q8h x 72h plus standard pain
      management regimens. The postoperative management will be unchanged and at the discretion of
      the attending surgeon, as appropriate for the surgical procedure. The patients will be
      followed for 5 days, or 48hrs from the end of ketorolac therapy for primary and secondary
      endpoints.
