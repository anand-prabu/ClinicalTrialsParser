  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite significant increases in global health investment  and the availability of low-cost,
      efficacious interventions designed to reduce mother to child HIV transmission in low and
      middle income countries with high HIV burden, the translation of these scientific advances
      into effective delivery strategies has been slow, uneven and  incomplete. As a result,
      pediatric HIV infection remains largely uncontrolled.  Enhancing the implementation of pMTCT
      interventions through contextually appropriate systems analysis and improvement approaches
      can potentially reduce drop-offs along the pMTCT cascade, leading to dramatic improvements
      in infant and maternal outcomes.  The goal of this proposal is to develop a model for
      systematic assessment and improvement of pMTCT services in sub-Saharan Africa. In specific
      aim 1, we will identify health system factors and service delivery approaches associated
      with high and low performing pMTCT services in C么te d'Ivoire, Kenya and Mozambique. In
      specific aim 2 we will adapt evaluate the feasibility and impact of a systems analysis tool
      and associated performance enhancement approach for pMTCT services in C么te d'Ivoire, Kenya
      and Mozambique.  This systems analysis tool and associated performance enhancement approach
      is currently being developed and piloted for pMTCT services in Mozambique.  The results of
      this implementation research are expected to generate knowledge of global health
      significance, and by disseminating the study results and intervention tools through the
      broad PEPFAR network, can rapidly impact pMTCT service delivery enhancements across the
      highest need countries.
