This resource is\n      designed to allow genomic, proteomic and transcriptional data to be integrated with high\n      quality clinical phenotype and outcomes data to identify risk factors for development and\n      severity of acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, organ toxicity, relapse, mortality, infection and\n      other clinically significant complications occurring after allogeneic HCT.\n\n      To achieve this goal, patients and donors will be recruited and consent obtained at the time\n      that they enroll on BMT CTN protocols where enrollment occurs at or before transplantation\n      or prior to start of conditioning for patients enrolled on non-BMT CTN studies or treated as\n      standard of care.  Samples will be collected: (1) from patients and donors pre-transplant;\n      and, (2) from patients post-transplant on a calendar schedule through the first 3 months\n      post-HCT.  For patients co-enrolled on BMT CTN studies, clinical data will be collected in\n      the context of the primary transplant protocols.  For patients not enrolled on BMT CTN\n      protocols, clinical data on early post-transplant events will be collected using the same\n      data collection forms and systems that are used on BMT CTN trials.  Additional clinical data\n      for both BMT CTN and non-BMT CTN patients will be available from data submitted to the\n      Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) using the CIBMTR\n      Comprehensive Report Forms.  This protocol also leverages ongoing pre-transplant\n      donor-recipient sample collection performed by the CIBMTR and National Marrow Donor Program\n      (NMDP).  Success in establishing this shared resource will inspire future investigator\n      initiated research proposals and will allow investigators to take advantage of National\n      Institutes of Health (NIH) funding initiatives."
