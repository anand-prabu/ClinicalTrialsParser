            "textblock": "INTRODUCTION\n\n      Overview:\n\n      The measurement of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is the only clinical test for measuring\n      airway inflammation that can be performed consistently and accurately in clinical practice\n      at the point-of-care. Airway inflammation is now recognized as the central mechanism in the\n      pathogenesis of asthma. The measurement of FeNO with the NIOX MINO\u00ae device provides a rapid,\n      noninvasive, and inexpensive tool to assess airway inflammation in inflammatory airway\n      diseases such as asthma. The test is easy to perform and requires minimal training for the\n      operator to conduct the test.\n\n      Role of Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO):\n\n      FeNO has evolved as a predictive and prognostic biomarker for airway inflammation. Nitric\n      oxide (NO) gas is produced in the epithelial cells of the bronchial wall as an intrinsic\n      part of the inflammatory process.\n\n      Measuring the amount of FeNO is useful in the initial assessment of patients with chronic\n      cough or non-specific respiratory symptoms suggestive of asthma, and for the management of\n      patients with established asthma who are receiving corticosteroid treatment.\n\n      Intended Use:\n\n      NIOX MINO\u00ae measures Nitric Oxide (NO) in human breath.  Nitric Oxide is frequently increased\n      in inflammatory processes such as asthma.  The fractional NO concentration in expired breath\n      (FeNO) can be measured by NIOX MINO\u00ae with assurance that such measurements are repeatable\n      and according to guidelines for NO measurement established by the American Thoracic Society.\n\n      Rationale for Study:\n\n      None of the standard clinical assessment tools provide information regarding underlying\n      airway inflammation, the control of which is central to an effective asthma management\n      strategy.  Therefore this study will evaluate the impact of FeNO assessments on asthma\n      treatment decisions in approximately 40-50 subjects 7-60 years of age with asthma.  This\n      pilot study will also provide information regarding the ability of physicians to correctly\n      assess airway inflammation using standard clinical assessment tools (i.e., prior to FeNO\n      measurement).  Finally, this pilot study will allow the cost consequences of changes in\n      asthma management following FeNO determinations to be estimated.\n\n      CLINICAL INVESTIGATION OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the\n      impact of FeNO assessments on asthma treatment decisions.\n\n      The secondary objectives of this study are to:\n\n        -  Evaluate the ability of physicians to correctly assess airway inflammation using\n           standard clinical assessment tools (i.e., prior to FeNO measurement).\n\n        -  Estimate the cost consequences of changes in asthma management following FeNO\n           determinations.\n\n      CLINICAL INVESTIGATION PLAN\n\n      This is a pilot, observational, single-center, single-visit, outpatient study.\n      Approximately 30 to 50 subjects will participate in the study during an (approximately) 8 to\n      12 week study enrollment period.  Eligible subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion\n      criteria for this study will be invited to participate.  The following documentation and\n      information will be provided by subjects:\n\n        -  Informed consent\n\n        -  Demographics\n\n        -  Smoking history (cigarettes only)\n\n        -  Usual asthma standard of care assessments\n\n        -  Asthma control test questionnaire\n\n        -  Spirometry\n\n        -  Study physician questions\n\n      FeNO: FeNO will be performed and the value will be reviewed and record.\n\n      Subject discharge from the study:\n\n      Once all information has been collected and all procedures have been performed, the subject\n      will be discharged from the clinic and their study participation will be complete\n\n      Medical device:\n\n      The NIOX MINO\u00ae was initially cleared by the FDA on March 4, 2008 as a new hand-held device\n      for the measurement of exhaled Nitric Oxide, a marker of eosinophilic airway inflammation.\n      The most recent clearance by the FDA was on September 2, 2010 for Instrument (09-1100),\n      which will be used in this study.  NIOX MINO\u00ae can be used in children 7-17 years of age and\n      in adults 18 years of age or older in the initial assessment and management of asthma.\n\n      The NIOX MINO\u00ae is a 10 second test based on exhaled breath measured at a 50 ml/second flow\n      rate. Results are provided at the point of care within 2 minutes after the successful\n      completion of the breath test. The test cannot be influenced by patient effort or variations\n      in the clinician's test technique.\n\n      Definitions:\n\n      Adverse event: Any incident where the use of a medical device (including in vitro\n      diagnostics) is suspected to have resulted in an adverse outcome in a patient.\n\n      Serious Injury means injury or illness that:\n\n        -  Is life-threatening\n\n        -  Results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body\n           structure, or\n\n        -  Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a\n           body function or permanent damage to a body structure.\n\n      Malfunction:  the failure of a device to meet its performance specifications or otherwise\n      perform as intended.\n\n      Caused or contributed:  the death or serious injury was or may have been attributed to a\n      medical device, or that the medical device was or may have been a factor in a death or\n      serious injury, including events occurring as a result of:\n\n        -  Failure\n\n        -  Malfunction\n\n        -  Improper or inadequate design\n\n        -  Manufacture\n\n        -  Labeling\n\n        -  User error"
