It starts with the first\n      APVAC1 vaccination, followed by additional APVAC2 vaccinations at a later time point and\n      ends with the Last Endpoint Evaluation Visit (LEEV) of a patient.\n\n      Single vaccinations with APVAC vaccines consist of an intradermal (i.d.) injection of the\n      personalized APVAC drug product into the skin of the thigh, shoulder or abdomen followed by\n      subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of 1.5 mg poly-ICLC (Hiltonol\u00ae) in close proximity to the\n      vaccination site."
