Hypoxyprobe will be used to determine the levels of oxygen post-surgery\n      in the current study.  If the study is successful, then imaging can be used to determine a\n      tumor's oxygen status even in patients who are not getting surgery.\n\n      Investigators want to find out how much oxygen is in the participants tumor based on how\n      much pimo is present, and correlate this with the results of their MRI and\n      18F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) PET scan.\n\n      This study is also testing the investigational radioactive substance known as FMISO. FMISO\n      is used during PET scans to help doctors see how much oxygen a tumor is getting.\n      Participants might be asked to participate in an optional PET scan using FMISO."
