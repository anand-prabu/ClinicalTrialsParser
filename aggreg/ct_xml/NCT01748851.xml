      The purpose of this study is to identify the non-inferiority of the combination therapy of
      Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin compared with the combination therapy of Fluorouracil/Folinic
      acid and Oxaliplatin in patients with advanced gastric cancer.

      Quality assurance: Data will be collected, controlled, and monitored at the Korean Clinical
      Study Group (KCSG) data center.

      Data will be entered throuGh the E-Case report form (CRF) (Web based data input)

      Korean Clinical Study Group (KCSG) data center will do the standard Operating Procedures to
      address registry operations and analysis activities, such as patient recruitment, data
      collection, data management, data analysis, reporting for adverse events, and change
      management

      Sample size assessment to specify the number of participants or participant years was
      consulted Statistical specialist. And data analysis will be also discuss with him

      Expected median progression-free survival(PFS) in Xelox: 6 months total number of events
      required: 359 197 patients will be needed After 10% of follow-up loss, 219 patients in each
      arm, a total of 438 patients will be enrolled
