Secondary aims are to demonstrate that single-anastomosis\n      duodeno-ileal bypass is simpler to perform, quicker and has less postoperative short, mid\n      and long-term complications."

            "textblock": "Sleeve gastrectomy is a restrictive operation for morbid obesity which has a 60% success\n      rate in solving both morbid obesity and related co-morbidities, mainly diabetes mellitus.\n      When the sleeve is not enough for the patient, due to alimentary habits or to an excessive\n      initial BMI before surgery (usually over 50 - 55), a second-step operation should be\n      performed to increase effectiveness. Some patients are submitted to a second restrictive\n      operation, i.e.: a re-sleeve, a gastric plication or sleeve banding. Other group are offered\n      a gastric bypass. And, finally, a subset of patients, generally those with higher initial\n      BMI, are offered a malabsorptive operation. While re-sleeve is adequate for many patients,\n      gastric bypass is not offering a greater weight loss rate, and it is a complex operation\n      requiring sectioning of the sleeve and two anastomoses. We support the performance of\n      malabsorptive operations which warrant a better weight loss result for \"resistant\" patients\n      needing a second-step. As Single-Anastomosis Duodeno-Ileal bypass with Sleeve gastrectomy\n      (SADI-S) has behaved as a good primary operation for morbid obesity, we decided to test this\n      one-loop reconstruction as a second step operation. Results will be compared to those\n      obtained with a Roux-en-Y duodenal switch performed as a second step after a \"failed\"\n      sleeve."
