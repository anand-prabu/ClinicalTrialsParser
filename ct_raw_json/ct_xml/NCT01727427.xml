  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The same initial and long-term anticoagulation is suggested for unsuspected  pulmonary
      embolism as for patients with symptomatic embolism. Based on these indications, cancer
      patients with unsuspected pulmonary embolism would be anticoagulated for at least 6 months
      or until the disease is active, which in most cases would mean indefinite treatment. In
      fact, dedicated studies on the treatment of unsuspected pulmonary embolism are missing,
      leaving doubts over the need for (indefinite) anticoagulation which exposes these patients
      to an increased risk of major bleeding events. Concerns over the need for anticoagulant
      treatment may especially hold for pulmonary embolism of the distal pulmonary tree since
      segmental and sub-segmental PE seem to have a more benign course than more proximal
      embolism.

      The scope of this study is to evaluate the current treatment approaches for unsuspected
      pulmonary embolism and to assess their efficacy and safety in a large prospective cohort of
      cancer patients.

    <description>Suspected recurrent PE with one of the following:
new intra-luminal filling defect on CT scan, MRI scan, or pulmonary angiogram;
new perfusion defect of at least 75% on V/Q lung scan;
inconclusive spiral CT, pulmonary angiography or lung scan with demonstration of DVT in the lower extremities by CUS or venography
Fatal PE is:
PE based on objective diagnostic testing or autopsy or
death not attributed to a documented cause and for which DVT/PE cannot be ruled out.
Suspected (recurrent) DVT with one of the following findings:
abnormal CUS;
an intra-luminal filling defect on venography.</description>

    <description>Major bleeding will be defined as overt bleeding associated with: a fall in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL or more, or leading to a transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells or whole blood, or bleeding that occurs in a critical site: intracranial, intra-spinal, intraocular, pericardial, intra-articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, retroperitoneal or contributing to death.
Other clinically relevant non-major bleeding will be defined as overt bleeding not meeting the criteria for major bleeding but associated with medical intervention, unscheduled contact (visit or telephone call) with a physician, (temporary) cessation of study treatment, or associated with discomfort for the patient such as pain, or impairment of activities of daily life. All other bleeding events will be classified as minor.</description>
