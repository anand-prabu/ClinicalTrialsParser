The purpose of this research is to\n      find out how fat circulating in the blood following fat consumption is taken up by the\n      muscles in healthy people as well as people that are insulin-resistant. The investigators\n      are specifically interested in how a hormone called insulin is involved in this process.\n      Findings from this research will contribute to our understanding of why insulin-resistant\n      people have increased accumulation of fat in their muscles, and ultimately help to design\n      appropriate interventions to prevent type 2 Diabetes."
