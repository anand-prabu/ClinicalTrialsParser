      This pilot clinical trial studies irinotecan hydrochloride in treating patients with breast
      cancer and brain metastases that progressed after whole brain radiation therapy or
      stereotactic radiosurgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan hydrochloride,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES; I. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of irinotecan (irinotecan
      hydrochloride) in breast cancer patients with brain metastases who progressed after
      radiation therapy.

      II. To estimate central nervous system (CNS) objective response and clinical benefit rate in
      patients with breast cancer and brain metastases treated with irinotecan.

      III. To estimate progression free survival. IV. To estimate overall survival. V. To assess
      the toxicity of Irinotecan.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 8,
      15, 22, and 29. Courses repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 24 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer (irrespective of receptor
             status), with evidence of CNS disease by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI), who have progressed after whole brain radiation therapy or
             stereotactic radiosurgery

          -  Patients must not be a candidate for surgical resection and/or further stereotactic
             radiosurgery

          -  At least two weeks must have elapsed since prior chemotherapy, three weeks must have
             elapsed since last surgery, and six weeks since completion of radiation therapy

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1500

          -  Platelet count (plt) &gt; 125

          -  Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels within five times the
             upper limit of normal

          -  Patients may be on oral corticosteroids at stable dose (no dose change within two
             weeks of enrollment), and may be on antiepileptic medication (except for cytochrome
             P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme-inducing antiepileptic medications)

          -  Fertile patients must use effective contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy, lactation, immunosuppression other than corticosteroids

          -  Patient may be on hormonal therapy or Herceptin, but no other concurrent chemotherapy
             is allowed

          -  Patients who had progression of their breast cancer after prior administration of
             irinotecan are excluded

          -  Patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis as the only site of CNS involvement are
             excluded

          -  No other active malignancy except for any of the following: curatively treated basal
             or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, other
             malignancies considered disease-free

          -  Patients using valproic acid within the last two weeks and patients with
             contraindications to anticholinergic agents will be excluded

          -  Concurrent administration of CYP3A4 enzyme-inducing antiepileptic medications (e.g.
             phenytoin) will not be allowed (if patients are taking one of these agents, they must
             switch to a non- enzyme-inducing antiepileptic medication prior to start of
             treatment)

          -  No history of immediate or delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to gadolinium
             contrast agents or other contraindication to gadolinium contrast, and no other known
             contraindication to MRI

          -  Homozygous for uridine diphosphate (UDP) glucuronosyltransferase 1 family,
             polypeptide A1 (UGT1A1)*28 allele * All patients will be tested for UGT1A genotype
             prior to starting treatment and be excluded if they are homozygous for the UGT1A1*28
             allele (UGT1A1 7/7 genotype); irinotecan's active metabolite glucuronidation of
             7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38) is inactivated through glucuronidation by
             uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) mainly in the liver and is
             excreted through the bile ducts; a meta-analysis demonstrated that the UGT1A1*28
             genotype is moderately predictive of severe irinotecan induced hematologic toxicity
             at moderate doses and strongly predictive at high doses, and in 2005, the Food and
             Drug Administration (FDA) added a warning to the irinotecan packaging label that
             patients with the UGT1A1*28 genotype were at increased risk for neutropenia
