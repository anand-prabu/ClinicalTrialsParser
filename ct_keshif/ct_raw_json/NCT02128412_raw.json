            "textblock": "Stent placement is now widely accepted to improve the results of angioplasty (an operation\n      to widen the blood vessel) and decreasing the need for further surgery. Despite their\n      worldwide acceptance, stent usage is still limited by renarrowing which occurs within the\n      stent (restenosis) in some patients within the first six months. In addition there still\n      exists a small risk of heart attacks soon after the stent is placed.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of trying to place the\n      stents using a different strategy of using low pressure oversized balloon inflations as\n      opposed to the usual high pressure balloon inflations. This may reduce injury to the artery\n      and reduce the chance of renarrowing of the stent. In order to ensure this is a safe and\n      effective way of performing the procedure the investigators intend to use an Intravascular\n      ultrasound (IVUS) catheter to look from inside the artery at the stents. IVUS has proven to\n      be the best way of ensuring optimal stent placement.\n\n      Primary hypothesis: Stents will be equally well expanded and apposed using a strategy of\n      oversized stenting at normal inflation pressures ( < 10 atmospheres ) as compared to high\n      pressure inflation (\u226514 atmospheres) as guided by intravascular ultrasound imaging.\n\n      Secondary Hypothesis: There will be no difference in acute clinical endpoints (death,\n      myocardial infarction, urgent revascularisation or stent thrombosis) using a strategy of\n      oversized stenting at normal inflation pressure as compared to high pressure inflation.\n\n      Tertiary Hypothesis: If the above is shown to be true the investigators would hope to expand\n      the study in order to reveal a decrease in stent restenosis using a strategy of lower\n      pressure balloon inflations. The investigators will assess the deployment characteristics of\n      drug eluting versus bare metal stents"
