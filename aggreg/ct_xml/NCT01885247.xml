  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of patients with Obstructive Chronic BronchoPneumopathy (OCBP) is based on a
      progression of therapeutic options and on a sensitization to physical activity.

      For these patients selected on OCBP stage 2, the treatment options include Long Acting
      Beta-Agonist Bronchodilator (LABA) or Long Acting Muscarinic Antagonist Anticholinergic
      (LAMA) or both (LAMA+LABA).

      The purpose of this study is to observe in common clinical practice the benefit of physical
      activity on quality of life, dyspnoea and walking distance for these patients under
      treatment (LABA and/or LAMA) and to determine whether these 3 medical strategies
      (LABA/LAMA/LABA+LAMA) benefit from physical activity.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life after 4 to 10 weeks of physical activity program</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 before physical activity program and Visit 2 after 4 to 10 weeks of physical activity program</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Evaluation of quality of life by specific questionnaires (VQ11, RICCI Test) and by specific parameters such as: spirometry, dyspnea, Body Mass Index (BMI), 6 minute Stepper Test (TS6), Body mass index, airflow Obstruction, Dyspnea and Exercise tolerance (BODE), O2 maximal Volume (VO2max) or Electrocardiogram (ECG).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medical Research Council dyspnea scale (grade degree 0 to 4)activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Grade degree of dyspnea will be evaluated one time before and after the physical activity program an expected average of 10 weeks.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Grade Degree of breathlessness related to activities (o to 4) :
0 : Not troubled by breathlessness except on strenuous exercise
: Short of breath when hurrying or walking up a slight hill
: Walks slower than contemporaries on level ground because of breathlessness, or has to stop for breath when walking at own pace
: Stops for breath after walking about 100m or after a few minutes on level ground
: Too breathless to leave the house, or breathless when dressing or undressing</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>6 Minute Walking Test (6MWT) (unit : meter)</measure>
    <time_frame>6MWT will be realized one time before and after the physical activity program an expected average of 10 weeks.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The original purpose of the six minute walk was to test exercise tolerance in chronic respiratory disease and heart failure. The six-minute walk test (6MWT) measures the distance an individual is able to walk over a total of six minutes on a hard, flat surface. The goal is for the individual to walk as far as possible in six minutes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Actimetry by accelerometer (unit : number of body movement)</measure>
    <time_frame>Accelerometer will be installed one time before and after the physical activity program an expected average of 10 weeks.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Actimetry by accelerometer to assess physical activity. Technically, an accelerometer consists of a device with a piezoelectric sensor that registers physical activity via body movement (acceleration) produced during a limited period of time.</description>
