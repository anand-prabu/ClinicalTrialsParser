Non-childbearing potential is defined\n             as: Pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy [for this\n             definition, \"documented\" refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's\n             review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a\n             verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records].\n             Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea.

Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and\n             whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the acceptable\n             contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.\n             Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status\n             prior to study enrollment.  For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks will elapse\n             between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the\n             type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they\n             can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.\n\n          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one\n             of the acceptable contraception methods.  This criterion must be followed from the\n             time of the first dose of study medication until follow up visit.\n\n          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the\n             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  CRITERIA BASED UPON MEDICAL HISTORIES:\n\n          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary\n             abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome).\n\n          -  History of chronic or acute pancreatitis.

Subjects with gastroparesis requiring treatment are\n             excluded.\n\n          -  History of significant cardiovascular disease including acute myocardial infarction,\n             stroke, hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome, heart failure within the\n             previous 12 months.\n\n          -  Uncontrolled hypertension, as evidenced by systolic pressure >160 or diastolic\n             pressure >90. Subjects taking anti-hypertensive medications are permitted.\n\n          -  Significant ECG abnormalities, defined as follows: Heart rate (resting) <50 and >100\n             beats per minute (bpm); PR Interval <120 and >220 milliseconds (msec); QRS duration\n             <70 and >120 msec\n\n          -  History of untreated pernicious anemia or who have laboratory parameters suggestive\n             of subclinical megaloblastic anemia (e.g., increased mean corpuscular volume with low\n             red blood cells count and/or haemoglobin level).\n\n          -  Current or relevant previous significant medical disorder that may require treatment\n             or make the subject unlikely to fully complete the study, or any condition that, in\n             the opinion of the investigator, presents undue risk from the study medication or\n             procedures.\n\n          -  Thyroid Disease: Uncorrected Thyroid Dysfunction:  Fasting plasma thyroid stimulating\n             hormone (TSH) outside of the normal range, as determined at the screening visit;\n             Subjects on stable thyroid replacement therapy and with TSH in the normal range are\n             eligible if approved by the GSK Medical Monitor; Unevaluated thyroid nodule or goiter\n             at Screening.\n\n          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: An\n             average weekly intake of >14 drinks for males or >7 drinks for females.
