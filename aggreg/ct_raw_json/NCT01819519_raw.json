The study research\n      assistants will enroll pregnant women who are less than 20 weeks' gestation, either English\n      or Spanish-speaking and that do not have a primary CMV infection (never been infected or\n      previously infected). Enrollment will occur during the woman's prenatal visit."

Women lacking evidence of acute infection will be\n      eligible for randomization into this study. Patients must be randomized no later than 20\n      weeks gestation.\n\n      If eligible and no more than 20 weeks gestation, the patient will be randomized. If the\n      patient is randomized in the control group, she will continue her routine prenatal care\n      inclusive of the CDC brochure that she received at the time of her venipuncture for\n      serologic screening and assessment of hygiene behaviors. If the patient is randomized into\n      the intervention group, we will deliver a face-face educational intervention during her next\n      routine prenatal visit. In addition to the intervention, the patient will include\n      educational material to take home.\n\n      Both groups will be assessed for performance of hygiene behaviors as a baseline assessment\n      at the time of consent. A second assessment will occur at least 12 weeks after enrollment\n      during the third trimester between 28-36 weeks of gestation. The follow-up assessment will\n      be completed by a different research assistant from the unblinded educator. A Kessler 10\n      (K10) survey will also be completed in addition to the baseline and follow-up assessment.\n\n      The follow-up assessment will take place during the participant's third trimester between\n      28-36 weeks of gestation, depending on duration of enrollment and likelihood of early\n      delivery. The enrollment duration will vary from approximately 14-20 weeks."
