The purpose of this study is\n      to determine how soft tissue sarcomas respond to treatment with an investigational drug\n      called tivozanib. In some lab and clinical studies, tivozanib has been shown to interfere\n      with the growth of some types of tumors. The study will also evaluate how safe the study\n      treatment is by observing how many and what kind of adverse events (side effects)\n      participants experience."

To determine the progression-free survival (defined as complete response [CR] + partial\n      response [PR] + stable disease [SD]) assessed at 16 weeks for patients treated with\n      tivozanib.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. Overall response rate (defined as CR + PR). II. Clinical benefit rate (CR + PR + SD).\n      III. Overall survival (up to 2 years beyond progression). IV. Correlation of clinical\n      outcome with antibodies for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1) and\n      VEGFR2.\n\n      V. Assess Safety and tolerability.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive tivozanib orally (PO) daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or until discontinuation per\n      patient preference or physician recommendation.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years."
