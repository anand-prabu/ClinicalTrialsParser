      Background:

      - Dental plaque is a coating of bacteria on the teeth. It contributes to poor dental health
      and diseases such as gingivitis, cavities and periodontal disease. Researchers who study
      plaque know that many different types of oral bacteria stick to each other in test-tube
      experiments. However, it is not clear if these interactions occur in natural dental plaque.
      By studying how bacteria interact, researchers can better understand how bacteria come
      together and grow to form plaque.

      Objectives:

      - To look at how bacteria interact with one another to form dental plaque.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy nonsmoking volunteers at least 18 years of age.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and dental exam. They will also
           have dental impressions taken for a stent (a device similar to Invisalign(SqrRoot)
           braces).

        -  Participants will wear the stent for up to 8 hours a day on selected study visit days.
           It will contain enamel chips made from sterilized human teeth. The mouth bacteria will
           stick to the chips and grow. Chips will be taken out of the stent twice during these
           study visit days.

        -  Participants will have other study visits to provide saliva and plaque samples. They
           will also have gum swabs to collect bacteria.

        -  Some participants may have a second set of study visits. At these visits, they will
           chew gum to increase their saliva production. Afterwards, they will wear the stent with
           the enamel chips for 4 hours. Samples from the stent will be taken once on these study
           visit days.

    <textblock>
      Dental caries and periodontal disease are closely associated with the oral biofilm known as
      dental plaque. Much is known about the makeup of this biofilm, especially at its early stage
      of development (i.e. up to 12 hrs following tooth cleaning). The primary initial colonizers
      are streptococci, and actinomyces. These bacteria coaggregate frequently with one another by
      a mechanism that involves binding of protein adhesins on the surface of one cell to
      complementary cell surface receptor polysaccharides (RPS) on streptococci.

      Coaggregation profiles are known for a wide range of oral actinomyces and streptococci.
      However, despite the potential significance of these interactions in biofilm formation,
      little is known about their occurrence within oral biofilms in situ.

      Objective

      The objective of this study is to determine and compare the influence of coaggregation on
      the spatial organization of bacteria in supragingival dental plaque formed under conditions
      of normal salivary flow (Arm 1 of the protocol) or increased salivary flow (Arm 2 of the
      protocol).

      Study Population

      The study population will consist of up to twenty-five (25) healthy adult subjects 18 years
      of age and older. All subjects will participate in Arm 1 of the protocol. In addition, at
      least three volunteers from Arm 1 will participate in Arm 2 of the protocol.

      Study Design

      This will be an observational, longitudinal protocol to determine the spatial organization
      of bacteria found within dental plaque of normal healthy subjects. Enrolled subjects will
      have a standard oral examination (including oral cancer screening) performed in the NIDCR
      clinic by protocol-listed dental clinicians. A mandibular stent will be custom fabricated
      based on impressions taken during the exam. Enamel chips cut from previously extracted third
      molars will be sterilized by ethylene oxide then inserted into the stent on each side over
      the molar area. We currently have enough extracted third molars in storage to accommodate
      tooth chips for the entire protocol if four subjects complete the study as projected. If
      additional chips are needed, the NIDCR is currently in the process of preparing a protocol
      that will provide extracted teeth, if needed, for this and other protocols. In Arm 1 of the
      study, a custom-fitted stent will be worn in the mouth of each subject, and chips removed
      for analysis after 4 or 8 hours of wearing. The bacterial biofilm on the chips will be
      stained with fluorescent antibodies against specific microbial adhesins or receptors, after
      which the spatial organization of labeled cells within the biofilm will be documented by
      laser confocal microscopy. Chips may be used for bacterial isolation and subjects will be
      asked to provide saliva samples, and site-specific plaque samples (curette scrapings, gum
      swabs) for molecular taxonomic analysis. Decisions on which subjects will have these samples
      taken will be based on the reactivity of available antibodies with bacterial communities.
      Subjects from Arm 1 of the study who are chosen to participate in Arm 2, will chew a gum
      base for 10 minutes to increase salivary flow while wearing their stent. The stent from
      these individuals will be removed after 4 hours of additional wear and analyzed as above.
      Prior to participation in Arm 2 of the protocol, subjects will be advised that the
      experiments are supported by a CRADA agreement. Through this agreement, only coded research
      information will be exchanged.  The samples will remain with the NIH research team.
      Individuals may participate in the first arm only, or in both arms of the study, as
      indicated in their consent document.

      Outcome Measures

      Outcome measures for this protocol will be the qualitative and quantitative description of
      the oral bacterial community during development of initial plaque.
