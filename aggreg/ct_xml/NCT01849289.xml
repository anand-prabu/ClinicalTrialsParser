    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Type 2 diabetes mellitus (diagnosed clinically) for at least 6 months

          -  Insulin naïve subjects (Allowed are: previous short term insulin treatment up to 14
             days; treatment during hospitalisation or during gestational diabetes is allowed for
             periods longer than 14 days)

          -  Current treatment: metformin monotherapy or metformin in any combination with an
             insulin secretagogue (sulfonylurea or glinide), dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV)
             inhibitor, alfa-glucosidase-inhibitors (acarbose) with unchanged dosing for at least
             3 months prior to randomisation (Visit 2) with the minimum doses stated: metformin:
             alone or in combination (including fixed combination) 1500 mg daily, or maximum
             tolerated dose (at least 1000 mg daily), insulin secretagogue (sulfonylurea or
             glinide): minimum half of the daily maximal dose according to local labelling,
             DPP-IV inhibitor: minimum 100 mg daily or according to local labelling,
             alfa-glucosidase-inhibitors (acarbose): minimum half of the daily maximal dose or
             maximum tolerated dose

          -  HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin) 7.0-10.0% (both inclusive) by central laboratory
             analysis

          -  BMI (Body Mass Index) below or equal to 40.0 kg/m^2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with TZDs (thiazoledinedione), or GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1) receptor
             agonists within the last 3 months prior to Visit 1 (screening)

          -  Anticipated change in concomitant medication known to interfere significantly with
             glucose metabolism, such as systemic corticosteroids, beta-blockers, MAO (monoamine
             oxidase) inhibitors

          -  Cardiovascular disease within the last 6 months prior to Visit 1 (screening) defined
             as stroke; decompensated heart failure NYHA (New York Heart Association) class III or
             IV; myocardial infarction; unstable angina pectoris; or coronary arterial bypass
             graft or angioplasty

          -  Any clinically significant disease or disorder, except for conditions associated with
             type 2 diabetes mellitus, which in the Investigator's opinion could interfere with
             the results of the trial

          -  Previous participation in this trial. Participation is defined as randomised.
             Re-screening of screening failures is allowed only once within the limits of the
             recruitment period

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to trial product(s) or related products
