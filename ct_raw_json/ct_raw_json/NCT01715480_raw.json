            "textblock": "The overall purpose of this study is to obtain a better understanding of the biological\n      response of red blood cells to sulforaphane contained in fresh broccoli sprouts that have\n      been put through a blending process. This study will use commercially available fresh\n      broccoli sprouts certified by Brassica Protection Products LLC (BroccoSprouts\u00ae). This\n      product can also be purchased at some local grocery stores in the produce section. It is\n      believed that NRF2, a transcription factor encoded by the NFE2L2 gene, plays a role in the\n      regulation of defense against oxidative stress. The detrimental accelerated breakdown of\n      sickle cell disease (SCD) red blood cells (SS RBC) is partially due to reduced\n      anti-oxidative capacity. Previous analysis of SS RBC microRNAs revealed that a reduced level\n      of NRF2, the master regulator of anti-oxidative stress capacity, contributes to reduced\n      resistance to oxidative stress and increased hemolysis; NRF2 also induces fetal hemoglobin\n      (HbF), which is known to prevent SS RBC sickling.\n\n      First, erythroid progenitors from normal and SCD subjects will be tested ex-vivo to find out\n      how sulforaphane, a natural NRF2 activator, affects the oxidative stress capacity, HbF\n      expression, and microRNA expression of red cells.\n\n      Second, a pilot clinical trial will be conducted to determine the safety and physiological\n      effects of 3 weeks of daily consumption of broccoli sprout homogenate in a cohort of Hb\n      SS/SB0 thalassemia adult SCD patients. During this study, subjects RBCs will be assayed for\n      changes in anti-oxidative stress capacity and microRNA composition in mature SCD red blood\n      cells."
