Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as leucovorin calcium,\n      fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,\n      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

To assess response rate (RR). II. To assess progression free survival (PFS). III. To\n      assess toxicity in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer receiving FOLFOX and\n      metformin. IV. To identify tumor/serum correlative markers.\n\n      OUTLINE:  Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7\n      for an introductory period before the addition of FOLFOX.  After the introductory period,\n      patients will continue metformin twice daily and FOLFOX therapy comprising leucovorin\n      calcium intravenously (IV) over 120 minutes, fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours, and\n      oxaliplatin IV over 120 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.    After completion of study treatment,\n      patients are followed up for periodically."
