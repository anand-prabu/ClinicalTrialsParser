Information about any side effects\n      that may occur will also be collected.\n\n      The study consists of two parts. Part A will study healthy participants in up to 4 dosing\n      periods over approximately 6 weeks. Part B will study participants with diabetes in up to 3\n      dosing periods over approximately 5 weeks."
