  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In atherosclerotic patients undergoing kidney transplantation, arterial cannulation is
      commonly performed for continuous monitoring of systemic blood pressure and intermittent
      assessment of arterial blood gases. The radial artery is the preferred artery, because of
      its well-documented low complication rate and easy access, but, radial artery cannulation is
      may associated with complications. Atherosclerosis is a systemic phenomenon, and structural
      changes attributable to atherosclerosis, such as luminal narrowing, intimal hyperplasia, and
      reduction in distensibility occur frequently throughout the arterial tree. Especially in
      patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), the radial artery is prone to atherosclerosis and
      perhaps calcification. In a recent study, it was found that the radial artery flow was
      decreased immediately after cannulation, but recovered to its pre-cannulation value after
      5min, whereas a compensatory increase of blood flow in the ulnar artery occured immediately
      after cannulation, persisting until 5 min. This study enrolled the patients of ASA physical
      status 1-2. In the patients scheduled for elective kidney transplantation, this compensatory
      increase of blood flow in the ulnar artery may not be occurred, because of atherosclerosis,
      particularly in patients with DM. In our study, we found whether there is appropriate
      compensatory increase of blood flow in the ulnar artery after the radial artery cannulation
      in two groups, patients with DM (group DM) or without DM (group nonDM), both undergoing
      elective kidney transplantation.
