Although\n      conventional treatment options are potentially curative in selected patients, these\n      treatments also have drawbacks, including the risk of negative long-term quality of life\n      consequences and serious complications.\n\n      The CyberKnife\u00ae system is a type of radiation machine that uses a special system to\n      precisely focus large doses of x-rays on the tumor.  The device is designed to concentrate\n      large doses of radiation onto the tumor so that injury from radiation to the nearby normal\n      tissue will be minimal.\n\n      Patients will be treated with either CyberKnife\u00ae Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)\n      monotherapy or with prostate/seminal vesicles (SV)/pelvic Intensity Modulated Radiation\n      Therapy (IMRT), followed by CyberKnife\u00ae SBRT boost.  Treatment will last 4-7 days.\n      Patients will complete the QOL questionnaires before treatment.  Questionnaires will also be\n      completed during follow-up visits at 1 month, 3 months and every 6 months for five years."
