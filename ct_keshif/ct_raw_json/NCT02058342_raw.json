            "textblock": "Compared to other children, those with disability have additional challenges to being\n      physically active. Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a genetic form of childhood obesity that\n      is characterized by hypotonia, growth hormone deficiency, behavioral, and cognitive\n      disability. In children, the low prevalence of PWS (1 in 10,000 to 15,000 live births) makes\n      group-based physical activity (PA) interventions impossible. In contrast, the home\n      environment presents a natural venue to establish a PA routine for this population. The\n      present high prevalence of non-syndromal childhood obesity (one in four) and high physical\n      inactivity rates, make alternative approaches to increasing PA in this population an area of\n      high interest. Therefore, we have developed a 24-week home-based physical activity that\n      could be suitable for children and adolescents ages 8-15 with PWS as well as obese children\n      without PWS ages 8-11 years.  It is hypothesized that: 1) an age-appropriate 24-week\n      home-based PA intervention will increase PA levels in youth with PWS and without the\n      syndrome but with obesity; 2) motor proficiency, central sensory reception and integration,\n      and body composition will significantly improve in youth with and without PWS following\n      completion of the home-based PA intervention and 3) physical activity self-efficacy and\n      quality of life will increase significantly in youth with and without PWS who complete the\n      home-based PA intervention. The study participants are 115 youth ages 8-15 y (45 with PWS\n      and 70 without PWS but categorized as obese). The study utilizes a parallel design with the\n      wait-listed control group receiving the intervention after serving as control. Participants\n      are expected to complete the PA curriculum 4 days a week for six months including playground\n      games 2 days a week and interactive console games 2 days a week. Parents are trained at\n      baseline and then provided with a PA curriculum (Active Play at Home) and equipment to guide\n      their implementation of the program at home. Measurements of children and parent dyads are\n      assessed at baseline and at the end (week 24) of the intervention or control periods.\n      Outcome measures include PA, body composition, motor proficiency, central sensory reception\n      and integration (subsample of children only), quality of life and physical activity\n      self-efficacy.

The SOT is designed to identify impairments in one or more of the three sensory systems (i.e., vision, somatosensory, vestibular) that contribute to standing balance. This test has been previously used with pediatric populations, with and without disabilities such as cerebral palsy. The test is comprised of six test conditions. This test will be administered only in a subsample of participants (30 with PWS and 55 with non-syndromal obesity).",
