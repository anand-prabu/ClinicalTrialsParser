  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare an algorithm for IV sedation dosing to the current standard of
      care in patients undergoing first trimester surgical abortion.  The primary outcome is
      subjects' pain score with suction curettage on a 0-100 21-point scale.  Secondary outcomes
      include pain scores with cervical dilation and 15 minutes post-procedure, subjective pain
      ratings, incidents of side effects and adverse events, the frequency of additional doses of
      medication, recovery room time, and physician assessment of and satisfaction with pain
      control.  Investigators hypothesize that this algorithm will result in improved pain
      control, decreased frequency of additional medication doses, improved patient and physician
      satisfaction, without differences in side effects, adverse events or recovery room time.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain with suction curettage</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured on Day 1 (day of enrollment), immediately (within one minute) after completion of suction curettage and speculum removal</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Measured on Day 1 (day of enrollment), immediately after paracervical block</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Pain with paracervical block will be measured (a) on a 21-point 0 to 100 scale (in increments of five), and (b) on a subjective scale of &quot;no pain, mild pain, moderate pain or severe pain.&quot; Pain will be measured immediately after paracervical block.</description>

    <measure>Pain with cervical dilation</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured on Day 1 (day of enrollment), immediately after cervical dilation</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Pain with cervical dilation will be measured (a) on a 21-point 0 to 100 scale (in increments of five), and (b) on a subjective scale of &quot;no pain, mild pain, moderate pain or severe pain.&quot;  Pain with cervical dilation will be measured immediately after cervical dilation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-operative pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured on Day 1 (day of enrollment), 15 minutes post-operatively</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Post-operative pain will be measured (a) on a 21-point 0 to 100 scale (in increments of five), and (b) on a subjective scale of &quot;no pain, mild pain, moderate pain or severe pain.&quot;  Pain will be measured 15 minutes post-operatively when the patient is in the recovery room.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction with pain control</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured on Day 1 (day of enrollment), 15 minutes post-operatively</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Patients will be asked about their general satisfaction with pain control, what their pain was compared to what they expected, whether they would chose the same pain management strategy again, and whether they would recommend their strategy of pain management to a friend.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Side effects</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured on Day 1 (day of enrollment), 15 minutes post-operatively</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Investigators will assess side effects for all patients, including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and drowsiness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Doses given over the duration of the study</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured on Day 1 (day of enrollment), intraoperatively</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>To assess whether use of the algorithm changes physician's behavior in the standard care arm, investigators will also examine doses given over the duration of the study, to see if a &quot;learning curve&quot; develops among the physicians based on their experience with the algorithm.</description>

    <time_frame>Measured on Day 1 (day of enrollment), post-operatively</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Investigators will also have the physician assess patients' pain control, whether they felt the dose was appropriate and how easy or difficult it was to determine the patients' doses of pain medication.</description>
