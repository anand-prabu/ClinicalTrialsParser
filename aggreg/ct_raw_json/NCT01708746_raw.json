Pregnant women who present for\n      prenatal genetic counseling at the designated clinics and who meet study eligibility\n      criteria will be offered the option of the verifi\u00ae prenatal test by a trained, licensed and\n      certified genetic counselor (GC) .  Women who elect the verifi\u00ae prenatal test will have a\n      blood sample drawn by peripheral venipuncture that will be sent to the Verinata Health\n      CAP-accredited clinical laboratory (Redwood City, CA).  Results will be reported to the\n      ordering health care provider by the laboratory within 8-10 business days and will be shared\n      with the subject by their provider.  Subject care and decision-making following NIPT result\n      will be clinically managed by the provider with his/her subject and is not dictated by the\n      study protocol.  All eligible women who provide informed consent, whether they elect or\n      decline NIPT will be asked to complete a short questionnaire on their views of prenatal\n      testing.  The uptake of invasive prenatal procedures (CVS and/or amniocentesis) by the total\n      prospective cohort will be collected through review of electronic medical records (EMR).  A\n      historical cohort with matched demographic and pre-test indications to the prospective\n      cohort will be identified from the EMR for comparison in the primary analysis."
