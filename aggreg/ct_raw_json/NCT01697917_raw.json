AEG may represent a specific\n      histopathological and biologic entity. In the treatment AEG there is argument over whether\n      proximal gastractomy(PG) or total gastractomy (TG) should be done. The quality of life (QOL)\n      of the patients following TG or PG arouses people's attention. The purpose of this study was\n      to evaluate differences of the quality of life in patients undergoing total gastrectomy or\n      proximal gastrectomy for adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction."
