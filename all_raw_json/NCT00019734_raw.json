Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive recombinant fowlpox vaccine IM on day 1 followed 4 weeks later\n           by recombinant vaccinia vaccine IM. Treatment repeats for a minimum of 4 vaccinations.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive vaccinations as in arm I plus low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2)\n           subcutaneously daily on days 2-13 after each vaccination.\n\n        -  Arm III: Patients receive vaccinations as in arm I plus high-dose IL-2 IV over 15\n           minutes every 8 hours on days 2-5 after each vaccination.\n\n      Patients with stable disease or a minor, mixed, or partial response after four immunizations\n      (1 course) may receive a second course of the same regimen beginning 4-6 weeks after the\n      first course. After the second course, patients with tumor regression may continue to\n      receive treatment in the absence of unacceptable toxicity until best response is achieved.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4-6 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 73 patients (13-20 for arm I, 13-20 for arm II, and 19-33 for\n      arm III) will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
