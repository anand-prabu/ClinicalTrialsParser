  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in non-Hispanic
      white Americans. Neovascular AMD is an advanced form of macular degeneration that
      historically has accounted for the majority of vision loss related to AMD. The presence of
      choroidal neovascular membrane (CNV) formation is the hallmark feature of neovascular AMD.
      Choroidal neovascular membranes consist of buds of neovascular tissue and accompanying
      fibroblasts from the choroid perforating Bruch's membrane with extension either above or
      below the retinal pigment epithelium.  These neovascular complexes are associated with
      hemorrhage, fluid exudation and fibrosis formation resulting in photoreceptor damage and
      vision loss. Treatment of neovascular AMD consists of injecting inhibitors of vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) into the vitreous cavity to interfere with proliferation of
      choroidal neovascularization and to reduce vascular permeability.

      OCT is an imaging technology that can perform non-contact cross-sectional imaging of retinal
      and choroidal tissue structure in real time.  It is analogous to ultrasound B-mode imaging,
      except that OCT measures the intensity of reflected light rather than acoustical waves.

      This observational study will use OCT technology to study and compare the retinal and
      choroidal anatomy and blood flow in two groups of patients with neovascular AMD:  treatment
      naïve group and active treatment group.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the utility of OCT angiography in the evaluation of
      NVAMD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of Neovascular AMD confirmed by fluorescein dye leakage on angiogram or
             presence of at least one of the following on OCT:  subretinal fluid, intraretinal
             fluid, or sub-retinal pigment epithelial fluid.

          -  Treatment naïve group consists of individuals who have not received any treatment for
             neovascular AMD in the study eye

          -  Active treatment group consists of individuals who have received treatment with an
             anti-VEGF agent (Avastin, Lucentis, Macugen, or Eylea) 6 weeks prior enrollment visit

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to give informed consent.

          -  Inability to maintain stable fixation for OCT imaging

          -  Significant renal disease, defined as a history of chronic renal failure requiring
             dialysis or kidney transplant.

          -  A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in
             the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure, cardiovascular
             disease, and glycemic control).

          -  Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 (systolic above 180 OR diastolic above 110). If blood
             pressure is brought below 180/110 by anti-hypertensive treatment, subject can become
             eligible.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential: pregnant or lactating or intending to become
             pregnant within the next 12 months due to unknown safety of fluorescein angiography.

          -  Unable to ambulate and take tram from clinic to where OCT is located

          -  Prior macular laser treatment

          -  Subretinal hemorrhage or fibrosis &gt;50% of choroidal neovascular lesion

          -  Visual acuity 20/200 or worse

          -  An ocular condition is present such that, in the opinion of the investigator, may
             alter the retinal anatomy (eg: epiretinal membrane)

          -  An ocular condition is present (other than Neovascular AMD) that, in the opinion of
             the investigator, might affect or alter visual acuity during the course of the study
             (e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease, etc.).

          -  Substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to be
             decreasing visual acuity by 3 lines or more (i.e., cataract would be reducing acuity
             to 20/40 or worse if eye was otherwise normal).

          -  History of major ocular surgery (including vitrectomy, cataract extraction, scleral
             buckle, any intraocular surgery, etc.) within prior 4 months.
