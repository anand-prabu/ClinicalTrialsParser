A serum bank will be conserved in the \"Centre de\n      Biologie Sud\" (\"Groupement Hospitalier Lyon Sud\").\n\n      The serum samples will be assayed locally for the usual medical support to patients and\n      after they will be sent to Siamed'Xpress (Marseille), where they will be assayed with the\n      new diagnostic test. The results obtained from the two techniques will be compared.\n\n      The validation of this new TSH test represents a major advancement, since it could bring in\n      the future to a therapeutic index which will allow clinicians to treat earlier asymptomatic\n      patients with subclinical hypothyroidism."
