  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to investigate the safety of LY2606368 in combination with
      another anti-cancer drug (either cisplatin or cetuximab) in participants with advanced
      cancer or cancer that has spread to another part of the body. The study has four parts (A,
      B, C, and D). Participants will only enroll in one part.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of Parts A and B of this study is to determine a recommended dose level
      of LY2606368 (an inhibitor of checkpoint kinase 1[chk 1]) in combination with cisplatin
      (Part A) or cetuximab (Part B) in participants with advanced or metastatic cancer. Part C of
      the study will evaluate the safety and toxicity of LY2606368 at the recommended dose level
      in combination with cisplatin in participants with advanced or metastatic cancer, and Part D
      of the study will evaluate the safety and toxicity of LY2606368 at the recommended dose
      level in combination with cetuximab in participants with advanced or metastatic colorectal
      cancer.
