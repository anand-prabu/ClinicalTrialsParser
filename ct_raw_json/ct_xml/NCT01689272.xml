      The purpose of the study:

        -  To estimate the role of morphological, clinical, biochemical and imaging studies at
           stages of kidney transplantation (medical therapy, explantation, preservation,
           transplantation).

        -  To improve the ways of preserving optimal functional parameters of renal transplants.

    <textblock>
      Terminal chronic renal failure (ESRD) as a result of almost any chronic kidney disease
      develops due to progressive loss of nephrons. This state is characterized by a gradual
      deterioration of the functional abilities of not only the kidneys, but also the whole body.
      Currently, ESRD is among the first ten causes of mortality .

      Transplantation of donor organs is the only radical treatment for various diseases of the
      terminal, for patients with a fatal prognosis.

      Kidney transplantation has allowed not only save lives, but also to return to normal life,
      tens of thousands of people. Survival of renal transplant recipients is growing.

      Despite the progress made in many clinics worldwide in recent years in the field of
      transplantation, kidney transplantation, does not settle the problem of reperfusion injury
      and the associated post-transplant dysfunction with the absence of clear indicators of
      morphological, clinical, biochemical and instrumental methods to assess functional reserve
      of organs that remain relevant and meaningful.

    <description>Graft survival is assessed on the following criteria:
The duration of the functioning graft
Clinical, laboratory and device functioning graft.
Morphological and histological study of the stages of transplantation (for withdrawal, before implantation) and the post-transplant period (with the threat of rejection.) Study of the blood recipient: Laboratory tests of blood recipient: biochemical analysis, the composition of the electrolyte, acid-base status, the level of immunosuppressants. Immunological typing for HLA-system. Cross-typing of donor and recipient, the level of pre-existing limfotsitotoksicheskih antibodies in the recipient.Patients survival.</description>
