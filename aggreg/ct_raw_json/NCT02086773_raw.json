            "textblock": "Transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) is vitally important for the care of patients\n      undergoing myelosuppressive therapy for acute leukemia.  The therapeutic approach to this\n      disease involves the use of high doses of chemotherapy to treat the blood cancers and bone\n      marrow disorders; but it damages the marrow and blood system. Malignant and healthy stem\n      cells are affected by the chemotherapy, and even when the malignant cells are killed, it can\n      take weeks for the healthy cells to reconstitute the marrow. At diagnosis and before bone\n      marrow recovery post treatment, RBCs are needed to support the patient. Current practices at\n      major comprehensive cancer centers all utilize liberal hemoglobin transfusions triggers of\n      8-9 g/dL or higher. Higher hemoglobin levels in these high risk patients may have benefits\n      such as better energy and organ function. However, research in a variety of clinical\n      settings, suggests that a higher hemoglobin transfusion threshold is associated with the\n      same or even higher mortality rates compared to lower hemoglobin thresholds (7-8 g/dL).\n      These other settings include prospective randomized trials in high-risk orthopedic surgery\n      patients, critically ill adult and pediatric ICU patients, acute GI bleed patients, and\n      patients undergoing cardiac surgery.   One clinical scenario where the ideal transfusion\n      threshold is unknown is in patients receiving chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies.\n      Transfusion requirements and triggers have not been systematically studied in acute leukemia\n      or other cancers. Acute leukemia carries a high mortality; any unnecessary increase in\n      morbidity or mortality is not acceptable.   Without a clear benefit of higher transfusion\n      thresholds, the added risks and costs of transfusion may be substantial and unnecessary.\n      The investigators plan to study this issue in this pilot and feasibility study by randomly\n      assigning patients treated for acute leukemia to be transfused with RBCs at either a higher\n      or lower hemoglobin concentration trigger point. In this way, the investigators will be able\n      to accurately determine if there is benefit or harms to having a lower or higher red cell\n      count during the induction treatment and recovery period for patients with acute leukemias.\n      This study will also collect information evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of the\n      two transfusion thresholds and the feasibility of expanding the study to a large randomized\n      trial.This safety data will serve as a platform for a larger mortality study in leukemia and\n      possibly additional studies in solid tumors."
