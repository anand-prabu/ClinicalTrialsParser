  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upwards of 33-50% of cancer patients who smoked prior to diagnosis continue to smoke
      following diagnosis and treatment. With medical advances in cancer care yielding a growing
      constituency of cancer survivors, addressing nicotine dependence in this population is a
      priority. While PHS guidelines recommend acute treatment durations with approved medications
      for tobacco use, extending the duration of treatment beyond the standard treatment duration
      significantly increases quit rates, reduces the risk for a relapse, and promotes recovery to
      abstinence following a lapse. Varenicline may be particularly effective for cancer patients
      given the drug's beneficial effects on affect and cognition. In this trial, 374 cancer
      patients will be randomized to standard varenicline treatment (12 weeks active + 12 weeks
      placebo) or extended varenicline treatment (24 weeks active). The investigators hypothesize
      that 1) Extended varenicline therapy will increase 24- and 52-week biochemically-confirmed
      abstinence versus standard varenicline treatment, 2) Quality of life will be rated higher in
      the extended therapy group versus the standard therapy group, and there will be no
      significant differences between groups in terms of severe side effects, and 3) Improved
      affect and reduced cognitive impairment will mediate the effect of extended therapy on quit
      rates.
