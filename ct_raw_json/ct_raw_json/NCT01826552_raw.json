            "textblock": "The rate of restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has dramatically\n      decreased since the introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES). However, restenosis still\n      remains a problem and some papers reported that the rate of restenosis can even go up to\n      nearly 20% after the first-generation DES implantation, depending on the complexity of\n      target lesion. Furthermore, there arises a concern about thrombogenic risk of these DES at\n      the expense of reduced restenosis. Therefore, works aiming to reduce both restenosis and\n      thrombosis are on-going, and there has been a rush of various second-generation DES with\n      \"biocompatible but non-absorbable polymer\" and third-generation DES with \"bioabsorbable\n      polymer\".\n\n      Recently, Orsiro hybrid sirolimus-eluting stent (Orsiro SES, Biotronik AG, Bulach,\n      Switzeland) has been developed. It has a unique hybrid combination of polymers coated on\n      thin cobalt-chromium struts (60um). The BIOlute\u00ae active component is a bioabsorbable polymer\n      matrix combined with an anti-proliferative drug, sirolimus, and elutes the drug in a\n      controlled manner after implantation, degrades over time and leaves only the PROBIO\u00ae coated\n      stent behind in the long-term. The PROBIO\u00ae passive coating encapsulates the stent and\n      protects interaction between the metal stent and the surrounding tissue. Although Orsiro SES\n      showed excellent results in terms of late lumen loss at 9 months in first-in-man single arm\n      trial (BIOFLOW-I trial), randomized controlled trials evaluating its efficacy and safety are\n      limited to date.\n\n      The ORIENT Trial will evaluate the angiographic and clinical outcomes of the innovative\n      third-generation DES, Orsiro SES, compared with the latest second-generation DES, Resolute\n      Integrity zotarolimus-eluting stent (ZES-I, Medtronic Cardiovascular, Santa Rosa,\n      California, USA), for treatment of patients with coronary artery disease."
