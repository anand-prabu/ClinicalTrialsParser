            "textblock": "Keratoconus is a progressive corneal ecstatic disease causing visual impairment by inducing\n      irregular astigmatism and corneal opacities. This disorder typically begins during the\n      second decade of life and, in severe forms, may need a corneal transplantation. Corneal\n      cross-linking (CXL) is a procedure intended to halt keratoconus progression. It creates\n      links between stromal proteins in order to stiffen the corneal tissue. Standard CXL includes\n      epithelial removal and stroma soaking with dextran-enriched 0.1% riboflavin solution for 30\n      minutes before being exposed to ultraviolet-A radiation using a  3mW/cm2 lamp for 30\n      minutes.\n\n      Epithelial debridement expose the cornea to a risk of side effects, such as pain for the\n      first two post-operative days, temporary loss of visual acuity during the first three\n      months, and serious complications such as infection and stromal opacity due to corneal\n      scarring.\n\n      Iontophoresis is a non invasive technique in which a weak electric current is used to\n      enhance the penetration of hypotonic 0.1% riboflavin-5-phosphate solution into the corneal\n      stroma through the intact epithelium. After iontophoresis, the corneal tissue is irradiated\n      using a 10 mW/cm2 for 9 minutes (TCXLionto). From previous experimental work (Lombardo M. et\n      al. J Cataract Refract Surg 2014), the investigators provided evidence that TCXLionto\n      increases the stiffness of human corneas with results almost comparable with standard CXL.\n      The new procedure thus holds the promise to be as effective as the standard procedure while\n      minimizing all the related risks. It is object of the present clinical trial to randomize\n      patients with progressive keratoconus to TCXLionto and standard CXL and compare efficacy and\n      safety of treatments."
