  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to analyze the effect of left ventricular (LV) lead pacing
      location  in the non-left bundle branch block (NLBBB)heart failure (HF) patient population.
      The LV lead pacing location will be guided by either the pacing site with the largest amount
      of dyssynchrony as measured by the LV electrical delay (QLV) or the physician's standard of
      care implant approach.

    <description>Evaluate the Clinical composite score at 12 months in NLBBB patients using a standard of care versus latest electrical delay (QLV) based implant strategy. The Clinical composite score includes 4 components: New York Heart Association (NYHA)class, Patient Global Assessment (PGA), HF events, and cardiovascular death.</description>

    <description>QLV is the pacing site with the largest amount of dyssynchrony as measured by the LV electrical delay. The QLV based implant strategy is choosing the vein branch and the cathode with the longest QLV measurement and programming a vector based on that cathode.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have NLBBB morphology (includes complete right bundle branch block and
             intraventricular conduction delay with a QRS duration &gt; 120ms)

          -  Have the following indication per the 2013 updated American College of Cardiology
             Foundation/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society (ACCF/AHA/HRS) guidelines:

               -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%, sinus rhythm, ischemic or
                  non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, a non-LBBB pattern with QRS duration ≥ 120 ms, and
                  New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/ambulatory class IV on guideline
                  directed medical therapy (GDMT)

          -  Receiving a new cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) implant or undergoing an
             upgrade from an existing implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or pacemaker
             implant with no more than 10% right ventricular (RV) pacing

          -  Are 18 years or older, or of legal age to give informed consent specific to state and
             local law

          -  Ability to provide informed consent for study participation and is willing and able
             to comply with the prescribed follow-up tests and schedule of evaluations

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Irreversible occlusion of venous access that will prevent placement of the CRT-ICD
             system either through the right or left upper extremity venous system

          -  Undergoing left ventricular lead placement via a surgical or epicardial approach

          -  Cardiomyopathy due solely to valvular disease that is not repaired/replaced

          -  Enrolled or intend to participate in a clinical drug and/or device study, which could
             confound the results of this trial as determined by St. Jude Medical, during the
             course of this clinical study

          -  Left bundle branch block (LBBB): QRS width ≥ 120 ms, with predominantly negative QRS
             in lead V1, and upright, monophasic QRS in leads I and V6

          -  Incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB)

          -  IVCD with a QRS duration between 110 and 119ms

          -  Persistent or Permanent atrial fibrillation

          -  Pacemaker dependent

          -  Patients who are being upgraded primarily due to RV pacing

          -  Women who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant during the clinical trial

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 1 year
