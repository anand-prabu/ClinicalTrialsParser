            "textblock": "Initiation of ULT for gout increases the occurrence of acute gouty arthritis flares due to\n      mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. IL-1\u03b2 plays a key role in mediating the\n      inflammatory response in gouty arthritis. The efficacy of IL-1\u03b2 blockade in the prophylaxis\n      of gouty flares during initiation of ULT has been validated in multiple trials of IL-1\u03b2\n      inhibitor therapies. Therefore, it is believed that IL-1\u03b2 is a relevant therapeutic target\n      for gout flares. AC-201 is an IL-1\u03b2 modulator indicated for the treatment of osteoarthritis\n      with good safety record and very few contraindications to the co-morbidities commonly among\n      gout patients. AC-201 has also been demonstrated to have uric acid-lowering effects in\n      clinical trials. The favorable product profile of AC-201 overall provides a strong rationale\n      for investigating its clinical utility as prophylaxis against flares when initiating ULT."

            "textblock": "Clinical trials have demonstrated that anti-IL-1 agents (IL-1Ra, IL-1 Trap, and anti-IL-1\u03b2\n      monoclonal antibody) can reduce the frequency of gout flares during the initial period of\n      treatment with urate-lowering therapy and prevent of gout flares in gout patients with\n      frequent flares. AC-201 is an oral IL-1 modulator but with a mechanism distinct from that of\n      existing anti-IL-1 agents. The active metabolite of AC-201 has been shown in vitro and in\n      vivo to inhibit the production and activity of IL-1, down-regulate IL-1 receptors, and\n      increase IL1-Ra. Molecular research further suggests that these effects are mediated\n      upstream via inhibition of MAPK signaling pathways and binding of NF-\u03baB and AP-1\n      transcription factors that encode for a range of pro-inflammatory factors, including IL-1\u03b2,\n      TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, iNOS, and MMPs, which have been implicated in gout flares. AC-201 has\n      also been demonstrated to have uric acid-lowering effects in clinical trials. The favorable\n      product profile of AC-201 overall provides a strong rationale for investigating its clinical\n      utility as prophylaxis against flares when initiating ULT."
