Minocycline is a commonly used antibiotic medication with\n      anti-inflammatory properties.  It is hoped that information gained from this study will help\n      the investigators better understand the role of inflammation in depression, and whether\n      decreasing inflammation will lead to improvement in the symptoms of depression and cognitive\n      function."
