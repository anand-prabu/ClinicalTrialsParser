The investigators are specifically studying the time difference between\n      groups and the difference in the number of attempts required to obtain vascular access and\n      begin to treat with fluids and medications. The study will also measure patient satisfaction\n      and procedural pain, the frequency of central line placement, the length of stay in the\n      hospital and emergency department, and adverse events to intravascular access to determine\n      whether IO access can improve these measures.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that the use of a protocol utilizing an IO device for select\n      patients with failed IV access will reduce the time requirements to obtain vascular access,\n      reduce the number of attempts needed to obtain IV access, reduce the ED LOS, and have no\n      negative impact on patient satisfaction compared to the current ED practices."
