Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.\n      Chemoprotective drugs, such as amifostine, may protect normal cells from the side effects of\n      chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of amifostine in treating patients with\n      newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia who are receiving idarubicin plus cytarabine."

Idarubicin IV is administered over 15 minutes on days 1-3. Cytarabine is\n      administered by continuous infusion on days 1-7. Patients may receive 1 additional course of\n      treatment, if necessary.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients each are treated at each dose level of idarubicin. Dose escalation\n      is discontinued when 2 or more patients experience dose limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 36 patients will be accrued for this study."
