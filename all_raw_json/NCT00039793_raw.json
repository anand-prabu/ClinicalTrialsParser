            "textblock": "The proposed project is a randomized pilot trial of a Swedish-style massage therapy\n      intervention for the treatment of fatigue in patients who are undergoing cancer\n      chemotherapy. Fatigue is the most common complaint of patients receiving treatment for\n      cancer, but is often difficult to treat and causes a substantial decrement in patients'\n      quality of life. Massage therapy is a non-invasive intervention used in many patients with\n      cancer for symptom control. Prior small studies have suggested some efficacy of bodywork\n      therapies in conditions characterized by fatigue, such as fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue\n      syndrome. Based on these results, massage therapy may provide an important adjunct in\n      ameliorating fatigue and enhancing cancer patients' well being.\n\n      The proposed study is a 12-week, randomized, three-arm, parallel-comparison clinical trial\n      comparing the effects of a Swedish-style massage regimen to a sham bodywork control and a\n      usual-care group for fatigue reduction in cancer patents undergoing chemotherapy. Patients\n      with breast, ovarian, prostate, or colo-rectal cancer will be enrolled; the primary outcome\n      measure is a quantitative assessment of fatigue symptoms. This study will determine\n      efficacy, functioning, perceptions of fatigue, and quality of life. This study should\n      provide not only important data on the potential efficacy of massage therapy for the\n      treatment of fatigue, but also advance the methodology for studying CAM interventions for\n      difficult-to-treat symptomatic conditions."
