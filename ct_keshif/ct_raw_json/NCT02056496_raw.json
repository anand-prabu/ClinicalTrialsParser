            "textblock": "Pomegranate phenolics (such as the ellagitannin punicalagin and ellagic acid) are\n      metabolized by the human gut microbiota to yield a number of metabolites called urolithins\n      (mainly Uro-A). Both ellagic acid (EA) and urolithins can exert a number of biological\n      activities. However, the bioavailability of ellagic acid has been reported to be very low\n      and the existing studies are controversial so far. The investigators want to carry out a\n      robust (cross-over, double-blind) pharmacokinetic assay in 20 healthy volunteers, using two\n      types of pomegranate extracts (PEs). PEs with low (PE-1) and high (PE-2) punicalagin:EA\n      ratio will be administered. The investigators will analyze blood and urine samples using\n      UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS. The investigators will evaluate:\n\n        -  The pharmacokinetics of EA.\n\n        -  The effect of punicalagin:free EA ratio on the pharmacokinetics of EA and urolithins\n           production."
