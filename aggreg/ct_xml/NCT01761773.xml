    <textblock>
      The main objective of the trial is to compare the pharmacokinetics of a 60 mg dose of
      cabozantinib in adult subjects with impaired renal function compared with healthy adult
      subjects. Another objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of cabozantinib in
      these adult subjects.
