The treatment is based on the center\n      specific standard of care. The total dose will be between 69 and 73 Gy (definitive\n      treatment) and 63 and 66 Gy (adjuvant treatment), the chemotherapy will be cisplatin- based.\n\n      The aim of the analysis is to validate the prognostic impact of potential biomarkers on\n      loco-regional control. This will lead to the definition of risk groups and stratification of\n      patients and will help to individualize radiotherapy prescription in future trials."
