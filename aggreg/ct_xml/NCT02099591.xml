Approval of the Safety Pharmacokinetic Review Committee to enrol new patients for the higher dose group will be based on data obtained from at least 8 evaluable patients (patients who contribute enough data for calculating AUC of naloxegol on Day 1 without important protocol deviations or violations thought to significantly affect the PK of the drug) for up to 2 weeks of treatment with naloxegol. For any or all of those patients, if data obtained is from less than 2 weeks of treatment, then the Safety Pharmacokinetic Review Committee evaluation and approval will be based on whatever data is available.</description>
