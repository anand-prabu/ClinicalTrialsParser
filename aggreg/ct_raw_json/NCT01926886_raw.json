For the first 3 cycles, Herceptin will be administered intravenously (6 mg/kg)\n      at the hospital. The next 3 cycles, Herceptin (600 mg every 3 weeks) will be administered\n      subcutaneously via a hand-held syringe by a trained HCP at the hospital, and for the last 6\n      cycles Herceptin will be administered subcutaneously via a hand-held syringe by a trained\n      HCP at the patient's home."
