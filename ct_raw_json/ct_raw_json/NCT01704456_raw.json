Women with PVD will be randomly assigned to attend either\n      eight sessions of group MBCT or CBT. Each session is 2.25 hours long and spaced 1 week\n      apart. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the 8-session MBCT intervention for\n      PVD is more efficacious than an 8-session CBT intervention for decreasing women's pain\n      intensity, sexual distress, catastrophizing and hypervigilance towards pain."

The\n      investigators will also examine whether pain improvements at follow-up are mediated by\n      changes in self-compassion and mindfulness (in the MBCT arm only) and moderated by\n      pre-treatment credibility, personality, and anxiety sensitivity.\n\n      HYPOTHESES:\n\n        1. At follow-up (4 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post-treatment), women in the MBCT arm\n           will experience a greater decline (vs. pre-treatment) in vestibular pain intensity\n           compared to women in the CBT arm.\n\n        2. At follow-up (4 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post-treatment), women in the MBCT arm\n           will experience a greater decline (vs. pre-treatment) in sex-related distress, pain\n           catastrophizing, hypervigilance, and self-reported pain during intercourse/other\n           penetrative sex compared to women in the CBT arm.\n\n        3. The investigators hypothesize that improvements in pain intensity during vestibular\n           touch will be mediated by changes in self-compassion and mindfulness in the MBCT arm\n           only at 6 and 12 months follow-up.\n\n        4. The investigators hypothesize that pre-treatment credibility, personality, and anxiety\n           sensitivity will significantly moderate improvements in pain intensity during\n           vestibular touch at 6 and 12 months follow-up.\n\n        5. The investigators hypothesize improvements in both arms on the \"Patient Global\n           Impression of Change Scale\" and significantly greater improvements in the MBCT arm\n           relative to the CBT arm at follow-up (4 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post-treatment)."
