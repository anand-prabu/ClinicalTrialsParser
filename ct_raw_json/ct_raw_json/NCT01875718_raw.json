The safety and tolerability of UC1010 is also evaluated in study part 1.\n\n      In part 2, the primary objective is to assess the pharmacodynamic effect of UC1010 on\n      premenstrual symptoms in women with Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) when given during\n      the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The pharmacodynamic effect is evaluated through the\n      patients' daily ratings of premenstrual symptoms. In both study parts, two active treatment\n      groups are compared to one placebo group."
