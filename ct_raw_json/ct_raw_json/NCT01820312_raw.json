The\n      overall total dose received of both the chemotherapy and radiation therapy will be less than\n      that typically given as standard of care; however, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\n      has not evaluated the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy.  In addition,\n      this study will gather information about the effects of radiation therapy and chemotherapy\n      on subject's overall quality of life."

Subjects with poor renal function as demonstrated by serum creatinine (>1.5 mg/dl)\n             and EGFR <40 mL/min, which would preclude the using of image contrast agents.\n\n          5. Subject with a planned surgical procedure within the next 30 days.\n\n          6. Subject has distant metastasis (with the exception of single stable distant\n             metastasis that does not decrease life expectancy to less than 6 months).\n\n          7. Subject is of childbearing potential and will not use adequate contraceptive\n             protection.\n\n          8. Subject who is breastfeeding.\n\n          9.
