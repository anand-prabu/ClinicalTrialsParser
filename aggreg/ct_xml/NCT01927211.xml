  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate whether the placement of silver plated dressings beginning in the
      OR will improve wound healing in patients undergoing cesarean delivery compared to
      traditional Telfa pads.  This study will also explore the presumed improvement in scar
      integrity when silver plated dressings are used compared to Telfa pads.  The study will
      examine post-operative pain by review of anesthesia and analgesic use during hospitalization
      and scar-related pain scores at the post-operative visits.

      The study will compare the percentage of patients who develop a surgical site infection
      after application of silver plated dressings versus standard Telfa dressings.  Investigators
      will also assess the cosmetic appearance of the cesarean section scar at the patient's one
      week and 6 wekk post-operative visits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, prospective study involving 660 patients undergoing cesarean sections
      at Tampa General Hospital.  The control group (n=330) will receive standard Telfa pad
      dressing and the treatment group (n=330) will receive the silver plated dressing.

      The primary objective is to compare the percentage of patients who develop a surgical site
      infection between the two groups at 1-week and 6-weeks post operative visits.  The secondary
      objective is to assess the cosmetic outcome of the cesarean incision observed at the 1-week
      and 6-week post-operative visits.  A panel of plastic surgeons will conduct a blinded
      assessment of cosmetic outcome by review of photographs taken of the wounds at 1-week and
      6-weeks.  Finally, this study will examine post-operative pain by review of anesthesia and
      analgesic use during hospitalization and scar-related pain scores at the post-operative
      visits.
