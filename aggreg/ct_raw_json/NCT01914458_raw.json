The\n      application of low dose helical computed tomography (CT) has been the milestone of lung\n      cancer screening. Recently, The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) shows screening with\n      low-dose CT could reduce mortality from lung cancer. We conducted this clinical trial to\n      determine the efficacy of low dose CT in early lung cancer screening in Taiwan."

Persons who had previously\n      received a diagnosis of lung cancer, had undergone chest CT within 18 months before\n      enrollment, had hemoptysis, or had an unexplained weight loss of more than 6.8 kg in the\n      preceding year were excluded.\n\n      All the participants should complete a questionnaire that covers many topics, including\n      demographic characteristics and smoking behavior. We also plan to collect additional data\n      for planned analyses of cost-effectiveness, and smoking cessation. Lung-cancer got by biopsy\n      and other biospecimens are available to researchers through a peer-review process All\n      screening examinations are planed to perform in accordance with a standard protocol,\n      developed by medical physicists associated with the trial, that specified acceptable\n      characteristics of the machine and acquisition variables. All low-dose CT scans are acquired\n      with the use of multidetector scanners with a minimum of 16 channels.\n\n      IDEALCAP radiologists are certified by appropriate agencies or boards and has completed\n      training in image acquisition; radiologists also has completed training in image quality and\n      standardized image interpretation. Images are interpreted first in isolation and then in\n      comparison with available historical images and images from prior IDEALCAP screening\n      examinations.\n\n      IDEALCAP primary analysis is the detection rate of lung cancer. Secondary analysis include\n      the detection rate of lung nodule, 5-year survival rate of persons with lung cancer who\n      receive standard surgical treatment, 5-year survival rate of persons with lung cancer who\n      receive alternative treatment other than standard surgical treatment (ex. Radiotherapy,\n      chemotherapy or target therapy), the correlation of CT images and cigarette smoking history,\n      the correlation of CT images and pulmonary function.\n\n      Key Word\uff1a low dose computed-tomography (LDCT), lung cancer screening"
