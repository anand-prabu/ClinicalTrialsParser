They will be psychiatrically evaluated on regular\n      bases: at least twice yearly in the years two to five after surgery, at least once a year\n      for the years thereafter. The duration of this protocol is indefinite, but spans at least 10\n      years. The main aim of this study is to investigate the long-term effect of DBS in OCD\n      patients."
