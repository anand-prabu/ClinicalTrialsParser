            "textblock": "A split-thickness skin graft (STSG) is used for a large wounds or wounds that cannot be\n      closed by primary and secondary wound closure. STSG is taken with the epidermis and part of\n      the dermis from an uninjured area (donor site) to an area of skin loss (recipient site).Most\n      patients have more discomfort at donor site than graft site. Accelerated\n      re-epithelialization rate and minimizing pain and infection are main goals of donor care.\n      Traditionally, skin graft donor sites have been dressed with paraffin gauze dressing\n      (Jelonet\u00ae) or medicated paraffin gauze dressing (Bactigras\u00ae and Sofra-tulle\u00ae). These\n      dressing are inexpensive but adhere to the wound surface and cannot absorb exudates. Thus,\n      we have developed a new biomaterial based on Thai silk for wound dressing application. Silk\n      is composed of two types of proteins, fibroin and sericin. Silk fibroin (SF) has been used\n      as biomedical materials because it has oxygen permeability, water vapor permeability,\n      biodegradability, biocompatibility and minimal inflammatory reaction. Silk sericin (SS) has\n      also been used as biomedical materials because it has moisturizing properties, collagen\n      promoting activity and enhances attachment of cultured human skin fibroblasts. Thus, silk\n      fibroin and silk sericin (SF/SS) were selected to produce wound dressing in this study. The\n      objective of this study is to compare wound dressing containing silk fibroin with bioactive\n      coating layer with standard dressing (medicated paraffin gauze dressing; Bactigras\u00ae), with\n      regard to healing time, patients' pain intensity, skin's transepidermal water loss after\n      healing and evidence of infection in the treatment of split-thickness skin graft donor\n      sites. The study design is a randomized, controlled, self paired clinical trial. Patients\n      age 18 to 60 years and undergo STSG at thigh in Division of Plastic and Reconstructive\n      Surgery, Department of Surgery, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital between November 2013\n      and May 2015 will be recruited in the study. The exclusion criteria are donor sites other\n      than thigh area or located at high risk of infection. Patients who are immunocompromised or\n      diabetes mellitus or psychiatric disorders or low serum albumin level (less than 3.0 g/dL)\n      or known allergic to SS or SF or paraffin or chlorhexidine acetate are also excluded. All\n      subjects sign the informed consents after discussion the protocol, benefits and risks. The\n      donor site will be divided into two equal halves, each site will be randomized to receive\n      the wound dressing containing silk fibroin with bioactive coating layer or the medicated\n      paraffin gauze dressing. The donor site wounds will be observed daily. The dressings will\n      not be changed, except when they are fully soaked with exudates and easily fell off or any\n      sign of infection. Healing time will be recorded when the dressing separate completely from\n      the donor site, no exudates and no pain when the donor site is exposed to air. The patient's\n      pain level will be evaluated with the visual analogue scale and the donor site wounds will\n      be observed daily for signs of infection. On the day of the wound is recorded for healing\n      time and 1 weeks, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 months after that, the skin barrier function (TEWL) of\n      each site will be measured using a Tewameter (Courage & Khazaka , GmbH). Blood sample will\n      be collected from patients pre- and postoperatively (within day 3) for hepatic and renal\n      function analysis."
