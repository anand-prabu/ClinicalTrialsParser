  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical wounds can be closed in several manners. Some physicians believe that closure in a
      straight line produces a scar that is more visible and slightly raised when compared to
      closure in a zigzagging fashion. The researchers of this study believe that there is no
      difference in the cosmetic appearance of one type of wound closure over the other. To
      evaluate this, they will provide a survey with visual aids to volunteers to rate the
      appearance of a straight line scar versus a zigzag scar.
