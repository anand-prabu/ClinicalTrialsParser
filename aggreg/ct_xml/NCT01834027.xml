  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of music on patients after surgery
      in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU). For many patients, surgery creates significant
      emotional stress and anxiety which can include discomfort or pain.  Music therapy has proven
      to be a useful adjuvant in various inpatient and outpatient settings by providing a relaxing
      effect that decreases heart rate, blood pressure, and hormonal measures of stress. It has
      been shown that classical music can cause physiological and psychological differences in
      patient outcomes, but few studies have looked specifically at effects of jazz music. Some
      have argued that jazz may be too involved to provide the same relaxed state as classical
      music, but this may be due in part to the type of jazz played for the patient. It is our
      hypothesis that slow jazz music by artists including Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald, Diana
      Krall, Dave Brubeck, etc. will reduce measures of stress and anxiety in patients in the PACU
      following surgery for hysterectomy (laparoscopic or robotic) to a greater extent than the
      control group. Jazz music or &quot;no music&quot; will be played through headphones to participants in
      the study post-surgically while they are in the PACU and measures of stress, anxiety, and
      pain will be monitored.

      -  Patients will be identified the morning of surgery from the operating room schedule.

        -  The patients will be randomized to two groups: jazz music or no music.

        -  Head phones will be applied to all patients inculded in the study; in one group jazz
           music will be provided through the headphones. The second group no music will be
           played.

        -  Blood pressure will be monitored by a non-invasive blood pressure cuff at 5 minute
           intervals throughout the patient's stay in the PACU.

        -  Heart rate will be measured, using a pulse oximeter,  at the same intervals as blood
           pressure.

        -  Before the patient leaves the PACU, she will be asked to rate her perception of her
           levels of pain and anxiety on scales that use a numeric scale of 1-10. The primary
           variable outcomes are: heart rate and mean blood pressure. Secondary outcomes include:
           perceived pain, anxiety, and level of relaxation.

        -  headphones will be used to deliver one of the following sounds to the patients: 1) jazz
           music (BPM&lt;100) by artists including Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald, Diana Krall, Dave
           Brubeck, etc.; or 2) no music providing.
