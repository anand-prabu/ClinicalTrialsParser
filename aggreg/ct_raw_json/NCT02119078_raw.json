The ACE program\n      will aim to improve the quality of care of older patients in the investigators hospital by\n      implementing focused interventions and recommendations specific to geriatric needs and\n      syndromes, including: reduced fall rate, decreased incidence and duration of delirium, early\n      recognition and treatment of impaired mobility and function, careful minimization of\n      medication use, prevention of unnecessary catheter and restraint use, decreased hospital\n      readmission rates, improved transitional care following hospital discharge, and high levels\n      of patient and referring physician satisfaction.   Additionally, the ACE program aims to\n      improve resident and student competence in treating geriatric syndromes, and to improve\n      staff and learner satisfaction with caring for older adults.  ACE programs have been well\n      studied at other institutions, so the investigators will be implementing a program that is\n      already standard of care, and studying the elements that are unique to OHSU.\n\n      This will be a quality improvement project. Study participants will be a convenience sample\n      of OHSU faculty, staff, residents and students who are employed by or on rotation with\n      General Medicine Team 1 of the Medicine Teaching Service. Faculty, staff, and learners (ACE\n      team members) will receive the ACE training. Study personnel will conduct prospective and\n      retrospective chart review of patients admitted to the ACE service to determine outcomes as\n      noted above."
