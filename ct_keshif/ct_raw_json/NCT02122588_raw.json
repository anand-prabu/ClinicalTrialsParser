The patients for whom BRCA mutations not found will\n      participate in the baseline assessments only and will not be followed up. Accordingly, 1\n      study visit (screening/baseline) is planned for all patients and 2 additional once a year\n      visits besides screening/baseline visit are planned for BRCAm+ patients.\n\n      The subpopulation of the patients with the congenital serous and endometrioid ovarian,\n      peritoneal and fallopian tube cancer with the corresponding family history will undergo the\n      broadened genetic testing panel (sequencing of all coding areas of genes BRCA1 and BRCA2).\n\n      Information regarding patient demographics, the disease characteristics, management\n      approaches, diagnostic tests performed and medication received by the patient will be taken\n      from the medical records."
