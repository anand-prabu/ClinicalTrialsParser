    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, multicenter, efficacy, and safety maintenance study of
      the Phase 1 Study CT-P10 1.1. This study is designed to assess the long-term efficacy and
      safety of CT-P10 co-administered with MTX  and folic acid  in patients with RA who have
      completed the scheduled visits in Study CT-P10 1.1

          -  Patient has, at the time of providing informed consent, any current medical issues
             such as serious adverse events (SAEs) or current or previous intolerance issues that
