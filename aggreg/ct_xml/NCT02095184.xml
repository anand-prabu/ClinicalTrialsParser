  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than three quarter of patients with breast cancer are treated by hormone pills called
      tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors (AIs). AIs are drugs that stop female hormone production.
      This hormone production mostly happens in fat, muscle, and breast tissue in postmenopausal
      women. The female hormone estrogen is an important hormone for the growth of breast cancer
      cells. Anastrozole (Arimidex®) and Letrozole (Femara®) are AIs that are approved by the Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA). They have been used since 2005 to treat women with early
      stage breast cancer.

      When given before surgery (neoadjuvant), both anastrozole and letrozole have been shown to
      successfully shrink breast cancer tumors in most patients. In over 50% of patients,
      anastrozole and letrozole when given for about 4 months also helped to improve surgery
      outcomes. On top of that, whether or not a patient responds to anastrozole and letrozole
      before surgery can help the doctor decide whether that patient needs additional
      chemotherapy.

      One of the things may influence the level of hormone is body weight. It has been previously
      shown that postmenopausal women with higher body fat have higher level of female hormone as
      well as an increased risk of breast cancer. This is likely due to an increase in aromatase
      activity in the fatty tissue. However, at the current time AIs are used at the same doses in
      all women with breast cancer no matter whether they have different body weight. Currently,
      we do not know for certain whether the same doses of AIs work as well in patients with
      higher body fat compared to patients with less body fat.

      The purpose of this study is to see if women with higher body fat respond differently to AI
      treatment compared to women with lower body fat.
