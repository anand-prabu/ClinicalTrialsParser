Methods: A controlled randomized trial\n      involving 27 patients divided into four groups: heliox + PEP, oxygen + PEP, heliox and\n      oxygen. After the initial evaluation, it was placing 89 reflective markers attached to the\n      surface of the trunk and images acquired by optoelectronic plethysmography (OEP) of six\n      cameras. Three slow vital capacity maneuvers and quiet breathing regarded as phase control.\n      After the control phase, all patients underwent nebulization with a distribution noninvasive\n      system, semi-closed using 10 drops of Fenoterol Bromide and 20 drops of Ipratropium."
