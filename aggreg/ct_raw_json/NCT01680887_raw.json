Live within a commutable distance of the Treatment Research Center (TRC) at the\n             Penn/VA Center for Studies of Addiction, University of Pennsylvania.  We define this\n             to be a distance within the service area of Septa, within an hour drive, or a\n             distance that both the patient and Principal Investigator (PI) find acceptable.\n\n          4. Understands and signs the informed consent.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Current DSM-IV diagnosis of any psychoactive substance dependence other than cocaine,\n             alcohol, or nicotine dependence, as determined by the SCID.\n\n          2. Subject is, in the investigator's opinion, at risk of requiring medical\n             detoxification for alcohol dependence during the study.\n\n          3.
