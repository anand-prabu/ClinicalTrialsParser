Determine the efficacy of\n      this regimen in preventing or delaying manifestations of disease progression as demonstrated\n      by biochemical failure or clinical recurrence in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive leuvectin\n      intraprostatically over 10-30 seconds under transrectal ultrasound guidance on days 0 and\n      14. Patients are re-evaluated at week 10. Treatment repeats every 10-11 weeks or 1-6 days\n      after completion of each week 10 re-evaluation for a maximum of 3 courses in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1\n      year and then every 6 months for 2 years in the absence of disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study."
