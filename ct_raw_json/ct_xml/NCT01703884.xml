    <textblock>
      The program's overall objective is to assess the impact of a package of interventions aimed
      at reducing malaria-related mortality and morbidity in pregnant women and newborns by
      ensuring access to a package of interventions designed to optimise the detection and
      treatment of malaria during pregnancy as well as improving the early detection and treatment
      of malaria during the third trimester.

      This is a cluster-randomised study in which the health facility is the unit of
      randomisation. 16 health facilities will be randomised to intervention and control. At the
      community level women will be encouraged to access ANC early in the pregnancy, attend
      follow-up antenatal visits throughout the pregnancy and deliver at the facility. The current
      recommended standard of care will be provided to all women attending antenatal and obstetric
      care. In the intervention area,  obstetric, medical, drug-exposure histories will be
      collected at ANC visits. In addition, in the last trimester of the pregnancy (&gt; 28 weeks of
      pregnancy), women will be systematically evaluated with selected diagnostic test for whether
      they have malaria parasites and treated effectively. Skilled birth attendants at the
      facility will be trained in emergency obstetric and neonatal care and the assessment of
      neonates for danger signs, low birth weight and external/observable birth defects. In the
      control area, women will be provided with standard practice of care.  In both areas, women
      will be diagnosed and treated at delivery if they are positive.

In addition, in the last trimester of the pregnancy (&gt; 28 weeks of pregnancy), women will be systematically evaluated with RDT for whether they have malaria parasites and treated effectively. all malaria cases diagnosed in the 2nd and 3rd trimester in the intervention area will be treated with Amodiaquine + Artesunate (ASAQ)</description>

    <description>At ANC and labor wards for women in the control area, there will be no change from routine approaches. However, in case of malaria suspicion, a RDT detecting circulating P. falciparum antigens (SD Bioline) will be performed, if this is determined to be the most effective RDT (on the basis of current data and literature). If positive, the woman will be treated.  Treatment will consist on a full course of quinine (24 mg/kg/day for 7 days) as it is done routinely.</description>
