             (CHF), with the exception of controlled diabetes

          5. Have documented history of diabetes with an A1C of ≥ 8 at time of pre-operative visit

             drugs with the exception of steroids for:

               1. prophylactic one-time-use administered peri-operatively

               2. inhaled general use

               3. topical administration

          7. Have documented collagen-vascular, connective tissue, bleeding disorders and/or on
             anticoagulation therapy, with the exception of baby aspirin for one week prior to
             SERI placement

          8. Have documented cancer &lt; 6 months prior to surgery or chemotherapy treatment &lt; 6
             months prior to surgery

          9. Have documented history of abdominal radiation therapy or is expected to have

         10. Have documented history of liver disease and/or renal failure requiring dialysis

         11. Have documented history of a previous wound infection at the surgical site or have an
             active infection at the time of surgery

         12. Have had prior surgery with synthetic and/or biologic mesh in the abdominal, chest or
             pelvic area

         13. Have documented allergy to silk

         14. Have documented UTI at the time of surgery

         15. Have smoked within 6 weeks of surgery and have a positive nicotine test at time of
             preoperative visit

         16. Have a concurrent procedure intra-operatively (with the exception of lysis of
             abdominal adhesions)

         17. Require intra-peritoneal or bridging placement of the soft tissue support device or
             require component separation at time of surgery

         18. Have surgical circumstances that are contraindicated for use of SERI™ Surgical
             Scaffold per the supplied package insert

         19. Have a concomitant unrelated condition of abdominal/chest wall/skin that would
             require a surgical intervention during the follow-up period

         20. Have documented alcohol and/or substance abuse problem at time of pre-operative visit

         21. Be pregnant, lactating, or if of childbearing potential, be unwilling to use
