Prematurity, enteral feeding, bacterial colonisation of the gut and\n      intestinal ischemia have been proposed as major risk factors.\n\n      Probiotics may prevent NEC by improving the maturity and function of the gut mucosal\n      barrier, modulating the immune system, promoting colonization of the gut with beneficial\n      organisms and preventing colonization by pathogens.\n\n      A variety of clinical trials have evaluated the effect of different probiotic preparations\n      on the occurrence of NEC in preterm infants. The results of recent metaanalyses suggest a\n      benefit of probiotic bacteria in reducing the incidence of NEC and propose a change of\n      practice.\n\n      The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the probiotic preparation Infloran\u00ae in\n      reducing the incidence of NEC after implementation in clinical routine in preterm (< 34\n      weeks gestational age) very low birth weight infants compared to a historical cohort."
