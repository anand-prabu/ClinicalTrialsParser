    <textblock>
      Accidental dural puncture (ADP) during placement of an epidural catheter for anesthesia and
      analgesia is a well known complication. Previous studies have found audiometric
      deterioration following ADP. Epidural blood patch (EBP) is a common method for treating
      postural headache in patients with accidental dural puncture. In most cases, one-two patches
      are needed for successful management. Long-term effects of EBP on the incidence of backache,
      headache and early audiometric deterioration are few or non-existant. The present study aims
      to determine the long-term sequelae of EDP in parturients who had ADP and were treated with
      an EBP during the years 2005 - 2011.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A major risk with epidural analgesia (EDA) is accidental dural puncture (ADP). ADP occurs in
      approximately 1% of all pregnant women receiving EDA in connection with childbirth.
      Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) is the most common complication after ADP and affects
      approximately 86% of all mothers with ADP. Headache after ADP may be severe and sometimes
      affects the interaction between the newborn baby and the mother. The headaches are
      orthostatic which makes the patient bedridden, and are associated with symptoms such as
      nausea, vomiting, tinnitus and hearing changes. The symptoms are thought to represent
      leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which in turn leads to reduced CSF volume and
      intracranial hypotension. These volume changes lead to traction of pain-sensitive
      intracranial structures. There are no studies in the literature that have either confirmed
      or visualized CSF leakage after ADP. The diagnosis of PDPH is solely based on clinical
      examination. There are over 50 different treatment options for PDPH. These treatments can be
      divided into conservative or invasive. Among others, the conservative treatment options
      include bed rest, caffeine and various pain medications. Several studies have shown the
      absence of a definite and curative effect of these treatment options. The most widely used
      invasive method for management of PDPH is epidural blood patch (EBP). EBP was first
      introduced in the 60's by applying three ml of the patients' own blood epidurally. Over the
      years, this volume has increased to at least 15-20 ml on the basis of case reports and
      studies with small number of participants and without any definite scientific evidence.
      However, EBP should not be applied sooner than 24 hours after the onset of accidental dura
      puncture, as the risk of failure is higher. Further studies are required in the literature
      to confirm the efficacy of EBP.

      Additionally, the long term effects of EBP remain either unknown or vaguely understood. Are
      we treating an acute symptom with an invasive method, not knowing the long term sequelae?
      Since audiometric changes are known to result following ADP, can these changes persist over
      a long period of time? Therefore, we are interested in assessing the long term effects of
      EBP on backache, headache and audiometric changes in parturients who delivered during the
      years 2005 - 2011.
