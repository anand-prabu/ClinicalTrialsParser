Pneumatic compression devices are also\n      known as sequential compression devices and are inflatable compression sleeves that are\n      placed around patient's legs to reduce the risk of clot formation deep vein thrombosis.\n      Pneumatic compression devices are made of a soft material that wraps around the lower leg\n      and periodically squeeze the calf. A deep vein thrombosis is a blood clot. Most hospitalized\n      patients wear these as a preventive measure. Pneumatic compression devices alone are not\n      sufficient to prevent deep vein thrombosis formation. Therefore, medicines, such as aspirin\n      and enoxaparin are utilized. Both drugs are used for prevention, but there are no studies in\n      patients with musculoskeletal tumors which have determined whether one drug is better than\n      another. The knowledge gained from this study will determine whether aspirin and pneumatic\n      compression devices is the same or better than enoxaparin and pneumatic compression devices\n      in preventing deep vein thrombosis in this patient population and may result in fewer wound\n      and bleeding complications"
