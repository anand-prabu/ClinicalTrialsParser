            "textblock": "Recurrent stroke and cognitive decline are common after ischaemic stroke. Allopurinol, a\n      drug usually used to treat gout, has been shown to reduce heart ischaemia, heart size, and\n      arterial stiffness and to relax brain blood vessels and may reduce the blood pressure. All\n      of these properties may be associated with a lower risk of second stroke and cognitive\n      decline. We now aim to explore whether allopurinol will reduce further damage to the brain\n      (called white matter hyper-intensities) after stroke and also whether it reduces heart size\n      and blood pressure after stroke.\n\n      We will conduct a multi-centre randomised, double-blind placebo controlled study to\n      investigate whether two years allopurinol 300 mg twice per day (BD) improves these 3\n      outcomes, which are inextricably linked to risk of recurrence and cognitive decline after\n      ischaemic stroke."
