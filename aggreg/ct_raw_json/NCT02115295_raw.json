Participant's doctor will tell them how many cycles they will have.\n      This will be based on any response participant may have to the therapy.\n\n      Each cycle is 28 days.\n\n      During the Induction Cycle, on Days 1-5, participant will receive cladribine and cytarabine\n      by vein over 1-2 hours. On Days 1-3, participant will receive idarubicin by vein over 30-60\n      minutes.\n\n      During the Consolidation Cycles, on Days 1-3, participant will receive cladribine and\n      cytarabine by vein over 1-2 hours. On Days 1-2, participant will receive idarubicin by vein\n      over30-60 minutes.\n\n      If the disease has not started to get better after the first cycle, participant may receive\n      an additional induction cycle, followed by 4 consolidation cycles.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      At the beginning of every cycle, participant will have a physical exam.\n\n      Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests at least 1 time a week. If the\n      disease starts to get better,  the blood draws will happen every 2-4 weeks while participant\n      is taking the study drug. After participant's last dose of study drug, the blood draws will\n      happen every 4-8 weeks as long as they are on study.\n\n      On Day 21 (+/- 7 days) of the first cycle participant will have a bone marrow biopsy and/or\n      aspirate to check the status of the disease. Participant may have another bone marrow biopsy\n      and/or aspirate later in the study if their doctor thinks it is needed.\n\n      During treatment, participant will come to the clinic at least 1 time each week for the\n      first month  and then at least 1 time a month after that until they stop treatment. If the\n      study doctor thinks it is needed, participant may have additional clinic visits after they\n      stop treatment.\n\n      Length of Treatment:\n\n      Participant may continue taking the study drugs for up to 6 cycles. Participant will no\n      longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects\n      occur, or if they are unable to follow study directions.\n\n      Patient's participation on the study will be over when they have completed follow-up.\n\n      Follow-Up Visits:\n\n      After participant's last dose of study drug, they will be called every 6 -12 months by a\n      member of the study staff to ask about any side effects they may be having. The phone call\n      should take about 5-10 minutes.  Participant will continue to be called for as long as\n      possible.\n\n      Participant will continue to have blood (about 2 tablespoons) drawn for routine tests every\n      4-8 weeks while they are on study. Participant may also need to have additional blood draws\n      as part of their standard of care.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Cladribine, cytarabine, and idarubicin are all FDA\n      approved and commercially available for the treatment of different kinds of leukemia.  It is\n      investigational to use these drugs in combination with each other. The study doctor can\n      explain how the study drugs are designed to work.\n\n      Up to 100 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."

Because there is a\n             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the\n             mother with the chemotherapy agents, breastfeeding should also be avoided.\n\n          2.
