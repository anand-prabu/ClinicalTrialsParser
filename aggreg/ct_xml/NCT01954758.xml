    <description>The patients will undergo a cycle of controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) to obtain oocytes which will then be fertilised by IVF/ICSI, after which the viable blastocysts from this patient group will be cryopreserved on day 5 or 6 of development. In a different cycle the patients will undergo a cycle of endometrial preparation with hormone replacement therapy HRT and will undergo an endometrial biopsy In this substituted cycle after five days of progesterone impregnation.The endometrial biopsies will be analysed with the ERA test. Group CR comprise  the patients whose endometria the test indicates is in the expected stage of development; these patients will undergo elective deferred embryonic transfer (EDET) in a subsequent cycle with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) identical to the that in which the endometrial biopsy was taken.</description>

In a different cycle the patients will undergo a cycle of endometrial preparation with hormone replacement therapy HRT and will undergo an endometrial biopsy in this substituted cycle after 5 days of progesterone impregnation. The endometrial biopsies will be analysed with the ERA test. These No receptive patients will undergo a new biopsy in another cycle with hormonal replacement therapy but the biopsy will be taken on a different day based on the result of the first ERA test, to identify their personalized window of implantation. These patients will be randomised into two arms of the same size: Arm CNR1 and Arm CNR2. Arm CNR1 will follow a substituted cycle based on the ERA test (pET) result.</description>
