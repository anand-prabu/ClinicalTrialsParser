Both visual behavior and brain response will be recorded\n      during game play.\n\n      It is hypothesized that that, over the course of the game, relative to baseline,\n      participants will show (a) increased looking to targets, (b) decreased response time to\n      targets, and (c) enhanced, more efficient neural response to visual cues.
