  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate methods for AGS-003 production from surgical (stage I)
      and metastatic biopsy (stage II) Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) specimens using core needle
      biopsy in subjects with RCC.  Specifically, this study will evaluate the feasibility of RNA
      amplification from total tumor RNA isolated from tissues obtained by core needle tumor
      biopsy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A subject with metastatic RCC, who in the opinion of the treating physician, is a
        potential candidate for inclusion in this study if all of the following criteria apply:

          1. 18 years of age or older.

          2. Histologically confirmed RCC.

          3. Metastatic disease in the opinion of the investigator.

          4. Availability of either:

               -  Nephrectomy or other surgically removed tissue (Stage I); or,

               -  Metastatic RCC biopsy tissue utilizing needle or core biopsy procedures (Stage
                  II).

          5. ≥4 biopsy specimens available from BRPC.

               -  Subjects who are having a surgical procedure (i.e. metastasectomy, nephrectomy)
                  will have these core biopsies obtained from the surgical specimen, per the BRPC
                  protocol.

          6. Not currently being treated with systemic therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Tumor tissue is committed to other use or inadequate for RNA analysis.

          2. Insufficient tissue is collected in the BRPC.
