  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Historically, medulloblastoma treatment has been determined by the amount of leftover
      disease present after surgery, also known as clinical risk (standard vs. high risk). Recent
      studies have shown that medulloblastoma is made up of distinct molecular subgroups which
      respond differently to treatment. This suggests that clinical risk alone is not adequate to
      identify actual risk of recurrence.  In order to address this, we will stratify
      medulloblastoma treatment in this phase II clinical trial based on both clinical risk (low,
      standard, intermediate, or high risk) and molecular subtype (WNT, SHH, or Non-WNT Non-SHH).
      This stratified clinical and molecular treatment approach will be used to evaluate the
      following:

        -  To find out if participants with low-risk WNT tumors can be treated with a lower dose
           of radiation to the brain and spine, and a lower dose of the chemotherapy drug
           cyclophosphamide while still achieving the same survival rate as past St. Jude studies
           with fewer side effects.

        -  To find out if adding targeted chemotherapy after standard chemotherapy will benefit
           participants with SHH positive tumors.

        -  To find out if adding new chemotherapy agents to the standard chemotherapy will improve
           the outcome for intermediate and high risk Non-WNT Non-SHH tumors.

        -  To define the cure rate for standard risk Non-WNT Non-SHH tumors treated with reduced
           dose cyclophosphamide and compare this to participants from the past St. Jude study.

      All participants on this study will have surgery to remove as much of the primary tumor as
      safely possible, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The amount of radiation therapy and
      type of chemotherapy received will be determined by the participant's treatment stratum.
      Treatment stratum assignment will be based on the tumor's molecular subgroup assignment and
      clinical risk.

      The participant will be assigned to one of three medulloblastoma subgroups determined by
      analysis of the tumor tissue for tumor biomarkers:

        -  WNT (Strata W): positive for WNT biomarkers

        -  SHH (Strata S): positive for SHH biomarkers

        -  Non-WNT Non-SHH, Failed, or Indeterminate (Strata N): negative for WNT and SHH
           biomarkers  or results are indeterminable

      Participants will then be assigned to a clinical risk group (low, standard, intermediate, or
      high) based on assessment of:

        -  How much tumor is left after surgery

        -  If the cancer has spread to other sites outside the brain [i.e., to the spinal cord or
           within the fluid surrounding the spinal cord, called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)]

        -  The appearance of the tumor cells under the microscope

        -  Whether or not there are chromosomal abnormalities in the tumor, and if present, what
           type (also called cytogenetics analysis).

      Outline:  This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to molecular
      subgroup assignment (WNT, SHH, or Non-WNT Non- SHH) and then by clinical risk stratification
      (extent of resection, M stage, histologic subtype, and cytogenetic features). All patients
      will be treated with risk-adapted radiation therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients
      assigned to Stratum W1 will receive reduced dose radiation therapy.  Patients assigned to
      Stratum W2, S1, N1, or N2 will receive standard dose radiation therapy.  Patients assigned
      to Stratum W3, S2, or N3 will receive high dose radiation therapy. Radiation therapy will be
      followed by 4 cycles of adjuvant conventional chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, cisplatin
      and vincristine for all patients.  Patients assigned to Stratum N2 or N3 (Non-WNT Non-SHH
      with high risk factors) will receive 3 additional cycles of pemetrexed and gemcitabine
      chemotherapy intermixed into the conventional adjuvant chemotherapy cycles. Patients with
      SHH subtype (Stratum S1 or S2) will receive 12 months additional maintenance therapy with
      vismodegib.

      Patients may consent to provide tumor tissue, blood, and CSF samples for biological studies.
      Tumor tissues are analyzed for the activation of the WNT signaling pathway, activation of
      the SHH signaling pathway, validation of novel patterns of gene expression via
      immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis; validation of genetic abnormalities via interphase
      fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH); construction of gene expression profiles via
      microarray analysis; construction of DNA methylation profiling via microarrays; single
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis for DNA copy number aberrations; potential oncogenes
      and tumor suppressor genes via DNA sequence analysis; expression of a number of cell signal
      proteins implicated in the biology of medulloblastoma via western blot; expression of
      additional proteins encoded by genes associated through SNP and gene expression array
      analysis with clinical disease behavior. Blood samples are analyzed from patients whose
      tumors contain gene mutations via sequence analysis of constitutional DNA. CSF and blood
      samples are analyzed for identification of potential tumor markers. Parents may consent to
      have blood samples analyzed for inheritable gene mutations associated with medulloblastoma.

      Patients may also consent to exploratory research that include additional functional MRI
      imaging to investigate damage to neural connections from therapy; additional psychological
      testing to identify neurocognitive effects of therapy; additional heart and lung testing to
      identify treatment effects; additional endocrine studies to identify treatment effect on
      growth and development.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Medulloblastoma or medulloblastoma variants including posterior fossa PNET as
             documented by an institutional pathologist.

          -  Age greater than or equal to 3 years and less than 22 years of age at the time of
             diagnosis.

          -  No previous radiotherapy, chemotherapy or other brain tumor directed therapy other
             than corticosteroid therapy and surgery.

          -  Patients must begin treatment as outlined in the protocol within 36 days of
             definitive surgery (day of surgery is day 0; definitive surgery includes second
             surgeries to resect residual tumor).

          -  Adequate performance status: children &lt; 10-Lansky Score ≥ 30; children ≥ 10-Karnofsky
             ≥ 30 (except for posterior fossa syndrome).

          -  Females of child-bearing potential cannot be pregnant or breast-feeding.  Female
             participants &gt; 10 years of age or post-menarche must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test prior to enrollment.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  CNS embryonal tumor other than medulloblastoma or PNET in the posterior fossa, for
             example, patients with diagnosis of Atypical Teratoid / Rhabdoid Tumor (ATRT),
             supratentorial PNET, pineoblastoma, ependymoblastoma, ETANTR are excluded.

          -  Research participants with other clinically significant medical disorders that could
             compromise their ability to tolerate protocol therapy or would interfere with the
             study procedures or results history.

        Participants in the exercise intervention portion of the study must meet all criteria
        below:

          -  Must be &gt; 5 years at the time of enrollment

          -  Must have no congenital heart disease or posterior fossa syndrome

        Participants in the cognitive remediation intervention portion of the study must meet all
        criteria below:

          -  Completed protocol-directed radiation therapy

          -  ≥5 years at the time of remediation intervention consent

          -  English as primary language and training aide who speaks English available to
             participate in required sessions

          -  No significant cognitive impairment operationalized as either an IQ &lt; 70 for children
             with St. Jude SJMB12 study baseline testing or based on clinician judgment baseline
             IQ missing

          -  No major sensory or motor impairment that would preclude valid cognitive testing
             (e.g., unresolved posterior fossa syndrome, blindness, poorly controlled
             seizures/photosensitive epilepsy, psychosis) or a major psychological condition that
             would preclude completion of the intervention (e.g., significant oppositionality,
             autism spectrum disorder, severe anxiety or depressive symptoms)
