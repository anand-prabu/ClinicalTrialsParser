    <textblock>
      This clinical investigation is being performed to compare the effect of BOL-303259-X dosed
      once daily (QD) with timolol maleate 0.5% dosed twice daily (BID) in reducing intraocular
      pressure (IOP) measured over a 24-hour period in subjects with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) or
      ocular hypertension (OHT).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have a diagnosis of OAG or OHT in 1 or both eyes.

          -  Subjects who are treatment-naïve must meet the following IOP requirements at Visit 1
             (Screening), and pretreated subjects must meet the following IOP requirements at
             Visit 2 (Washout): Intraocular pressure ≥ 22 mmHg in at least 1 eye and ≤ 36 mmHg in
             both eyes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have been exposed to BOL-303259-X within 3 months prior to Visit 1
             (Screening).

          -  Subjects with a history or presence of chronic generalized systemic disease that the
             Investigator feels might increase the risk to the subject or confound the results of
             the study.

          -  Subjects with an irregular daily sleep schedule.

          -  Subjects who are unable to wear sleep monitoring device for 7 days prior to
             laboratory study.

          -  Subjects with an anticipated need to initiate or modify medication (systemic or
             topical) that is known to affect IOP.

          -  Subjects for whom concomitant use of medications may interact with the safety or
             efficacy of a nitric oxide.

          -  Subjects with known hypersensitivity or contraindications to latanoprost or any of
             the ingredients in the study drugs.

          -  Subjects who are expected to require treatment with ocular or systemic
             corticosteroids.

          -  Subjects who are in need of any other topical or systemic treatment of OAG or OHT.

          -  Subjects who are unable to discontinue contact lens use during and for 24 hours
             before the laboratory study.

          -  Subjects with a central corneal thickness greater than 600 μm in either eye.

          -  Subjects with any condition that prevents reliable applanationtonometry in either
             eye.

          -  Subjects with advanced glaucoma and subjects with a cup/disc ratio greater than 0.8
             or a history of split fixation, or a field loss threatening fixation in either eye.

          -  Subjects with previous or active corneal disease.

          -  Subjects with a history of severe dry eye.

          -  Subjects with active optic disc hemorrhage.

          -  Subjects with a history of central/branch retinal vein or artery occlusion.

          -  Subjects with a history of macular edema.

          -  Subjects with very narrow angles and subjects with angle closure, congenital, and
             secondary glaucoma, and subjects with history of angle closure in either eye.

          -  Subjects with a diagnosis of a clinically significant or progressive retinal disease
             in either eye.

          -  Subjects with any intraocular infection or inflammation within 3 months prior to
             Visit 1 (Screening).

          -  Subjects with a history of ocular laser surgery within the 3 months prior to Visit 1
             (Screening).

          -  Subjects with a history of incisional ocular surgery or severe trauma within 3 months
             prior to Visit 1 (Screening).
