  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project has two primary goals. The first goal is to further scientific understanding
      about marijuana abuse by examining two recognized factors in marijuana use and relapse: (1)
      stress/anxiety and (2) atypical reactivity to marijuana-related stimuli (e.g., attentional
      bias). The second goal is to attenuate the influence of stress/anxiety and attentional bias
      to marijuana stimuli via administration of buspirone.

      Buspirone is uniquely suited to this project because it has effects on neurotransmitter
      systems known to modulate both stress/anxiety and attentional bias.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For nearly 40 years marijuana has remained the most widely used illicit drug in the US, with
      more than 50% of first-time users &lt; age 18. Marijuana accounts for ≈ 60% of illicit
      substance use disorders (SUD) in the US, bearing by percent the largest US public health
      burden among illicit substances. Across preclinical, human laboratory, and clinical
      interview data, there is compelling evidence that the phenomenon of cue reactivity is
      related to drug seeking and relapse. Attentional bias is a measurable component of cue
      reactivity, and can be operationally defined as differential attention (e.g., reaction time
      difference) towards drug-related stimuli vs. neutral stimuli. This phenomenon has been
      demonstrated in SUD populations across many classes of abused drugs, including alcohol,
      nicotine, stimulants, opiates, and - importantly - marijuana. Cue reactivity and attentional
      bias are exacerbated by acute and chronic stress and anxiety. Notably, stress is a
      well-documented predictor of marijuana abuse and marijuana relapse. Therapeutic
      interventions that attenuate attentional bias to marijuana cues are a potentially important
      component in the treatment of marijuana SUD. Due to the well-documented association with
      stress, an intervention that simultaneously addresses both stress and attentional bias could
      be uniquely efficacious. Currently, few pharmacotherapies exist for marijuana SUD, and none
      are presently known to address attentional bias to marijuana cues. This application will
      explore the potential of the anxiolytic buspirone to modify attentional bias and stress.
      Buspirone is a unique compound marked by modulation of both serotonin (5-HT1A) and dopamine
      D3 receptors. Importantly, the 5-HT1A receptor is known to play a key role in stress related
      anxiety, and preclinical work indicates that D3 antagonists significantly decrease cue
      reactivity to a number of abused drugs. This combination of effects suggests buspirone may
      be advantageous in targeting both stress and attentional bias as factors that contribute to
      problem marijuana use.

      Accordingly, this application seeks to examine the effects of chronic buspirone
      administration on attentional bias and stress/anxiety in marijuana SUD. Using
      laboratory-based methodologies sensitive to attentional bias towards marijuana cues and well
      validated measures of stress and anxiety, we will examine if buspirone's unique mechanism of
      action will (a) produce an attenuation of attentional bias to marijuana cues, and (b) be
      most pronounced under conditions in which attentional bias is related to high levels of
      stress and anxiety.
