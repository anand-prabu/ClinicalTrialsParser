The primary objective of the study is to describe techniques\n      utilized to screen for and diagnose vasa previa.\n\n        -  In those cases that were diagnosed antenatally, to describe the different management\n           protocols utilized, correlate these management protocols with neonatal outcomes and\n           support the management protocol that offers optimal outcomes for both mother and\n           neonate.\n\n        -  In those cases that were not diagnosed antenatally, to describe the clinical scenario\n           surrounding delivery and the neonatal outcomes.  Review the ultrasound reports and\n           maternal characteristics to identify any potential risk factors for vasa previa that\n           could have been identified antenatally in attempt to improve neonatal outcomes in the\n           future.\n\n        -  In all cases of diagnosed vasa previa (those diagnosed antepartum, intrapartum, and\n           postpartum), to describe the maternal characteristics and identify potential underlying\n           risk factors that may provide a basis for future screening recommendations and\n           protocols. Due to the rarity of this diagnosis, the study hopes to include 100-250\n           participants."
