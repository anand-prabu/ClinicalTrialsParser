Both groups were followed-up every month for six months. The primary\n      outcomes were body composition changes during the six-month period, measured by dual X-ray\n      absorptiometry (DEXA) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Secondary outcomes were\n      metabolic syndrome risk changes measured by fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and lipid\n      profiles.\n\n      The adherence to the nutritional education and physical activity recommendation was\n      evaluated by using three-day dietary records (two weekdays and one weekend day) and a\n      physical activity questionnaire at each visit. All participants were examined and counseled\n      about physical activity and life style modification strategies by a pediatrician at every\n      visit."
