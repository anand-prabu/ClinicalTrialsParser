  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pilot clinical trial - Phase 2a, multicenter, single arm, open label trial -  to evaluate
      efficacy and safety of concomitant combination treatment with Gemcitabine and Romidepsin
      (GEMRO) regimen as salvage treatment in relapsed/refractory PTCL in a selected population of
      patients.

      Objectives will be focused on preliminary dose-response, type of patients, frequency of
      dosing, and safety and tolerability profile.

    <description>The time from start of study treatment to first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death due to any cause, whichever comes first. PFS data will be censored on the day following the date of the last radiological assessment of measured lesions documenting absence of progressive disease for patients who do not have objective tumor progression and are still on study at the time of an analysis, are given antitumor treatment other than the study treatment or stem cell transplant, or are removed from study prior to documentation of objective tumor progression. Patients lacking an evaluation of tumor response after their first dose will have their event time censored at 1 day.</description>
