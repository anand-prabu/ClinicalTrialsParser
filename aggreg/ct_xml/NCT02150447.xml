      The aim of this study is the effect of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) with respect to gastric
      cancer bleeding in inoperable patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tumor bleeding frequently occurs in inoperable gastric cancer patients. Inoperable gastric
      cancer usually has a large ulcer with friable tumor vessels.  Acidic environment in stomach
      prevents adequate function of coagulation cascade and decrease clot stability. Gastric
      cancer bleeding may cause significant morbidity and often delays scheduled chemotherapy.
      National Center Center data showed that about 30% of gastric cancer patient undergoing
      palliative chemotherapy eventually experience significant cancer bleeding during the
      treatment period. Once bleeding occurs, endoscopic management is more difficult in gastric
      cancer patients than in patients with benign peptic ulcers, because the malignant ulcer bed
      has significant fibrosis. Consequently, gastric cancer patient has a high risk of
      rebleeding.

      Proton pump inhibitor (PPI, lansoprazole for example) decrease gastric acid secretion by
      inhibiting H+,K+-ATPase, and subsequently stabilize blood clot. PPIs are commonly used for
      benign peptic ulcer or reflux esophagitis, and PPI can decrease recurrent benign ulcer
      bleeding or other ulcer complications. Moreover, it was reported to prevent bleeding from
      NSAID or aspirin induced gastric ulcer.  Because PPIs are very safe, and they are even
      available as over-the-counter drugs in some countries.  Furthermore, the drug has no
      interaction with major chemotherapeutic agents commonly used for gastric cancer. Moreover,
      the drugs are prescribed to the gastric cancer patients when tumor bleeding occurs.
      Although gastric cancer bleeding is not uncommon and clinically challenging problem, there
      has been no recommended measure to prevent cancer bleeding. Also there has been no report
      about the efficacy of PPIs on the gastric cancer bleeding prevention up to now.
