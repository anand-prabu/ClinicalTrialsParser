The recruitment occurs during the consultations in the service of neurology.\n      If the subjects are eligible, the study is proposed to them, and an evaluation is fixed in\n      the next days. This evaluation consists in an individual face-to-face interview based on\n      standardized and semi-structured questionnaires, during approximately one and a half hour.\n      It's focused on the different characteristics of Parkinson's disease, and on psychiatric and\n      addictive co morbidities. The evaluation is completed by a set of self-administered\n      questionnaires focused on impulsivity and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\n\n      For the 80 patients participated to the ancillary study only, a blood sample will be\n      realized when the patient will arrived, just before the intake of his treatment (to obtain\n      the residual plasmatic concentration). A second sample will be realized at a different time\n      for each patient, to cover the entirety of the kinetic between 2 intakes of pramipexole\n      (immediate release form) via the entire sample. The second blood sample will be realized\n      four hours after the first one at the most. After this second sample, the patient will have\n      completed his participation to the study.\n\n      An extraction of DNA and a conservation of the sample during ten years are planned, for the\n      possible realisation of a pharmacogenetic analysis, if the results of the pharmacokinetic\n      analysis imply an interest of such a study."
