Subjects will refrain from using rescue medication for 4 hours prior to any clinic\n      visits, unless for emergency.\n\n      During each treatment period, study medication will be taken once in the morning until the\n      morning of Day 7 (+2 days) when subjects will return to the clinic for study assessments and\n      take the last dose of study medication.  On Day 7 (+2), subjects will remain in the clinic\n      overnight for serial assessments (ECG, and PK plasma and urine samples over the 24-hours)."
