Our NGO\n      (non-governmental organization), Omni Med, has partnered with the Ministry of Health in\n      Kampala and Mukono to facilitate its Village Health Team (VHT) program. Our volunteers\n      facilitate training of VHTs and then conduct follow up home visits with these VHTs. During\n      the trainings and follow up visits we stress the health practices in the Ministry's training\n      program that have been shown to make the biggest impact on local health such as: exclusive\n      breast-feeding for 9 months, use of oral rehydration therapy (ORT), antibiotics for\n      pneumonia, timely antimalarial use, use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs), clean water,\n      improved sanitation, Vitamin A supplementation and vaccination, antenatal visits and tetanus\n      immunization for pregnant women, etc. Our pre-trial assumption is that local villagers will\n      use this knowledge to improve their own health; and that the VHTs are the ideal messengers\n      to deliver this knowledge. While the Ministry has trained over 83,000 VHTs nationally, there\n      are no objective studies measuring impact on host communities. This will be the first and\n      could prove an important means to promote the program nationally and internationally.\n\n      The primary objective of this research is to measure the efficacy of the VHT program in\n      Uganda. While this program has become a priority of the Ministry of Health, there is to date\n      no clear randomized, prospective trial measuring its impact. This will thus fill a current\n      gap using data obtained from 1190 households. A second objective is to demonstrate\n      measurable results of a global service program. There is very little impact data despite\n      huge interest in service from many in the world's wealthiest countries. A third objective is\n      to provide an objective measure of efficacy to the United States Peace Corps, which despite\n      50 years of activities, has little data demonstrating its true value; several Peace Corps\n      Volunteers are working in this program in Mukono."
