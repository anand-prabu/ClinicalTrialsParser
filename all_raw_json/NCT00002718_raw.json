Beginning 5-6 days before transplantation, filgrastim\n           (G-CSF)-stimulated, allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested,\n           selected for CD34+ cells, and treated in vitro. If feasible, autologous bone marrow is\n           harvested in the event of allogeneic graft failure.\n\n        -  Myeloablation: Patients undergo total body irradiation 3 times a day on days -9 to -6,\n           thiotepa IV over 4 hours on days -5 and -4, and cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and -2.\n\n        -  Transplantation: CD34+, E-rosette and T-cell-depleted PBSC are infused over 15 minutes\n           and then T-cell-depleted bone marrow is infused over 1-5 minutes on day 0. Patients\n           receive G-CSF IV over 30 minutes beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood counts\n           recover and then tapering. Patients receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 4-6 hours\n           on days 8, 10, 12, and 14 and oral methylprednisolone on days 8-14 followed by tapered\n           doses on days 15-17.\n\n        -  CNS prophylaxis: Beginning at least 2 months after transplantation, patients with acute\n           lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and no history of CNS leukemia receive cytarabine\n           intrathecally (IT) monthly for 6 months and patients with ALL and a history of CNS\n           leukemia receive cytarabine IT monthly for 12 months.\n\n      Patients with graft failure are offered autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) or\n      second allogeneic BMT.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and then annually for 3 years."
