Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy together\n      with low-dose radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage I or stage IIA\n      Hodgkin's lymphoma."

Beginning 2-3 weeks after completion of\n      chemotherapy, patients undergo low-dose radiotherapy 5 days a week for approximately 3\n      weeks.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years."
