            "textblock": "Robot assisted prostatectomy reduces the patients' postoperative pain and leads to rapid\n      rehabilitation. But pneumoperitoneum affects the kidney.  The increase of stress hormone\n      reduces the glomerular filtration and the vaso-contraction of renal vessels leads the renal\n      ischemia. Remifentanil is analgesics coupled with \u03bc opioid receptor. In high dose of\n      remifentanil, it is associated with \u03ba and \u03b4 receptors, which leads to renal protection\n      effect in animal study. Also, remifentanil infusion during anesthesia showed a diuretic\n      effect. The purpose of this study is to investigate the remifentanil effect on renal\n      function during robot assisted prostatectomy."
