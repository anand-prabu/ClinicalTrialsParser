The specific aim of the study is\n      to provide data permitting the development of guidelines for use of AZT in patients with\n      mild, moderate, or severe liver disease.\n\n      AZT is the only antiviral agent that has been shown to be effective in patients with severe\n      HIV infection. However, AZT is largely eliminated from the body through a biochemical\n      reaction that takes place in the liver, and it is possible that patients with underlying\n      liver disease may have altered AZT pharmacokinetics and may metabolize AZT differently, with\n      the result that they are susceptible to an increased risk of serious drug toxicity. This\n      study will examine the pharmacokinetics, elimination, and metabolism of AZT in patients with\n      liver disease. Guidelines developed from the data will be helpful in managing AZT treatment\n      of these HIV-infected persons and will indicate whether the dose of AZT administered should\n      be adjusted to compensate for any changes in its bioavailability and/or pharmacokinetics."

Patients fast for 8\n      hours prior to each dose and for 2 hours after each dose. Liver function tests are repeated\n      on the first day of the study. In each patient, serial measurements of serum and urine AZT\n      and its metabolite, 3'-azido-3'-deoxy-5'-glucuronylthymidine (GAZT), are monitored after\n      both doses."
