There will be a maximum of three follow up visits. The imaging test battery will\n      consist of amyloid and acetylcholine brain PET and MRI scans. The use of acetylcholine PET\n      imaging will demonstrate how changes in activity of this neurotransmitter relate to changes\n      in cognitive functions, such as memory and mental concentration. A key question will be\n      whether persons with PD who not only are losing acetylcholine brain cells but also have the\n      buildup of the Alzheimer amyloid protein have a more rapid progression with more severe\n      cognitive decline and behavioral changes compared to persons who do not have the amyloid\n      protein."
