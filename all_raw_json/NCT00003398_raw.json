Evaluate the rapidity of engraftment and CD4 count recovery post-transplantation in this\n      patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive total body irradiation (TBI) three or two times a day on days -8\n      to -5. Following TBI, patients receive thiotepa IV over 4 hours daily on days -4 and -3 plus\n      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour daily on days -2 and -1. Antithymocyte globulin is\n      administered by IV over at least 4 hours on days -4 to -1. Patients undergo an allogenic\n      bone marrow transplantation on day 0. Bone marrow is harvested from patient's donor,\n      depleted of T-cells, and infused. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously\n      beginning on day 4.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 26-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-4\n      years."
