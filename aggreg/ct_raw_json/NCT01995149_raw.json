Each participant's caloric prescription represented a deficit of 600 kcal per day as calculated from the person's resting energy expenditure and activity level using the Harris-Benedict equation. In general, prescribed energy intake was between 1200 kcal and 1600 kcal/day. Dietary composition consisted on 50-55% of carbohydrates, 15-20% of protein and 30% of fat and included a wide variety of foods typical of a Mediterranean diet. Patients were also provided with recipes and shopping counselling to improve intervention compliance and to achieve the weight loss goal. Individual consultations with a nutritionist were performed twice a month to motivate the weight loss and reinforce the intervention."

They were advised to follow a hypocaloric diet with\n      a deficit of 600 kcal (30% fat, 15% protein, and 55% carbohydrates) per day as calculated\n      from the person's resting energy expenditure and activity level. Anthropometric data,\n      biochemical analysis including lipids, apolipoproteins and non-cholesterol sterols were\n      evaluated at baseline, 3 months and 6 months."
