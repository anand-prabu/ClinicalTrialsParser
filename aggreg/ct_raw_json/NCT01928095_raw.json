The surgical process by which the tissue is obtained is\n      not part of this research project.  These tissues are surgically removed from patients as a\n      treatment for atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries and typically sent for pathological\n      examination.\n\n      After the the clinical pathology has been completed, the investigator will obtain and\n      analyze a small amount of discarded (200mg) tissue. Subsequent analyses will be performed on\n      the basis of the pathological grading provided by UK Pathology (e.g do readouts of the Dicer\n      pathway correlate with pathological plaque characteristics). Tissue will be anonymized, with\n      only information with respect to drug history, age, gender and pathological grade of the\n      tissue.\n\n      The will extract protein and RNA. Dicer abundance will be assessed by western blot,\n      quantitative RT-PCR and northern blot. Dicer related RNAs  will be measured by quantitative\n      RT-PCR and northern blot. The invesigator will inspect the tissue for evidence of altered\n      Dicer activity by measuring the relative levels of abundant canonical Dicer\n      substrates/enzymatic products (i.e. the ratio of pre- to mature micro-RNA) via northern\n      blot. The investigator predicts that Dicer levels and activity are reduced in human\n      atherosclerotic tissue compared to healthy arteries.\n\n      Next, the investigator will assess whether downstream mediators of Dicer dysregulation are\n      activated in these tissue samples by comparing levels and activation of the inflammasome\n      (caspase-1, NLRP3, ASC), cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-18) and signaling intermediates (MyD88,\n      IRAK1/4) between healthy and diseased tissues. The investigator predicts that\n      atherosclerotic plaques will exhibit evidence of Dicer dysregulation.\n\n      Next, the investigator will co-stain tissue sections with antibodies recognizing Dicer as\n      well as cell-specific markers (CD31 for endothelium, SMA for smooth muscle, MAC-1 for\n      macrophages) to assess whether Dicer dysregulation displays cell type-specific patterns."
