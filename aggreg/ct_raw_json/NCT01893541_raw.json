Band\n      ligation is the best endoscopic treatment to prevent EV bleeding. The exact benefit of\n      beta-blocker association to band ligation remains to be defined, especially for primary\n      prophylaxis. This prospective randomized controlled trial will compare EBL with propranolol\n      and EBL alone in primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding among cirrhotic patients with\n      high-risk varices. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patients with high-risk varices will be\n      randomly allocated to EBL plus propranolol (Group I) or EBL alone (Group II). EBL will be\n      performed at 3-week interval till obliteration of varices. In Group I, incremental dosage of\n      propranolol (sufficient to reduce heart rate to 55 beats/min or 25% reduction from baseline)\n      will be administered and will be continued after obliteration of varices until the end of\n      the study. The follow-up of patients will be 2 years. The primary outcome of this study will\n      be EV recurrence during two years of follow-up. The secondary outcomes will be EV\n      eradication, bleeding before eradication, mortality and complications during the same\n      follow-up."
