      This study will provide information regarding the metabolic pathway of TD 1211, the need for
      evaluation of potential drug-drug interactions, the need for studies in special populations
      and the absolute oral bioavailability of TD-1211.  The administration of radiolabeled drug
      is necessary to fully characterize the rates and routes of elimination of TD 1211, providing
      further quantitative information on the disposition of TD 1211.  The results from this study
      will allow a more comprehensive comparison between animal and human routes of elimination
      and metabolic profiles of TD 1211.

          4. Willing and able to give written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant allergic (except for untreated,
             asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of dosing), hematological, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, or neurological

             gastrointestinal tract [including removal of parts of the stomach, bowel, liver, gall
             bladder, or pancreas]).

          5. Participated in another clinical trial of an investigational drug (or medical device)
             within 60 days (or 5 half-lives of the investigational drug, whichever is longer)
             prior to Screening, or is currently participating in another trial of an
             investigational drug (or medical device).
