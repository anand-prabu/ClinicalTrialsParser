      1. MAIN OBJECTIVE :

           To assess the consequences of a maternal hyperthyroïd during pregnancy on intellectual
           development of the child from 6 to 9 years

        2. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES :

             1. To assess the consequences of a maternal hyperthyroïd during pregnancy on the
                capacities of attention, learning process and the degree of hyperactivity of the
                child from 6 to 9 years.

             2. To study if it exist differences of intellectual development, capacities of
                attention, learning process, and degree of hyperactivity in the child from 6 to 9
                years, born to hyperthyroid mother during pregnancy, according to:

                  -  the etiology of the maternal hyperthyroïd (transitory gestation hyperthyroid
                     versus disease of Basedow),

                  -  the use or not of a anti-thyroid treatment,

                  -  the rate of TSH néonatal (measured with the blotter by tracking with J3 at
                     all the new born ones).

      mothers during pregnancy (nonexposed children with the maternal hyperthyroïd).

        -  1st part of the study: Retrospective analyze of the files of symptomatic hyperthyroid
           mothers during pregnancy.

        -  2nd part of the study: Assessment of intellectual development, capacities of attention,
           learning process and degree of hyperactivity of the children between 6 and 9 years. The
           exposed children (born to hyperthyroïd mothers during pregnancy) will be compared with
           nonexposed children (born to euthyroïd mothers during pregnancy).
