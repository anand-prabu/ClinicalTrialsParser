Equally concerning\n      is that patients with severe persistent mental illness (SPMI) continue to have inadequate\n      integration of care between psychiatry and medicine. Because of the difficulty getting\n      patients to primary care or hospital based laboratories, the use of capillary blood,\n      point-of-care tests (POCT) to monitor glucose and lipids in addition to vital signs and\n      other anthropometric measurements in community mental health centers might prove beneficial.\n      It is highly likely that this advanced level of screening in the mental health setting may\n      lead to identifying new metabolic abnormalities or improved treatment with careful\n      monitoring of previously diagnosed metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and/or hypertension in\n      antipsychotic treated patients. It is hypothesized that if metabolic abnormalities are\n      identified; then providing pharmacist CMM consultative services would reduce medication\n      related problems by improving medication adherence, coordination of care between psychiatry\n      and primary care, and outcomes in metabolic indices."
