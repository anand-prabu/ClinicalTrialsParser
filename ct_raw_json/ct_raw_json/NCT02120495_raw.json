            "textblock": "In this study we will use the digital techniques such as pre-surgical visual treatment\n      planning, real time surgical navigation system, endoscope techniques, to do the intraoral\n      condylectomy via coronoid process resection. After the condyle lesion resection, the\n      coronoid process will be reimplanted and fixed by stainless steel wire. By using these\n      techniques we can safely and precisely cut proper size and position of the condyle lesion as\n      we pre-surgically designed, and at the same time greatly maintain the temporomandibular\n      joint anatomy structure. Since we don't need to do the mandible vertical ramus osteotomy,\n      and no conventional extraoral incision will be needed, the surgical injury will be minimized\n      and the TMJ function will recover soon postoperatively. Additionally, the intraoral approach\n      can avoid the risk of facial nerve injury, salivary fistula and skin scar, so it has better\n      aesthetic results than the preauricular approach and the submandibular approach."
