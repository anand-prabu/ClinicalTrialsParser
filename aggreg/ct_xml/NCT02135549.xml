  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and effectiveness of two doses of SugarDown in two different doses vs.
      placebo on serum glucose levels after meals in subjects with Type 2 Diabetes treated with
      metformin alone. There will be five visits, a screening visit, baseline visit, and 3
      treatment visits. The study duration will be five weeks. Subjects will all receive placebo
      tablets at the baseline visit, eat a standard rice meal, and then serum glucose levels will
      be measured in frequent intervals over four hours immediately following the meal. Subjects
      will be randomized to one of the six treatment sequences. Patients will take in an unknown
      order one week of placebo, one week of 4 g dose and one week of 8 g dose of SugarDown
      immediately before breakfast, lunch and dinner meals. Patients will continue their usual
      metformin regimen during the trial period.
