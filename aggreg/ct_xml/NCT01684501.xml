  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to perform clinical testing of the PowerFoot in a group of
      individuals with trans-tibial amputation with the objective of optimizing its performance
      and comparing it with a current state-of-art passive-elastic ankle-foot prosthesis, i.e. the
      Ceterus Flex-Foot.

    <textblock>
      The investigators will measure performance during level ground walking and in simulated
      uneven terrain. The investigators will also compare the metabolic cost and self-selected
      gait speed with the PowerFoot versus the traditional Ceterus Flex-Foot.

      Tasks will include:

        -  Perform biomechanical analysis (kinematic and kinetic gait parameters) of the PowerFoot
           and the Ceterus in a group of individuals with trans-tibial amputation during level
           walking, ramp ambulation, and stair ambulation.

        -  Compare in the laboratory and in the field the performance of the PowerFoot with the
           Ceterus.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  weigh more than 200 lbs

          -  are high level ambulators corresponding to levels E to F of the Special Interest
             Group of Amputee Medicine (SIGAM) mobility grade

          -  have the ability to follow multi-step commands.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  score level D on the  SIGAM mobility grade

          -  have experienced 1 or more falls in the last month before the study

          -  have a residual limb length which does not allow for seven inches clearance of
             bracket attachment for the PowerFoot

          -  the residual limb must be stable in volume (no change in socket or socket padding in
             last 6 months) and without pain that limits function

          -  the sound-side (contralateral) lower extremity must be free of impediments that
             affect gait, range of motion, or limb muscle activity

          -  Any diagnosed cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological, and/ or orthopedic conditions
             that would interfere with subject participation
