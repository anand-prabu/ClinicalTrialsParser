  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to clinically and radiographically assess whether the use of a
      ridge preservation technique significantly minimizes alveolar ridge resorption following
      tooth extraction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects requiring single-rooted tooth extractions and future tooth replacement therapy with
      implant-supported restorations will be recruited. Subjects will be randomly assigned to
      either a control (tooth extraction alone) or an experimental group (tooth extraction and
      ridge preservation using an allograft to fill the alveolar socket covered with a
      non-absorbable, dense polytetrafluoroethylene membrane [dPTFE]). Clinical linear
      measurements of the ridge (horizontal and vertical) will be obtained using a tooth-supported
      stent. Following extraction, primary closure of the socket will not be attempted. Subjects
      will be re-evaluated at 1 and 4 weeks. Implant placement surgery will be performed at 16
      weeks. Clinical measurements will be repeated upon surgical re-entry. Cone beam computed
      tomographic (CBCT) scans will be obtained at baseline (after tooth extraction) and at 14
      weeks (prior to implant placement) to assess alveolar ridge volumetric changes (primary
      outcome). Secondary outcome measures include changes in bucco-lingual and apico-coronal
      clinical measurements of the ridge and changes in modified wound healing index changes
      overtime. The influence of the thickness of the facial and lingual bone of the alveolar
      ridge and the width of the keratinized tissue on the remodeling of the ridge will be
      evaluated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: 18 to 75 years.

          -  Gender: No restriction.

          -  Subjects must require a single-rooted tooth extraction (Tooth deemed as periodontally
             and/or restoratively hopeless), except lower incisors and second premolars.

          -  Subjects must be able and willing to follow instructions related to the study
             procedures.

          -  Subjects must have read, understood and signed an informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Reported allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the products to be used in the study.

          -  Severe hematologic disorders, such as hemophilia or leukemia.

          -  Active severe infectious diseases that may compromise normal healing.

          -  Liver or kidney dysfunction/failure.

          -  Currently under cancer treatment or within 18 months from completion of radio- or
             chemotherapy.

          -  Subjects who have a long-term history of oral bisphosphonate use (i.e. 10 years or
             more).

          -  Subjects with a history of IV bisphosphonates.

          -  Subjects with uncontrolled diabetes.

          -  Subjects with severe metabolic bone diseases, such as Paget's disease of bone, will
             be excluded.

          -  Pregnant women or nursing mothers.

          -  Smokers:  Subjects who have smoked within 6 months of study onset.

          -  Concomitant medications: Subjects on concomitant drug therapy for systemic conditions
             that may affect the outcomes of the study will not be included in the study.

        NOTE: Occasional, short-term use (7-14 days) of analgesics or common cold medications is
        permitted.  Use of such medications will be reviewed and recorded by the investigator.

        - Any other non-specified reason that from the point of views of the investigators will
        make a candidate not a suitable subject for the study (e.g. limited mouth opening).
