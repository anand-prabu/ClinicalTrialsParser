The purpose of this study is to develop and test education programs designed to\n      reduce barriers and Increase facilitators associated with cancer clinical trials\n      participation for Hispanic Americans and Asian/Pacific Islanders. Focus groups were\n      conducted with Hispanic American men and women to obtain culturally-linked attitudes related\n      to clinical trials participation. This information was used to create a prototypic\n      educational program anticipated to increase participation in clinical trials.  It was then\n      vetted and honed via additional focus groups.\n\n      Simultaneously, a validation study was conducted with Hispanic Americans for a packet of\n      psychosocial instruments  that could be used for a subsequent randomized controlled trial to\n      evaluate the impact of the clinical trials education program.\n\n      The finalized clinical trials education program was tested via a randomized controlled\n      trial.  Participants assigned to the experimental group received the  clinical trials\n      education program, while participants in the control arm were administered a comparable, but\n      non-relevant education program.  Recruitment to this study has been completed.\n\n      A comparable approach is being used to develop a program(s) for Asian/Pacific Islanders.\n      Recruitment to the focus groups is still underway."
