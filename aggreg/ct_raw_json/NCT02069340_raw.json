Zoledronic acid\n      is an anti-resorptive drug used as part of cancer treatment. A serious side effect of these\n      drugs is death of the jawbone, commonly called bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the\n      jaw (BRONJ). Genetic research may help doctors understand risk factors for BRONJ or who is\n      more likely to get BRONJ and why."
