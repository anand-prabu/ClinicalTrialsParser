Unselected\n      PBMNC are cultured and expanded ex vivo in flt3 ligand, interleukin-3, filgrastim (G-CSF),\n      sargramostim (GM-CSF), and epoetin alfa for 13 days. Expanded PBMNC are reinfused on day 0.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study."
