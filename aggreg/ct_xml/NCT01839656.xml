      This study will test the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of multiple doses of
      ISIS-SMNRx administered into the spinal fluid three times over the duration of the trial, in
      patients with Infantile-Onset Spinal Muscular Atrophy. Two dose levels will be evaluated
      sequentially. The lowest dose level will be studied in a cohort of 4 patients, and the
      highest dose level will be studied in a cohort of 4-16 patients.  All patients will receive
      active drug.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Genetic documentation of 5q SMA (homozygous gene deletion or mutation)

          -  Onset of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with SMA at ≥ 21 days and &lt;6 months
             (180 days) of age

          -  At study entry, receiving adequate nutrition and hydration (with or without
             gastrostomy), in the opinion of the Site Investigator

          -  Body weight &gt;5th percentile for age using CDC guidelines

          -  Medical care meets and is expected to continue to meet guidelines set out in the
             Consensus Statement for Standard of Care in SMA (Wang et al. 2007), in the opinion of
             the Site Investigator

          -  Gestational age of 35 to 42 weeks and gestation body weight ≥2 kg

          -  Reside within approximately 9 hours ground-travel distance from a participating study
             center for the duration of the study. Residence &gt;2 hours ground-travel distance from
             a study center must obtain clearance from the Site Investigator and the study Medical
             Monitor

          -  Able to complete all study procedures, measurements and visits and parent or
             guardian/subject has adequately supportive psychosocial circumstances, in the opinion
             of the Site Investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hypoxemia (O2 saturation awake &lt;96% or O2 saturation asleep &lt;96%, without ventilation
             support)

          -  Presence of an untreated or inadequately treated active infection requiring systemic
             antiviral or antimicrobial therapy at any time during the screening period

          -  History of brain or spinal cord disease that would interfere with the LP procedures,
             CSF circulation, or safety assessments

          -  Presence of an implanted shunt for the drainage of CSF or an implanted CNS catheter

          -  History of bacterial meningitis

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities in hematology or clinical chemistry parameters,
             as assessed by the Site Investigator, at screening that would render the subject
             unsuitable for inclusion

          -  Treatment with another investigational drug (e.g., albuterol, riluzole, carnitine,
             creatine, sodium phenylbutyrate, salbutamol, valproate, hydroxyurea etc), biological
             agent, or device within 90 days prior to enrollment or anytime during the study.  Any
             history of gene therapy or cell transplantation

          -  The subject's parent(s) or legal guardian(s) is unable to understand the nature,
             scope, and possible consequences of the study, or does not agree to comply with the
             protocol defined schedule of assessments

          -  Ongoing medical condition that according to the Site Investigator would interfere
             with the conduct and assessments of the study.  Examples are medical disability other
             than SMA that would interfere with the assessment of safety or would compromise the
             ability of the subject to undergo study procedures
