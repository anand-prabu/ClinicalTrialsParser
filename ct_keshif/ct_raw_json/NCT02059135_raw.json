Efficacy will be assessed by comparing the difference in\n      extension of gestational age from the time of randomization into the study until delivery\n      between ATryn and placebo treated subjects. In addition, the effect of ATryn on fetal and\n      neonatal clinical outcomes will be assessed. The PK characteristics of ATryn in the subjects\n      will be investigated by measuring AT activity levels in the mother during treatment and in\n      cord blood."

After informed consent has been\n      obtained subjects will be screened for eligibility. Screening includes obtaining the\n      subject's medical/obstetric history and a physical examination which includes an assessment\n      of maternal and fetal status. Blood samples for hematology, clinical chemistries,\n      biomarkers, coagulation, immunogenicity and AT activity levels will be drawn. A 12/24-hour\n      urine collection for protein or protein/creatinine ratio will be collected if not available\n      at the time of screening. Eligible subjects who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be\n      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a continuous infusion of either ATryn or placebo.\n\n      Sampling for AT activity will be performed immediately prior to the first dose of study drug\n      and at specified times thereafter.\n\n      Subjects will continue on study drug until maternal and/or fetal indications for delivery\n      necessitate cessation of expectant management or until 34 0/7 weeks of gestation. The\n      average extension of pregnancy with standard of care expectant management in this patient\n      population is approximately 7 days. It is assumed that treatment with ATryn will provide an\n      additional increase in gestational age of 5-7 days as compared to this standard of care.\n      Total duration on study drug is therefore estimated to be approximately 7 to 14 days on\n      average.\n\n      Post treatment assessments of the mother will be performed approximately 4-6 weeks after\n      delivery of the neonate. Information on the neonates will be collected until they reach a\n      post-menstrual age of 36 weeks (and a minimum of 28 days post delivery)."
