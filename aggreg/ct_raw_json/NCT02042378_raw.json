Clinical benefit has been observed in patients with a\n      gBRCA mutation as well as in those with a somatic BRCA (sBRCA) mutation.  Clinical data have\n      also shown that pancreatic cancer patients with a gBRCA mutation benefit from PARPi\n      treatment.  Clinical activity of PARP inhibitors in BRCA-mutated pancreatic cancer combined\n      with the paucity of 2nd line therapies support evaluation of rucaparib in pancreatic cancer\n      patients known to harbor a deleterious BRCA mutation."
