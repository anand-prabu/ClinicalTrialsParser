Participants will meet Diagnostic and\n      Statistical Manual-5 (DSM-5) criteria for ADHD, any current presentation, as established by\n      the Behavior Disorders Module of the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and\n      Schizophrenia (KSADS-PL) and clinical interview.\n\n      Other screening procedures include measures of ADHD symptom severity, other behavioral\n      ratings, and cognitive assessments.  Once inclusion/exclusion criteria  have been reviewed\n      and verified, participants will have a pre-treatment visit to establish behavioral and\n      cognitive baseline ratings and to obtain an EEG.  Participants and parents will be\n      instructed in the use of eTNS, and participants will begin use of the eTNS as directed\n      during sleep each night.  Participants will be randomized 1:1 to active or inactive sham\n      eTNS.  Participants, families, and most of the study team will remain blind to treatment\n      assignment. Participants will have weekly assessments over the eight week study to assess\n      behavioral, cognitive, and brain activation change and to monitor safety, tolerability, and\n      compliance.  Weekly ratings will be obtained from a parent, teacher, and clinician\n      investigator.  EEG will occur at baseline, end of treatment (week 4) and end of follow up\n      (week 8)."
