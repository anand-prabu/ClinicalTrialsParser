Evaluate tumor response and duration, one-year progression-free survival, and\n      one-year overall survival in patients with recurrent or metastatic colorectal carcinoma when\n      treated with trimetrexate glucuronate, fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive trimetrexate glucuronate (TMTX) IV over 1 hour on day 1. Beginning\n      18 hours after the TMTX dosage, patients receive leucovorin calcium (CF) IV over 2 hours.\n      Immediately after the completion of the CF infusion, patients receive an IV bolus injection\n      of fluorouracil (5-FU). Beginning 4 hours after the 5-FU infusion, patients receive oral CF\n      every 6 hours for 6 doses. Treatment repeats every 14 days in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity or as long as the disease remains inoperable. Patients\n      are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 15\n      months."
