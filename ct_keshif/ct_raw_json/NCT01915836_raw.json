Before the start the game,the participant will fill out a brief questionnaire.\nIt should take about 5 minutes to complete. Once this is done, the game play should last about 30 minutes & will present with different scenes. These scenes will show situations that may trigger smoking urges such as walking into a room where another person is smoking. In the game, the participant will be able to use different ways of coping with urges to smoke such as taking several deep breaths or listening to music. The participant will be asked to talk aloud about what they think of the game. The participant will be video &/or audio recorded while doing this. Once finished testing the game, we will then ask you a few questions about what you thought of the game. We will also ask you how relevant different situations are to you as a smoker or someone who is trying to avoid smoking. The entire visit is expected to last about 1.5 hours."
