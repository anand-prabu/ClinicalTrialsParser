However, NSBB has some limitation to apply clinically because of poor\n      response rate and compliance.\n\n      Recent literature has supported the role of bacterial translocation as a mediator of\n      splanchnic vasodilatation and portal hypertension. This stimulates the release of\n      pro-inflammatory cytokines and the activation of the vasodilator NO resulting in a more\n      pronounced deterioration of the baseline hyperdynamic circulatory state. Selective gut\n      decontamination with Rifaximin can induce inhibition of bacterial translocation and\n      associated worsening of portal hypertension. The investigators hypothesized that Rifaximin\n      plus NSBB could result in decrease of portal pressure in cirrhotic patients with esophageal\n      varices."
