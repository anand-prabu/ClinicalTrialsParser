If the safety profile is deemed appropriate, the study will continue to\n      explore the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine in healthy South African infants.\n\n      The primary safety hypothesis is that the P2-VP8 subunit rotavirus vaccine is safe and\n      well-tolerated in healthy toddlers and infants.  The primary immunogenicity hypothesis is\n      that the P2-VP8 subunit rotavirus vaccine is immunogenic in infant participants and will\n      induce an immune response in at least 80% of participants in at least one of the study\n      groups."
