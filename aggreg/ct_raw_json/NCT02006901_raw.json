Lumbar spinal stenosis is the most frequent indication for\n      spinal surgery in the elderly, and as the oldest segment of the population continues to grow\n      its prevalence is likely to increase. However, data on surgical outcomes are limited. Open\n      or wide decompressive laminectomy, often combined with medial facetectomy and foraminotomy,\n      was formerly the standard treatment. In recent years a growing tendency towards less\n      invasive decompressive procedures has emerged. Many spine surgeons today perform\n      microdecompression for central lumbar spinal stenosis.\n\n      Prospectively registered treatment and outcome data are obtained from the Norwegian Registry\n      for Spine Surgery (NORspine)."
