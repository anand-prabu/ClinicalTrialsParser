Nonetheless, mature gametocytes may persist after treatment, contributing to\n      malaria transmission. Conversely, artemisinin resistance is confirmed in South-east Asia,\n      and it may spread to Africa. New control tools have to be integrated to sustain the gained\n      successes, further reduce transmission and curb the spread of resistance.\n\n      Primaquine has strong gametocytocidal effect against mature gametocytes and when added to\n      schizonticidal drugs such as artemether-lumefantrine (AL), it rapidly shorten gametocytes\n      carriage duration, halting disease transmission. Nonetheless, its wide scale use has been\n      hampered by a dose-dependent acute hemolytic anemia it causes in glucose-6-phosphate\n      dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient individuals. Conversely, Artemisinins potentiate primaquine\n      activities, thus a low dose of primaquine would be able to clear falciparum gametocytes.\n\n      The World Health Organization recommends addition of 0.25 mg/kg single-dose primaquine to\n      Artemisinin based combination therapies in malaria endemic areas including Africa without\n      testing for G6PD status. Nonetheless, the recommendation, relies on historical data from\n      South-East Asia and among African Americans in the United States. Therefore, this study\n      plans to assess safety and efficacy of 0.25 mg/kg single-dose primaquine added to a standard\n      AL treatment against P. falciparum gametocytes clearance among patients with uncomplicated\n      malaria aged 1 year and above regardless of their G6PD status.."
