General anesthesia can affect on pattern of\n      electroencephalograph. Previous studies showed that patients received BIS guided anesthesia\n      could wake up faster, earlier extubation and stay in recovery room shorter compared to\n      standard general anesthesia. Optimized level of  anesthesia by BIS could reduce cognitive\n      dysfunction in elderly patients and reduce biological marker of brain injury. Therefore, the\n      investigators hypothesized that adjustment of general anesthesia by BIS guided could protect\n      central nervous system and reduce incidence of postoperative delirium."
