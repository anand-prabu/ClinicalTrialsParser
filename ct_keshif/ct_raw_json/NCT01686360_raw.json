These outcomes will be measured using self-reported questionnaire\n      items.\n\n      In this project, the investigators will compare alternative communication strategies to\n      determine which strategy or strategies result in the greatest level of understanding. The\n      investigators also will examine if the various strategies differentially affect the primary\n      outcomes listed above."
