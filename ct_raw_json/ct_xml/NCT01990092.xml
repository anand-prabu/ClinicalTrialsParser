      The objectives of the MEDIAN study are to evaluate the short-term and long-term safety and
      nutritional benefits of Metanx® versus placebo in subjects with mild to moderate diabetic
      peripheral neuropathy (DPN).  Short-term effects will be evaluated during the first 16 weeks
      of treatment, and long-term effects will be evaluated over the duration of a 48 week
      treatment period.
