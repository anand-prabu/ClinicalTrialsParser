Patients will be randomized into\n      one of two treatment groups:  Vedera KXS combined with corneal collagen cross-linking or\n      collagen cross-linking alone.  The Vedera KXS procedure performs a controlled application of\n      microwave energy in an annular configuration.  The goal of this procedure is to reshape the\n      cornea to flatten the cornea and improve corneal topography in patients with keratoconus.\n      The primary goal of collagen crosslinking is to stabilize the corneal shape in keratoconus\n      and prevent progression of the disease.  Moreover, investigations of crosslinking have shown\n      the procedure not only to decrease keratoconus progression, but also to decrease the\n      steepness of the cone and improve uncorrected and best corrected visual acuity in some\n      cases. Since the mechanism of improvement differs between the procedures, this study will\n      compare the combined microwave/crosslinking treatment to crosslinking alone."
