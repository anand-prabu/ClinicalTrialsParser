  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overaccumulation of apolipoprotein (apo)B-48-containing lipoproteins of intestinal
      origin observed in patients with insulin-resistance is now thought to be attributable to
      both elevated intestinal production and reduced clearance of these lipoproteins. Substantial
      evidence exists indicating that elevated plasma levels of these lipoproteins are associated
      with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Therefore, reduction of atherogenic plasma
      TRL levels of intestinal origin appears to be crucial to improve CVD risk associated with
      insulin-resistance. In this regard, there is some evidence that the clinical recommendation
      to replace dietary saturated fatty acids (SFAs) by n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)
      reduces CVD risk in the general population. Although the beneficial impact of n-6 PUFAs on
      CVD risk has been related primarily to favorable changes in plasma LDL-cholesterol levels,
      recent data suggest that chronic n-6 PUFA consumption may also exert beneficial effects on
      CVD risk by reducing postprandial lipemia. The impact of substituting SFAs by n-6 PUFAs on
      postprandial lipid response may be of even greater significance in dyslipidemic patients
      with insulin-resistance among whom intestinal triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs)
      represent a large proportion of the atherogenic lipoproteins. The general objective of the
      proposed research is to investigate how dietary n-6 PUFAs in place of SFAs modify intestinal
      lipoprotein metabolism in men with dyslipidemia associated with insulin-resistance. The
      investigators hypothesize that the intestinal secretion of apoB-48-containing lipoproteins
      will be lower following a diet rich in n-6 PUFAs than after consuming a diet rich in SFAs.
      The investigators also hypothesize that substitution of SFAs by n-6 PUFAs will be associated
      with significant alterations in expression of key genes and proteins involved in intestinal
      lipoprotein metabolism.
