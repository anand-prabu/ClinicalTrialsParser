Treatments A and B include delavirdine, 1 of 2\n      doses of indinavir, and 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) to which the\n      patient has not been exposed. Treatment C includes ritonavir, indinavir, and 2 NRTIs to\n      which the patient has not been exposed. When virologic failure is first observed, the\n      patient must return in 2 weeks for confirmation of failure and start the salvage regimen\n      within 1 month of the first assay in which failure was observed. Patients who have less than\n      400 copies/ml HIV RNA after 16 weeks of therapy are considered responders and continue on\n      the study. Those who have more than 400 copies/ml after 16 weeks of therapy are considered\n      nonresponders and should be discontinued from the study. In addition, patients who respond\n      and subsequently rebound with a viral load 0.5 log above the nadir and greater than 400\n      copies/ml on 2 consecutive assays at least 2 weeks apart are considered treatment failures\n      and should be discontinued from the study. Patients have regular physical exams, as well as\n      virologic, immunologic, and pharmacokinetic assessments."
