People with metabolic syndrome have\n      an increased risk for the development of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and\n      diabetes.  Recent studies have shown that a build-up of fat in the muscle of overweight and\n      obese people may partially explain the link between metabolic syndrome and the development\n      of chronic diseases. There is evidence to suggest that diets with a higher amount of protein\n      can improve some aspects of metabolic syndrome, including the build-up of fat in muscle. The\n      purpose of this study is to examine the effects of eating a larger amount of dairy-based\n      protein on risk factors for metabolic syndrome."
