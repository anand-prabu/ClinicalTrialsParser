Areas of abnormal focal uptake will be documented. These areas of abnormal uptake will be compared with cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI)to confirm the presence of lesions. The images from 111In- penteoctreotide Scintigraphy will be reported independently by another experienced nuclear medicine physician."
