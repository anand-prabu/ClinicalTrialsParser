Patients achieving a partial response, complete response with\n      recurrence, or stable disease may receive further therapy.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of monoclonal antibody HuM291 until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed weekly for 1 month and then monthly for 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-15 patients will be accrued for this study."
