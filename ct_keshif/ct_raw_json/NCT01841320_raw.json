The intervention will seek and test IDUs and their network members in\n      the community, particularly those who are recently released from drug treatment centers.\n      HIV-positive IDUs will be referred to HIV care through a two arm randomized controlled trial\n      to compare the effects of different levels of engagement in care on ART uptake,\n      antiretroviral adherence, and treatment outcome."
