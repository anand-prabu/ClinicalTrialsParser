  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergency departments are established in 20 hospitals in Denmark in order to improve the
      quality for the acute patients.

      A group of acute patients which require timely assessment and plan from a specialist is
      patients with abdominal pain.

      the aim of the present study is to evaluate whether the admission of the group of patients
      to emergency departments reduces the time to doctor, specialist and plan compared to the
      traditional admission to a surgical acute ward.
