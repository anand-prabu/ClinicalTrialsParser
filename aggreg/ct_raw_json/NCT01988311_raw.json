Effects of psilocybin on psychological function: This version of the pilot study will\n           involve 1 or 2 day-long psilocybin sessions, and several meetings and data assessment\n           visits. You will make a total of about 5 to 10 visits to our research unit (the BPRU on\n           the Johns Hopkins Bayview Campus).\n\n        2. Performance on behavioral and cognitive tasks: This version of the pilot study will\n           involve completing various behavioral and cognitive tasks at our research unit.  You\n           will make a total of about 1-10 visits to our research unit (the BPRU on the Johns\n           Hopkins Bayview Campus).\n\n        3. Brain functioning: This version of the study will involve 1 to 3 brain imaging (MRI)\n           measurements. You will make a total of about 2 to 5 visits to our research unit (the\n           BPRU on the Johns Hopkins Bayview Campus). The MRI measurements will be taken at the\n           F.M. Kirby Research Center at the Kennedy Krieger Institute (across the street from the\n           Johns Hopkins Hospital).\n\n      People who are between the ages of 25 and 80 years old, who have a current, regular\n      meditation practice, and who meet the medical requirements may join."
