About 25% of patients have the opportunity for radically surgical resection when\n      diagnosis. However, the recurrence rate is up to 85% within 2 years. Data from clinical\n      trials indicated that gemcitabine-based adjuvant chemotherapy reduced recurrence and\n      enhanced overall survival for patients who have undergone surgery to remove their tumor.\n      Nab-paclitaxel could enhance the intratumoral concentration of gemcitabine; recent studies\n      showed that nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine significantly improved progression-free survival\n      and overall survival of metastatic pancreatic cancer patients. The present study is intended\n      to investigate the activity and safety of the combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel\n      as adjuvant chemotherapy in treating patients with pancreatic cancer after curative\n      resection."
