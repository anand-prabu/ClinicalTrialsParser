            "textblock": "Background:  Several lines of investigation indicate there to be potential beneficial\n      effects of interventions that augment cerebral blood flow (CBF) to irrigate the ischemic\n      penumbra in acute ischemic stroke.  The simplest manner to do this is to place the patient\n      in a 'flat down' rather than upright head position.  However, any potential benefits on the\n      brain may be offset by an increased hazard of aspiration pneumonia or exacerbation of\n      cardiac failure in vulnerable patients.  Given uncertainty over the balance of potential\n      modest benefits and risks, and variability regarding the ideal head position policy for\n      patients with acute ischemic stroke around the world, reliable randomized evidence is\n      required to standardize clinical practice.\n\n      Aims:  The main objectives of this pilot phase clinical trial are  to determine the\n      feasibility, safety and potential efficacy of a large-scale cluster randomized clinical\n      trial to assess whether a simple nursing care policy - 'flat down head position' - provides\n      beneficial effects as compared to the standard upright head position in patients with acute\n      ischemic stroke.  The main efficacy outcome of the pilot phase is demonstration of increased\n      mean cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) in the flat down compared to the upright head\n      position, as assessed by transcranial Doppler (TCD) to the medial cerebral arteries of\n      patients with anterior circulation infarction.  Secondary efficacy objectives are to\n      demonstrate that the flat down head position improves neurological status at 7 days and\n      disability at 90 days.\n\n      Methods:  Inclusion criteria include consecutive adult patients with acute ischemic stroke\n      within 12 hours of onset admitted to participating centers.  A cluster (month) method of\n      randomization to flat down or upright head position for 48 hours, stratified by site  The\n      primary outcome is change in mean CBFV measured by TCD at 24 hours.  Secondary outcomes\n      include proportion of adverse events at 7 days, distribution of NIHSS at 7 days, and\n      distribution of mRS disability scale scores at 90 days.  Sample size is 16 clusters of 12\n      patients totaling approximately 200 patients to detect an increase of 8.3 (\u00b117) cm/sec in\n      average CBFV from 30\u00b0 to 0\u00b0 head position.  This sample size will also allow detection of a\n      30% increase in average CBFV from baseline with 80% power at a 5% significance level."
