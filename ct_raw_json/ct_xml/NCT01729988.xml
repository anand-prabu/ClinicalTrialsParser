  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to assess the effectiveness, safety and feasibility of carotid body
      removal in patients with high blood pressure (hypertension) resistant to medical treatment.
      Patients with high blood pressure are at significant risk of medical complications including
      stroke and heart disease.  The principle research question is whether removal of the carotid
      body will lead to an improvement in the blood pressure of this patient group.

    <description>This surgery does not involve any study drug or investigational device.
The carotid body will be removed by the so called 'lateral approach' or a combined 'lateral and medial approach'. In all cases the target area was defined as the tissue in between the ECA and ICA, up to 5-6mm above the bifurcation point of the common carotid artery into the ECA and ICA. In a lateral approach the carotid bifurcation is not turned. A combined approach includes usually dissection of the superior thyroid vessel and turning of the carotid bifurcation.</description>
