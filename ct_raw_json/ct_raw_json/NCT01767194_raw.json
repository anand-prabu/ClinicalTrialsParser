Drugs used in chemotherapy, such\n      as irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of\n      tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Temsirolimus may\n      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.\n      Monoclonal antibodies, such as monoclonal antibody Ch14.18, can block tumor growth in\n      different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor\n      cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known\n      whether giving irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide together with temsirolimus or\n      monoclonal antibody Ch14.18 is more effective in treating neuroblastoma."
