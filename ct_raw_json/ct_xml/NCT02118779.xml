  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myotonic dystrophy type1 (DM1) is a rare, inherited, chronic progressive disease as well as
      an autosomal dominant multisystemic disorder. It is the most common adult form of muscular
      dystrophy, with a prevalence of approximately 10 per 100,000 people affected. With 733
      million people in Europe, we estimate that 75,000 people are DM1 patients in Europe.

      The aim of OPTIMISTIC is to improve clinical practice in the management of patients with
      this rare disease for which no dedicated treatment is currently available. OPTIMISTIC is a
      multi-centre, randomised controlled trial designed to compare a two component tailored
      behavioural change intervention to increase physical activity against standard patient
      management regimes, with particular attention given to the definition of appropriate outcome
      measures and new clinical guidelines for DM1 management. The two components of the
      intervention are 1) cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and 2) graded physical activity and
      we will evaluate the intervention's effectiveness and safety against standard patient
      management.

      Participants will be recruited from myotonic dystrophy clinics and neuromuscular centres in
      France, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK. A total of 286 male and female patients aged 18
      years and older with genetically proven classical or adult DM1 suffering from severe fatigue
      (only DM1 patients with a CIS subscale fatigue score &gt; 35 are likely to benefit from the
      intervention), able to walk independently and able to complete the trial interventions will
      be included.

      A key objective of OPTIMISTIC is to provide outcome measures that are relevant for the
      patients and have a rate of change that is appropriate for a clinical trial timeframe. In
      addition, OPTIMISTIC will identify genetic factors that predict outcome and potential
      biomarkers as surrogate outcome measures that best explain the observed clinical variation.

      Background DM1 is a rare, inherited, progressive disease as well as an autosomal dominant
      multisystemic disorder. It is the most common adult form of muscular dystrophy, with a
      prevalence of approximately 10 per 100,000 people affected. With 733 million people in
      Europe, we estimate that 75,000 people are DM1 patients in Europe. Typical symptoms of the
      disease include progressive muscle weakness and wasting from distal to proximal, ptosis,
      weakness of facial, jaw and anterior neck muscles, myotonia, daytime sleepiness, fatigue and
      cataract. Other symptoms of adult DM1 include cardiac conduction defects, as well as
      endocrine, gastrointestinal and cognitive dysfunction. DM1 is one of the most variable human
      diseases, has complex, multisystemic and progressively worsening clinical manifestations and
      leads to severe physical impairment, restricted social participation and premature death.

      There is no pharmaceutical treatment for causal or symptomatic relief of DM1 core symptoms
      (with the exception of Modafinil for excessive daytime sleepiness). Thus the aim of
      treatment is to relieve impairments, reduce limitations and optimise participation. Physical
      activity has been acknowledged as an important factor for health in general. For patients
      with a slowly progressive neuromuscular disease, such as DM1, there is accumulating evidence
      for prescribing low-to-moderate-intensity strength and aerobic exercise training, and an
      active lifestyle. Nevertheless, recent reviews conclude that existing studies are limited in
      number and quality, and that there is a need for disease-specific, randomised, controlled
      trials investigating the effect on quality of life.

      RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY It was demonstrated recently by an OPTIMISTIC research partner that
      severe fatigue, defined as a score equal to or higher than 35 on the subscale fatigue of the
      Checklist Individual Strength (CIS-fatigue), was reported by around 70% of patients with
      DM1. These severely fatigued patients had more problems with physical and social functioning
      as well as with their mental and general health than similar patients without severe
      fatigue. They also had more problems with concentration and planning. As such, experienced
      fatigue should be clearly distinguished from muscle weakness, which is probably the most
      common and characteristic symptom of DM1 and also of a lack of initiative (apathy) that is
      known to occur often in DM1.

      In a longitudinal study, we built a model of perpetuating factors for fatigue in patients
      with DM1.  It appeared that lack of physical activity, sleep disturbances and pain all
      contributed to experienced fatigue. In addition, loss of muscle strength and pain
      contributed to fatigue through a lower level of physical activity. Ultimately, experienced
      fatigue and physical activity both contributed to the level of societal participation. A
      lack of initiative further increased fatigue but also had a direct negative effect on
      societal participation. Thus, theoretically, in order to improve societal participation one
      should compensate for a reduced initiative, optimise physical activity and alleviate
      experienced fatigue. To alleviate fatigue one should address the fatigue maintaining factors
      identified by the model, e.g. experience of pain or sleep disorders.

      The main rationale for the combination of CBT and physical activity is based on our
      DM1-specific model. The DM1-specific model shows that physical activity, experienced fatigue
      and lack of initiative are the main determinants of DM1 health status. OPTIMISTIC is the
      first model-based clinical trial in DM1. It evaluates the effect, and the maintenance of
      effects, of CBT combined with exercise training on the reduction of chronic fatigue in
      patients with DM1.

      Importantly, the intervention will also involve caregivers where they are willing to take
      part. The disabilities associated with DM1 put considerable strain on caregivers and can
      also lead to a negative interaction with the patient. The intervention will aim to support
      caregivers by installing realistic expectations about what can be expected from the patient,
      teach caregivers how to help patients to stay as self-reliant as possible and also reduce
      caregivers strain by taking time for themselves.  If a DM1 patient has no caregiver or
      significant other, or no caregiver or significant other willing to take part in the study,
      the patient will not be excluded from the study. All patients will be asked if the study
      team could approach them to inform them for further research. This contact does not
      constitute consent.

    <description>The intervention is cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT).  The CBT consists of six different modules. All patients will start with individual goal setting and psycho-education about the role of cognitive-behavioural variables in the disabilities patients' experience. The patient formulates his or her treatment goals in concrete terms and later on in the therapy the goals are realised step by step by the patient. The treatment is tailored to the patient's problems: which of the six modules a patient will receive is dependent on the scores on measures that have been collected at baseline assessment. Based on our previous experience with modular interventions we expect that most patients will receive less than four modules.</description>
