            "textblock": "Bevacizumab (called also Avastin \u00ae) is a medicine preventing the creation of new blood\n      vessels (a process called \"angiogenesis\"). This can reduce blood flow of the tumor and then\n      decreasing the contribution of nutriments and oxygen to the  cancer cells and prevent the\n      tumor from growing.\n\n      In various types of cancers, as lung, breast, colorectal and renal cancer, addition of the\n      bevacizumab to chemotherapy allowed to improve the disease outcome. The bevacizumab already\n      benefits from a marketing authorization (MMA) for these various types of cancers.\n\n      The bevacizumab has also obtained MMA for the treatment of the ovarian cancer in its most\n      frequent histological form (ovarian carcinoma). Clinical trials conducted in this indication\n      demonstrated the importance to pursue the treatment by bevacizumab after the chemotherapy is\n      ended.\n\n      This anti-angiogenic medicine is thought to be of a potential interest in sex cords- stromal\n      since this   tumors are very well vascularized.\n\n      The ALIENOR study aims to explore  the interest and the clinical benefit of associating\n      bevacizumab to the paclitaxel  in order  to treat  patients suffering from recurring sex\n      cords- stromal tumor treated beforehand by platinum chemotherapy"
