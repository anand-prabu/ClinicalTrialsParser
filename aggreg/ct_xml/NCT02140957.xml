  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observational studies support an association between bottle feeding beyond 15 to 18 months
      of age and lower socioeconomic status, excessive milk intake, dental caries, iron
      deficiency, behavioral issues and obesity. Yet many parents, particularly those from low
      socioeconomic households, choose to feed their children by bottle much beyond this age.
      Recognizing the need for further educational interventions for bottle feeding, the TARGet
      Kids! Research Collaboration recently developed a 5-minute bottle weaning educational
      intervention for the 9 month well-child visit. We undertook a pragmatic randomized
      controlled trial to evaluate its effectiveness involving 251 children recruited through
      TARGet Kids! (PMID: 20624802) We hypothesize that by 7 years of age, children randomized to
      the bottle weaning intervention will have better oral health status, higher iron stores,
      lower body mass index (BMI), and fewer behavioral issues. If the 5 minute bottle weaning
      educational intervention should demonstrate lasting effects on health at 7 years of age,
      this simple intervention could have important implications for the long term health and
      development of Canadian children.

    <description>Parents of children in both intervention and control groups received standardized counseling on healthy nutrition based on Canadian Paediatric Society guidelines. In addition, during the same 9-month doctors visit, parents of infants allocated to the intervention group were given a sip cup (Avent Magic CupTM) and shown how to use it.  A trained research assistant told intervention group parents the risks of continued bottle use. They were also instructed to limit daily milk consumption to 16 ounces.  Parents were also counseled to discontinue bottle use in the next 1 week using a step-wise protocol described on a handout to be placed on their refrigerator. Parents of infants allocated to the control group did not receive this information.</description>
