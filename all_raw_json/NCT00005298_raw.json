            "textblock": "BACKGROUND:\n\n      Asthma and chronic bronchitis are among the most common chronic diseases afflicting\n      middle-aged and elderly adults in the United States, respectively occurring in 4 percent and\n      5 percent of the population in these age groups.  While chronic bronchitis is often caused\n      by cigarette smoking and asthma often occurs in nonsmokers in association with atopy, the\n      two conditions may be difficult to differentiate in many middle-aged and older adults and\n      may share a number of pathophysiologic features including increased airway smooth muscle\n      tone, increased airway responsiveness to bronchoconstricting stimuli, and bronchial mucus\n      hypersecretion.  The precise mechanisms which produce the alterations of airway function are\n      not clear.  Such functional alterations may be caused by airway inflammation and\n      abnormalities of the autonomic nervous system;  however, there are little population data\n      available regarding the importance of airway inflammation and disordered neural regulation\n      in the pathogenesis of airway hyperresponsiveness and mucus hypersecretion.  Also, little is\n      known about potential interactions between airway inflammation and disordered neural\n      regulation of airway function in the pathogenesis of chronic airways disease.  Information\n      on the relationships may offer insights into the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying\n      asthma and chronic bronchitis in adults.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      The study was cross-sectional and used a subgroup of the Normative Aging Study, a\n      longitudinal study of aging in men established by the Veterans Administration in 1963.  The\n      study used data normally collected during NAS examinations and included smoking history,\n      socio-economic status, anthropometry, respiratory symptoms and illnesses, and pulmonary\n      function.  New data were collected on: indices of inflammation as indicated by histamine,\n      leukotriene, and serotonin in urine; autonomic activity as indicated by urinary\n      catecholamine excretion and heart rate variation induced by deep breathing; autonomic\n      responsiveness as measured by pupillary alpha-adrenergic and cholinergic responses."
