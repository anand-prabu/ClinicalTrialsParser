A further objective of this\n      pilot study is to identify which outcomes are being affected by the intervention. Past\n      research has highlighted psychoeducational intervention (i.e., interventions including both\n      educational/skills-building components and psychological support) as most effective in terms\n      of impacting caregiver functioning. The current study will recruit 44 caregivers and their\n      children with SCI. All caregivers will participate in a 2-day Parent Forum, an in-person\n      educational session. Caregivers will then be randomly assigned to receive monthly phone\n      calls from a mental health professional (\"intervention group\") or no additional targeted\n      support (\"control group\"). We expect that caregivers who participate in the intervention\n      group and their children will demonstrate better outcomes than caregivers in the control\n      group and their children."
