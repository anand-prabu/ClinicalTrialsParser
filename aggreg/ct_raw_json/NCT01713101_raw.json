Although a recent meta-analysis done by Cochrane\n      review group concluded that it improves patient survival, other review articles including\n      \"Gut\" suggested that a well-designed clinical study is needed for re-evaluation of the\n      efficacy and safety of the drug in current clinical situation. We hypothesized that early\n      administration of the drug will significantly decrease the proportion of patient requiring\n      early endoscopic treatment."
