            "textblock": "Despite major advances in the treatment of mood disorders, depression remains a serious\n      public health problem. Delayed onset of response and lack of efficacy in a significant\n      portion of patients are the limitations of pharmacotherapy. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)\n      has been shown to provide fast amelioration of depressive symptoms and its efficacy is\n      reported to be 65 to 85%. However, one of the main limiting factors for its use is the\n      cognitive impairment, which is directly related to the number of ECT sessions.\n\n      There is increased evidence for the mediation of glutamate in the pathophysiology of\n      depression, as suggested by the potential antidepressant effect of drugs that modulate\n      glutamate transmission. Open studies and recent case reports demonstrate a rapid\n      antidepressant effect of intravenous ketamine - a non-competitive antagonist at the\n      glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Ketamine is a general anesthetic used\n      commonly for procedural sedation. Ketamine has no anticonvulsant properties. It is used as\n      an alternative to methohexital - a barbiturate with anticonvulsant properties - in patients\n      with high seizure threshold. A recent open non-randomized trial by Okamoto shows a faster\n      response when ECT is given with ketamine anesthesia.  In a recent review Gregory-Roberts et\n      al suggest that available evidence in animals and humans supports the prediction that\n      ketamine could effectively prevent ECT -induced persistent retrograde amnesia and improve or\n      hasten therapeutic response.\n\n      We propose a double-blind randomized controlled pilot study to measure both therapeutic\n      efficacy and cognitive side effects of ECT using ketamine compared to methohexital - the\n      gold standard anesthetic in ECT - in depressed patients.\n\n      Thirty patients who are scheduled to receive an acute course of ECT for major depressive\n      episode. Inpatients and outpatients will be screened by the ECT psychiatrists who\n      participate in this study. Patients who are able and willing to provide written informed\n      consent will be randomly assigned on a 1:1 ratio to receive either a course of bifrontal ECT\n      using ketamine 1-2 mg/kg or methohexital anesthesia0.5-1.0 mg/kg.  Subjects will receive a\n      standard acute course of ECT (3X/week. Raters and subjects will be masked to group\n      assignment."
