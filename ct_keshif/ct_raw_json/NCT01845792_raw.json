            "textblock": "Abiraterone acetate and cabazitaxel have been approved by the United States Food and Drug\n      Administration (FDA) to treat prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body\n      such as the lymph nodes or bone.  These drugs are approved individually for use when the\n      cancer has become resistant to other treatments, including chemotherapy with docetaxel.  The\n      combination of these two drugs has not been approved, so the research team will study the\n      safety and effectiveness of the combination.\n\n      Patients are being asked to participate in this study because their tumor has grown or\n      spread during therapy.  Patients may benefit from a new combination of drugs to treat it.\n      Abiraterone acetate and prednisone have been shown to prevent the growth of prostate cancer\n      cells by lowering the level of testosterone in the blood.  It works in different areas of\n      the body to block the production of this hormone that signals the cancer cells to grow.\n      Cabazitaxel and prednisone prevent cancer cells from growing by blocking certain structures\n      from functioning properly in the cell.  These structures help cells divide and therefore\n      grow.  By blocking their function, the cell will not be able to divide and will die."
