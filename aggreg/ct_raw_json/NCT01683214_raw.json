BNA\n      allows to identify patterns of activation in brain networks and to track their changes over\n      time.  The investigators want to examine the possible role of brain network activation (BNA)\n      in the diagnosis of mood disorders and predicting improvement over time.  The procedure\n      conducted with patients diagnosed with a mood disorder will be compared to people who do not\n      have a mood disorder."
