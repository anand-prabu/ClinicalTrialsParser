    <textblock>
      Accurate measurement of core body temperature at the scene of an accident is critical for
      both diagnosis and treatment/triage decisions for hypothermic patients. Measurement in the
      lower third of the oesophagus is considered the gold standard of CT reading, but invasive
      and hardly applicable with a conscious patient. Tympanic membrane sensors for CT reading
      have been widely tested by may be unreliable in extreme environmental temperatures.
      Similarly, the Double Sensor device is a non-invasive device and is promising for
      prehospital use but has not been sufficiently verified under very cold and hot environmental
      conditions. Furthermore, comparisons of different non-invasive methods with oesophageal
      measurement in extreme conditions are lacking. The objective of these studies is to compare
      different techniques of core body temperature measurement with exposure to cold and hot
      environments.
