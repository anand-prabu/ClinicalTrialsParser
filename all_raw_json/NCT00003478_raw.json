Each patient then receives a therapeutic dose by the most\n      efficient method. Both methods are delivered via a stereotactically-placed intralesional\n      catheter.\n\n        -  Arm I: Bolus injection method\n\n        -  Arm II: Microinfusion delivery method Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses\n           of I 131 MAb 81C6, with dose escalation occurring separately for each arm. After 10\n           patients are enrolled and the best method of administration is determined, all\n           subsequent patients receive I 131 MAb 81C6 by that method, and the maximum tolerated\n           dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more the 2 of 6\n           patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients with newly diagnosed tumors for which no effective conventional therapy exists,\n      such as malignant glial tumors, are treated with external beam radiotherapy within 4 months\n      after I 131 MAb 81C6 infusion. Patients with recurrent tumors receive no other therapy\n      unless tumor progresses.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4, 8, 16, and 24 weeks and then every 12 weeks for one year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 10 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
