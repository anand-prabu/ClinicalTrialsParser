The T-cell depleted\n      haplo-identical stems cells are intended to facilitate early, short-term myeloid engraftment\n      with the primary goal of minimizing early infections and other non-relapse mortality while\n      the UUCB cells engraft as the durable and permanent graft. Patients with high risk or\n      refractory malignancies, or non-malignant disorders amenable to stem cell transplantation\n      therapy but lacking conventional related or unrelated donors will be eligible for this\n      protocol."

Patients who do not have a\n             single UCB unit that will deliver the minimum required cell dose, two partially\n             HLA-matched UCB units which together meet the minimum cell dose requirement, can be\n             used for 1 transplant.  These units must be HLA-matched minimally at 4 of 6 HLA-A and\n             B (at intermediate resolution by molecular typing) and DRB1 (at high resolution by\n             molecular typing) loci with the patient, and HLA-matched at 3 of 6 HLA- A, B, DRB1\n             loci with each other (using same resolution of HLA typing as indicated above).  There\n             is no limitation on maximum cell dose.\n\n          -  Have a high risk or refractory malignancy, or non-malignant disorder amenable to stem\n             cell transplantation therapy.\n\n          -  Meet eligibility requirements for allogeneic transplant per institutional standard\n             practices.\n\n          -  Have given written informed consent according to FDA guidelines (or consent of\n             parent/legal guardian as applicable).\n\n          -  Be <65 years of age at the time of study enrollment.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Have a consenting 8/8 or 10/10 allele matched, consenting, related or unrelated\n             hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) donor.\n\n          -  Have a life expectancy of less than 3 months.\n\n          -  Have uncontrolled infections at time of cytoreduction."
