Fluid requirements will be calculated according to the Parkland Formula with 50% administered during the first 8 hours and the second 50% administered over the next 16 hours. During the first 2 hours IV fluids will be started at the Parkland goal minus 250cc, which will be administered using Ceralyte via oral, NG, or dobhoff tube. ORT and IV fluids will be monitored with additional doses given hourly. Urine output will be monitored hourly and gastric residuals will be monitored every 2 hours, with adjustments made as needed to ensure adequate fluid resuscitation."

            "textblock": "In patients with moderate to severe thermal injuries (> 20% TBSA) adequate fluid\n      resuscitation is the main priority to achieve successful outcomes. Soon after burn injury\n      substantial amounts of fluid accumulate rapidly in the wound while more is lost in the third\n      space. Without intervention this process leads to hypotension and shock. The Parkland\n      formula was devised to calculate how much intravenous (IV) fluid, i.e. crystalloids, is\n      needed for adequate resuscitation during the first 24 hours post-burn. However, IV\n      resuscitation can lead to overexpansion of (third space) volume, leading to severe\n      complications such as compartment syndrome or pulmonary edema.\n\n      In major population centers, catastrophic events causing mass casualties will disrupt many\n      hospital and emergency services, potentially delaying acute IV fluid resuscitation. Burn\n      patient case reports have shown that oral rehydration therapy (ORT) used to supplement or in\n      place of IV therapy is efficacious. ORT could be easily applied in mass burn casualties.\n\n      ORT is generally known in the third world for treating life-threatening dehydration due to\n      diarrhea. The glucose-sodium co transport mechanism enables the affected human intestine to\n      absorb a sufficient amount of water and electrolytes to replace large fluid losses due to\n      severe diarrhea, even under adverse field conditions. No electrolyte disturbances have been\n      recorded in such cases. Studies on enteral resuscitation in animal burn models showed high\n      rates of small intestinal absorption which should be adequate for resuscitation following\n      major burn injury.\n\n      The optimal composition of oral rehydration solution for resuscitation in burn wounds has\n      not been determined. In cholera patients, Ceralyte\u00ae has proven superior to the WHO Oral\n      Rehydration Solution, increasing fluid absorption of the intestine. The Ceralyte\u00ae 90\n      solution, with 90mEq/L sodium and a low osmolarity of <275mOsm, may also contribute to\n      optimal intestinal fluid uptake without causing electrolyte disturbances in thermal injury.\n      ORT use might reduce the occurrence of compartment syndrome and pulmonary edema since fluid\n      is regulated by the intestine according to physiologic requirements. The investigators\n      propose to conduct a prospective study using Ceralyte\u00ae 90 to show that oral resuscitation\n      therapy (ORT) in burns can reduce the total amount of IV fluid needed for adequate\n      resuscitation and to test the efficacy and safety of ORT in the resuscitation of burn\n      patients."
