  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a managed care-based HPV
      vaccination reminder/recall system using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) across diverse
      practices and patient populations.  The trial will measure the effectiveness of text
      messaging reminder/recall on (a) improving initiation and (b) completion rate of the HPV
      vaccine series; (c) decreasing the time between vaccine doses; and (d) improving rates of
      preventive visits for adolescents

      The hypotheses are that text-messaged reminders to parents of adolescents will result in
      improved rates of HPV vaccine series initiation, HPV vaccine series completion, will
      decrease the intervals between vaccine doses and will improve rates of preventive care among
      adolescents.  Parents receiving specific text-messaged reminders about services (i.e. HPV
      vaccination, well child care visits) for which their adolescent is due will be compared to a
      control group of parents receiving general health tips through text messages.

    <textblock>
      The study setting is western New York State and the Southern Tier of New York State (15
      counties total).  Investigators will work with the Monroe Plan for Medical Care, an
      IPA-model managed care organization (MCO) that serves  Medicaid managed care and SCHIP
      enrollees.  The MCO will conduct regular reviews of insurance claims data and the New York
      State Immunization Information System of adolescents ages 11-&lt;18 years.  Parents (all over
      18 years of age) of adolescents will receive the texted messages on their phones.

      There are no enrollment restrictions based upon race or ethnic origin. The inclusion
      criteria are that the adolescents are a) enrolled in Medicaid or SCHIP through the Monroe
      Plan, b) have been enrolled greater than 6 months with the Monroe Plan (in order to have
      sufficient claims data to determine whether they are due for a well child care visit or
      recommended immunizations), c) the Monroe Plan has received their consent to send preventive
      care text messages, d)  their child attend a primary care practice that has agreed to
      participate and d) they are between the ages of 11-&lt;18 years at the start of the study.

      The key independent measure is group allocation (intervention vs. control); an
      intention-to-treat strategy will be used to assess the effectiveness of text messaging
      reminders. Key outcome measures will be: 1) receipt of 0, 1, 2 or 3 doses of HPV vaccine 2)
      interval (in days) between doses and 3) having a preventive visit in the 6 month period.
