Rather, patients eligible for REALITY will be\n        those testing HIV positive for the first time with a low CD4 count (i.e. those delaying\n        presentation to care), or those who have defaulted before initiating ART and only return\n        to care at an advanced stage of immuno-deficiency.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Contraindications to any proposed antiretroviral drugs (including integrase\n             inhibitors), isoniazid, fluconazole, albendazole or azithromycin\n\n          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding or intending to become pregnant during the first 12 weeks\n             of the study\n\n          -  Ever known to have previously received single-dose nevirapine for prevention of\n             mother-to-child transmission (mother or child)."
