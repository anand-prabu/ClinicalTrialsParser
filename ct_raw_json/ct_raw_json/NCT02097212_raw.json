TBM entails flaccid tracheal and\n      bronchial cartilages leading to airway collapse, emanating primarily from the anterior wall\n      of the lumen. It is seen in conditions such as Relapsing Polychondritis and saber sheath\n      tracheal deformity. HDAC on the other hand is the hyper-flaccidity of the membranous portion\n      of the tracheobronchial tree leading to airway collapse. This condition is commonly seen\n      with obesity and severe emphysema. TBM and HDAC frequently coexist.\n\n      In patients with TBM/HDAC sleep disorders are common. Patients often complain of poor\n      quality sleep, snoring, daytime fatigue, and somnolence. These patients are often diagnosed\n      with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) upon workup."
