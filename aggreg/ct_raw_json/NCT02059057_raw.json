Subject has DLCO <20% of predicted.\n\n          5. Subject has severe gas exchange abnormalities as defined by:\n\n             PaCO2 >55 mm Hg PaO2 <45 mm Hg on room air (High altitude criterion: PaO2 <30 mm Hg)\n\n          6.

Subject has evidence of other severe disease (such as, but not limited to, lung\n             cancer or renal failure), which in the judgment of the investigator may compromise\n             survival of the subject for the duration of the study.\n\n         10. Subject is pregnant or lactating, or plans to become pregnant within the study\n             timeframe.\n\n         11. Subject has an inability to tolerate bronchoscopy under moderate sedation or general\n             anesthesia.\n\n         12. Subject has clinically significant bronchiectasis.\n\n         13. Subject has giant bullae >1/3 lung volume.\n\n         14. Subject has had previous LVR surgery, lung transplantation, lobectomy, LVR devices or\n             other devices to treat COPD in either lung.\n\n         15. Subject has been involved in pulmonary drug or device studies within 30 days prior to\n             this study, with the exception of the RENEW Study.\n\n         16. Subject is taking >20 mg prednisone (or equivalent dose of a similar steroid) daily.\n\n         17. Subject requires high level chronic immunomodulatory therapy to treat a moderate to\n             severe chronic inflammatory autoimmune disorder.\n\n         18. Subject is on an antiplatelet agent (such as Plavix) or anticoagulant therapy (such\n             as heparin or Coumadin) which cannot be stopped for seven (7) days prior to\n             procedure.\n\n         19. Subject has a sensitivity or allergy to Nickel.\n\n         20. Subject has a known sensitivity to drugs required to perform bronchoscopy.\n\n         21. Subject has been diagnosed with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD).\n\n         22. Subject has any other disease, condition(s) or habit(s) that would interfere with\n             completion of study and follow up assessments, would increase risks of bronchoscopy\n             or assessments, or in the judgment of the investigator would potentially interfere\n             with compliance to this study or would adversely affect study outcomes.\n\n             -"
