Vaccination in this group is given as adjuvant therapy.\n\n      Patients are assigned to receive HPV E6 or E7 peptide by the principal investigator.\n      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (antigen presenting cells) are harvested and\n      treated in vitro with sargramostim (GM-CSF) and pulsed with HPV16 E6 or E7. Patients receive\n      vaccination with HPV16 E6 or E7 pulsed PBMC IV over 1-2 minutes during weeks 1, 3, 7, and 11\n      for a total of 4 vaccinations. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete response (CR) continue treatment for a\n      maximum of 1 year past CR.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1 month.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40-46 patients (at least 28 patients for stratum A and 12 for\n      stratum B) will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years."
