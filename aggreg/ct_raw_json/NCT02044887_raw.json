A basal assessment will be\n      made and the participants will be assigned to control or intervention group (1:1).\n      Variables: The main measure will be the assessment of PA (pedometer and 7-Day PAR) in\n      patients and caregivers. In patients: ADAS-cog, functional degree and cardiovascular risk.\n      In caregivers: cardiovascular risk, general health and quality of life.\n\n      INTERVENTION: For 3 months, participants will receive instructions to do PA with an adapted\n      PA program. This program will be designed and applied by Primary Health Care professionals\n      in patients with dementia and caregivers. The control group will receive regular care.\n\n      ANALYSIS: An intention-to-treat analysis will be carried out by comparing the observed\n      differences between basal, 6 and 12 months measures. Change in the mean of daily steps\n      assessed with the pedometer and 7-day PAR will If the main hypothesis is confirmed , it\n      could be useful to improve the cardiovascular risk of all of them , as well as the cognitive\n      state of patients with dementia.."
