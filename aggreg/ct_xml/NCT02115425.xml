    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect body composition data using bioimpedance analysis
      (Samsung) and DXA (GE Medical).  Both of the methods are explained in more detail in section
      5 of this consent. The data collected will help Samsung improve the products the company
      offers.

      If you are eligible and you choose to participate in this study, you will be asked to come
      to the Bone &amp; Joint Clinic of Baton Rouge in Baton Rouge between 7:00 and 11:00 am after at
      least a two-hour fast (nothing to eat or drink besides water for 2 hours prior to your
      appointment). You will be asked not to exercise, shower, or use a steam room or sauna at
      least two hours prior to evaluation. The study visit will take approximately one hour.
      During the visit, you will complete the informed consent process and then complete the
      baseline body measurements and body composition procedures immediately afterwards. Adult
      pre-menopausal women will have a urine pregnancy test prior to evaluation.  Study procedures
      are not for diagnostic or treatment purposes and the DXA scan is intended for research
      purposes.

      Description of study procedures

      Body Measurements (about 15 minutes):

      A series of body measurements will be taken by trained staff.  These measurements include
      height, weight, and vital signs.  The weight and height measurements will be completed twice
      during this time.  The subject will wear a hospital gown and tight fitting garments for
      these procedures and the subject's BMI will be calculated from these measurements.

      Body Composition Measurements

      Whole Body DXA Scan, about 20 minutes This scan measures the amount of bone, muscle, and fat
      in your body.  The scan will be performed using a whole-body scanner.  The subject will be
      required to wear a hospital gown, to remove all metal-containing objects from the body, and
      to lie down on the table.  The subject will be carefully positioned on the table, and the
      legs will be placed together using two Velcro straps.  A scanner emitting low energy X-rays
      and a detector will pass along the body.  The subject will be asked to remain completely
      still while the scan is in progress.  The scan takes approximately ten minutes.

      Impedance Analysis (BIA) (about 10 minutes):

      These tests will measure the amount of fat in the body.  These procedures will vary
      depending on the measurement system and several different BIA systems will be used during
      this test.

      Some examples are presented in the supplementary material at the end of this protocol.

      Specifically, the following systems will be used in this study:

      Samsung Health Cover; Measure 3 times; Standing Posture

      Marketed systems:

      InBody720 (http://www.biospaceamerica.com/Product/ib720.html; measure one time; Standing
      Posture Omron 306; Measure 1 time; Standing Posture Omron 510; Measure 1 time; Standing

    <description>The study will be conducted in two overlapping phases. In Phase I, approximately 300 adult subjects (&gt;18 to 80 yrs, equal numbers of female and male) will be recruited to take part in this study as detailed below: (1) Underweight (BMI&lt;18.5 k/m2), 50 subjects.  (2) Normal-Overweight (18.5-30), 150 subjects.  (3) Obese (&gt;30), 100 subjects.
Phase II, planned to start later this spring and summer, will involve evaluation of children and 100 subjects (10-&lt;/=18 yrs, equal numbers of female and male) are planned in this phase as: (1) Normal-Overweight (18.5-30), 50 subjects. (2) Obese (&gt;30), 50 subjects.  An addendum describing details of this study phase will be forthcoming.
Informed consent for both adults and children will be obtained for this study.  Written and verbal assents for children will be obtained for this study.</description>

    <description>These tests will measure the amount of fat in your body.  You will be asked to change into a hospital gown and to remove all footwear and socks/stockings.  Once changed and barefoot, you will be asked to stand on a scale (similar to a large gym scale) and to hold on to hand electrodes on each side of the scale.  You will be asked to step off of the scale once the measurement is complete (less than one minute).  You will also hold on to hand electrodes for three other BIA systems.</description>
