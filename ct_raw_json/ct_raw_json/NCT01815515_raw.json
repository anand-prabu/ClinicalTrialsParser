PSMA is a well characterized histological marker of\n      prostate cancer tumor aggressiveness and metastatic potential. The investigators propose to\n      assess the ability of DCFBC PET to detect metastatic prostate cancer by visual qualitative\n      and quantitative SUV analysis.  Correlation will be made to sites of suspected metastatic\n      disease detected by standard conventional imaging modalities (CIM) for prostate cancer which\n      includes IV contrast CT of chest/abdomen/pelvis and whole body bone scintigraphy."

Prior radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or androgen-deprivation therapy within 2 weeks\n             prior to study radiotracer administration (Washout is one half-life of the drug or 2\n             weeks, whichever is longest)\n\n          3.
