  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of renal dysfunction after implantation of the artificial heart is high. The
      infusion of exogenous B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) after implantation of the total
      artificial heart (TAH) improves renal function in a sustained manner.  The renal protective
      and hormone-modulating effects of nesiritide may be enhanced with ventriculectomy compared
      to heart failure surgery that leaves the native myocardium intact.  The goal of this project
      is to determine the renal protective effects of nesiritide after implantation of a
      mechanical device.

      This is a randomized, double blinded placebo controlled study that will take place in the
      Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit, at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Hospital
      Center.

      This study will enroll 20 adult patients who have undergone implantation of a circulatory
      support device (10 TAH patients, 10 Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) patients).
      Patients will receive standard postoperative care, including anticoagulation, continuous
      hemodynamic monitoring with an arterial line and central venous line and hemodynamic support
      as determine by the cardiac surgery clinical team. We will exclude patients who are
      receiving renal replacement therapy at the time of device implantation or those that have
      had previous solid organ transplantation in order to remove the confounding influence of
      calcineurin inhibitor exposure on renal function. Patient unable to provide informed consent
      will also be excluded.

      Nesiritide Infusion

      The patients will be randomized (stratified by device type) to either the study drug
      (nesiritide at 0.005 mcg/kg/min without a bolus) or placebo. A fixed-dose infusion will be
      initiated 6 hours after the patients having come off of cardiopulmonary bypass and continued
      for 48 hours.

      Laboratory Measurements

      Acute and chronic effects of nesiritide on Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) and Renal Plasma
      Flow (RPF) will be measured by continuous infusion of iothalamate and PAH, respectively. GFR
      and RPF will be measured at baseline (-3 to 0 hrs) and at 3 intervals during drug/placebo
      administration as follows: 0 to 6, 6 to 16 and 16 to 40. Intravenous catheters will be
      placed as needed for infusion of PAH and IOTH and for timed blood collections.

      Urine volume, creatinine, sodium excretion will also be measured. Neurohormones will be
      measured at all time points 3-6. Plasma renin activity will be measured with an automated
      chemiluminescent immunoassay (DiaSorin Liaison). Serum aldosterone concentration will be
      determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (Agilent, AB Sciex API 5000). Serum
      BNP concentration will be measured with a sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay (Siemens
      Healthcare Diagnostics, ADVIA Centaur BNP immunoassay).

      Statistical Analysis Sample size was determined using urine output data from our preliminary
      observations. Power calculations showed that a total of 10 patients in this two-treatment
      parallel-design study to have 84 percent power to detect a change in urine output by 75
      mL/hr at a two-sided 0.05 significance level (using SD of 35 mL/hr for urine output). Thus
      10 patient were included in each device arm of the study.Chi-square analysis was used to
      compare discrete variables.

      A two tailed Student's t-test was used to compare continuous variables. A repeated measures
      analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare changes in clinical variables laboratory
      measurements across time points. A P value &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.  For
      individual comparisons post-hoc testing was performed with a paired t-test analysis with
      Bonferonni correction for 2 comparisons and thus only a P value &lt; 0.025 will considered
      significant for the repeated measures analyses. A Student 2-tailed paired t test will be
      used to compare placebo and active drug values for each individual time point.
