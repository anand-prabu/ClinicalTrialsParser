            "textblock": "Surgical correction of congenital heart defects in children requires the utilization of\n      cardiopulmonary bypass, a technique that temporarily substitutes heart and lung functions\n      during surgery. During this process the patient\u00b4s circulation is controlled by a bypass\n      machine which provides several functions:\n\n        1. Controls the patient's blood flow by pumping of blood in the patient's body.\n\n        2. Controls the correct oxygen levels in the patient's blood.\n\n        3. Regulates the temperature and fluid level of the blood. This process triggers negative\n           responses in the heart and throughout the whole body, potentially resulting in injury\n           to the heart and other organs such as brain, kidneys and lungs.\n\n      Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) describes a procedure that could potentially reduce\n      the injury to heart muscle during cardiac surgery.  The procedure consists of the inflation\n      of a blood pressure cuff on the child's leg for three 5 minute cycles. This process acts by\n      briefly reducing blood flow to the leg muscle, which will then activate the body\u00b4s own\n      protective mechanisms and thereby reduce heart injury.\n\n      Several animal studies have been used to help the understanding of the mechanisms behind\n      this process, and trials in human adults have showed optimistic results; however evidence\n      regarding the paediatric population is limited and necessary since children present\n      different basal profiles, risks and requirements.\n\n      The investigators propose a randomized clinical trial assessing the efficacy of RIPC to\n      provide protection against injury to the heart and other organs in children going through\n      cardiac surgery using CPB at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The research project will\n      have a translational approach, integrating basic molecular mechanisms to clinical outcome.\n      The investigators hope it will allow the understanding and utilisation of the patient\u00b4s own\n      protective mechanisms, reducing CPB-related injury and ultimately improving patient outcome."
