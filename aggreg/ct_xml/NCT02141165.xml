      Primary objectives: To determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a management program
      for patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) carried out in primary or
      specialist healthcare. In the primary arm, the diagnosis and therapeutic decision will be
      made by means of a domiciliary nasal pressure (DNP) channel and oximetry while the
      specialist healthcare arm will use polysomnography (PSG) in a hospital. Patients with an
      intermediate-high suspicion of OSAS will be included, taking as primary variables the
      Epworth scale, for efficacy, and the Epworth scale and EuroQol 5D, for cost-effectiveness.

      Secondary objectives: efficacy of the two SAHS management programs according to the
      following secondary variables: a) quality-of-life tests: FOSQ questionnaire, SF36 and
      analogical wellbeing scale, b) adherence to and compliance with the treatment.

      Design: prospective, randomized, controlled, open, parallel, non-inferiority. A total of 280
      patients will be randomized for management on the basis of DNP (primary) or PSG
      (specialist), thereby giving rise to 4 groups: two treated and two not treated with CPAP.
      The former will undergo a home auto-titration. The follow-up will last 6 months and include
      4 evaluations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Snoring or apneas objectively observed during sleep by a partner;

          2. Symptoms that are potentially secondary to apneas/hypopneas with an intermediate-high
             probability of being treated with CPAP. In operative terms, Epworth scale ≥12 or
             previous cardiovascular disease;

          3. Age between 18 and 70 years;

          4. Absence of any clinical suspicion of any other sleep pathology susceptible to
             coinciding with daytime sleepiness.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Psycho-physical incapacity to complete questionnaires;

          2. Documented structural or coronary heart disease uncontrolled by any medical
             treatment;

          3. Cheyne-Stokes syndrome;

          4. Patients subjected to uvulopalatopharyngoplasty;

          5. Significant nasal obstruction impeding the use of CPAP;

          6. Pregnancy;

          7. Lack of informed consent.
