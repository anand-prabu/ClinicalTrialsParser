  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research is the accumulation of gameplay data and simulator sickness
      background surveys for trend analysis, and individual simulator sickness trigger factor
      analysis for the test subjects involved. Rather than isolating specific variables for
      hypothesis formulation, this study will be attempting to collect an array of data that is a)
      both qualitative and quantitative, and b) observational and test subject-reported. The final
      results will consist of a list of possible trigger factors to avoid for individual subjects,
      and metrics showing the directional tendencies of players depending on the severity of their
      symptoms at the time.

      The overall goal of this research is to better understand factors that contribute to
      simulator sickness, both in who it affects and why some gameplay experiences may cause it
      more than others. Operating from the basic assumption that the way a player moves through an
      environment affects how quickly that player gets sick, we will primarily be gathering data
      on how the player moves through the digital space and whether that behavior changes once
      they begin to feel sick.
