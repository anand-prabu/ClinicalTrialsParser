            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the rate of early and intermediate toxicity related\n      to accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) delivered in a more convenient 5 fraction\n      schedule using non-invasive image-guided breast brachytherapy (NIBB) (AccuBoost System) in\n      women with resected, early stage breast cancer.\n\n      Non-invasive image-guided breast brachytherapy (NIBB), using advanced image-guided radiation\n      technology, has the potential to eliminate the disadvantages of the conventional APBI\n      techniques. NIBB facilitates non-invasive partial breast irradiation without the use of\n      catheters or implants. Yet by using breast immobilization and precise image-guidance, it\n      reduces non-target breast tissue within the irradiated field compared with other\n      non-invasive APBI techniques such as 3D-CRT. This has made NIBB an attractive approach to\n      deliver APBI.\n\n      We hypothesize that NIBB delivered in 5 treatments will be a more convenient, safe and\n      effective modality to deliver partial breast irradiation.\n\n      Anticipated advantages of NIBB protocol treatment include:\n\n        -  Convenient treatment schedule\n\n        -  Short course can allow for increased patient access to treatment\n\n        -  Non-invasive approach\n\n        -  Increased accuracy with precise targeting of lumpectomy cavity using advanced imaging\n\n        -  Reduced irradiation of non-target breast tissue\n\n        -  Reduced skin toxicity\n\n        -  No heart or lung radiation exposure\n\n        -  Reduced late skin or breast toxicity\n\n        -  High rate of good or excellent cosmetic outcome\n\n        -  High rate of ipsilateral breast tumor control comparable to other APBI techniques"
