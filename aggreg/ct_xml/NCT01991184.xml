    <textblock>
      This open-label, Phase I study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharm acokinetics
      of increasing doses of GDC-0853 in patients with relapsed or refract ory B-cell
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In a dose-exp ansion part, GDC-0853
      will be assessed in subsets of patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt;/= 18 years

          -  ECOG score of 0-1

          -  One of the following histologically-documented hematologic malignancies for which no
             effective standard therapy exists: indolent non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), follicular
             lymphoma (FL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), or
             chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)

          -  At least one site of disease that, as seen on CT scan, is &gt; 1.5 cm in the greatest
             transverse diameter or &gt; 1.0 cm in short axis diameter (except for patients with CLL)

          -  An available tumor specimen

          -  Adequate hematologic and organ function

          -  For female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with partners of
             childbearing potential, use of effective contraceptive(s) as defined by protocol for
             the duration of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 12 weeks

          -  &lt; 3 weeks since the last anti-tumor therapy, including chemotherapy, biologic,
             experimental, hormonal or radiotherapy (with the exception of leuprolide or similar
             medications for prostate cancer)

          -  Recent major surgical procedure or traumatic injury, or unhealed incisions or wounds

          -  Active infection requiring IV antibiotics

          -  Clinically significant history of liver disease, including viral or other hepatitis,
             current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis.

          -  Primary CNS malignancy or untreated/active CNS metastases (progressing or requiring
             anticonvulsants or corticosteroids for symptomatic control)

          -  History of other malignancy within 5 years prior to screening, except for
             appropriately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, non-melanoma skin cancer,
             Stage I uterine cancer, or other cancers with a similar outcome

          -  Cardiovascular dysfunction, including ventricular dysrhythmias or risk factors for
             ventricular dysrhythmias

          -  Pregnancy, or lactation

          -  Any other diseases that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that
             may affect the interpretation of the results or render the patient at high risk from
             treatment complications
