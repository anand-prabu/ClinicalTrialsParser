            "textblock": "Research Design: Using a 2-group randomized control trial, the investigators will evaluate\n      the intervention in comparison to usual care.  Usual care is traditional clinic-based care,\n      which will be enhanced by 2 phone calls to provide an attention control condition.\n\n      Methodology: Participants will be 100 Veterans diagnosed with mild to moderate TBI who are\n      followed by the Philadelphia VA Medical Center (PVAMC) Polytrauma Service and a family\n      member (100) of each Veteran. All Veterans will have a family member or partner living with\n      them who is willing to participate in the study. The intervention and study interviews will\n      occur in Veterans' homes.  Qualitative phone interviews with a subset of the sample who\n      received the intervention will be conducted at PVAMC.\n\n      Primary study outcomes for the Veterans will be physical, cognitive, and\n      emotional/interpersonal functioning and community reintegration, measured by standardized\n      instruments at baseline and follow-up at 3 to 4 months.  Study outcomes for family members\n      will be mood and dimensions of well-being, measured by standardized instruments at baseline\n      and follow-up at 3 to 4 months.  Acceptability of the intervention for Veterans and family\n      members will be measured through Project Evaluations, administered at follow-up with both\n      groups. In addition, qualitative phone interviews will be conducted with a subset of\n      Veterans and family members who received VIP to evaluate VIP's acceptability and to enhance\n      understanding of the impact of VIP from the perspective of those experiencing it.\n\n      Based on a person-environment fit framework, the VIP intervention consists of 8 sessions (up\n      to 6 in the home and 2 telephone contacts) delivered by occupational therapists over a 3\n      month period to Veterans and family members.  VIP realigns environmental demands to match\n      Veterans' abilities through the modification of home environments, development of meaningful\n      activities tailored to Veterans' strengths, training in the use of emotion-regulation\n      strategies to address behavioral/interpersonal difficulties, and training in the use of\n      cognitive strategies to compensate for cognitive impairments.  In its family focus, VIP\n      provides family members with education and training to understand and manage the Veterans'\n      limitations.\n\n      Clinical relationships: VIP extends and adds value to traditional on-site clinical care by\n      helping individuals with TBI and their families in the setting where most functional and\n      behavioral problems emerge.  As a skills-building intervention, VIP has the potential to\n      enhance Veterans' abilities to function effectively in their home environments and to\n      improve their quality of life and that of their families."
