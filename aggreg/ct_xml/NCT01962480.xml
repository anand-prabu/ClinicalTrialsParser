    <textblock>
      Introduction: Closure of the hernia gap in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair before mesh
      reinforcement has gained increasing acceptance among surgeons despite creating a
      tension-based repair. Beneficial effects of this technique have sporadically been reported
      but no evidence is available from randomized controlled trials.

      The primary purpose is to compare early postoperative activity-related pain in patients
      undergoing ventral hernia repair with closure of the gap with patients undergoing standard
      laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (non-closure of the gap). Secondary outcomes are cosmesis
      and hernia-related quality of life (QoL).

      Material and Methods: A randomized, controlled, double-blinded study is planned. Based on
      power calculation we will include 40 patients in each arm. Patients undergoing elective
      laparoscopic umbilical, epigastric, or umbilical trocar-site hernia repair at Hvidovre
      Hospital and Herlev Hospital, who meet the inclusion criteria, are invited to participate.

      Conclusion: The technique with closure of the gap may induce more postoperative pain, but
      may be superior with regard to other important surgical outcomes. No studies have previously
      investigated closure of the gap in the setting of a randomised controlled trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion criteria

               -  Elective, primary or recurrent laparoscopic umbilical or epigastric hernia
                  repair, umbilical trocar-site hernia and epigastric hernia repair where
                  laparoscopic hernia repair is no contraindication (i.e. previous laparotomy with
                  anticipated severe and dense adhesions

               -  Defect gab between 2-6 cm measured preoperatively by the surgeon at the
                  out-patient clinic

               -  Maximum 1 defects

               -  Patients 18-80 years Patients with technical failure (where it is not possible
                  to suture the gab) or patients who are reoperated due to complications remain
                  included and will stay in their primary assigned randomization group in order to
                  perform an intention to treat (ITT) analysis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria:

               -  Open hernia repair

               -  Poor compliance (language problems, dementia and alcohol or drug abuse etc.)

               -  Fascia  gab &gt;6 cm (largest diameter, evaluated preoperatively and
                  intra-operatively, thus patients are excluded if the defect is found larger
                  intra-operatively)

               -  Emergency repair

               -  Chronic pain syndrome (chronic back pain, chronic headache, severe dysmenorrhea,
                  fibromyalgia, whiplash or other conditions requiring daily pain medication)

               -  Daily consumption of opioids (for the last 3 weeks up till the operation)

               -  Decompensated liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B-C)

               -  If the hernia repair is secondarily to another surgical procedure

               -  If a patient withdraws his/her inclusion consent
