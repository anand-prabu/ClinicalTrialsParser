  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to determine if speech-language therapy has positive effect, reliable measurement
      tools are required to document outcomes. Currently, there is very limited information
      concerning the measurement of changes in speech production as a result of treatment for
      acquired apraxia of speech and aphasia. This study will obtain information concerning the
      reliability of several speech production measures over time. Thirty persons with chronic
      aphasia and apraxia of speech will be asked to provide speech samples in response to
      commonly used assessment tools on three sampling occasions so that the stability of
      measurements may be examined.

      After establishment of appropriate outcome measures, a small, pilot treatment study will be
      conducted with four participants. The participants will receive a new treatment for aphasia
      and acquired apraxia of speech and outcomes will be measured relative to speech and language
      production.

      A single group, repeated measures design will be used to obtain repeated speech samples from
      30 persons with chronic acquired apraxia of speech and aphasia. Speech samples will be
      elicited using commonly employed motor speech assessment protocols; an initial sample, a
      sample one week following the initial sample, and a sample at four weeks following the
      initial sample. The following measures will be obtained from the samples: percent consonants
      correct, percent fluent utterances, and duration of utterance. Stability of the measures
      will be examined.

      After the preceding measures have been analyzed, a series of four, single-subject
      experimental designs will be conducted. Four participants with chronic aphasia and apraxia
      of speech will receive a new treatment for aphasia and apraxia of speech applied
      sequentially to two sets of experimental picture picture stimuli. Outcomes will be measured
      in terms of speech production (measures described above) as well as in terms of language
      production.

    <description>Therapy is delivered in a face-to-face format. The therapist uses picture stimuli, verbal modeling, feedback, reinforcement, forward-chaining to increase verbal production. For speech errors that occur, the therapist uses modeling, feedback, reinforcement, simultaneous production, articulatory instruction, and repeated practice to improve articulation.</description>
