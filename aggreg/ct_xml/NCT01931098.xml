      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if pazopanib when given in combination
      with topotecan can help to control glioblastoma.  The safety of this drug combination will
      also be studied.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      group based on if you have received bevacizumab or not:

        -  You will be in Group A if you have not received bevacizumab in the past.

        -  You will be in Group B if you have received bevacizumab in the past.

      Both groups will receive pazopanib and topotecan at the same dose level and on the same
      schedule.   Up to 34 participants will be enrolled in Group 1 and up to 32 participants will
      be enrolled in Group 2.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each cycle is 28 days.

      You will take capsules of topotecan by mouth 1 time everyday at about the same time each
      day.  You should swallow the capsules whole with at least 1 cup (8 ounces) of water, with or
      without food.

      You will take tablets of pazopanib by mouth 1 time every day at about the same time each
      day.  They should be taken on an empty stomach (at least 1 hour before and 2 hour after
      eating) with about 1 cup (8 ounces) of water.

      If you vomit after taking the study drugs, you should not take a replacement dose on that
      day.  You should resume taking the study drugs at the next scheduled dose on the following
      day.  If vomiting continues, you should tell your doctor.

      You will be given a study drug diary to record the times that you take the study drugs and
      if you vomit.  You should bring the diary to each study visit.

      Study Visits:

      At Week 1, your blood pressure will be measured.

      At Week 2, your blood pressure will be measured and blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn
      for routine tests.

      At Week 4, you will have an EKG.

      Every 4 weeks:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing.

        -  Urine will be collected to check your kidney function.

      Every 8 weeks:

        -  You will have a neurological exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check thyroid function.

        -  You will have an EKG.

      If you are in Group A, you will have a brain MRI or CT scan at Week 4 of Cycle 2, and then
      every other cycle after that (Cycles 4, 6, 8 and so on) to check the status of the disease.
      You will also complete the symptom questionnaire at these visits.

      If you are in Group B, you will have a brain MRI or CT scan at Week 4 of Cycles 1, 2, 3, and
      then every other cycle after that (Cycles 5, 7, 9 and so on)  to check the status of  the
      disease.  You will also complete the symptom questionnaire at these visits.

      At any time during the study, extra tests may be performed if the doctor thinks they are
      needed for your safety.  The study doctor will tell you more about any extra tests.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      Within 14 days after your last dose of the study drugs, you will have an end-of-treatment
      visit.  The following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing.  This blood
           draw will also include a pregnancy test if you can become pregnant.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may take the study drugs for up to 1 year.  You will no longer be able to take the study
      drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to
      follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the long-term follow-up phone calls.

      Long-Term Follow-Up Calls:

      After you have stopped taking the study drugs and completed your end-of-treatment visit, the
      study staff will call you 1 time every 3 months from then on to check on how you are doing.
      Each phone call should last about 5 minutes.

      This is an investigational study.  Pazopanib is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of renal cell cancer.  Topotecan is FDA approved and commercially available
      for the treatment of lung cancer.  In this study, the combination of pazopanib and topotecan
      is being used for research purposes only.

      Up to 66 participants will be enrolled in this multicenter study.  Up to 15 will take part
      at MD Anderson.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with histologically proven intracranial glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or
             gliosarcoma (GS). Patients will be eligible if the original histology was low-grade
             glioma and a subsequent histological diagnosis of a GBM or GS is made. Patients must
             have evidence of progression of the GBM or GS on MRI or CT scan.

          2. Patient must have failed prior chemoradiation with temozolomide and any other
             therapies except BEV (group A), or must have failed primary chemoradiation and a
             BEV-incorporating treatment (group B).

          3. Patients may have had treatment for no more than 2 prior relapses. Relapse is defined
             as progression following initial therapy (i.e. radiation+/- chemo if that was used as
             initial therapy). The intent therefore is that patients had no more than 3 prior
             therapies (initial and treatment for 2 relapses). If the patient had a surgical
             resection for relapsed disease and no anti-cancer therapy was instituted for up to 12
             weeks, and the patient undergoes another surgical resection, this is considered as 1
             relapse. For patients who had prior therapy for a low-grade glioma, the surgical
             diagnosis of a high-grade glioma will be considered the first relapse

          4. Patients must be greater than 12 weeks following completion of chemoradiation or any
             additional radiation to reduce the chance of pseudoprogression.

          5. Measurable disease is required unless patient is post-operative and in that case
             patient can have no evidence of disease.

          6. All patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the
             investigational nature of this study. Patients must have signed an authorization for
             the release of their protected health information. Patients must be registered in the
             MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER Office of Multicenter Clinical Research (OMCR) database
             prior to treatment with study drugs.

          7. Archived tumor tissue must be available for all subjects for biomarker analysis
             before or during treatment. Samples must be provided within 4 weeks of enrollment.

          8. Tissue to be analyzed for MGMT (if not already performed) and additional analyses
             noted in correlative biomarker section(on hold).

          9. Patients must be &gt;/= 18 years old.

         10. Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of &gt;/= 60.

         11. At the time of registration: Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of
             prior therapy: &gt;/= 28 days from any investigational agent, &gt;/=28 days from prior
             cytotoxic therapy, &gt;/=14 days from vincristine, &gt;/=42 days from nitrosoureas, &gt;/=21
             days from procarbazine administration, &gt;21 days from bevacizumab administration and
             &gt;/=7 days for non-cytotoxic agents, e.g., interferon, tamoxifen, thalidomide,
             cis-retinoic acid, etc. (radiosensitizer does not count). Any questions related to
             the definition of non-cytotoxic agents should be directed to the Study Chair.

         12. Patients must have adequate organ function: 1) Bone marrow function (WBC &gt;/=3,000/µl,
             ANC &gt;/=1,500/mm3, platelet count of &gt;/=100,000/mm3, and hemoglobin &gt;/=10 gm/dl).
             Eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by transfusion. 2) Liver function
             (alanine amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt;2.5XULN(upper
             limit of normal), and total bilirubin &lt;1.5XULN), prothrombin time (PT) or
             international normalized ratio (INR), and activated partial thromboplastin time
             (aPTT) &lt;/=1.2XULN. Concomitant elevations in bilirubin and AST/ALT above 1.0xULN are
             not permitted. Subjects receiving anticoagulant therapy are eligible if their INR is
             stable and within the recommended range for the desired level of anticoagulation. 3)
             Renal function (creatinine &lt;/=1.5mg/dL (133 µmol/L), or if &gt;1.5mg/dL, calculated
             creatinine clearance &gt;/=50cc/min), and urine protein to creatinine ratio of &lt;1 before
             starting therapy. 4) These tests must be performed within 14 days prior to
             registration.

         13. Patients must have shown unequivocal radiographic evidence for tumor progression by
             MRI or CT scan. A scan should be performed within 14 days prior to registration and
             on a steroid dose that has been stable or decreasing for at least 5 days. If the
             steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and registration a new baseline
             MR/CT is required. The same type of scan, i.e., MRI or CT must be used throughout the
             period of protocol treatment for tumor measurement.

         14. Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be
             eligible as long as all of the following conditions apply: 1) They have recovered
             from the effects of surgery and be &gt; 28 days from surgery. 2) Residual disease
             following resection of recurrent GBM or GS is not mandated for eligibility into the
             study. To best assess the extent of residual disease post-operatively, a CT/ MRI
             should be done no later than 96 hours in the immediate post-operative period or at
             least 4 weeks post-operatively, within 14 days prior to registration. If the 96-hour
             scan is more than 14 days before registration, the scan needs to be repeated. If the
             steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and registration, a new
             baseline MRI/CT is required on a stable steroid dosage for at least 5 days.

         15. Patients must have failed prior radiation therapy and must have an interval of
             greater than or equal to 12 weeks from the completion of radiation therapy to study
             entry.

         16. Patients with prior therapy that included interstitial brachytherapy or stereotactic
             radiosurgery must have confirmation of true progressive disease rather than radiation
             necrosis based upon either PET or Thallium scanning, MR spectroscopy or
             surgical/pathological documentation of disease.

         17. A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of: 1)
             Non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant),

         12. Evidence of active bleeding or bleeding diathesis.

         13. Known endobronchial lesions and/or lesions infiltrating major pulmonary vessels.

         14. Hemoptysis in excess of 2.5 mL (or one half teaspoon) within 8 weeks of first dose of
             study drug.

         15. Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric, or other condition
             that could interfere with subject's safety, provision of informed consent, or
             compliance to study procedures.

         16. Unable or unwilling to discontinue use of inducers and inhibitors of CYP450 listed
             for at least 14 days or five half-lives of a drug (whichever is longer) prior to the
             first dose of study drug and for the duration of the study. CYP3A4 substrates can be
             administered, but investigators will need to be aware of possible increased or
             decreased effectiveness of the non-study drug and this should be recorded in
             concomitant medications. Dexamethasone is acceptable although listed as a CYP3A4
             inducers/inhibitors as long as the dose is 16 mg/day or lesser. BCRP and PgP inducers
             and inhibitors will be also prohibited.

         17. Any ongoing toxicity from prior anti-cancer therapy that is &gt; Grade 1 and/or that is
             progressing in severity, except alopecia.

         18. Ongoing use of enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic agents (EIAEDs), unless 2 week washout
             has elapsed form last dose of EIAED.

         19. Patients must not have any significant medical illnesses that in the investigator's
             opinion cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy or would compromise
             the patient's ability to tolerate this therapy

         20. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to pazopanib or topotecan or to their
             excipients.

         21. Patients on total daily dose of dexamethasone greater than 16 mg/day.

         22. Patients must not have received prior therapy with topotecan, pazopanib, or related
             drugs such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, VEGF inhibitors (except bevacizumab). Prior
             treatment with TKIs that do not impact VEGFR -1, -2, or -3, PDGFR -a, -b of cKIT
             could be allowed.

         23. Patients must not have any disease that will obscure toxicity or dangerously alter
             drug metabolism.
