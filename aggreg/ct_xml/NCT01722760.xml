  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children born prematurely are of greater risk of developing chronic lung disease
      (Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia).

      With an increase in the amount of premature children, we expect an increasing number of
      children with BPD.

      Today we do not have many ways of predicting or treating this condition, and the children
      are usually in hospital for several months after birth. Many are dismissed with home oxygen.
      Children with BPD are typically often re-submitted to hospital with respiratory disease the
      first couple of years, and some of them have problems throughout childhood and into
      adulthood.

      Other scientists have found a correlation between BPD and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
      Disease (COPD).

      The condition as well as the treatment (steroids), are associated with great risk of adverse
      effects as Cerebral Palsy, blindness, deafness and mental retardation.

      The investigators wish to find a safe way to identify the children in greater risk of
      developing BPD, who could therefore benefit from a more intensive treatment.An early
      diagnosis would increase the possibility of predicting the prognosis.

      Other studies have proven a connection between both low vitamin A and D and high exhaled
      nitrogen oxide (NO) with lung disease.

      With this trial the investigators wish to make a reference material for NO and vitamins A
      and D in infants admitted to the neonatal department at two hospitals in Denmark, both with
      and without treatment with nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure.

      The investigators furthermore wish to describe an eventual connection between BPD and these
      factors by examining a large group of children on 7 specific occasions within the first two
      months of life and at a one year follow up.

        Unit. Gestational Age 24-42 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Children with ciliary dyskinesia, as NO is distinguishable lower in these children.

          2. Children who can not cooperate to the examination.

          3. Children so dependant on oxygen, that the examination/measurement is not possible.

          4. Children with pneumothorax

          5. Children having a diagnosed pneumonia verified by tracheal secrete.

          6. Children with bigger congenital anomalies
