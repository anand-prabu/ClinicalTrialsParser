In cohort of patients\n      with renal cell carcinoma, both patients with primary disease only, and those patients who\n      have limited metastases (\u22645) will be eligible. Besides technical feasibility of delivering\n      this treatment, this study will be to assess efficacy, toxicity and tumour response using a\n      novel imaging biomarker called diffusion weighted-MRI."
