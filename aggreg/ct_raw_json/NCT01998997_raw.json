Family members actively participated in a\n      non-pharmacological intervention to prevent delirium. This has not been done in a North\n      American environment, with different cultural and climactic factors.\n\n      This study will be a randomized controlled trial (pilot study) involving family members.\n      Family members will be randomized to a control group or an educational intervention. The\n      control group will receive a general brochure, outlining general health information\n      published by the Ministry of Health. The intervention group will receive a specific brochure\n      on details around delirium (what it is and how to prevent it), and then a brief educational\n      session comprising a didactic session and to address any questions. This pilot study will\n      examine the feasibility of doing this kind of intervention in a North American environment.\n      The family-based intervention is similar to what was done in the Chilean study. It involves\n      six elements including the educational session. The five other elements include: 1) family\n      being present for extended periods (at least 5 hours if possible); 2) engaging in\n      conversation with study patients for re-orientation to current time and current events; 3)\n      avoiding sensory deprivation (ensuring hearing or visual aids and dentures are available as\n      needed; 4) providing familiar objects to patients; 5) provision of a clock and calendar to\n      the patient. The intervention brochure is similar to what was provided to family members as\n      part of the original Chilean study (kindly provided to the principal investigator, M.\n      Dasgupta, by the lead author of the Chilean study, Dr. F.T. Martinez)."
