This will be accomplished by using a dose\n      escalation procedure starting at a low dose of VX15/2503 and will continue based on\n      predefined parameters until the maximum tolerated dose is identified. Patients will be\n      randomized at a 4:1 ratio to receive VX15/2503 to placebo. The patients and the study team\n      will be blinded to the treatment that each patient receives.\n\n      The study drug, VX15/2503, is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the semaphorin\n      4D (SEMA4D; CD100) antigen. Experimental evidence suggest that antibody neutralization of\n      SEMA4D may represent a new therapeutic strategy for treating multiple sclerosis."
