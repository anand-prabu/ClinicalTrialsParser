            "textblock": "The study will evaluate safety and efficacy of gene transfer in Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type\n      1 (SMA1) patients.  SMA is caused by low levels of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein,\n      and affects all muscles in the body.  There is no other effective treatment for SMA and\n      current drug therapy has been unsuccessful in stabilizing or reversing this disease.  Only\n      supportive care is currently possible.\n\n      The gene transfer trial will deliver SMN gene intravenously (i.v.) using the\n      adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9). Two cohorts will undergo gene transfer in a\n      standard three-six dose escalation scheme to establish maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using\n      toxicity. The first cohort will consist of three participants, and the second cohort will\n      consist of six participants to receive a 5-fold increase in dose.\n\n      The primary objective of this study is the assessment of the safety of scAAV9.CB.SMN\n      delivered intravenously to SMA type 1 patients.  Following gene transfer i.v. infusion,\n      participants will be carefully monitored for any side effects at the outpatient follow-up\n      visits weekly for 3 weeks followed by monthly visits over two years of active study period.\n      Safety endpoints will be assessed by changes in hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis,\n      immunologic response to rAAV9 and SMN, and reported history and observations of symptoms.\n      The time from birth to study pre-defined use of respiratory assistance devices or death will\n      be used as a secondary outcome measure of efficacy.  Exploratory outcome measures include\n      nerve conduction and muscle assessment studies.  The active phase of this study will last\n      for two-years post-infusion, following which, participants will be asked to transfer into a\n      monitoring program where medical progress will continue to be collected from annual standard\n      care medical exams for the next 15 years."
