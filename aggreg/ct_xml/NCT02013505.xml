  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesised that a video based patient education will help patients
      understand the process of colon cleansing prior to a colonoscopy procedure and hence will
      result in clean colons that will may help physician perform a better quality examination.

    <textblock>
      After obtaining consent over phone, the investigators randomly assigned assigned
      participants to receive either the standard paper based instructions or receive an
      educational video in addition to the standard paper based instruction. Physicians performing
      the procedure were blinded to this assignment. The investigators obtained information
      relating to the cleanliness of the colon as noted during the colonoscopy examination. The
      investigators obtained this information from the colonoscopy reports. The investigators also
      obtained information regarding colon polyps,wanting to see if there is any difference in the
      number of patients in whom adenomatous polyps were detected.

      Outcome measures:

      Primary Out come:

      1.Quality of bowel preparation

      Secondary outcome:

        1. Adenoma detection rate

        2. Rate of incomplete procedures due to poor bowel prep.

    <description>An educational video was developed based on the current paper instructions for bowel preparation. The video included a physician explaining the process, using more images and short clip videos of the example. The script of the video was approved by the patient education department of the University Hospital and language adjusted to 6th grade level.</description>
