            "textblock": "This is a prospective, randomized (1:1 DFT vs ULV testing), controlled clinical research\n      trial. Patients undergoing ICD implant or device change out will be candidates for this\n      study. Medical records for these patients will be screened prior to enrollment to ensure\n      eligibility for the study. Each patient who is a candidate and who agrees to participate in\n      the study will undergo the standard of care pre-procedure evaluation including a complete\n      medical history evaluation, a complete physical examination and routine laboratory testing\n      including chemistry panel, hematology panel, coagulation panel, a 12-lead electrocardiogram,\n      and a urine pregnancy test (all females of child-bearing age).  A candidate patient will be\n      randomly assigned to either the standard DFT testing method group or the ULV testing method\n      group.\n\n      For the standard DFT testing group, per routine standard of care, the patient will be\n      admitted to the hospital. The study requires a pre-procedure blood test of 3 ml for\n      Troponin-T (TnT) which will be drawn prior to any DFT testing. The blood sample will be sent\n      to the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) central laboratory for processing.  The\n      patient will then undergo the scheduled ICD implant procedure in a standard fashion.  The\n      standard defibrillation threshold testing will be performed using a low energy shock\n      delivered on T-wave to induce ventricular fibrillation (VF).  If VF is induced, the first\n      shock is 25J. If success, we will wait 5 minutes and repeat the process.  If the 2nd shock\n      yields success, the DFT testing is complete and a 10J safety margin achieved (device shock\n      energy is set at 35J).  A back-up external defibrillator will always be immediately\n      available in case transvenous shocks fail.  A safety margin of 10J (i.e. DFT + 10J) will be\n      considered adequate for safe implantation of modern ICD systems.  This is standard DFT\n      testing as clinically done at each implant today.  Blood pressure will be monitored before\n      and immediately after each shock.  After 4 hours, 8 hours and 20 hours post DFT testing,\n      blood samples (3 ml for Troponin-T) will be drawn and sent to the UCSD central laboratory\n      for processing.\n\n      For the ULV testing group, per routine standard of care, the patient will be admitted to the\n      hospital. The study requires a pre-procedure blood test (3 ml for Troponin-T.) which will be\n      drawn prior to any ULV testing. The blood sample will be sent to the UCSD central laboratory\n      for processing.  The patient will then undergo the scheduled ICD implant procedure in a\n      standard fashion.  The ULV testing is performed as followed: for single coil device, a 18J\n      shock will be delivered at 0msec, +20 msec, -20msec and -40msec measured from the peak of\n      the T-wave; for dual coil device, a 18J shock will be delivered at 0msec, -20msec, +20msec,\n      and  +40msec measured from the peak of the T-wave.  If VF is not induced with any of the\n      above mentioned shocks, the ULV will be considered as 18J and the ICD will be implanted with\n      the first shock strength set at 30 joules. If VF is induced, a 25J rescue shock will be\n      delivered as is standard and if successful, the device will be programmed to the maximum\n      output of 35 joules. If the rescue shock is unsuccessful, external rescue shock will be\n      performed and the ICD lead system will be repositioned and testing repeated until the ULV is\n      acceptable. The ULV is the weakest shock strength that does not induce VF and this value\n      correlates closely with the defibrillation threshold obtained using alternating current for\n      VF induction.  Blood pressure will be monitored before and immediately after each shock.\n      After 4 hours, 8 hours and 20 hours post ULV testing, blood samples (3 ml for Troponin-T)\n      will be drawn and sent to the UCSD central laboratory for processing.\n\n      Other than the blood tests for Troponin-T, there is no change in routine post-operative\n      management. Patients will be followed every three months, as is standard management for\n      patients with ICDs.\n\n      The results of Troponin-T measurement for the study patients will be assessed by the\n      electrophysiology (EP) staff covering the case.  If myocardial injury is noted (any TnT\n      value >0.1 as per current assay at the UCSD laboratory), the patient will be monitored with\n      appropriate laboratories including repeat TnT measurements.  The patient will need to stay\n      in the hospital until all lab results obtained.  The TnT blood draws at 4-hour, 8-hour and\n      20-hour post implantation will not require longer hospital stay since they are still in the\n      24-hour window observation which is routine admission status for device implantation.  If\n      the repeat TnT measurement is <0.1, then myocardial injury is most unlikely and the positive\n      TnT value is likely due to DFT shocks.  Only if the repeat TnT value is 0.1 or above, then\n      the patient will require longer hospital stay to work up for myocardial infarction.  During\n      this stay, additional TnT values will be drawn; a cardiac stress test will likely be\n      performed to rule out coronary blockage.  The patient will also be treated with appropriate\n      therapy for myocardial injury including aspirin and beta-blocker (if the patient is not\n      already taking these) while further tests are being carried out.  If the stress test is\n      negative, positive TnT values are likely due to DFT shocks and not ischemia per se.  If\n      stress test is positive, consultation with interventional cardiology will be obtained for\n      cardiac angiogram. Only if the patient has a positive stress test and a positive cardiac\n      angiogram will the patient be diagnosed with myocardial infarction.  We will follow standard\n      of care for management of myocardial injury as recommended by the American Heart Association\n      and the American College of Cardiology. All patients are required to stay overnight after\n      ICD implantation and this is standard of care. All lab results should be obtained during\n      patient's hospitalization.\n\n      Analysis will be performed using a two-tailed t-test at alpha = 0.05.  A sample size of 25\n      patients in each group will have 90% power to detect a difference in means of 0.019 ng/mL,\n      assuming a common standard deviation of 0.020.  This standard deviation was computed based\n      on a range of 0.030 to 0.100 ng/mL using nQuery Advisor version 4.0."
