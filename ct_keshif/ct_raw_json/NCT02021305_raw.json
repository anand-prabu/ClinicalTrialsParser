In this study the researchers will try\n      to investigate the role of TLRs as molecular interactions between bacterial virulence and\n      host response.\n\n      TLRs are important mediators in the development of the natural immunity against bacteria.\n      They recognize microbial pathogen associated molecular patterns and alert the host's immune\n      system to the presence of invading microbes"
