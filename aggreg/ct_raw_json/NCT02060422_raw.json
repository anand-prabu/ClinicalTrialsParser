The\n      bi-directional interaction between psychological well-being and seizure have been recognized\n      in recent years. Reduction of psychological stress has the potential to improve seizure\n      manifestation.\n\n      The present study uses an assessor-blinded prospective randomized controlled trial to\n      evaluate the efficacy of a mindfulness-based psychotherapy and an attentional-placebo social\n      support on improving psychological well-being, seizure control and cognitive performance\n      among adult patients with drug-resistant epilepsy."
