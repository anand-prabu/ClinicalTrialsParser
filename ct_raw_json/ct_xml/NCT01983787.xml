  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At the Department of Infectious Diseases, Aarhus University Hospital, continuous infusion
      with piperacillin/tazobactam for a period of 2 weeks, has been used for several years in
      patients with cystic fibrosis, suffering from acute pulmonary exacerbations (APE).

      It is an outpatient treatment. To assess the efficacy and quality of the treatment, a blood
      test every 3rd day is taken to determine the concentration of Piperacillin in blood-plasma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are often colonized with multidrug-resistant
      microorganisms, which increases the risk of suboptimal dosing of antibiotics as the time
      above the minimum inhibitory concentration (T&gt;MIC) is suboptimal. Continuous infusion of
      beta-lactam antibiotics is more likely to optimize T&gt;MIC than intermittent infusion. At the
      Department of Infectious Diseases, Aarhus University Hospital, continuous infusion with
      piperacillin/tazobactam for a period of 2 weeks, has been used for several years in patients
      with CF, suffering from acute pulmonary exacerbations (APE). It is an outpatient treatment,
      and the patients are given 16 g of piperacillin per 24 hours. To assess the efficacy and
      quality of the treatment, a blood test every 3rd day will be required to monitor the
      blood-plasma concentration of piperacillin, as well as C-reactive protein (CRP) and white
      blood cell count (WBC).
