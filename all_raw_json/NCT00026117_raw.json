Patients\n      are stratified according to disease type (breast vs colorectal female vs colorectal male),\n      age (49 and under vs 50-69 vs 70 and over), ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2), baseline\n      quality of life (UNISCALE rating less than 50% vs 50-75% vs more than 75%), and concurrent\n      chemotherapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral shark cartilage (BeneFin\u2122) 3-4 times daily.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo 3-4 times daily. Treatment continues in the\n           absence of unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed weekly for 1 month and then monthly thereafter during treatment.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 600 patients (300 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 24 months."
