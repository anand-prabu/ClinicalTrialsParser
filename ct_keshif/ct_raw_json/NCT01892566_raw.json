In conjunction, wireless sensor-based inhalers will monitor the frequency of rescue inhaler use (Asthmapolis\u00ae; Madison, WI). As well, on a daily basis, participants in the early identification group will complete eight respiratory symptom questions from the COPD Assessment Test (CAT). Participants' short acting beta-agonist inhaler use will be monitored by an Asthmapolis Spiroscout Inhaler Tracker.  Based on participant responses, flags or electronic notifications can be generated. Based on severity of symptoms and guidelines for recommended care, participants will be instructed to self-manage by optimizing inhaler use (if symptoms are mild) or present for an acute care visit at JHHCC if necessary."

Investigators hypothesize\n      that earlier identification of acute exacerbations through in-home monitoring of respiratory\n      symptoms, lung function and medication usage will allow appropriate intervention to reduce\n      the morbidity associated with AECOPD. Therefore, the investigators propose using innovative\n      mobile health (mHealth) applications to Respond Early to Acute exacerbations of COPD in HIV\n      (mREACH). COPD is a co-morbidity of HIV with growing recognition, but remains greatly\n      under-recognized among HIV-infected persons. In this application, among HIV-infected\n      individuals with spirometry-confirmed COPD, investigators will conduct a pilot randomized\n      trial of mHealth monitoring compared to usual care to reduce the symptom and clinical burden\n      of AECOPD."
