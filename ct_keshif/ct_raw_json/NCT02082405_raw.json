Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone, work in\n      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by\n      stopping them from dividing. Giving cyclophosphamide daily may kill more cancer cells.\n      Giving bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone may be an effective treatment for\n      multiple myeloma."
