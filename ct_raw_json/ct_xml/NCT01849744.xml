  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation trial of VS-4718, a focal
      adhesion kinase inhibitor, in subjects with metastatic non-hematologic malignancies. This
      clinical study is comprised of 2 parts: Part 1 (Dose Escalation) and Part 2 (Expansion).
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety (including the recommended Phase II
      dose), pharmacokinetics (the amount of VS-4718 in your blood) and the anti-cancer activity
      of VS-4718.  The pharmacodynamic effects (genes or proteins that may predict or show how
      your body may respond to VS-4718) will also be examined in tumor biopsies and blood samples.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of a metastatic non-hematologic malignancy.
