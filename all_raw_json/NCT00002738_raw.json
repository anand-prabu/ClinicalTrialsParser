Combining\n      more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well combination chemotherapy works in treating\n      children with recurrent acute lymphoblastic leukemia, recurrent osteosarcoma, or refractory\n      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."

Treatment repeats every 4 weeks. Patients\n      with stable or responsive disease may receive up to 4 courses of therapy.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
