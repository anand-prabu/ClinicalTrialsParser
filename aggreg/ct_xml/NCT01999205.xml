  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The participants are twelve small or middle-sized companies. A team is nominated in each
      company to develop company's practices in relation to promoting physical activity and
      reducing sedentary behavior among employees. Baseline information about the company's
      practices and employees' physical activity is collected in November 2013 with questionnaires
      and accelerometers. The teams are supported with materials and three meetings and the
      opportunity to obtain physical activity services from the regional offices of the Finnish
      Sport Confederation. The development process is carried out in Fall 2013 and the actions to
      promote physical activity and to reduce sedentary behavior are implemented in the companies
      during spring and fall 2014. The follow-up evaluation with the same measures as at baseline
      will be conducted in November 2014.
