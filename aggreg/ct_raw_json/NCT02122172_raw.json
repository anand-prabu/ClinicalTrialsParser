To determine the overall response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]),\n      median progression free survival, and overall survival for the same treated population.\n\n      II. To determine whether tumor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and/or HER2\n      overexpression influences 3-month PFS in patients treated with afatinib.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive afatinib dimaleate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-42.
