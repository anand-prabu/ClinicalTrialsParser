  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Firstly, on the basis of our primary research, the investigators are to further confirm the
      efficacy and safety of differentiation inducer---all-trance retinoid acid (ATRA) in the
      treatment of refractory immune thrombocytopenia (RITP). Secondly, from the prospective of
      induced differentiation, the investigators want to verify whether ATRA is a potential
      curative agent for RITP. Thirdly, the investigators are trying to explore the possible
      pathogenesis of RITP and the mechanism of ATRA in curing RITP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Refractory immune thrombocytopenia (RITP) is a severe bleeding disorder with a high
      mortality rate of 10% to 30%, which is resulted from the toxicities associated with
      therapies, as well as from life-threatening bleedings. Up to now, treatments for RITP
      patients are still limited and no consensus has been reached about the standard treatment
      protocol, therefore, it remains a great problem and challenge for hematologists to think out
      ways to treat RITP, that is to say, new therapies should be explored to maintain a
      relatively stable and safe platelet counts with minimum toxicities, so as to improve
      patients' quality of life and reduce mortalities related to severe bleedings and therapies.

      Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder ascribed not only to increased
      platelet (PLT) destruction, but also to reduced PLT production, which is appears to be
      related to impaired megakaryocyte maturation. All-trance retinoid acid (ATRA) belongs to a
      class of retinoids, which exerts immunomodulatory and differentiation inducing capacities,
      and has been studied in clinical trails about autoimmune disease and has been successfully
      applied in clinic to cure APL by inducing the differentiation of cancer cells.

      In this study, the investigators retrospectively reviewed the medical chart of 35 RITP
      patients who take ATRA as part of the combination therapy and have been regularly visiting
      professor Zhang's clinic, a professional clinic of bleeding and coagulation disorders from
      February 2008 to August 2012. The investigators made phone calls for some other detailed
      medically relevant information not recorded, including previous ITP history, bleeding
      episodes and etc.
