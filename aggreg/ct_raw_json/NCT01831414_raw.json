In normal subjects,\n      water immersion generates a reduction in lung volumes. The effects of water immersion on the\n      respiratory function of spinal cord injury patient (who are liable to present a respiratory\n      failure secondary to paralysis) are not well known.  They could be deleterious (by majoring\n      respiratory failure)or beneficial (by mimicking the effect of a corset and improving\n      respiratory function). Therefore, we are planning to study the effect of different water\n      immersion levels on the respiratory function of spinal cord injury patients."
