      The purpose of this study is to reduce the psychological risk factors( including hostility,
      anxiety, depression, and perceived stress) in  coronary artery disease (CAD) patients and
      enhance the regulation of the autonomic nervous system  (including respiration rate, heart
      rate, distal blood vessel pulse, and finger temperament) through web-based cognitive
      -behavioral group therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in reducing the level of anger, hostility
      and depression present in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients.In Taiwan, Weng et al. also
      confirmed the eight-week group CBT program not only diminished the emotion disturbances
      including anger, hostility and depression of CAD, but also significantly prolonged the
      coagulation time, thus reducing the rate of thrombosis formation. Even though the
      therapeutic effect of the CBT program was valid, this program is still not accessible for
      some patients in need because they are not aware of it, or they are restricted by time and
      transportation. Internet-based therapeutic intervention can overcome the obstacles to access
      this program at any time and in any place. Presently, structured CBT intervention is
      provided through the Internet and used widely by patients with physical or psychological
      problems such as smoking, obesity, or headaches, but not by CAD patients. Therefore, the
      purpose of this research is to evaluate the effects to reduce the psychological risk factors
      of a web-based group CBT program in CAD patients. Follow-up assessments will be performed
      after 3 and 6-month durations. The investigators expect that, after an eight-week group
      intervention, there will be significant decrease of the psychological risk factors.
      Moreover, the therapeutic effects can be maintained during the three- and six-month
      follow-up.
