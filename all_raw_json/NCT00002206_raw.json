Patients should be considered recovered from such infectious episodes when\n             at least 2 weeks have elapsed following the cessation of parenteral antibiotic\n             therapy.\n\n          -  Evidence of a gastrointestinal malabsorption syndrome or inability to receive an\n             orally-administered medication.\n\n          -  A malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). (NOTE:\n\n          -  Patients with biopsy-confirmed KS are eligible, but must not have received any\n             systemic therapy (including chemotherapy) for KS within 4 weeks prior to study entry.\n\n             1. Antiretroviral therapy, including nucleoside analogues, nonnucleoside reverse\n             transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, or investigational antiretroviral\n             agents (antiretroviral therapy may be started after completion of the Day 35\n             follow-up visit).\n\n          -  Interferon (alpha, beta, or gamma) or interleukin (e.g., IL-2).\n\n          -  Aminoglycoside antibiotics, amphotericin B, cidofovir, diuretics, foscarnet,\n             ganciclovir, itraconazole, fluconazole, ketoconazole (topical allowed), isoniazid,\n             rifampin, rifabutin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, chemotherapeutic agents\n             (systemic), systemic corticosteroids, other agents with significant nephrotoxic\n             potential, other agents that inhibit or compete for elimination via active renal\n             tubular secretion (e.g., probenecid), and other investigational agents.\n\n             1. Treatment with any HIV protease inhibitor.\n\n          -  Treatment for more than a total of 2 weeks with any nucleoside or nonnucleoside\n             reverse transcriptase inhibitor antiretroviral agent.\n\n          -  Ongoing treatment with interferon (alpha, beta, or gamma), interleukins or other\n             immunomodulatory agents, systemic corticosteroids, or any investigational agents\n             except on sponsor's approval within 1 month prior to study entry.\n\n        Evidence of active substance abuse (including alcohol), as determined by the investigator,\n        that would preclude adequate compliance with the protocol."
