Determine the\n      pathologic complete response rate to this treatment regimen in this patient population. III.\n      Assess the side effects and toxicity profile of this treatment regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 5-10\n      minutes followed by cyclophosphamide IV over 5-10 minutes and docetaxel IV over 1 hour.\n      Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Within 5 weeks following completion of chemotherapy, operable\n      patients achieving complete or partial response undergo mastectomy, segmental mastectomy, or\n      lumpectomy with nodal dissection. Patients with positive surgical tumor margins may undergo\n      an additional surgical procedure. Patients are followed for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
