            "textblock": "Youth diagnosed with sickle cell disease (SCD) may have difficulty taking medication as\n      prescribed (adherence). Hydroxyurea (HU) is one medication that youth may take to help\n      manage SCD.  Electronic adherence monitoring is widely considered the gold standard in\n      objective adherence measurement. These monitors provide continuous, real-time records of\n      medication adherence and reveal problematic behavior patterns, including underdosing,\n      overdosing, delayed dosing, \"drug holidays\" (i.e. where individuals do not take medications\n      for a specified interval of time), and \"white coat\" adherence (i.e., a pattern of drug\n      adherence as a function of time where individuals display good adherence immediately before\n      and after clinic attendance with worsening adherence in the period between).\n\n      Overall, electronic adherence measures are considered valid, reliable, and accurate, with\n      clear advantages over pharmacy refill records, physician estimates and self-report measures.\n      Currently, only one electronic measure capable of monitoring medications in both pill and\n      liquid form is being manufactured: WisePill and WiseBag. While data are limited regarding\n      its validity and reliability, preliminary data support the use of Wise technology to measure\n      adherence to medication. The current study will determine the Wise device's ability to\n      feasibly measure adherence to liquid and solid form HU medication in a pediatric SCD\n      population."

They will be asked to use the Wise\n      device over the following two months. A study team member will contact each participant by\n      phone within seven days of study enrollment to monitor participant use of the Wise device\n      and to answer any questions. Participants will be asked to return the Wise device in two\n      months at their normal clinic care visit. At this visit, participants will be asked to\n      complete two more questionnaires and, as part of standard clinical care, a pill count/bottle\n      weight will be completed by the pharmacy."
