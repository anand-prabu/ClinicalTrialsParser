The\n      Treatment consists of four or six 4-week cycles of induction therapy followed by intensive\n      therapy with auto-transplantation\u00b1modified VCD regimens and maintenance treatment with VD or\n      CTD/TD regimen. Then,patients will be followed up for 24 months after chemotherapy. The\n      investigators will record all the laboratory and clinical investigations to assess response\n      at different points of the study. We also monitor and assess adverse events (AEs), as graded\n      according to NCI-CTCAE Version 3.0.Response categories were based on the International\n      Myeloma Working Group uniform response criteria."
