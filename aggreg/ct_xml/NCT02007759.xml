  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the use of Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation
      (NMES) will provide a more efficient method of treating neonates with dysfunctional oral
      feeding such as dysphagia.  This study will attempt to determine if NMES applied to neonates
      at 36-42 weeks post-conception age (PCA) will decrease the need for nasogastric tubes (NG)
      and gastrostomy tubes (G-TUBE). Increase the rate at which these neonates complete full oral
      feeds, improve their swallowing skills, increase oral intake of calories, and gain weight.
