    <textblock>
      This randomized, multicenter, open-label study will evaluate the safety and effi cacy of
      DNIB0600A in comparison with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in pa tients with
      platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer or fall opian tube cancer.
      Patients will be randomized to receive either DNIB0600A 2.4 m g/kg intravenously every three
      weeks or PLD 40 mg/m2 intravenously every four we eks. Anticipated time on study treatment
      is until disease progression or unaccep table toxicity occurs.
