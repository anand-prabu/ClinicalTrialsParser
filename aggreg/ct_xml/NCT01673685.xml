  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) have limited activities of
      daily living (shopping, visiting friends, going for a walk) due to exertional dyspnoea.
      State Government funding provides up to 4 oxygen cylinders to be delivered to patients
      requiring portable oxygen per month.  However, the more active and motivated COPD patients
      often find these gratis supplies run out well before the month is up.  Recent technology has
      developed battery powered portable oxygen concentrators. The latest models weigh less than a
      typical oxygen cylinder and have the advantage that the battery plug can be plugged into a
      car cigarette lighter outlet, or into the power point of any house.  This means that the
      COPD patient has the potential to be far more mobile for far longer periods of time and
      visit friends almost infinitely by recharging the battery pack during the course of their
      travels.  The latest battery powered oxygen device weighs 2kgs which is about half that of
      an oxygen cylinder.  However, there is an upfront expense to these devices and inevitably a
      sound business case with cost considerations (amortization of the initial purchase price,
      recharging the battery costing the patient's electricity etc) needs consideration.  Also,
      before assuming these devices are superior (or at least as good as) oxygen cylinders,
      because they have a pulsed delivery of oxygen technology i.e. the oxygen is delivered in
      bursts with each inspiration that is detected, unlike oxygen cylinders which can run
      continuously, one cannot assume without rigourous evaluation that mobility and quality of
      life necessarily is good or superior with the new devices.  Hence, quality of life
      evaluation with emphasis on enjoyed activities by each COPD patient are essential as well as
      costing issues for the funding stakeholder (i.e. hospital site specific funds).  Should a
      sound business case be made (i.e. improved quality of life with less costs over a longer
      period of time), then a sound justification can be made to funding bodies that COPD patients
      are better off and the funding body is shouldering less cost by wider usage of these devices
      following evaluation of this project.  The design will be a randomised crossover such that
      COPD patients will spend one month on oxygen or battery powered concentrator devices and
      then switch over to the other oxygen delivery.  Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (Quality
      of Life) will be administered at the end of each month.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Outpatients diagnosed with stable COPD

          -  currently prescribed and using portable oxygen cylinders with a &quot;pulsed&quot; oxygen
             delivery for exertion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Co-morbidities such as: other major respiratory conditions, cardiac or other
             substantial co-morbidities which significantly limit mobility independent of COPD
