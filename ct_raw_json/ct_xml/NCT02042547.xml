      Before la surgery:

      Transthoracic cardiac echography will be done systematically, to measure among other things
      the size of the left atrium.

      During surgery:

      Surgery under extracorporeal circulation: tissue samples will be harvested from the right
      atrium (one before clamping of the aorta (T0= pre-ischemia sample), immediately before
      declamping of the aorta (T1= post-ischemia sample).

      Surgery without extracorporeal circulation: tissue samples from the right atrium before CABG
      (T0) and a second sample after CABG (T1).

      In parallel with the harvesting of cardiac tissue, blood samples will be taken at different
      times (H0, H3, H24) to correlate tissue data with systemic data. These will be taken by the
      anesthetists.

      After the surgery:

      Holter ECG will be set up for 7 days of continuous recording. Each patient will fill in an
      observation notebook. The biological samples will be analysed immediately and the biological
      data obtained will be recorded in the observation notebook.
