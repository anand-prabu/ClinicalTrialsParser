Courses repeat in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of TPA until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients\n      experiences dose limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 36 patients will be accrued for this study."
