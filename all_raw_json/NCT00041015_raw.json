Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is\n      not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating\n      extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare different chemotherapy regimens in treating\n      patients who have extensive-stage small cell lung cancer."

Patients are stratified\n      according to gender, ECOG performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2), lactate dehydrogenase (less than\n      1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) vs 1.5 times ULN or greater), and country. Patients\n      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral topotecan once daily on days 1-5 and cisplatin IV on day\n           5.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive cisplatin IV on day 1 and etoposide IV over at least 30\n           minutes on days 1-3.\n\n      Treatment in both arms repeats every 21 days for at least 4 courses in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, prior to each course, at 4 weeks after study, and\n      then every 4 weeks for 16 weeks.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, every 4 weeks for 16 weeks, and then every 3 months\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 760 patients (380 per treatment arm) will be accrued for\n      this study within 18 months."
