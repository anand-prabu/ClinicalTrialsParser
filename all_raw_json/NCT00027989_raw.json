Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression\n      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) receive 2 courses\n      beyond documentation of CR.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, on day 1 of each course, and then at the end of\n      study.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 75 patients will be accrued for this study."
