Subjects will be seen in the clinic at 3 and 7 days post-dose\n\n      A modified 3+3 design will be used to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on\n      the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) defined by Common Terminology Criteria for\n      Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.  Additional specific DLTs will be defined as: 1) Hypoxia, defined\n      as a non-artifactual drop in pulse oximetry to < 90% on room air, 2) A decrease in forced\n      expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 12% or greater compared to the last observation\n      prior to dosing, 3) Any  evidence of bronchospasm or wheezing requiring medical\n      intervention.  Doses will be doubled until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD- defined as the\n      largest dose with 0/6 or 1/6 DLTs) is reached."
