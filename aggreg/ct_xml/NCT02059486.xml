      This study uses a randomized controlled design to compare the impacts of the Teen Choice
      Program to the &quot;business-as-usual&quot; school curriculum. The Teen Choice curriculum is designed
      for adolescents aged 12 to 19 and will be delivered in different formats that range in
      length from 6 to 12 weeks. Teen Choice will be offered during the regular school day to
      middle and high school aged youth. This study is being conducted as part of the national
      Personal Responsibility Education Program evaluation funded by Administration for Children
      and Families within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
