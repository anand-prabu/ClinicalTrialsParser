Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or\n      die. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy is more\n      effective than radiation therapy alone in treating patients with low-grade glioma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II/III trial to evaluate observation and to compare the effectiveness of\n      radiation therapy with or without combination chemotherapy in treating patients with\n      low-grade glioma."

Patients are stratified according to tumor subtype\n      (astrocytoma [mixed-astro dominant or equal astro/oligo mix] vs oligodendroglioma\n      [mixed-oligo dominant]), age (younger than 40 vs at least 40), Karnofsky performance status\n      (60-80% vs 90-100%), and contrast enhancement on preoperative scan (present vs absent).\n      Patients with low-risk disease (younger than 40 years old whose tumors have been surgically\n      removed) are assigned to arm I. Patients with high-risk disease (at least 40 years old or\n      who have had incomplete tumor removal) are randomized to arm II or III.\n\n        -  Arm I (low-risk patients): Patients are observed. Patients may receive treatment if\n           tumor recurs.\n\n        -  Arm II (high-risk patients): Patients receive daily external beam radiotherapy 5 days a\n           week for 6 weeks.\n\n        -  Arm III (high-risk patients): Patients receive radiotherapy as in arm II followed by\n           chemotherapy 1 month later. Chemotherapy consists of oral lomustine on day 1,\n           vincristine IV on days 8 and 29, and oral procarbazine on days 8-21. Each course of\n           chemotherapy lasts 8 weeks. Patients may receive up to 6 courses of chemotherapy.\n\n      Patients are followed every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 252 patients will be accrued within 5.25 years."
