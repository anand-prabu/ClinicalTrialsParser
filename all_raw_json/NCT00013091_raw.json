            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      Post-traumatic stress disorder is a mental health problem of enormous proportion within the\n      VA system for both male and female veterans.  The 40 percent of veterans with PTSD and\n      concurrent clinically significant depression are particularly difficult to treat. Effective\n      and efficient treatment of veterans with this combination of disorders would be of benefit\n      to a significant number of veterans.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      Well-validated treatments of PTSD and its complications are rare.  There are no studies of\n      treatment addressing the sequelae of chronic PTSD, including depressive symptomatology. Our\n      study is the first randomized, controlled study of group psychosocial interventions for the\n      combination of PTSD and depression in male and female veterans.  The purpose of the study is\n      to evaluate the impact of two psychosocial interventions on clinical outcomes and on the use\n      of hospital resources by veterans with these co-existing disorders.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      Male and female veterans with both PTSD and depressive diagnoses will be recruited for the\n      study.  Male veterans must have combat-related PTSD, and female veterans will have trauma\n      related to sexual assault.  Veterans will be randomly assigned to either Self-Management\n      Therapy (Rehm, 1984), a cognitive-behavioral treatment program for depression, or to a\n      Psychoeducational Group Therapy (Dunn, et al., 1998).  Both programs involve short-term\n      group therapies that teach veterans about their disorders, and provide them with new\n      strategies and skills for overcoming them. These therapy groups will be in addition to other\n      standard care that veterans receive within the Trauma Recovery Program at the Houston VA\n      Medical Center.  Approximately 120 male veterans and 60 female veterans will be enrolled in\n      the program.  Participants will be assessed at pretest, posttest, and at 3-, 6-, and\n      12-month follow-up periods, utilizing various clinician-administered and self-report\n      instruments of psychiatric symptomatology, psychosocial functioning, constructs targeted by\n      the therapy groups, treatment compliances, and satisfaction.\n\n      Status:\n\n      Final report preparation."
