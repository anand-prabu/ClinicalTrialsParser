  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health information technology, including health information exchange, offers the potential
      to improve care by providing an integrated view of relevant, integrated patient information
      from multiple health care providers practicing in multiple sites. However, realizing that
      potential can be difficult, particularly with respect sensitive information. Increasingly,
      patients, patient advocate groups, and even the National Coordinator for Health Information
      Technology (ONC) are pushing for patients to have more granular control over specifically
      who can see what personal health information (PHI) in their electronic health records
      (EHRs).

      This will be a demonstration project aimed at showing the initial feasibility a system
      allowing patient controls on their EHR data system, Advanced Data Access Control (ADAC).
      Because of the exploratory nature of the research, the investigators do not have specific
      hypotheses. The investigators hope that this demonstration and feasibility project will lead
      to more extensive prospective evaluations of ADAC and other tools for enhancing patient
      control over access to their EHRs.
