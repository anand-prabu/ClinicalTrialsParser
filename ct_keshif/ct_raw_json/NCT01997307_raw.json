Eligible are women and\n      men with a 2:1 enrolment ratio.\n\n      Patients will be stratified according to gender and age, including four age categories:\n      55-64, 65-74, 75-85 and >85 years. Each age category will include 200 patients, and\n      enrolment in each category will be stopped once this number has been reached.\n\n      A specific electronic web-based CRF will collect clinical and procedural data. Clinical data\n      input will take place at the participating Centers. Angiographic data input will be\n      performed at rthe angiographic corelab, blinded of clinical data.\n\n      The e-CRF will collect data on\n\n        -  the characteristics of the ACS\n\n        -  the relevant risk factors for CAD and known prognostically relevant variables\n\n        -  prior clinical history (prior MI, PCI, CABG, heart failure, stroke)\n\n        -  in women fertility history will be captured by specific items, including age at first\n           and last menstrual period, past use of oral contraceptives, ongoing and past hormone\n           replacement therapy (HRT) and whether they had undergone a hysterectomy and/or\n           oophorectomy, as well as information on the number of full-term pregnancies (the sum of\n           live births and stillbirths). Age at menarche is defined as the age at the first\n           menstrual period. Reproductive life span is automatically calculated calculated by\n           subtracting the age at menarche from the age at menopause. The presence of hot flushes,\n           their severity and duration in years will be also captured.\n\n      The extent of coronary artery disease will be evaluated at a central corelab using the\n      Gensini score and the SYNTAX score"
