  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to design and validate a force-measuring platform that will
      measure the magnitude and duration of the load experienced by the lower extremities of
      individuals with a neuromuscular disability who use a stationary assisted standing device to
      increase their Bone Mineral Density.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-ambulatory children with a neuromuscular disability are at significant risk for poor
      bone health as reflected by low bone mineral density (BMD) and increased propensity to
      fracture. In large part, this is due to abnormally low levels of load experienced by the
      skeleton. A common approach for increasing BMD is to stimulate the musculoskeletal system by
      increasing the amount and duration of weight-bearing in the lower extremities. For
      non-ambulatory individuals, this typically takes the form of using an assisted standing
      device to enable the child to spend time in a standing position so that their lower limbs
      can experience some degree of body weight. Some of these physical interventions result in
      varying degrees of improvement in BMD, and some do not. This lack of clarity in outcomes may
      result from a failure to objectively measure the magnitude and duration of the load
      experienced by the lower extremities. A lack of change in BMD may be due to the extremities
      experiencing only a fraction of the body weight due to load-sharing with the assistive
      device, or to an inadequate duration of standing time. The goal of this project will be to
      design and validate a force-measuring platform that will measure the magnitude and duration
      of the load experienced by the lower extremities of individuals with a neuromuscular
      disability who use a stationary assisted standing device to increase their BMD.

    <description>The CPCHILDÂ© measures caregivers' perspectives on the health status, comfort, well being, functional abilities and ease of caregiving of children with severe developmental disabilities. It was developed to measure the effectiveness of interventions intended to improve or preserve these outcomes for children with severe disabilities, including non-ambulant children with severe cerebral palsy, and traumatic or other acquired brain injuries.  This will help determine if care-givers perception of health status changes with changes in standing magnitude and duration.</description>
