  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised control trial to assess the benefits of using patient specific
      instrumentation in total knee replacement surgery.  Patient specific instrumentation is an
      individualised system for total knee replacement surgery.  The system has been marketed and
      is already in use in some centres. The type of implant used remains the same but the sizing
      of the components, and alignment of the implant is expected to improve.  This study assesses
      any improvement in implant alignment in using the patient specific instrumentation, any
      improved intra-operative outcomes and any long term  clinical outcome improvements for
      patients.

      This is a randomised control trial to assess the benefits of using patient specific
      instrumentation in total knee replacement surgery.  Patient specific instrumentation is an
      individualised system for total knee replacement surgery.  The system has been marketed and
      is already in use in some centres. The process is similar to traditional knee replacement
      surgery but approximately 6 weeks prior to the operation patients will undergo an MRI scan
      of their knee, hip and ankle.  From this data the dimensions and rotation of the knee can be
      accurately measured, and a custom made jig can be made specific to that patients anatomy.
      The jig is used intra-operatively to make accurate bone cuts according to this pre-operative
      plan, the type of implant used remains the same but the sizing of the components, and
      alignment of the implant is expected to improve.  This study assesses any improvement in
      implant alignment in using the patient specific instrumentation, any improved
      intra-operative outcomes and any long term  clinical outcome improvements for patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females aged 18-75 years at time of surgery.

          -  Those presenting with primary or secondary osteoarthritis and/or rheumatoid arthritis
             of the knee.

          -  Those deemed capable of giving informed consent, understanding the aims of the study
             and expressing willingness to comply with the post-operative review programme.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women.

             five years due to the pre-existing medical condition.

          -  Previous knee surgery including those already treated by with a total knee
             replacement (i.e. requiring a revision knee replacement).
