    <textblock>
      The purposes of this international post-marketing observational program is to investigate
      effectiveness of betahistine dihydrochloride (Betaserc®) tablets and assess the course of
      vestibular vertigo after treatment discontinuation in population of Russia and Ukraine
      outpatients suffering from vestibular vertigo in pragmatic clinical settings. Exploratory
      analyses of results from both participating countries may be expected to provide insights
      about the subjective circumstances of vestibular vertigo patients in a wider than usual
      range of gender, underlying ICD-10 diagnosis, national and cultural situations.

      A prospective, multicentre, non-interventional, non-randomized, non-controlled, single arm,
      post-marketing observational program in patients whom betahistine dihydrochloride
      (Betaserc®) tablets were prescribed in the usual manner at the maximal recommended daily
      dose of 48 mg in accordance with the locally approved label. Over a program period physician
      is free to adjust betahistine dihydrochloride dose according to country approved label.
      Adult outpatients with vestibular vertigo who can be treated with betahistine
      dihydrochloride as per the locally approved label will be enrolled in the program. The
      program consists of an observational treatment period (up to 2 months) and a follow-up
      period (up to 2 months, for evaluation of the course of vestibular vertigo after treatment
      completion).
