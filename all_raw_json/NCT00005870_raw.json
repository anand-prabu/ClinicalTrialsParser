It is not yet known whether nitrocamptothecin is more effective\n      than other chemotherapy for cancer of the pancreas.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of nitrocamptothecin with\n      that of other chemotherapy in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory cancer of\n      the pancreas."

Compare the overall survival, objective response rate, time to treatment\n      failure, and time to progression in patients with recurrent or refractory adenocarcinoma of\n      the pancreas treated with oral nitrocamptothecin vs most appropriate chemotherapy. II.\n      Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified\n      according to Karnofsky performance status (50-70% vs greater than 70%). Patients are\n      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin on days\n      1-5. Treatment repeats every week for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease after week 8 may receive\n      additional courses. Arm II: Patients are stratified according to most appropriate therapy\n      possible (mitomycin or investigator's choice (including best supportive care) vs gemcitabine\n      vs fluorouracil). Patients who previously received fluorouracil and gemcitabine with or\n      without radiotherapy receive mitomycin or the investigator's choice of any proven or\n      experimental chemotherapy regimen previously submitted to the sponsor. Patients who\n      previously received fluorouracil only, other chemotherapy only, or fluorouracil with other\n      chemotherapy receive a proven or experimental regimen comprising gemcitabine. Patients who\n      previously received gemcitabine with other chemotherapy receive a proven or experimental\n      regimen comprising fluorouracil. Patients with stable or responding disease after week 8 may\n      receive additional courses if medically indicated. Patients for whom these drugs are not\n      indicated may receive best supportive care. At the time of disease progression, patients may\n      receive treatment with nitrocamptothecin. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year or\n      until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 400 patients (200 per arm) will be accrued for this study\n      within 15 months."
