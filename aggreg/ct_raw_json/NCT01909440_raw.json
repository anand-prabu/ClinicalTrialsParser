To determine feasibility of conducting a resistance training (RT) and supplementation\n      program in this population, determine patient adherence and inter-patient variability, and\n      estimate the necessary effect sizes for a larger study.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To examine the effects of a high intensity RT program, with and without whey protein\n      supplement (WPS), on lean body mass (LBM). Enhancing LBM will increase muscle strength,\n      endurance, and physical function leading to improved quality of life.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To examine the effects of a high intensity RT program with and without WPS on muscle\n      strength, endurance, physical function, and quality of life.\n\n      II. To examine changes in lymphocyte glutathione (GSH) and the pharmacodynamics of WPS with\n      and without high intensity RT.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 arms. ARM I: Patients receive whole body\n      high-intensity RT thrice weekly and whey protein supplementation orally (PO) daily for 12\n      weeks.\n\n      ARM II: Patients receive whole body RT as in Arm I.\n\n      ARM III: Patients receive whey protein supplementation as in Arm I.\n\n      ARM IV: Patients receive no intervention for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, patients may receive\n      whole body RT as in Arm II.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically."
