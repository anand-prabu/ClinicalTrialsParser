Patients are assessed for safety and tolerability during Weeks 2, 6, and 10. At Week\n      10, efficacy assessments are also made. For those who volunteer, a sample of cerebrospinal\n      fluid is obtained at baseline and at Week 10. Blood samples for CPI-1189 pharmacokinetic\n      trough measurements are taken at Weeks 2 and 10. The open-label phase starts at Week 11. At\n      Weeks 13 and 16, a safety evaluation is performed. At the end of the open-label phase, Week\n      22, a final set of safety and efficacy assessments and a blood sample for CPI-1189\n      pharmacokinetic trough measurement are obtained."
