Acute illness within the preceding 30 days that, in the opinion of the investigator,\n             could pose a threat or harm to the participant or obscure laboratory test results or\n             interpretation of data on exposure to vedolizumab (eg, mononucleosis).\n\n         12. Any history of malignancy, except for the following: (a) adequately-treated\n             nonmetastatic basal cell skin cancer; (b) squamous cell skin cancer that has been\n             adequately treated and that has not recurred for at least 1 year prior to enrollment;\n             and (c) history of cervical carcinoma in situ that has been adequately treated and\n             that has not recurred for at least 3 years before enrollment.\n\n         13. Had a surgical procedure requiring general anesthesia within 30 days before the\n             initial Screening visit or is planning to undergo a surgery that requires general\n             anesthesia during the study period. Minor surgeries that are medically necessary and\n             that do not require general anesthesia may be allowable during the study period.\n\n         14. One or more positive responses on the PML subjective symptom checklist at screening\n             or before dosing on Day 1.\n\n         15. Blood donation within 60 days before screening.\n\n         16. Unable to attend all study days or comply with protocol requirements.\n\n         17.
