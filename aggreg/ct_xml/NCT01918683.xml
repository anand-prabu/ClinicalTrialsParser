    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to be the initial prospective pilot investigation of the
      effectiveness of combined SBRT and TACE as bridging therapy for HCC patients awaiting liver
      transplanation. No prospective clinical trials regarding the combination of TACE and SBRT in
      pre-transplant population have been performed. We propose the trial be conducted as a pilot
      clinical trial with the goal of enrolling 40 patients into each arm

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of stereotatic body
      radiotherapy (SBRT) tand transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is an effective &quot;bridging
      therapy&quot; for patients hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of the liver awaiting transplantation.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Capable of giving informed consent; diagnosed with HCC and listed for OTL at the
        participating institution in accordance with OPTN guidelines(single tumor less than 5cm;up
        to 3 tumors all less than 3cm; no gross vascular invasion or regional nodal or distant
        metastasis); age equal to or greater than 18 years old; albumin greater than 2.4g/dL;
        total bilirubin less than 2 mg/dL; INR less than or equal to + 1.5; creatinine less than
        2.0mg/dL; Child's class A or B7; ECOG 0 or 1 All subjects who meet the above criteria and
        are referred for bridging TACE prior to OTL at Penn will be approached for participation
        in this study. There are no plans to limit participation based on age or gender.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior radiotherapy to the upper abdomen; Prior TACE, RFA, or liver transplant; Active
             GI bleed within 2 weeks of study enrollment; active GI ulcer disease within 4 weeks
             of study enrollment; ascites refractory to medical therapy; contraindication to
             receiving radiotherapy or TACE; complete obstruction of portal venous flow to the
             segment of liver that includes the target lesion; contraindication to both contrast
             enhanced MRI and contrast enhanced CT (i.e., unable to undergo follow-up imaging or
             SBRT treatment planning); women who are pregnant; participation in another concurrent
             treatment protocol. There will be no exclusion based on other factors.
