So the investigators can draw\n      the conclusion that the anatomy method with the guide of  right portal pedicle and\n      Rouviere's sulcus is useful in laparoscopic cholecystectomy."

In some patients, the lips of the sulcus are partially fused, with only a small cleft\n      visible laterally. The sulcus indicates reliably the plane of the common bile duct;\n      dissection may be started safely by division of the peritoneum immediately ventral to the\n      sulcus and continued in a triangle bounded by the liver surface, the neck of the gallbladder\n      and the plane of the sulcus. Even if the bile duct is tented upwards by the traction that\n      has been exerted on the gallbladder, dissection will be safely ventral to the plane of the\n      duct. Posterior branches of the cystic artery, may lie in the area of dissection and must be\n      identified with care.Once a plane has been opened posteriorly, attention may be turned to\n      the anterior dissection, using the posterior landmarks as a guide. The anterior and\n      posterior dissections can then be made to meet, thus opening the hepatobiliary triangle\n      completely.\n\n      Surgical procedures(Control group ):A small periumbilical incision is made, with the\n      location and orientation depending on the patient's body habitus and cosmetic\n      considerations.The laparoscope is used to explore the abdomen for adhesions and potential\n      injuries that may have occurred during port placement\uff0cratcheted grasper is inserted through\n      the lateral 5-mm port to retract the gallbladder fundus in cephalad fashion. An atraumatic\n      grasper is inserted through the middle 5-mm port to retract the gallbladder infundibulum\n      laterally, exposing the anteromedial aspect of the triangle of Calot. A hook cautery is used\n      to carefully incise the peritoneum overlying the triangle of Calot, continuing along the\n      medial aspect of the proximal gallbladder. As the infundibulum is retracted superomedially,\n      peritoneum overlying the posterolateral aspect of the triangle of Calot is similarly incised\n      using hook cautery. All remaining connective tissue is dissected out of the triangle of\n      Calot using blunt dissection and hook cautery as needed to fully mobilize the gallbladder\n      infundibulum."
