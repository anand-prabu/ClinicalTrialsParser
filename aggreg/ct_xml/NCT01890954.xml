      The purpose of this study is to use a closed-loop Control-to-Range (CTR) system in
      adolescents with type 1 diabetes in an outpatient setting, and to evaluate the CTR system's
      ability to significantly improve blood glucose levels when an insulin bolus is omitted for a
      30 gram carbohydrate snack and when insulin bolus is insufficient for the amount of
      carbohydrates consumed for a meal. The primary objective of this study is to use a
      closed-loop Control-to-Range (CTR) system to significantly reduce the post-prandial blood
      glucose excursion in adolescents with type 1 diabetes who omit and/or under-bolus insulin
      for either snacks or meals. Up to 20 subjects aged ≥13 and ≤18 years old will be tested.

      The purpose of this study is to use a closed-loop Control-to-Range (CTR) system in
      adolescents with type 1 diabetes in an outpatient setting, and to evaluate the CTR system's
      ability to significantly improve blood glucose levels when an insulin bolus is omitted for a
      30 gram carbohydrate snack and when insulin bolus is insufficient for the amount of
      carbohydrates consumed for a meal. The CTR system is comprised of two algorithmic layers:
      (i) A Safety Supervision Module (SSM) which contains a predictive insulin request dampener
      (or brakes); (ii) a Range Correction Module (RCM), consisting in (a) a Hyperglycemia
      Mitigation System, and (b) Insulin on Board controller. Both modules will receive continuous
      glucose monitoring (CGM) and historical insulin delivery data. The SSM will monitor the
      safety of the subject's continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump (CSII) to prevent
      hypoglycemia. The RCM will be responsible for optimizing blood glucose (BG) control and
      mitigating postprandial hyperglycemic excursions through a mix of increased basal rate and,
      potentially, isolated insulin boluses. To run CTR, we will use our wearable artificial
      pancreas platform, known as DiAs (Diabetes Assistant) which consists of a smart phone
      running CTR and connected to standard insulin delivery and CGM devices.
