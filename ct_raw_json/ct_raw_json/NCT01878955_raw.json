            "textblock": "AMH is a member of the transforming growth factor family. It is produced by the granulosa\n      cells from 36th weeks of pregnancy.Ovarian granulosa cells are the only source of the\n      antim\u00fcllerian hormone. AMH production continues until response to exogenous FSH occurs and\n      follicles reach 4-6 mm in diameter.The number of follicles in patients with polycystic\n      ovaries are 2-6 times higher than normal women. Serum AMH levels are 2-3 times higher in\n      patients with PCOS. The cause of elevated serum AMH levels in patients with PCOS is unknown.\n      There are data showing elevated serum AMH level is due to the increase in the number of\n      follicles 2-8 mm in diameter. Although there is no precise definition; multicystic ovarian\n      is defined by the presence of more than six follicles 4-9 mm in diameter and mixed\n      morphologically with PCO. PCO and multicystic ovaries are distinguished by the absence of\n      the increase in stroma / volume.The aim of this study is to investigate whether there is a\n      difference of serum AMH levels between patients with PCO or multicystic ovaries. A primary\n      goal is to investigate the usability of AMH as a marker besides ultrasound for\n      discrimination of nonhyperandrogenic patients with PCO or multicystic ovaries."
