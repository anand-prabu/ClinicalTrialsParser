  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      FOLFOXIRI/Avastin (bevacizumab) regimens (concurrent and sequential) versus FOLFOX/Avastin
      in first-line in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients will be randomized to
      receive Avastin 5 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks with either concurrent or sequential
      FOLFOXIRI or with FOLFOX for 4 to 6 months of induction therapy, followed by maintenance
      therapy with Avastin plus either leucovorin/5-fluorouracil or capecitabine until disease
      progression occurs. After disease progression, patients will receive treatment with a
      fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy plus Avastin.

          -  Inadequately controlled hypertension
