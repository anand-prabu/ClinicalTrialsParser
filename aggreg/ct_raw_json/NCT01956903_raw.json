Ethical considerations:\n\n             -  The study will be conducted in accordance with the requirements expressed in the\n                Declaration of Helsinki (Hong Kong revision, September 1989) and following the\n                recommendations of the Good Clinical Practice of the Clinical Trials (document\n                111/3976/88, July 1990 ) and Spanish legislation (Royal Decree 561/1993, published\n                in April 16th Official State Bulletin \"BOE\"; May 13th, 1993) laying down the\n                requirements for conducting clinical drug trials.\n\n             -  Every subject will receive a written document called \"Patient Information Sheet\"\n                that contains information about the following aspects of clinical trial: a) Aim of\n                the study, methodology, study treatment and alternative therapies, expected\n                benefits for himself or society, risks of the study and possible adverse events,\n                number of visits and additional tests.\n\n                b) Voluntary nature of their participation and ability to withdraw at any time,\n                without thereby altering the doctor-patient relationship.\n\n                c) People who have access to the data of the volunteer and how they maintain the\n                confidentiality of the data.\n\n                d) How to contact with the investigator if necessary.\n\n             -  The investigator will obtain the informed consent of the subject or, failing that,\n                from a legal representative.

Statistical Analysis:\n\n             -  Baseline data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and demographics\n                (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and number of valid cases)\n                for quantitative variables and absolute and relative frequencies for categorical\n                variables.\n\n             -  The primary efficacy objective is to determine the response rate of graft versus\n                host disease (confidence intervals 95%).\n\n             -  The primary safety objective is to determine the incidence of adverse events and\n                toxicity related to the administration of the CSM (confidence intervals 95%).\n\n             -  Secondary objectives: analyze overall survival and disease-free survival by the\n                Kaplan-Meier method."
