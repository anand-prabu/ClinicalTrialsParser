Healthy status is defined by absence of evidence of\n             any active or chronic disease following a detailed medical and surgical history, a\n             complete physical examination including vital signs, 12-lead ECG, hematology, blood\n             chemistry, and urinalysis.\n\n          -  Serum ferritin >20ng/mL, hemoglobin >125g/l, and erythrocyte indices within normal\n             range of the clinical laboratory at the Screening Visit and on Day -1: packed cell\n             volume, mean corpuscular volume, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, or\n             deemed not clinically significant by the investigator.\n\n          -  Subject is willing to comply with any applicable contraceptive requirements of the\n             protocol and is:\n\n          -  Male, or\n\n          -  Female of non-childbearing potential (defined as a female who is post-menopausal\n             [amenorrhea for at least 12 consecutive months] or surgically sterile [hysterectomy,\n             bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy]) and at\n             least 6 weeks post-sterilization\n\n          -  Non-pregnant, non-lactating female\n\n          -  At least 90 days post-partum or nulliparous (females only).\n\n          -  An understanding, ability, and willingness to fully comply with study procedures and\n             restrictions.\n\n          -  Ability to provide written, personally signed, and dated informed consent to\n             participate in the study, in accordance with International Conference on\n             Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice Guideline E6 (1996) and applicable regulations,\n             before completing any study-related procedures.\n\n          -  Body mass index between 18.5-30.0kg/m\u00b2 inclusive.
