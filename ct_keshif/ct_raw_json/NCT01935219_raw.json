The ultimate purpose of our research is to\n      develop interventions to help maintain older adults' mobility in order to assist their\n      'aging at home'. The planned study will assess the effectiveness of an intervention that\n      includes Goal Management Training + processing speed training (using DriveSharp software),\n      which is designed to address both executive function and processing speed changes that\n      contribute to poor driving performance in people with diagnosed mild cognitive impairment.\n      The investigators will measure the effectiveness of the intervention on driving performance,\n      sustained attention, divided attention, executive function, depressive symptoms and quality\n      of life."
