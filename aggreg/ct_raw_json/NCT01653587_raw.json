However, the desired reduction of the recurrence of ischemic events has\n      as complication an increased incidence of bleeding. Since arterial puncture followed by the\n      insertion of an introducer has become the standard method to perform invasive cardiovascular\n      procedures, complications related to vascular access have become an important bleeding site.\n\n      Among the strategies to decrease vascular complications, the transradial approach is a well\n      stablished alternative to the transfemoral approach. For its part, vascular closure devices\n      were introduced to decrease vascular complications, homeostasis time and ambulation time of\n      patients submitted to invasive procedures by the transfemoral access. Rapidly incorporated\n      to the clinical practice, such devices to date have shown conflicting results with regard to\n      their safety and efficacy. The inconsistency of data proving its safety limits its routine\n      adoption as strategy to prevent vascular complications, requiring evidences through\n      adequately designed randomized studies for this end."
