    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Clinical investigation is to assess the impact of the Multi Point Pacing
      (MPP) feature at 12 months in the treatment of patients not responding to standard Cardiac
      Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) after 6 months.

    <description>The primary endpoint of this study is evaluated at 12 months after enrollment and it is defined as the percentage of non-responder patients converted to responders after 6 months of MPP feature turned ON compared to baseline, as measured by Left Ventricular End Systolic Volume (LVESV) reduction of at least 15%.</description>
