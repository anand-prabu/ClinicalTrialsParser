  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of hormone contraception poses a significant challenge for the estimated 16 million
      HIV-infected women of childbearing age. This is due to known drug interactions with
      antiretroviral therapy (medicines used to treat HIV) that may jeopardize contraception
      effectiveness. By evaluating the impact of antiretroviral therapy on a levonorgestrel
      subdermal implant, the most widely available hormone implant in low and middle-income
      countries, this study will translate its findings into an evidence-based approach to
      co-manage these important medications. The investigators hypothesize that women receiving
      nevirapine or efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy will have a significant decrease in the
      mean levonorgestrel plasma concentration measured six months after the implant's insertion
      as compared to those women who are not taking antiretroviral therapy.  Although the
      implant's efficacy may be retained initially, the investigators propose that a decrease in
      levonorgestrel concentrations in women receiving antiretroviral therapy may jeopardize the
      implant's effectiveness near the end of its intended duration of use (5 years).

    <textblock>
      Family planning services, including hormone contraceptives, are critical for HIV-infected
      women, in whom prevention of unintended pregnancy not only decreases maternal and child
      mortality, but also reduces the risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission. Similarly,
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a lifesaving intervention that improves the health and
      economic status of HIV-infected women throughout the world. Therefore, it is of significant
      public health importance to guide the appropriate use these essential medications. To this
      end, millions of HIV-infected women in low and middle income countries (LMIC) currently use
      or are gaining access to subdermal progestin-containing implants as a preferred method of
      long-acting reversible contraception. These implants are often combined with ART despite the
      lack of critically needed pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-interaction data to inform their safe
      and effective concomitant use. Highlighting this concern are several case reports of
      unintended pregnancy that occurred in patients with subdermal progestin-containing implants
      concurrently receiving non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based ART, the
      most commonly used ART in LMICs. While NNRTIs are known to significantly decrease oral pill
      progestin concentrations, no data are available to inform healthcare providers of the impact
      of NNRTIs on progestin concentrations following release from subdermal implants. To fill
      this critical gap in knowledge, the overall aim of this proposal is to conduct a PK study to
      evaluate the combination of a levonorgestrel (LNG) implant and NNRTI (nevirapine or
      efavirenz)-based ART in HIV-infected Ugandan women. The investigators propose that lower LNG
      concentrations will be observed in patients on NNRTI-based ART and although the implant's
      efficacy may be retained initially, this negative interaction will jeopardize implant
      effectiveness near the end of its intended duration of use (5 years). The specific aims of
      this project are (1) to characterize the PK of LNG released from a subdermal implant over
      one year in HIV-infected women with and without NNRTI-based ART and (2) to evaluate the
      potential for a bidirectional drug-interaction resulting from the long-term impact of
      chronic progestin exposure on antiretroviral concentrations. To achieve these aims, this
      study will enroll 20 HIV-infected women into each of three study groups: a control group not
      receiving ART and two treatment arms consisting of patients receiving nevirapine- or
      efavirenz- based ART. Using sparse PK sampling strategies, LNG, nevirapine or efavirenz
      concentrations will be measured over one-year and compared between and within groups, as
      appropriate. The LNG data will also be used to develop a PK model that will predict LNG
      disposition over the following three years of intended use, allowing for identification of
      the safe duration of LNG implant use in women on NNRTI-based ART. At the conclusion of this
      project, the first evidence-based medical knowledge will be available to guide the safe and
      effective concomitant use of subdermal LNG implants and NNRTIs, thereby improving management
      of reproductive health in millions of HIV-infected women worldwide.
