Determine the\n      toxicity profile of this combination therapy in these patients. III. Assess the survival\n      rate of these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour followed by gemcitabine IV over 30\n      minutes. Patients receive treatment every other week for 8 weeks (4 courses). Patients may\n      continue treatment in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients\n      are followed every 12 weeks until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue approximately 10 patients per month for a maximum\n      of 33 patients."
