Initial information on safety and on some biological\n      effects when using THS 2.1 will be collected. Human Smoking Topography (HST) will be\n      explored."

After leaving the clinic on the Day of\n      Discharge, the subjects will be followed up for safety over a period of 7 days. All subjects\n      will receive smoking cessation advice at screening, at Day of Admission and at Day of\n      Discharge.\n\n      This clinical study will be conducted in compliance with International Conference on\n      Harmonisation of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use\n      (ICH Good Clinical Practice), the Declaration of Helsinki as amended in 2008, and the\n      applicable regulatory requirements."
