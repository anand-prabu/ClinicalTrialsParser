The first step\n      of the study is to learn the dose of ruxolitinib that is tolerable (bearable). It has\n      already been studied in a number of patients with different bone marrow diseases and is\n      approved for the treatment of a disease called Myelofibrosis; however, it is not approved\n      for treatment of CMML. It is given orally (by mouth). Most people tolerate it well but the\n      tolerability has not been determined in patients with CMML. We will be testing different\n      doses to determine how much of the medication people can tolerate (bear) before they develop\n      side effects."
