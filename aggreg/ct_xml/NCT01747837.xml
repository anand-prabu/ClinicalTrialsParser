      The goal of this trial is to determine the efficacy and safety of adjunctive catheter-based
      renal sympathetic denervation (RSDN) in the primary prevention of (implantable
      cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy in patients with ischemic or non-ischemic
      ventricular dysfunction, who are to receive an ICD for either i) secondary prevention, or
      ii) primary prevention + inducible VT by programmed ventricular stimulation at the time of
      ICD implantation. These patients will be randomized to ICD alone or ICD + RSDN.

      Rationale for this Study

      This study will specifically evaluate the safety and efficacy of RSDN in the prevention of
      ICD therapy in patients with ventricular dysfunction who are to receive an ICD for either
      secondary prevention, or primary prevention if they have inducible VT by programmed
      ventricular stimulation at the time of ICD implantation.

      Description of Procedures

      Screening:

      To take part in this study, you must meet all study requirements.  The screening visit tests
      and procedures are done to see if you are eligible to be in the study.  The study doctor
      will review these with you and let you know if you qualify.  The study doctor will make a
      final decision about your possible study qualification.

      Pre-randomization Procedures:

      After providing written consent the following data will be collected and examinations and
      tests performed:

        -  A physical examination

        -  Your blood pressure will be taken

        -  A review of your medical history and what medications you are taking

        -  A blood sample will be drawn for routine laboratory tests.

        -  Women who can have children will take a urine pregnancy test.  The test must be
           negative for you to be in this study.

        -  A Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE)-a non-invasive test where a probe is placed on the
           chest wall and images are taken through the chest wall of the heart valves and heart
           muscle, that will measure the left ventricular size (heart wall thickness) and mitral
           inflow (flow of blood through the heart valve).

        -  An ICD interrogation (if you already have an ICD implanted) - a non-invasive test where
           a device is placed over the chest wall near your ICD, and data is transmitted
           wirelessly from your ICD to a laptop for your physician to review.

        -  An electrocardiogram (EKG) - a non-invasive test where several probes are placed on the
           chest wall that will measure electrical activity in your heart.

      Randomization:

      Immediately following the catheter ablation, patients will undergo a renal angiogram in
      order to assess suitability for catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation.  A renal
      angiogram is an x-ray study of the blood vessels in the kidney to evaluate for blockage, and
      abnormalities that could be affecting the blood supply to the kidney.  It is performed by
      injecting contrast dye through a catheter (a tiny tube) into the blood vessels of the
      kidney.  The study doctor will assess whether the renal arteries are suitable to receive
      catheter-based renal denervation.  Once you agree to participate in this study, by signing
      this informed consent, and are it is determined that you are eligible to participate you
      will be randomized to one of two treatment groups immediately following the renal angiogram.

      Randomization means that you are put into a group by chance.  It is like flipping a coin.
      You will have an equal chance (50%) of being placed in either group.  This study design is
      single-blinded; you will not know ahead of time which group you will be in.  Only your
      physician will know which group you are randomized to.

      If you do not already have an ICD, you will undergo ICD placement as part of routine
      clinical care.  You may undergo ICD placement up to 1 month (30 days) before randomization.
      An ICD (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator) is a small battery-powered electrical
      impulse generator which is implanted in patients who are at risk of sudden cardiac death due
      to ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. The device is programmed to detect
      abnormal heart beats (cardiac arrhythmia) and correct it by delivering a jolt of
      electricity.

      The first group will undergo catheter-based sympathetic renal denervation.  Renal
      Sympathetic Denervation is a procedure that uses a catheter probe inserted into the renal
      (kidney) artery that deactivates the nerves that are linked to high blood pressure.

      The second group (control group) will receive no further intervention after ICD
      implantation.

    <description>Renal sympathetic denervation is modulation of the nerves which run along the renal arteries (the renal sympathetic nerves) with radiofrequency energy. This is the same energy source used to perform your heart ablation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ≥ 18 years of age

          -  Structural heart disease (post-MI, dilated cardiomyopathy, sarcoid myopathy,
             hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, etc.)

          -  Planned for ICD implantation for:

               -  i. Secondary prevention (eg: VT/VF arrest, sustained VT, syncope/inducible VT)

               -  ii. Primary prevention + inducible MMVT during induction via ICD lead testing

          -  Accessibility of renal vasculature (determined by renal angiography)

          -  Ability to understand the requirements of the study

          -  Willingness to adhere to study restrictions and comply with all post- procedural
             follow-up requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient taking a Class I or III antiarrhythmic drug.

          -  Planned to undergo a cardiac VT ablation procedure

          -  NYHA Class IV Congestive Heart Failure

          -  MI within 30 days

          -  Known renovascular abnormalities that would preclude RSDN (eg, renal artery stenosis,
             previous renal artery stenting or angioplasty)

          -  Baseline orthostatic hypotension

          -  GFR &lt; 45 ml/min (unless receiving dialysis)

          -  Life expectancy &lt;1 year for any medical condition
