In particular, it is uncertain whether the transient increase in plasma HIV-1 RNA is\n      due to enhanced replication of an actively replicating pool of HIV-1, or is due instead to\n      activation of proviral sequences in previously resting CD4+ cells. One approach to\n      discriminate these alternatives is a \"molecular pulse-chase\" experiment. In this approach,\n      drug resistant mutants would be selected by administration of Lamivudine (3TC)."
