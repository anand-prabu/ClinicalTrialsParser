A patient interactive cell phone disease management system plus a community health\n           worker (CHW) is superior to either a cell phone system or a CHW alone to activate DM2\n           Medicaid patients to improve a composite of 7 Wellness Behaviors and 6 Clinical Goals.\n\n        2. A patient interactive cell phone disease management system will activate Medicaid\n           patients with type 2 diabetes (DM2) to improve the composite of 7 wellness behaviors\n           and 6 clinical outcomes by 25% or greater compared to baseline\n\n      Expected Outcomes:\n\n      Primary outcomes:\n\n        1. Superior improvement over baseline of the composite of Wellness Behaviors and Clinical\n           Outcomes in the CHW plus C4L group compared to the CHW alone and cell phone alone\n           groups.\n\n        2. Improvement by 25% or greater over baseline of the composite of Wellness Behaviors and\n           Clinical Outcomes for patients using C4L  alone.\n\n      Secondary outcomes:\n\n      Improvement in both clinical and behavior endpoints. Endpoints to be compared across the\n      three treatment arms include:\n\n        1. % patients meeting the modified HEDIS1 goals,\n\n        2. mean A1c,\n\n        3. average BP if hypertensive\n\n        4. emergency room visits\n\n        5. hospitalizations\n\n        6. unscheduled acute care clinic visits\n\n        7. # of target medication adjustments,\n\n        8. patient level of self activation in the management of DM2 (PAM-13 questionnaire),\n\n        9. patient utilization of and satisfaction with the support provided by CHWs alone, C4L\n           alone and the combined CHW/C4L approach,\n\n       10. medication adherence,\n\n       11. healthcare team utilization of and satisfaction with the CHW alone versus the Voxiva\n           system alone versus the combined  CHW/C4L care model.\n\n      Anticipated results and impact on healthcare:\n\n      Mobile health has great potential to enhance DM2 patient health behaviors and clinical\n      outcomes both alone and, even better, with assistance of a CHW. mHealth systems can be\n      provided to a wide range of urban and rural DM2 patients resulting in an affordable, a more\n      efficient patient-driven/centered health delivery system."
