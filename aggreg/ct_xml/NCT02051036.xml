  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of
      moxibustion therapy on benign prostate hyperplasia(BPH) patients with moderate to severe
      lower urinary tract symptoms(LUTS).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who diagnosed as BPH with moderate to severe LUTS aged 20 to 80 years old will be
      divided into two groups, one is moxibustion plus conventional therapy group and the other is
      conventional therapy group.

      Patients who belong to moxibustion plus conventional therapy group will be treated
      moxibustion for eight times by a Korean Medicine doctor with conventional therapy by a
      urologist.

      Patients who belong to conventional therapy group will be treated with conventional therapy
      only, and they can receive moxibustion therapy after the clinical trial is finished.

      IPSS,  post void residual volume (PVR) and peak urine flow (Qmax) will be checked to
      evaluate the effectiveness and safety.

    <description>In the moxibustion treatment group, 5 moxibustion points (bilateral SP6, LV3 and unilateral CV4) will be heated with indirect moxibustion (KangHwa, Korea).
The moxa pillars will be removed when the patient feel hotness and require to remove them.
The moxibustion will be conducted repeatedly unless patients feel the sense of heat up to seven times per session.</description>
