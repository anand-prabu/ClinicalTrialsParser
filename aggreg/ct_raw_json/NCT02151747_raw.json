Next generation sequencing\n      (NGS) is a high-throughput parallel sequencing that can provide genetic information with\n      high accuracy. NGS is a faster and cost-effective method to detect gene mutations compared\n      to Sanger sequencing. In this study, we evaluated the clinical role of NGS testing for BRCA\n      1/2 compared to Sanger sequencing."
