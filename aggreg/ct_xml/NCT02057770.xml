  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how overall health status and how disease responds to a
      type of transplant called a haploidentical stem cell transplant when followed with a couple
      of doses of a drug called cyclophosphamide in patients with acute myeloid leukemia that has
      relapsed after a complete remission or that has never fully responded to therapy. When a
      patient cannot find a donor who exactly matches their tissue type, half-matched related
      (haploidentical) donors, who are first degree relatives such as siblings, children, or
      parents, may be used. In the past, people who have undergone haploidentical stem cell
      transplant have been more likely to experience complications such as rejection of the stem
      cell transplant or severe graft-versus host disease (GVHD). Giving cyclophosphamide after
      haploidentical stem cell transplant may improve the outcomes of the transplant.
