It is not known whether laparoscopic\n      surgery is more effective than standard surgery in treating endometrial cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying laparoscopic surgery to see how well it\n      works compared to standard surgery in treating patients with endometrial cancer or cancer of\n      the uterus."

Patients are randomized to 1 of 2\n      treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo vaginal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo- oophorectomy (BSO)\n           via laparoscopy.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo total abdominal hysterectomy and BSO via conventional\n           laparotomy.\n\n      Patients in both arms also undergo pelvic and para-aortic lymph node sampling. Quality of\n      life is assessed at baseline, at 1, 3, and 6 weeks, and then at 6 months.\n\n      Patients are followed at 6 weeks, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 3\n      years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,550 patients will be accrued for this study within at least\n      10 years."
