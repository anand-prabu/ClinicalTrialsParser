Teaching parents about these strategies in an enriching\n      setting such as prenatal education classes has the potential to increase utilization of\n      these strategies, and empower parents to take on a more active role in the management of\n      their infant's pain during routine immunization. Educating parents about pain-management for\n      infant immunization has not been previously investigated in this setting. The aim of this\n      cluster-randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of an immunization\n      pain-management education module added to the prenatal education program at Mount Sinai\n      Hospital on parental knowledge and behaviour regarding pain management during routine\n      2-month infant immunization injections."
