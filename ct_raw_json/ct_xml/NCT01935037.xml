  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study to see how useful investigational drug MK-1775 in combination with
      cisplatin is compared to cisplatin alone in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous
      cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

      Chemotherapy is toxic to tumor cells. It prevents the tumor cells from multiplying by
      damaging their DNA, which in turn stops the tumor from growing. However, a protein, called
      Wee1, may play a role in helping to repair damaged tumor cells, so that the tumor continues
      to grow.

      MK-1775 is a new drug which may block Wee1 protein activity. When given in combination with
      chemotherapy drug cisplatin, MK-1775 may help prevent the Wee1 protein from repairing
      damaged tumor cells without causing harm to normal cells. This is believed to increase the
      effectiveness of cisplatin.

      Participants will be randomized (assigned by chance, like flipping a coin) into 2 groups:
      Arm 1 - Cisplatin and MK-1775 or Arm 2 - Cisplatin and MK-1775 placebo (inactive substance
      that looks the same as MK-1775). Participants will have a 50% chance of being assigned to
      either arm.
