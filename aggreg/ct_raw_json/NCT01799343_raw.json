            "textblock": "Pregnant women with pre-eclampsia and growth restricted fetuses often have a reduced\n      function of the placenta. This is accompanied by an increased perinatal mortality and\n      morbidity.\n\n      By ultrasound it is possible to measure blood flow and vascular resistance in both the fetal\n      umbilical cord and in the blood vessels supplying the uterus. A high resistance in these\n      vessels occur before the child is severely affected.\n\n      By immersion in water extracellular fluid is redistributed back into the circulation, and\n      central blood volume increases. Previous studies have shown that maternal minute-volume\n      increases, while blood pressure drops slightly. Also an increased amniotic fluid has been\n      recorded. This has been interpreted as an expression of increased renal blood flow.\n      Immersion into water could increase blood flow in the vessels supplying the uterus and thus\n      increase blood flow to the child.\n\n      The investigators aim to clarify this by examining blood flow and resistance in the blood\n      vessel supplying the uterus and in the umbilical cord, while the participant is immersed\n      into water. Initially, 25 healthy women with an uncomplicated singleton pregnancy recruited\n      from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology: Hvidovre University Hospital, Denmark,\n      will be examined. The participant will act as its own control and measurements above water\n      and immersed will be conducted at the same study session.\n\n      Ultimately the investigators seek to contribute to a non-invasive option for prolonging\n      those pregnancies where the fetus and/or maternal condition requires delivery several weeks\n      before term, and where immersion of the pregnant woman in the water a few hours one to\n      several times daily, may prolong the pregnancy the required number of hours/days for\n      antenatal steroid treatment to be sufficient.\n\n      There are no risks associated with the study and the project team considers it ethical to\n      implement this. The study is not supported by pharmaceutical companies or other groups with\n      economic interests. The project group itself has taken the initiative to study."

            "textblock": "Intrauterine growth retardation and preeclampsia are major causes of neonatal mortality,\n      morbidity and later neurological sequelae. The conditions are associated with an increased\n      resistance to blood flow in the placenta, that can be detected by an increase in pulsatility\n      index (PI) in the umbilical artery (1).\n\n      When Doppler flow is assessed in the uterine arteries, increased resistance in the\n      uteroplacental circuit is indicated both by an increase in PI and by a change in the flow\n      velocity waveform, which can be seen as a \"notch\" in early diastole.\n\n      In the 2nd trimester, the invasion of trophoblasts and the remodeling of the uterine spiral\n      arteries are complete. Persistence of a bilateral notch beyond the 24th week of gestation is\n      associated with an increased risk of intrauterine growth retardation and preeclampsia. Even\n      though the risk persists, the notch usually disappears later in pregnancy (2).\n\n      When the non-pregnant body is immersed in water, extracellular fluid is redistributed back\n      into the circulation. Central blood volume, cardiac output, renal perfusion and urine output\n      increase and the blood pressure falls (3-7).\n\n      The same changes occur in the pregnant women. However the increased diuresis is strongly\n      correlated with the degree of the pregnancy edema, which decreases substantially (8), and\n      the amount of amniotic fluid increases (9). The changes all occur within minutes  (8), but\n      are transient and return to conditions before immersion within 1-2 hours after the pregnant\n      woman has come out of the water.\n\n      The changes in the above parameters are significant but less pronounced in pregnant women\n      with preeclampsia than in pregnant women without the condition (11). None of the experiments\n      showed changes in the fetal heart rate.\n\n      Because of the physiological changes that take place when pregnant women are immersed in\n      water, several authors have speculated whether immersion has a positive effect on the\n      uteroplacental circuit (8,10,12).\n\n      There are no published data on Doppler flow measurements in the umbilical artery and the\n      uterine arteries during water immersion.\n\n      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of immersion on the fetoplacental and\n      uteroplacental circuits in healthy pregnant women, using Doppler flow measurements in the\n      umbilical artery and uterine arteries.\n\n      Materials From the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Hvidovre University Hospital,\n      Denmark, we recruit 25 healthy women with an uncomplicated singleton pregnancy. Gestational\n      age was between 26 and 38 weeks. All participants will have a normal first trimester\n      combined screening and a normal second trimester ultrasound scan for fetal abnormalities.\n      Within the last 2 weeks prior to participation, fetal weight will be estimated, and only\n      woman with fetuses of normal weight (within the 95 percentile) will be included.\n\n      Methods The study is performed at the labor ward at Hvidovre Hospital, Denmark. If fetal\n      weight has not been estimated by an ultrasound examination within the last 2 weeks, fetal\n      weight will be estimated on the day of the study. In order to exclude an on-going infection,\n      the temperature is measured and the urine examined in all participants on the day of the\n      study.\n\n      The same experienced sonographer performs all examinations, and the same Bruel & Kjaer\n      ultrasound scanner, suitable for scanning under water, is used in all participants.\n\n      Each participant has five recordings of blood pressure, pulse, saturation, deepest vertical\n      pocket (DVP) of amniotic fluid and Doppler flow in the umbilical artery and uterine\n      arteries. All recordings are obtained during the same study session. Doppler ultrasound\n      measurements of umbilical and uterine arteries are obtained by pulsed wave ultrasound using\n      an insonating angle as close to 0 degrees as possible.  The Doppler measurements on the\n      uterine arteries are obtained approximately one centimeter from the crossing of the iliac\n      arteries. The pulsatility index (PI) is calculated automatically by the machine using the\n      formula (systolic velocity-diastolic velocity)/mean velocity. PI of the uterine artery is\n      calculated as the mean PI of the left and the right uterine artery.\n\n      For immersion, a regular bathtub is used. The tub is filled with thermo-neutral tap water\n      (35.0 \u00b0C +/- 0.5 \u00b0C). The temperature of the water is measured every 10 minutes, and kept\n      thermo-neutral during the period of immersion.\n\n      The participants are placed in a supine position outside the bathtub and the first\n      recordings are obtained (T0). Afterwards the participants are immersed in water, placed in a\n      supine position, and measurements are repeated after 5 min (T5) and 25 min (T25) in water.\n      All measurements are repeated with the participant in a supine position outside the bathtub\n      15 min (T40) and 30 min (T55) after immersion.\n\n      All recordings of Doppler flow curves and measurements of amniotic fluid (DVP) are saved on\n      an USB stick. An experienced specialist in fetal medicine, who is not present at the\n      investigation, validates each recording blindly. Any recording not eligible for approval is\n      redefined as a missing value.\n\n      Statistical analysis Because the measurements taken before, during and after immersion, are\n      made in the same patient during the same study session, and with the same ultrasound\n      apparatus, each participant act as their own control.\n\n      Data are expressed as means +/- standard error of the mean (SEM). The first recording, T0,\n      was defined as baseline. Comparisons between the respective recordings, T0-T55, are done\n      using a two-tailed paired t-test on raw data. P-values < 0.05 are considered significant.\n      For calculation,  STATA 12.1 (13) is used."
