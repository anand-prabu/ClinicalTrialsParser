Giving chemotherapy and low-dose TBI before a donor peripheral blood stem cell\n      transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune\n      system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. Also, monoclonal antibodies, such as\n      alemtuzumab, can find cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances\n      to them without harming normal cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused\n      into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells,\n      white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also\n      make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine (CSP) and\n      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) after transplant may stop this from happening."
