  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been considerable efforts to control rising health care costs.  One of the more
      recent developments is the practice of reprocessing single use medical devices.  This
      practice has been shown to provide considerable savings for health care payers.  Medical
      devices have been reprocessed in a number of different medical fields including Orthopaedic
      Surgery.  One of the devices that has been reprocessed are the Precision Saw Blades from
      Stryker Inc.  These saw blades are used during Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) surgery.  The
      reprocessed Precision saw blades are Health Canada approved and are available at Capital
      Health.

      Beyond the benefits to the environment and cost savings, the investigators do not know if
      the reprocessed saw blades work better, work worse or the same as non reprocessed saw
      blades.  This study is designed to determine if the reprocessed saw blades used during a TKA
      work as well as a new saw blade.
