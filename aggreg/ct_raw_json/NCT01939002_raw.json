Secondary\n      objectives of this study in this study population are: to determine the severity and\n      frequency (measured by flu-like symptom score [FLS-S]) of FLS in these subjects; to\n      determine the duration (measured in number of hours) of FLS in these subjects; to determine\n      the effect of BIIB017 on other patient reported outcomes (PROs) including treatment\n      satisfaction (measured with the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication [TSQM])\n      and disability status (measured with the Patient Determined Disease Steps [PDDS]) over a\n      56-week period; to determine whether interferon-related FLS result in missed days of\n      work/daily activities (e.g., absenteeism); to assess the use of additional medications (in\n      addition to current medications used to treat FLS) to relieve BIIB017-related FLS; to\n      determine the incidence of adverse events (AEs) throughout the study period; to characterize\n      the immunogenicity profiles of patients switching from prior IFN-\u03b2 therapy to BIIB017."
