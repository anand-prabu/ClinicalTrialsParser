It has also been referred to as cyclical edema, periodic edema, fluid\n      retention syndrome and orthostatic edema.\n\n      The present studies were designed to 1. Improve our ability to identify patients with\n      idiopathic edema by extending the clinical criteria from an increase in weight of > 1.4 kg\n      between 8 AM to 10 PM to the inclusion of nocturia, a very important component to the\n      history.  Additional aims are to: 2.  Demonstrate orthostatic weight gain with or without\n      edema in idiopathic edema and autonomic failure that will identify a greater number of\n      patients suffering from variable degrees of weight gain and compare to controls or other\n      conditions associated with edema.  The study will focus mainly on subjects with polycystic\n      ovaries and autonomic failure.  3.  Provide a reasonable course of therapy that is presently\n      not well defined.  4.  Provide evidence that orthostatic edema or weight gain has two common\n      etiologies, a. an increase in vascular membrane as in idiopathic edema and b. pooling of\n      blood in the lower extremities in autonomic failure due to a lack of vascular tone."

Subjects under the age of 18 will be asked tp complete the\n      questionnaire, which requires that the subject record the weights at 8 AM and 10 PM and\n      whether they get up at night to urines.  If they gain more than three pounds during the day\n      and get up at night to urinate, they will be asked to keep a record of their weights and the\n      number of times they get up at night to urinate for one week.  A consent form for patients\n      below the age of 18 has been developed for this age-group.  Patients will be recruited from\n      referrals from the different subspecialty groups in the Winthrop Hospital system, mainly\n      pediatric endocrinology, obstetric and gynecology, neurology, ophthalmology, cardiology and\n      gastroenterology practices.\n\n      The subjects will be placed in the following groups:\n\n      Group I: nonedematous patients\n\n        1. polycystic ovaries\n\n        2. autonomic failure-male and female\n\n        3. Age and gender matched normals Group II-Edema not meeting criteria for idiopathic edema\n\n      1.Congestive heart failure 2.Cirrhosis of liver 3.Nephrosis 4.Pregnancy 5.Pre eclampsia\n      6.Unknown cause of edema, such as obesity. Group III-Orthostatic weight gain of > 3 lbs\n      between 8 AM and 10 PM with nocturia\n\n        1. Idiopathic edema, include patients in Group I-fluctuations in weight/nocturia\n\n        2. Autonomic failure, include patients in Group I-fluctuations in weight/nocturia\n\n      Group III subjects will undergo the following procedures:\n\n        1. Record weights in pajamas before bedtime and after excreting first urine upon arising\n           in the morning for 1 week.\n\n        2. Record the number of times they get up to urinate and collect all urines passed\n           overnight in separate containers, including urine excreted upon arising in the morning.\n            The patient will record the time and date on each container provided for this purpose.\n\n      24 hour study:\n\n        1. Blood will be collected after waking up the following morning and at 7 PM the same day.\n            Blood will be analyzed for renal profile, renin, aldosterone, uric acid, phosphorus\n\n        2. All urines excreted from the time after arising in the morning and collected in\n           separate containers throughout the following 24 hours and the times of collection\n           noted.  The urines will be analyzed for osmolality, sodium, potassium, creatinine, uric\n           acid, urea and phosphorus.\n\n      Bioimpedance Studies:\n\n      Patients in group III will have bioimpedance studies performed in the morning upon arising\n      and in the evening to determine any change in body composition, i.e. change in volume of\n      extracellular, intracellular and total body water.\n\n      Collection of Interstitial Fluid:\n\n      In selected patients, an 18g needle will be placed subcutaneously in the mid-thigh and the\n      interstitial fluid collected by gravity to obtain 2-3 ml of fluid for analysis in late\n      afternoon.    A blood sample will be obtained after completion of the sampling of edema\n      fluid.  The serum will be analyzed for renal profile, total protein, albumin and\n      electrophoresis.  The interstitial fluid will analyzed for renal profile, osmolality, total\n      protein, albumin and electrophoresis.\n\n      Fluorescein dye studies:\n\n      Patients in Group III and selected patients with polycystic ovaries without edema over the\n      age of 18 years will undergo a standard ophthalmologic fluorescein dye test to detect any\n      increase in vascular endothelial permeability.  Patients with diabetes mellitus will be\n      excluded from this study."
