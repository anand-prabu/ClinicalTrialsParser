Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different\n      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from\n      dividing. Giving these treatments before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the\n      amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving these treatments after surgery may\n      kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery."

Document adverse events using this regimen in this setting. II. To document the overall\n      and disease free survival. III. To correlate response with markers such as presence or\n      absence of excision nuclease within the nucleotide excision repair 1 (ERCC1) and\n      dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase\n      (DPD) and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyl transferase (GARFT).\n\n      IV. Correlate pre- and post chemotherapy effects on fludeoxyglucose F18 (FDG) uptake by the\n      tumor on positron emission tomography (PET) scan.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      NEOADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium intravenously (IV) over 10\n      minutes and cisplatin IV over approximately 1 hour on days 1, 22, and 43.

Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,\n      every 6 months for 3 years, and then yearly thereafter."
