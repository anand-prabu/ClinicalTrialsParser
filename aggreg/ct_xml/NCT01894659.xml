  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) require up to several
      hundred procedures during their hospitalization. Many of these are tissue-damaging
      procedures (TDPs) that cause pain.  Through our NIH funded research, we made the novel
      observation that exposure to a single TDP can significantly increase ATP utilization and
      oxidative stress, as evidenced by increased plasma levels of hypoxanthine, uric acid and
      malondialdehyde in neonates exposed to TDPs as compared to controls (no TDP).  Because
      neonates are exposed to numerous TDPs, it is relevant to explore the energy costs of
      repeated exposures to painful procedures, an important information that is currently not
      known, as the effect of this cumulative metabolic dysfunction could result in potentially
      treatable or preventable cell injury.

      Oral sucrose analgesia is frequently given to relieve procedural pain in neonates on the
      basis of its effect on behavioral and physiological pain scores. However, we found, through
      our prospective, randomized, double blind study funded by NIH, that although oral sucrose
      significantly reduced pain scores, its administration before a single TDP (heel lance)
      significantly increased ATP utilization.  This is evidenced by higher plasma concentrations
      of hypoxanthine and uric acid in neonates given sucrose compared to control neonates (no
      TDP, no sucrose) or neonates just given a pacifier. These novel findings raise concern
      because preterm neonates have limited ATP stores and are susceptible to cell injury due to
      ATP depletion. In addition, it raises the relevant concern: If a single dose of oral sucrose
      can alter ATP metabolism, what are the effects of exposure to multiple doses of oral
      sucrose? More importantly, what is the effect of multiple TDPs and/or multiple oral sucrose
      dosages on ATP utilization, oxidative stress and cell injury? This application will also
      explore the effect of 30% oral glucose, another sweet solution currently used to relieve
      pain, on ATP metabolism.

      In this study, we will test the general hypothesis that exposure to multiple TDPs and/or
      multiple doses of oral sucrose analgesia compared to oral glucose or standard care, alter
      biochemical markers of ATP utilization, oxidative stress and cell injury. We will use a
      prospective randomized clinical research design to test this hypothesis during days of life
      3-7 of human premature neonates.  Increased ATP utilization will be quantified by
      concentrations of hypoxanthine, xanthine and uric acid measured using HPLC. Oxidative stress
      will be quantified by concentrations of allantoin using gas chromatography/mass
      spectroscopy, and cell injury will be quantified through urinary concentration of intestinal
      fatty acid binding protein, an early marker of enterocyte injury. Data from this application
      will provide insight into the cellular and biochemical effects of repetitive and accumulated
      TDPs and/or multiple doses of oral sucrose. With this knowledge, we will propose and test
      innovative strategies that will not only decrease pain but also will prevent cell injury or
      cell death.
