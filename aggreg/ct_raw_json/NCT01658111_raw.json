            "textblock": "Numerous studies showed that ascertaining the effectiveness of rehabilitative interventions\n      on conditions leading to long-term disability, such as stroke, is a complex task because the\n      outcome depends on many interacting factors. Several studies underline the importance of\n      brain plasticity and its therapeutic potential in neurological disorders. Accredited\n      theories of cortical reorganization after brain lesion endorse the use of early, intensive,\n      repetitive, and context-related exercise as optimal strategies to promote motor relearning\n      and minimize motor deficit. The use of robotic systems in upper limb motor rehabilitation\n      programs has been already demonstrated to provide safe and intensive treatment to subjects\n      with motor impairments due to a neurological injury: several studies showed the advantages\n      of robotic therapy on chronic post-stroke patients, even if no consistent influence on\n      functional abilities was found and evidence of better results providing intensive\n      treatments, both robotic and conventional rehabilitative techniques, was found. Recent\n      development and recent trial in robot-assisted rehabilitation has shown the great potential\n      of robotic devices for delivering repetitive training, thus facilitating a high intensity\n      and a large dose of training during sub-acute and chronic phases of stroke rehabilitation.\n      The proposed project, through a randomized controlled observer-blind multicenter trial is\n      aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of robot-assisted therapy as additional treatment to\n      the standard physical therapy in the early phase after stroke onset and evaluating in\n      conjunction with EEG and EMG recordings the effects of the rehabilitative treatments in a\n      quantitative, measurable way, by providing reliable and objective methods for measuring\n      functional recovery after stroke."
