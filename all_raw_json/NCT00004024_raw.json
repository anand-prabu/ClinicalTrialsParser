Patients without recurrent disease receive local\n      radiotherapy on weeks 2-8. Beginning week 10-12, patients are vaccinated with irradiated\n      autologous tumor cells and sargramostim (GM-CSF) and then receive GM-CSF alone intradermally\n      at vaccination sites daily for 4 days. Patients are revaccinated 4 weeks later and may\n      receive up to 3 additional vaccinations every 2 weeks until a response is detected.\n\n      Patients undergo peripheral blood mononuclear cell collection on week 14 followed by\n      monoclonal antibody OKT3-activated T lymphocytes IV over 1-6 hours with alternating\n      interleukin-2 IV once every other day for 5 doses over 10 days beginning on week 16.\n      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients may receive one additional course of immunotherapy as above.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1 week, monthly for 3 months, every 3 months for 2 years, and then\n      every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study."
