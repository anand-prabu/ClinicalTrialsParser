  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate and document real life safety and satisfaction
      of re-use of urethral catheters for intermittent self catheterization. The study will
      collect re-used catheters from included patients and compare those to a control group with
      regard to bacterial contamination and mechanical properties. A four week prospective
      evaluation will follow where the patients will be given catheters intended for single-use.
