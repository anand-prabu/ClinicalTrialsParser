Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells.\n      Combining chemotherapy with interferon alfa may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining temozolomide and interferon\n      alfa in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV melanoma."

Courses repeat every 8 weeks in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-61 patients (12-35 without CNS metastases and 11-26 with\n      CNS metastases) will be accrued for this study within 18 months."
