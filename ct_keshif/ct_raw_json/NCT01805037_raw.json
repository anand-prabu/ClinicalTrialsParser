This study is for patients who have a type of lymphoma that expresses a tumor\n      marker called CD30 and/or a type that is associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV-related\n      lymphoma) and who have not yet received any treatment for their cancer, except for\n      dose-reduction or discontinuation (stoppage) of medications used to prevent rejection of\n      transplanted organs (for those patients who have undergone transplantation).

To evaluate the efficacy, as measured by response rates, of brentuximab\n      vedotin and rituximab in patients with lymphoid malignancies that are CD30+ and/or EBV+.\n      (Phase II)\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To further evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicity. (Phase II) II. To further\n      evaluate the clinical efficacy of the combination of brentuximab vedotin and rituximab, as\n      measured by progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) at one year after the\n      end of treatment. (Phase II) III. To determine the effects of the combination of brentuximab\n      vedotin and rituximab on markers of EBV activation and proliferation. (Phase II) IV. Further\n      evaluate efficacy as measured by time to cytotoxic chemotherapy. (Phase II) V. Further\n      evaluate efficacy as measured by observed rates of graft rejection.

To determine whether and to what extent expression of EBV markers predicts for response\n      and outcome.\n\n      III. To determine whether changes in serum levels of EBV correlate with response and\n      subsequent loss of response to therapy.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of brentuximab vedotin followed by a phase\n      II study.\n\n      INDUCTION: Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes once\n      weekly for 3 weeks and rituximab IV once weekly for 4 weeks.

Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 1 year in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, and\n      then every 6 months for 2 years."
