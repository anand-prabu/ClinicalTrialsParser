  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of Lillipops in the
      improvement of NVP symptoms. Secondary objectives are to assess if there are any changes to
      concurrent symptoms that may intensify NVP, such as metallic taste or gastrointestinal
      issues (e.g. heartburn, acid reflux, indigestion and gas), as well as preference for freezie
      flavours.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) is the most common medical condition of pregnancy,
      affecting up to 80% of pregnant women. Lillipops Iced Soothies are naturally flavoured
      freezies developed in the United Kingdom for women with morning sickness. They are available
      in 5 different flavours: grapefruit and tangerine, lemon and mint, chamomile and orange,
      lime and vanilla, and ginger. The flavours are derived from steam distillation of the peels
      (grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, orange, lime), mint leaves, and chamomile flowers to release
      and collect their essential oils. Vanilla pods and ginger are macerated and their resin is
      used. These flavours are chosen because they may provide relief of symptoms as they are
      either traditional remedies for NVP, such as ginger, or soothing and refreshing flavours,
      such as chamomile, vanilla and citrus.

      This study hypothesizes that using Lillipops Iced Soothies will reduce the severity of NVP
      symptoms according to the PUQE-24 (pregnancy-unique quantification of emesis and nausea)
      scoring system for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. In addition, we hypothesize concurrent
      symptoms that may intensify NVP7, such as metallic taste or gastrointestinal disorders (e.g.
      heartburn, acid reflux, indigestion and gas), will be alleviated. We hypothesize that
      improvements to NVP and concurrent symptoms will be greater with Lillipop freezies compared
      to another commercially available freezie.

    <description>Initially, women will be given 1 multiflavour box of Lillipop samples minus the ginger flavour (4 flavours). Each box contains 24 freezies (20 mL each), 6 of each flavor. They will be told to eat the freezies as needed to alleviate symptoms, up to a maximum of 12 per day, and to not have any other popsicles, freezies or any ginger products throughout the duration of the study (7 days). They can request an additional multiflavour box of freezies at each follow-up, as needed.</description>
