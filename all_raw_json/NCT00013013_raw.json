The VHA has encouraged adoption of the AHCPR Guideline for Smoking\n      Cessation, yet most hospitals have poorly developed smoking cessation programs.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      The present study is designed to investigate the effectiveness of an organizational strategy\n      to increase compliance with the AHCPR guideline.  Short term goals of the study include\n      increasing the rate of identification of smokers and increasing the delivery of brief\n      smoking cessation interventions.  Long term goals include reducing tobacco consumption among\n      veterans.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      Twenty VAMC\ufffds with active primary care clinics have been  randomly assigned to either\n      control (usual practice; UP) or intervention (organizational support; OS) groups.  The\n      intervention hospitals receive staff training and site consultation; all hospitals will\n      receive the AHCPR guideline.  Rate of identification of smokers in the medical record,\n      smoking cessation rates, provision of smoking cessation services (e.g., NRT, counseling),\n      and costs of NRT will be determined via telephone interviews with patients, chart review,\n      and electronic records.\n\n      Status:\n\n      Baseline data collection is nearly complete, and the intervention period will be complete in\n      September, 2000. We have completed telephone surveys with approximately 4500 veterans.\n      Analysis of study data is ongoing, and manuscript preparation will begin within the next few\n      months."
