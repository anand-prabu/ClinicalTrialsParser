            "textblock": "The obesity epidemic is attributable to dietary and behavioral trends acting on a person's\n      genetic makeup to determine body mass and susceptibility to obesity-related disease. Common\n      forms of obesity have a strong hereditary component and many genetic pathways that\n      contribute to obesity have already ben identified.\n\n      Glucagon-like peptide (GLP) -1 is an incretin hormone that potentiates glucose-stimulated\n      insulin secretion. However, GLP-1 also acts as an appetite-inhibiting hormone affecting the\n      appetite center in the hypothalamus. Today, GLP-1 agonists are available for treatment of\n      type 2 diabetes, and their treatment potential in obesity is an area of active research.\n\n      The aim of this study is to explore if the appetite inhibiting effect of GLP-1 is intact in\n      people diagnosed wth an obesity causing genetic disorder and to investigate the\n      physiological role of GLP-1 on food intake and appetite regulation in this group. The\n      investigators hypothesis is that GLP-1 can form the basis of obesity treatment in patients\n      with obesity causing genetic disorders."
