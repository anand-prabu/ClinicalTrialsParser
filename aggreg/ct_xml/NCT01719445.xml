    <textblock>
      The Primary Aim of the project is to modify the RFPM for adolescents and to address the
      concerns identified by the reviewers of the first grant application. We will then test the
      RFPM's validity (accuracy) compared to the validity of pen-and-paper food records.

      The Primary Aim of the project is to modify the RFPM for adolescents and to address the
      concerns identified by the reviewers of the first grant application. We will then test the
      RFPM's validity (accuracy) compared to the validity of pen-and-paper food records. Our
      experience and the literature indicate that the RFPM is acceptable and feasible in school
      settings. Following modification of the RFPM and pilot testing with 4 adolescents, we will
      test the reliability and validity of both the RFPM and food records when used by 60
      adolescents (12 to 18 years of age). During one week, participants will use the RFPM and
      during another week they will use food records (the order will be balanced across
      participants). The accuracy of each method will be examined by comparing energy and nutrient
      intake (collectively referred to as food intake or FI) to three gold standards: 1) doubly
      labeled water or DLW (energy intake only, or EIDLW), 2) a laboratory-based test meal
      (FILaboratory), and 3) food intake during lunch in a school cafeteria (FISchool).
      User-satisfaction and participant burden will also be compared between methods, and a
      cost-effectiveness analysis will determine if and under what conditions one method is more
      cost-effective than the other.

    <description>Participants will be instructed how to keep a food record and estimate portion size during a session at the Center. Participants will also receive a packet containing the food protocol outline, food record form, guide to portion sizes, guidelines for description of foods, and tips for recording food intake. Participants will be instructed to record everything they eat or drink, recording the food item, portion size, time of consumption, and meal designation.</description>
