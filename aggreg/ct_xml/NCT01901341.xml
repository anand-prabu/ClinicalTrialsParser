    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CB-5945 for the
      treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC)in adults taking opioid therapy for chronic
      non-cancer pain.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in subjects
      with OIC taking opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain. Approximately 600 subjects (300
      subjects per treatment group) with OIC will be randomized at approximately 75 study centers
      to receive either oral 0.25 mg CB-5945 BID or oral matching placebo BID for the 12 week
      double-blind treatment period, followed by a 4-week follow-up period. All randomized
      subjects will be evaluated for clinical response for duration of their study participation.
      All subjects will be followed for safety for 16 weeks regardless of when they discontinue
      study medication.
