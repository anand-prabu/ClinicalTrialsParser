Mobile sensors include paralinguistic aspects of speech,\n      physical activity and location, and sleep. The first hypothesis is that mobile sensing and\n      EMA techniques will capture early behavioral warning signs. The second hypothesis is that\n      machine learning, coupled with user input, will enable development of individualized\n      predictive \"risk signature\" models. The third hypothesis is that automated system patient\n      and provider functions will help prevent psychotic relapses."
