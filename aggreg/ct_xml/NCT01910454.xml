  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the most serious disabling condition in the United States and the developed world.
      Novel stroke rehabilitation approaches, such as task-specific training, have shown promise
      in improving an individual's recovery in the rehabilitation setting; however, evidence
      suggests that these improvements are not generalized or transferred to the home, community,
      or work settings. Thus, these interventions usually do not impact overall health and
      participation outcomes.  This research study seeks to improve task-specific training as a
      stroke rehabilitation approach by integrating it with evidence-based cognitive-oriented
      strategies which have shown great promise as a way to address the limitations of
      task-specific training.  The new treatment protocol is called Cognitive-Oriented Strategy
      Training Augmented Rehabilitation, or COSTAR.  The hypothesis of this study is that COSTAR
      will result in more efficient functional skill acquisition, better long-term retention of
      skills learned, and generalization and transfer of skills learned to home, community, and
      work settings.

    <description>The protocol for COSTAR is based on the Cognitive-Orientation to daily Occupational Performance Intervention (CO-OP) approach which includes the following components: (1) Guided discovery - a process created by CO-OP to make certain that participants discover the strategies that will solve their own performance problems ; (2) Cognitive strategy use - participants are taught a global problem-solving strategy and are enabled to discover additional domain specific strategies that will support their skill acquisition and performance competence; and (3) Dynamic performance analysis - an observation-based process of identifying performance problems or performance breakdown.  These three components from CO-OP are overlaid on the TST intervention protocol described above to address the overall hypothesis of this study: that an evidence-based stroke rehabilitation treatment protocol (task-specific training) can be enhanced when augmented with the catalyst of cognitive-oriented strategy use.</description>

    <description>The protocol for task-specific training is based on criteria established by Winstein and Wolf (2008) who define task-specific training (TST) as a top-down approach to rehabilitation that is based on recent integrated models of motor control, motor learning, and behavioral neuroscience and that addresses skill acquisition of performance of meaningful and relevant tasks (Winstein and Wolf, 2008). Winstein and Wolf use current theory to identify three key ingredients for a task-specific training (pg 269): (1) Challenging enough to require new learning, and engagement with attention to solve the motor problem; (2) Progressive and optimally adapted such that over practice, the task-demand is optimally adapted to the patient's capability and the environmental context. The task should not be too simple or too repetitive nor too difficult; and (3) Interesting enough to invoke active participation through engagement in meaningful activity.</description>
