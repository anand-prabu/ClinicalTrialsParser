A challenge of emergency care is providing\n      patient education surrounding procedures in a standardized and patient-oriented manner. This\n      data would provide insight on a patient's understanding of the risks and benefits of rescue\n      access, assess patient preference, and potentially influence what rescue technique is\n      employed in the future. This information may also give us insight onto why DIVA patients\n      might refuse randomization."
