Determine the sensitivity of combined\n      methods of identification of sentinel lymph nodes by patent blue V dye and gamma probe\n      detection in these women.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive patent blue V dye injection peritumorally prior to surgery.\n      Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy is performed using technetium Tc 99 sulfur rhenium colloid\n      injected around the tumor associated with intraoperative gamma probe detection. Nonpalpable\n      tumors receive a localized injection using stereotactic injection techniques. Patients then\n      undergo standard axillary (level I and II) lymph node dissection.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
