Combining more than one chemotherapy drug and giving\n      them as induction intensification may kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well induction intensification works in\n      treating infants with newly diagnosed acute lymphocytic leukemia."

Patients are stratified according to participating\n      center and presence of CNS disease (yes vs no).\n\n      Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising vincristine IV on days 1, 8, and 15; oral\n      prednisone three times a day on days 1-21; daunorubicin IV over 30 minutes on days 1-2;\n      cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes every 12 hours on days 3-4; and asparaginase\n      intramuscularly (IM) on days 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, and 19. Patients also receive triple\n      intrathecal therapy comprising methotrexate, hydrocortisone, and cytarabine on days 1, 8,\n      and 15 and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) or IV beginning on day 5 and continuing\n      until day 20, regardless of blood counts.\n\n      Patients receive induction intensification chemotherapy comprising high-dose methotrexate IV\n      over 24 hours; triple intrathecal therapy as per induction therapy on days 22 and 29; and\n      leucovorin calcium IV every 6 hours for 2 doses beginning 42 hours after start of high-dose\n      methotrexate and then orally every 6 hours for 3 doses. Patients also receive etoposide IV\n      over 2 hours and cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes on days 36-40. Patients receive G-CSF\n      SC or IV beginning on day 41 and continuing until blood counts recover.\n\n      Patients achieving morphologic remission and recovery of blood counts while off G-CSF for 48\n      hours receive reinduction chemotherapy comprising the same regimen as in induction therapy\n      with the exception of asparaginase IM beginning on day 1 (week 8) and continuing every\n      Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for a total of 8 doses and triple intrathecal therapy on days\n      1 and 15 only (weeks 8 and 10). Patients receive G-CSF SC or IV beginning on day 5 and\n      continuing until blood counts recover.\n\n      After blood count recovery, patients receive consolidation chemotherapy comprising triple\n      intrathecal therapy as per induction therapy on day 1 (week 11); high-dose methotrexate IV\n      over 24 hours on weeks 8 and 12; and leucovorin calcium IV every 6 hours for 2 doses\n      beginning 42 hours after start of high-dose methotrexate and then orally every 6 hours for 3\n      doses. Patients also receive etoposide IV over 2 hours followed by cyclophosphamide IV over\n      30 minutes on days 15-19 (week 13). Patients receive G-CSF SC or IV beginning on day 20 and\n      continuing until blood counts recover. On days 29-31 (week 15), patients receive high-dose\n      cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours for 4 doses and asparaginase IM 6 hours after\n      completion of high-dose cytarabine. Patients receive G-CSF beginning 24 hours after\n      completion of asparaginase and continuing until blood counts recover.\n\n      Patients achieving morphologic remission and blood count recovery while off G-CSF for 48\n      hours receive continuation therapy comprising vincristine IV on day 1; oral prednisone three\n      times a day on days 1-5; and triple intrathecal therapy on day 1 (weeks 18 and 22). Patients\n      also receive methotrexate IM once a week and oral mercaptopurine daily on weeks 19-21, 23,\n      and 24. On week 25, patients receive etoposide IV over 2 hours daily followed by\n      cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes daily on days 1-5 and G-CSF SC or IV beginning on day 6\n      and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients receive an additional course of\n      continuation therapy on weeks 28-35. On weeks 38-48, patients receive another identical\n      course of continuation therapy with the exclusion of the etoposide and cyclophosphamide\n      combination regimen.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 2 months for 1 year, every 3 months for 1\n      year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 58-104 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.1\n      years."
