  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in approximately
      104 subjects (52 per group) to evaluate the effectiveness of  an herb and mineral
      combination product on fasting serum glucose levels in subjects with impaired fasting
      glucose.  The study consists of 5 visits: a Screening visit, followed by a Baseline visit
      (at which eligible subjects will be randomized to product to consume throughout the 12-week
      supplementation period), followed by Supplementation period visits at 3, 6 and 12 weeks
      after baseline.
