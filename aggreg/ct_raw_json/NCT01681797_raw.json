            "textblock": "Reconstructive surgery is intended to replace amputated anatomical regions  by autologous\n      tissue taken from distant locations: flaps. The goal is to restitute ad integrum with\n      minimal sequelae. Among the flaps available, perforator flaps have the advantage of being\n      highly plastic, large and can be  taken from accessory vessels the loss of wich does not\n      compromise the vitality of the sampling site. However their more variable anatomy requires\n      irradiating preoperative morphological assessment (CT angiography) or a doppler\n      ultrasonography that is not always performed by the surgeon himself and does not distinguish\n      between muscle perforator and skin perforator.\n\n      Fluorescence angiography is a superficial exploration technique of vascularization. After\n      intravenous injection of a tracer (indocyanine green ICG), fluorescence angiography provides\n      useful surface angiographic imaging in real-time. It can also help in monitoring\n      intraoperative and postoperative quality of vascular anastomoses. Although fluorescence\n      angiography has numerous applications (ophthalmology, neurosurgery, liver\n      transplantation...), its usefulness in surgical flaps is only supported by a few\n      publications. None really validate its clinical value by comparing it to reference\n      investigations (CT angiography or doppler ultrasonography).\n\n      40 candidate for reconstructive surgery will be included in this study. The day before\n      surgery, in addition to the usual technique used to locate perforator flaps, the patient\n      will receive an injection of 0.025 mg / kg  Infracyanine\u00ae (indocyanine green) and the area\n      of \u200b\u200binterest of the flap will be explored with the Fluobeam\u2122 camera.\n\n      Two hours after the surgery, during the usual clinical monitoring of the vitality of the\n      flap, a new injection of Infracyanine\u00ae will test perfusion of the flap by measuring\n      fluorescence intensity of the target area. These measurement will then be repeated every 6\n      hours for 4 days."
