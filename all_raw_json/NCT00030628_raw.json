Radiosurgery may\n      be able to deliver x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. It\n      is not yet known if radiosurgery is more effective with or without whole-brain radiation\n      therapy in treating brain metastases.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiosurgery with or\n      without whole-brain radiation therapy in treating patients who have brain metastases."

Patients are stratified according to age\n      (60 and over vs under 60), extracranial disease (controlled for more than 3 months vs\n      controlled for 3 months or less), and number of brain metastases (1 vs more than 1).\n      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo radiosurgery.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiosurgery. Within 14 days, patients then undergo whole\n           brain radiotherapy 5 days a week for 2.5 weeks.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, the beginning of each treatment, at week 6, every 3\n      months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 2 years.\n\n      Patients are followed at weeks 6 and 12, every 3 months for 9 months, every 4 months for 1\n      year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 480 patients (240 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 5 years."
