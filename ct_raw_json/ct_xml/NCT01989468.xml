    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide 24 - 52 week efficacy, safety and tolerability data,
      as well as up to 3-year efficacy, safety and tolerability data in subjects with active
      Psoriatic Arthritis despite current or previous nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID),
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy and/or previous anti-tumor necrosis
      factor alpha (TNFα) therapy.

    <measure>American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20) response in subjects treated with secukinumab versus placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>ACR20 response is used to assess the efficacy of at least one dose of secukinumab versus placebo. An ACR20 response is defined by at least 20% decrease in the swollen and tender joint count, and at least 20% improvements in 3 of the following 5 criteria: physical disability on the Health Assessment Questionnaire; pain score on a visual analog scale; patient global assessment; physician global assessment; and acute phase reactant [either erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP)]</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Psoriatic Area and Severity Index 75 (PASI75) response in subjects treated with secukinumab versus placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>PASI75 is used to assess the efficacy of at least one dose of secukinumab versus placebo. PASI takes into account the extent of the disease, as well as the severity of erythema, scaling, and thickness in different body areas affected by psoriasis. A PASI75 represents an improvement in the PASI score of at least 75% as compared with baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>PASI 90 is used to assess the efficacy of at least one dose of secukinumab versus placebo. PASI takes into account the extent of the disease, as well as the severity of erythema, scaling, and thickness in different body areas affected by psoriasis. A PASI90 represents an improvement in the PASI score of at least 90% as compared with baseline.</description>

    <measure>Disease Activity Score for 28 joints (DAS28-CRP) (utilizing hsCRP) relative to baseline, assessed in subjects treated with secukinumab versus placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>DAS28-CRP score is used to assess improvement from baseline of at least one dose of secukinumab versus placebo. The DAS28-CRP is a measure of disease activity based on swollen and tender joint counts, high sensitivity CRP and the patient global assessment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical function component of the short-form health survey (SF-36-PCS), relative to baseline, in subjects treated with secukinumab versus placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The SF-36-PCS is used to assess improvement from baseline of at least one dose of secukinumab versus placebo. SF-36 is a 36 item questionnaire which measures Quality of Life across eight domains, which are both physically and emotionally based. Two overall summary scores, the physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) can be computed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI score), relative to baseline, in subjects treated with secukinumab versus placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>HAQ-DI score is used to assess improvement from baseline of at least one dose of secukinumab versus placebo. The disability assessment component of the HAQ assesses a subjects level of functional ability and includes questions of fine movements of the upper extremity, locomotor activities of the lower extremity, and activities that involve both upper and lower extremitites.</description>

    <measure>American College of Rheumatology 50 (ACR50) response in subjects treated with secukinumab versus placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>ACR50 response is used to assess the efficacy of at least one dose of secukinumab versus placebo. An ACR50 response is defined by at least 50% decreases in the swollen and tender joint count, and at least 50% improvements in 3 of the following 5 criteria: physical disability on the Health Assessment Questionnaire; pain score on a visual analog scale; patient global assessment; physician global assessment; and acute phase reactant [either erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP)]</description>

    <measure>Treatment emergent adverse events for each treatment group</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>

    <description>Adverse events will be summarized to include the number and percentage of subjects having an adverse event, the severity of the adverse event, serious adverse events and other significant adverse events that lead to study treatment discontinuation.</description>
