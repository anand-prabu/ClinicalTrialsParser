      This clinical trial studies magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission
      tomography (PET) imaging in predictive treatment response in patients with stage IB-IVA
      cervical cancer. Comparing results of diagnostic procedures done before, during and after
      radiation and chemotherapy may help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and
      help plan the best treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the value of MRI and PET as a non-invasive predictive assay for therapy outcome
      in cervical cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo radiation therapy and receive chemotherapy per standard of care. Patients
      undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI, and magnetic
      resonance (MR) spectroscopy at baseline, 2-2.5 weeks, 4-5 weeks, and 1 month following
      radiation therapy completion, and fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) PET/computed tomography (CT) at
      baseline, 2-2.5 weeks, and 4-5 weeks.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at least every 4 months for 2 years and
      then at least every 6 months for 3 years.

    <description>Hazard ratios will be calculated. Predictive power of the heterogeneity metrics will be compared and ranked with Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, lymph node status, histology, hemoglobin level, and tumor anatomic volumes. Multivariate predictive algorithms will be derived by synergizing the predictive power of imaging metrics and clinical prognosticators for clinical translation.</description>

          -  Medical contraindication to MR imaging (e.g. pacemakers, metallic implants, aneurysm
             clips, known contrast allergy to gadolinium contrast, pregnancy, nursing mothers,
             weight greater than 350 pounds, GFR &lt; 30)

             prevent completion of treatment, completion of the study protocol, or interfere with
             follow-up

          -  Life expectancy of less than 6 months
