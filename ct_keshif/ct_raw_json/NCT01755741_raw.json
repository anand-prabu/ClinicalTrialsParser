Either partner taking any topical or oral medication to treat a urogenital condition\n             at enrollment, except medication for the male partner to treat erectile dysfunction\n             (e.g., tadalafil, sildenafil);\n\n          7. Either partner with a self-reported or clinically diagnosed urogenital condition\n             (e.g. itching, burning, irritation, etc.) that, in the opinion of the Investigator,\n             could affect use of the study condoms or ability to interpret trial data;\n\n          8. Females, based on findings from a pelvic examination, who are not suitable candidates\n             for wearing the vaginal ring (anatomical condition, current vaginal infection, etc.);\n\n          9. Current participation in a study or other research involving a drug, device or other\n             product;\n\n         10.
