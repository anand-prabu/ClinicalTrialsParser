Describe the psychosocial response of parents and caretakers who learn\n      cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) techniques for infants at high risk for respiratory or\n      cardiac arrest.\n\n      II.  Compare the effect of 4 methods of CPR instruction on psychosocial response.\n\n      III.  Evaluate a psychological intervention based on social support theory designed to\n      offset the potential adverse psychological outcomes of CPR instruction.\n\n      IV.  Evaluate a self-paced CPR learning module using the principles of adult learning\n      theory.\n\n      V.  Document the level of CPR knowledge and skill retention over time. VI.  Document the\n      frequency of CPR and its outcome following a witnessed respiratory or cardiac arrest."

The control group\n      receives the standard CPR instruction at hospital discharge. Participants are followed at 2\n      weeks, then at 3 and 6 months."
