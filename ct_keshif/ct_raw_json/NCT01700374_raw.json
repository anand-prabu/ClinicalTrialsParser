Maternal stress may have\n      an adverse impact on the developing fetus by causing abnormal programming of the fetal\n      Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which could lead to medical and behavioral health\n      problems later in life. Non-invasive measurements of fetal adrenal gland volume by 3-D\n      ultrasound may allow us to understand if maternal stress can impact fetal adrenal gland\n      size. In addition, the investigators can begin to discern whether fetal adrenal size has\n      behavioral ramifications for the offspring through assessment of the infants HPA axis\n      response to novelty. This study presents a non-invasive, novel approach to understanding the\n      impact of maternal stress on fetal and infant developments."
