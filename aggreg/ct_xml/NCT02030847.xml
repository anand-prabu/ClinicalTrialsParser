    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single arm, open-label phase II study to determine the efficacy and
      safety of a single infusion of autologous T cells expressing CD19 chimeric antigen receptors
      expressing tandem TCR and 4-1BB (TCR/4-1BB) co-stimulatory domains (referred to as CART-19
      cells) in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
      Inclusion criteria are designed to include adult patients aged greater than 18 with B cell
      ALL, relapsed or refractory, with no available curative treatment options (such as
      autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation) who have limited prognosis (greater than
      12 weeks survival expectancy) with currently available therapies. The study product is
      CART-19 cells transduced with a lentiviral vector to express anti-CD19 scFv TCR:41BB
      administered by a single i.v. infusion of 1 to 5 x 108 transduced CAR T cells.
