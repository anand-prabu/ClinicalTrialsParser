This study will determine if fecal\n      microbiota transplantation, which involves administering fecal flora from a healthy stool\n      donor to a patient with relapsing CDI, is an effective and safe treatment."

            "textblock": "Clostridium difficile is an increasingly common infection.  The number of hospital\n      discharges for which C. difficile was listed as the first diagnosis more than doubled\n      between 2000 and 2003.  In addition to occurring more frequently, there is an epidemic of\n      serious cases which are more refractory to therapy and which have high rates of colectomy\n      and death.  Most commonly, C. difficile infection (CDI) is associated with use of\n      antimicrobial agents that are thought to alter the normal bacterial flora of the\n      gastrointestinal tract so as to permit colonization and/or proliferation and toxin\n      elaboration by C. difficile.  Though the precise mechanisms by which this occurs are still\n      incompletely understood, depletion of physiologic microflora, in particular Bacteroides\n      species may play an important role.  Most patients with CDI respond to a course of oral\n      metronidazole or vancomycin, however, up to 20% of patients relapse after initial treatment.\n      Current guidelines recommend a tapering course of vancomycin after a second recurrence,\n      however up to 60% of patients still do not respond to this treatment strategy or develop\n      further recurrence after the vancomycin is stopped.  Use of antimicrobials to treat CDI may\n      predispose these patients to further relapses through the maintenance of disturbed\n      intestinal flora and may contribute to the emerging problem of drug resistance.\n\n      \"Fecal Microbiota Transplantation\" (FMT) is a novel treatment approach which involves\n      administration of feces from a healthy (donor) individual into a patient with relapsing CDI\n      to promote recolonization with missing components of normal intestinal flora.  Numerous case\n      reports and retrospective case series have suggested benefit of FMT in patients with severe\n      or recurrent CDI with cure rates as high as 100% and a mean cure rate of 89% for the nearly\n      300 cases reported in the world literature.  Although efficacy has been documented in these\n      case reports, to date there has not been a published prospective clinical trial of FMT for\n      CDI.\n\n      The proposed study would be the first randomized, double-blind, placebo (sham) controlled\n      clinical trial to determine whether FMT delivered at colonoscopy is effective at preventing\n      further relapse in patients who have suffered from at least a 3rd recurrence  of CDI despite\n      receiving standard treatment. The investigators hypothesize that FMT is superior to placebo\n      in preventing relapse after treatment of CDI with vancomycin.  As a result of this study,\n      the investigators will have preliminary efficacy data for this novel treatment approach for\n      recurrent CDI.  The investigators will be better prepared to test the efficacy of FMT in\n      future multicenter clinical trials.  This research will advance clinical care, potentially\n      impacting the protocol for treatment of relapsing C. difficile infection worldwide.   This\n      proposal includes collaboration with an investigator capable of performing microbiome\n      analyses on specimens collected as part of the trial and will further understanding of the\n      intestinal microflora in health and disease."
