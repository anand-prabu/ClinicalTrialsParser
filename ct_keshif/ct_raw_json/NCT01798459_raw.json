The\n      subjects will be of all racial, ethnical and gender categories, ranging from 8 to 18 years\n      of age.\n\n      Structure: the study is a randomized double blind crossover study. The subjects will\n      complete a continuous performance test, the cambridge neuropsychological test automated\n      Battery, before and after given methylphenidate or placebo on the first day of the study. On\n      the second day of the study, the subjects will receive either methylphenidate or placebo\n      based on what was given on the first day of the study and they will complete the same task."
