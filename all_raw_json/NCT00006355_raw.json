Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of pyrazoloacridine followed by\n      radiation therapy in treating adults who have newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma\n      multiforme."

Patients are stratified according to\n      type of anticonvulsant (hepatic metabolic enzyme inducers vs hepatic metabolic enzyme\n      moderate inducers or noninducers).\n\n      Patients receive pyrazoloacridine (PZA) IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3\n      weeks for a maximum of 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Following completion of PZA treatment, patients undergo cranial irradiation 5 days\n      a week for 6 weeks.\n\n      Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of PZA until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)\n      is determined. Additional patients receive PZA at the MTD.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 3 patients will be accrued for phase I and a total of 18-35\n      patients will be accrued for phase II of this study."
