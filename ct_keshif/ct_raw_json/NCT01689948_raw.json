            "textblock": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia among elderly patients. By its\n      prevalence and its medical and social consequences, AD represents a dual challenge to public\n      health and society. The elderly want to stay in their homes even when their lives are\n      altered by a chronic progressive disease. Their caregivers claim in turn a support at home.\n      But this desire is questioned because of the characteristics of the disease, e.g. the\n      altered relational function by the cognitive impairment and the behavioural disorders\n      associated.\n\n      Outpatients non-drug therapies represent a potential support that adapts to patient with an\n      AD or mixed dementia, especially in their milder forms.\n\n      The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of a weekly rehabilitation's\n      intervention at home and its acceptability by both the patient and the caregiver.\n\n      The study of its efficiency in terms of autonomy will be the next step."

The first five are needed to define a\n      realistic and achievable goal of treatment which is accepted by the dyad and the therapist.\n      The following seven interventions will achieve this goal by rehabilitation's intervention\n      (e.g. occupational therapy, psychomotor approach).\n\n      Four filmed sessions for dyad's assessment are planned (at inclusion, at weeks 5 and 12\n      after inclusion and 3 months after the last intervention)."
