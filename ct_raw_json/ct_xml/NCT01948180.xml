        FOR SCREENING PHASE:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of extranodal NK/T lymphoma, perWHO classification, 4th ed., which must
             include EBV tumor positivity, measured either by EBV encoded RNA (EBER) or LMP1
             immunostaining.

          2. a) Clinically suspected or documented relapse/progression, at any time following at
             least one cycle of an asparaginase-based chemotherapy OR b) High-risk disease (stage
             III/IV, KPI groups 3-4 or IPI intermediate-high) at any time (regardless of
             chemotherapy status and disease relapse/ progression)

          3. Male or female ≥ 18 years of age.

          4. Weigh ≥ 35 kg.

          5. ECOG performance score 0-2, inclusively.

          6. Negative β-hCG test in women of childbearing potential.

          7. Able to understand and comply with the requirements of the study and to provide
             written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. CNS lymphoma.

          2. NK cell leukemia.

          3. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.

          4. Positive laboratory test for anti-HIV 1,2; HBsAg, anti-HTLV-I; anti-HCV, or syphilis
             (Patients with anti-hepatitis B core antibody are eligible if negative for HBsAg).

          5. Use of systemic corticosteroids &gt;0.5 mg/kg/day within 10 days prior to obtaining 100
             mL whole blood starting material.

          6. Patient is pregnant or lactating.

          7. Female patient of childbearing potential unwilling to use effective birth control
             (barrier methods, oral contraceptives and/or intrauterine devices) during the entire
             duration of the study (or the patient must be surgically sterile with documentation
             in the patient's medical records).

          8. Sexually active patients unwilling to utilize one of the more effective birth control
             methods during the study and for 6 months after the study treatment is concluded. The
             male partner should use a condom.

          9. Clinically significant medical condition e.g. pulmonary, neurological,
             cardiovascular, metabolic, that could jeopardize patient safety, interfere with the
             objectives of the protocol, or limit patient compliance with study requirements, as
             determined by the Investigator.

         10. Active second malignancy.

         11. Previous non-hematological malignancy, except for adequately treated basal-cell
             carcinoma of skin or cervical carcinoma in-situ without current evidence of disease,
             unless the tumor was treated with curative intent more than 5 years prior to study
             entry.

         12. Any prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

        FOR TREATMENT PHASE:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All Screening Phase inclusion criteria.

          2. Documented relapse or progression following at least one prior cycle of an
             asparaginase-containing chemotherapy regimen.

          3. At least one prior cycle of gemcitabine-based salvage chemotherapy.

          4. a) Presence of measurable disease as defined by the modified Response Evaluation
             Criteria in Solid. Tumors (RECIST v1.1) as described in the protocol (assigned to Arm
             A). OR b) No measurable disease with complete or partial response following at least
             one cycle of gemcitabine-based salvage chemotherapy (assigned to Arm B)

          5. Completed most recent course of chemotherapy at least 2 weeks prior to first study
             drug dose.

          6. Recovery from acute hematological, hepatic and renal chemotherapy-related toxicities
             as defined by

             ≤ Grade 1 according to NCI CTCAE v4.0.

          7. Life expectancy ≥ 8 weeks.

          8. Pulse oximetry of ≥ 90% on room air.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. All Screening Phase exclusion criteria.

          2. Use of any investigational agents within prior 4 weeks.

          3. Radiotherapy within prior 3 weeks.

          4. Major surgery within prior 2 weeks.

          5. Systemic corticosteroids within 24 hours prior to study drug administration.

          6. Symptoms of cardiac failure with New York Heart Association classification of III or
             IV.

          7. Clinically significant medical condition e.g. infection, pulmonary, neurological,
             cardiovascular, metabolic, that could jeopardize patient safety, interfere with the
             objectives of the protocol, or limit patient compliance with study requirements, as
             determined by the Investigator.
