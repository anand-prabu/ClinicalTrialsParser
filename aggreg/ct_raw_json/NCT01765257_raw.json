However, the\n      neuropathological bases of apathy are still unknown. However, recent data suggests that\n      apathy could be linked to a more specific dopaminergic denervation in the ventral striatum.\n\n      Rasagiline increases the bioavailability of striatal endogenous dopamine by blocking the\n      MAO-B. Some recent data suggest rasagiline could be effective to improve apathy in\n      Parkinson's disease.\n\n      The primary outcome is to demonstrate a significant reduction of apathy using the Lille\n      apathy rating scale (LARS) in drug naive patients with early diagnosed Parkinson's disease,\n      using a treatment by rasagiline."
