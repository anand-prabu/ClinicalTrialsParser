It is not yet known if surgery is more effective with or\n      without preoperative chemotherapy in treating non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying surgery and preoperative chemotherapy\n      to see how well they work compared to surgery alone in treating patients with resectable\n      non-small cell lung cancer."

Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo surgical resection no more than 4 weeks after randomization.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive one of the following chemotherapy regimens immediately after\n           randomization:\n\n             -  Regimen 1: Patients receive mitomycin IV, vinblastine IV, and cisplatin IV on day\n                1.\n\n             -  Regimen 2: Patients receive mitomycin IV, ifosfamide IV over 3 hours, and\n                cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1.\n\n             -  Regimen 3: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and vinorelbine IV\n                over 5 -10 minutes on days 1 and 8.\n\n             -  Regimen 4: Patients receive paclitaxel IV and carboplatin IV on day 1.\n\n             -  Regimen 5: Patients receive gemcitabine IV on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin IV over 2\n                hours on day 1.\n\n             -  Regimen 6: Patients receive docetaxel IV and carboplatin IV on day 1. In all\n                regimens, treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a total of 3 courses. Patients\n                undergo surgical resection at least 4 weeks after the last course of chemotherapy.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at 6 and 12 months and then annually thereafter.\n\n      Patients are followed 1 month after surgery, 6 months after randomization, every 3 months\n      for 2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 600 patients (300 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
