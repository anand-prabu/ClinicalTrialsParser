    <textblock>
      The overarching objective of this project is to assess the potential public health impact of
      delivering Tai Ji Quan: Moving for Better Balance, a proven fall prevention program, through
      local community dissemination partners (e.g., senior service providers), in the selected
      counties in the state of Oregon.

    <time_frame>at the study entry</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Target senior centers will be contacted to determine the willingness to adopt the program.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reach - defined by the total number of older adults agreed to participate</measure>
    <time_frame>study on-set</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>This indicator will be determined at the study on-set by documenting number of individuals who express interest in participating and are eventually enrolled in the program.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>implementation, effectiveness, maintenance</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months evaluation on program implementation and effectiveness, and a follow-up at month 18 on program maintenance</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Assessment of implementation includes fidelity evaluation (compliance rate, completion of required teaching and practice protocol).
Effectiveness will be evaluated using falls calendar, physical performance based measures including Functional Reach, Timed Up&amp;Go, 50 foot walk for speed.
Maintenance will be evaluated by measuring continued participation among participants (individual level) and participating centers' (center level) willingness to continue the program.</description>
