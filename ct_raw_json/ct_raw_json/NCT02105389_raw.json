There will be a common structure for all sessions that will include relaxation and breathing exercises as well as a series of poses focused on strengthening, flexibility, and balance. There will be low, moderate and high intensity regimens prescribed depending on the wishes and abilities of the child and parent and the judgment of the yoga instructor."

A\n      unique intervention that combines exercise and relaxation is yoga. This pilot study will\n      evaluate the feasibility of three times weekly yoga sessions administered by a trained yoga\n      instructor for a three week duration and will enroll between 10 and 20 children. If\n      feasible, the intervention will be tested in a randomized controlled trial."

We have chosen to focus on a small number of key endpoints to preserve the feasibility of the pilot and future RCT as incorporation of a large number of endpoints would likely result in greater non-compliance in outcome ascertainment. The secondary analyses will all be descriptive. Variability and change in outcome measures in this study will be used to assess the sample size required in the design of a future efficacy trial.",
