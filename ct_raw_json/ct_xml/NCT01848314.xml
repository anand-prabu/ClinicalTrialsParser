    <textblock>
      Many studies have studied the effect and safety of renal denervation. However,  it remains
      unknown what the exact mechanism behind renal denervation is. It can be hypothesized that a
      difference in renal blood flow occurs after treatment. In the light of this ignorance,
      current study will investigate whether renal denervation leads to a difference in renal
      blood flow after treatment with renal denervation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individual is scheduled to undergo renal denervation as standard patient care for
             resistant hypertension.

          -  Individual is diagnosed with resistant hypertension. Secondary causes and a white
             coat hypertension are actively excluded.

          -  Individual is â‰¥18 years of age.

          -  Individual agrees to have all study procedures performed, and is competent and
             willing to provide written informed consent to participate in this clinical study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individual is excluded from treatment with pRDN .

          -  Individual has an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of &lt;30mL/min/1.73m2,
             using the MDRD calculation.

          -  Individual has experienced a myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, or a
             cerebrovascular accident within 6 months of the screening visit, or has widespread
             atherosclerosis, with documented intravascular thrombosis or unstable plaques.

          -  Individual has any serious medical condition, which in the opinion of the
             investigator, may adversely affect the safety and/or effectiveness of the participant
             or the study (i.e., patients with clinically significant peripheral vascular disease,
             abdominal aortic aneurysm, bleeding disorders such as thrombocytopenia, haemophilia
             or significant   anaemia).

          -  Individual is pregnant, nursing or planning to be pregnant.

          -  Individual has a known, unresolved history of drug use or alcohol dependency, lacks
             the ability to comprehend or follow instructions, or would be unlikely or unable to
             comply with study follow-up requirements.
