  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the healing of the patients spine at 24-months
      following surgery and screw placement among 3 groups. The doctor will also compare clinical
      outcomes and the immediate and delayed medical and surgical complications among the 3 study
      groups. The goal of this study is to determine if treating patients with one of the 3 groups
      is better than the others.

      Patient must be between 18 and 80 years old and have problems with the bones in there lower
      back (lumbar disease) for which Cautious management over at least 3 months has not brought
      relief from back and/or leg pain. Patients will be scheduled to undergo surgery to treat
      there lumbar disease. The surgery will be followed by placement of screws in the back of the
      bones of there lower back. This includes placing solid metal rods that are connected and
      secured to adjacent vertebrae (bones of the back) using screws. The screws are used to hold
      the spine together. Everyone who takes part in this study will be assigned to one of the
      following 3 study groups: 1) One-sided screw placement into the bones above and below the
      area where the nerve is being surgically relieved of its pinching; 2) Same as group 1 but
      with an additional stand alone screw which crosses the spinal joint placed into the joint on
      the other side; 3) Screw placement on both sides into the bones above and below the area
      where the nerve is being surgically relieved of its pinching.
