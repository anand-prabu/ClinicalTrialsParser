            "textblock": "Fibromyalgia is a clinical syndrome characterized by extensive chronic pain. Today, the main\n      theory argues the origin of the pain is \"central sensitization\" which is en amplification of\n      processing and transferring neuronal signals. Patients  usually suffers a wide range of\n      symptoms: extensive pain, chronic fatigue disorders of sleep (having trouble falling asleep,\n      fragmented sleep and early awakening) , mood disorders and cognitive damage. To treat the\n      sleep disorder, the pain and the depuration with Fibromyalgia patients is a complex clinical\n      challenge that usually requires combination of different medicines (short term analgesic +\n      long term analgesics + anti-depressives and so on). Patients are also referred to other\n      treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), occupational therapy treatment,\n      phycisal therapy, alternative medicine and so on.\n\n      Another such non-medical treatment is to try and modifies the patterns of activity of the\n      patient's brain. One approach that draws attention in the last few years is EEG based\n      neuro-feedback (NF). EEG NF is a closed circuit brain computer Interface (BCI) in which the\n      patient gets a feedback from his or her own brain that signifies a certain mental state. The\n      brain-patient feedback allows to train patients in performing a voluntary change of a\n      dedicated brain area, such as pain related areas. In this study we intend to assess the\n      effect of two different EEG-NF protocols targeting different brain areas as compared to\n      placebo (sham) NF and drug therapy on pain and sleep quality measures in fibromyalgia\n      patients."
