            "textblock": "T cells can penetrate virtually every biologic space and have the power to dispose of normal\n      or malignant cells as seen in viral and autoimmune diseases and in the rare spontaneous\n      remis-sions of cancer.  However, T cells are easily tolerized to self or tumor antigens and\n      \"immune surveillance\" has manifestly failed in every cancer that is clinically apparent.  It\n      is the goal of these studies to supply the specificities and affinities to patient T cells\n      without regard for their \"endogenous\" T cell receptor repertoire, directed by\n      antibody-defined recognition to kill malignant cells based on their expression of antigen.\n      We will achieve this by preparing chimeric IgCD28TCR genes in mammalian expression vectors\n      to yield \"designer T cells\" from normal patient cells.  This extends the approach of\n      Anderson, Rosenberg and co-workers to introduce or augment expression of genes in patients'\n      T cells in a therapeutic setting.\n\n      Prior studies in model systems demonstrated that recombinant IgCD28TCR could direct modified\n      T cells to respond to antigen targets with IL2 secretion, cellular proliferation, and\n      cytotoxicity, the hallmarks of an effective, self-sustaining immune response.  It therefore\n      becomes of paramount interest to extend these studies to a human system of widespread\n      clinical relevance to explore the clinical potential of this new technology.  The target\n      antigen for these studies is carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) which is predominantly expressed\n      on tumors of the colon and rectum, breast, pancreas and other sites."
