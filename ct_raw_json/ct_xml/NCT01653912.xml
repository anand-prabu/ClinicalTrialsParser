      PKB116611 is an open-label Phase I/II study of the investigational drug GSK2110183 given in
      combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel to subjects with recurrent ovarian cancer.
      Phase I is a dose escalation evaluation of daily oral doses of GSK2110183 administered in
      combination with every 3 week carboplatin and paclitaxel to any subject with recurrent
      ovarian cancer.  Phase II is a single arm evaluation of the clinical efficacy of the
      combination identified in Phase I to subjects with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.

The dosing regimen identified in Phase I will then be evaluated in Phase II, a single arm study focused on clinical efficacy.  Treatment with the three drug regimen will continue for a maximum of 6 x 21 day cycles followed by continuous GSK2110183 at the single agent MTD.  Subjects may continue on study drug until progression, death or unacceptable toxicity.</description>
