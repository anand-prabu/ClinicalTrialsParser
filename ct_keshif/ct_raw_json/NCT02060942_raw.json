            "textblock": "The assessment of the cardiovascular state in critically ill patients is subject to\n      difficulties in terms of the fact that several hemodynamic parameters, for example mean\n      arterial blood pressure (MAP) and cardiac output (CO) supply insufficient information about\n      the circulating volume and cardiac performance. There is a clinical need to adequate\n      determination of intravascular volume status and therefore reliable predictors of fluid\n      responsiveness are highly relevant. However, in determining the fluid status of a patient,\n      the lack of appreciation of the venous side of the circulation persists today, which is\n      greatly due to the inability to appropriately assess the venous side of the circulation. The\n      importance of the venous part of the circulation is moreover reflected by the fact that an\n      increase in venous resistance does reduce CO many times more than a similar increase in\n      arterial resistance. Mean systemic filling pressure (Pms), which is defined as the pressure\n      equal to the pressure which would be measured if the heart should suddenly stop pumping and\n      all (arterial and venous) the pressures in the entire circulatory system should be brought\n      to equilibrium instantaneously, is a good, complete and reliable reflection of the total\n      intravascular fluid compartment. Passive leg raising (PLR) represents a \"self-volume\n      challenge\" that predicts preload responsiveness and the transient hemodynamic changes on\n      venous return can be directly monitored in ventilated patients, provided that there is an\n      intact circulation, in order to test the amount of volume responsiveness."
