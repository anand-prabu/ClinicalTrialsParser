  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Defense Automated Neurobehavioral Assessment (DANA) was recently developed as a durable,
      portable, and &quot;field-hardened&quot; NeuroCognitive Assessment Tool. The purpose of this study is
      to compare the sensitivity of the DANA Brief exam with the Automated Neuropsychological
      Assessment Metrics (ANAM) battery currently used by the military after concussion. The
      primary hypothesis is that the DANA Brief exam will be more sensitive for detecting
      continued impaired cognitive performance than the ANAM during recovery after a concussion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among active duty military personnel deployed to combat theaters, blast injury is a leading
      cause of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Service members with TBI can experience notable
      neurological impairments-e.g., attention disturbances, memory and language deficits, and
      delayed reaction time. Cognitive performance can still be impaired 2-4 weeks after
      concussion with no overt physical symptoms. Thus, there is a critical need to have an
      efficient means to determine the incidence of cognitive deficits in service members exposed
      to or injured by blasts. To that end, this study plans to evaluate the ANAM and the DANA to
      determine which neurocognitive test more reliably and accurately detects cognitive
      impairments during the recovery period from a concussion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Active-duty U.S. military service members

          -  Clinical diagnosis of concussion/mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) (as defined by
             the American Congress of Rehabilitation, 1993, and DoD), made by the treating
             clinician based on clinical history, examination and/or clinical imaging performed as
             part of standard of care. This includes subjects with concussion from any mechanism
             (blast-related, blunt trauma etc.)--for concussed subjects only

          -  Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15 as assessed by the consenting research
             staff--for concussed subjects only

          -  Concussive event that occurred within 72 hours of injury (to exclude service members
             presenting due to lingering effects of a previous injury)--for concussed subjects
             only

          -  Willingness to participate in the study, ability to communicate and comply with the
             study protocol and ability to provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a history of other mTBI within 90 days, moderate brain injury within the past 3
             years, or any lifetime history of severe brain injury

          -  History of a documented diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or of
             treatment for PTSD

          -  Taking psychoactive medications, opioids, or other significant sedating medication

          -  Individuals with severe psychiatric disorders requiring continuing medication or
             recent treatment for an alcohol or drug dependency

          -  Report a pain level of 8 or greater on the 10-point Likert scale of 1 to 10 (e.g., 8,
             9 or 10).
