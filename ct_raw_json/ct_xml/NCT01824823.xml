    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well giving afatinib after chemoradiation and
      surgery works in treating patients with stage III-IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
      neck at high-risk of recurrence. Afatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine disease-free survival (DFS) given afatinib/placebo adjuvant therapy in patients
      with viable tumors in lymph nodes after neck dissection for suspected residual disease after
      concurrent chemoradiation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the recurrence rate, recurrence patterns, development of second primary
      malignancies, overall survival (OS) and toxicity of afatinib/placebo.

      II. Evaluate on-target inhibition by afatinib, and determine circulating deoxyribonucleic
      acid (DNA) as a biomarker of afatinib resistance.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive afatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD on days 1-28.

      In both Arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 1 year and then every 12 months for 1 year.
