    <textblock>
      This study of vitamin D is designed to assess both the safety and efficacy of potential
      doses (2,000 IU/day and 4,000 IU/day) in raising a vitamin D level to a normal range in a
      short period of time (e.g. 4 weeks or less) compared to 200 IU/day.

      In children with vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency who are at risk for severe asthma
      exacerbations, we hypothesize that both vitamin D supplementation with 4,000 IU/day and
      2,000 IU/day will safely achieve normal vitamin D levels, but that the higher dose (4,000
      IU/day) will result in a larger proportion of subjects achieving this level within 4 weeks.

      Asthma is a major public health problem in the United States and worldwide. Severe disease
      exacerbations account for the majority of costs attributable to asthma in the United States.
       Vitamin D is an essential nutrient with significant immuno-modulatory effects. The
      observation that vitamin D insufficiency and asthma share risk factors such as urban
      residence, obesity, and African American ethnicity has generated significant interest in
      exploring a link between these two conditions.

      This is an 8-week randomized, double-masked, controlled trial of vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day
      and 4,000 IU/day) to achieve vitamin D sufficiency (a serum 25(OH)D ≥30 ng/ml in 60
      school-aged children (ages 6 to 14 years) who have vitamin D insufficiency (a serum 25(OH)D
      &lt;30 ng/ml) and are at risk for severe asthma exacerbations, but whose asthma that is
      well-controlled on medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) at the end of a 4-week run-in
      period.
