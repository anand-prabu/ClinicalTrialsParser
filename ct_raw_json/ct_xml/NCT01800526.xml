  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two primary processes dominate the complications associated with sickle cell disease (SCD):
      vasoocclusion and hemolysis. Vasoocclusion is very likely to account for the tissue
      infarction and pain associated with the disease, while hemolysis liberates hemoglobin into
      the plasma where it scavenges nitric oxide (NO), producing vascular complications such as
      pulmonary hypertension and skin ulcers. The plasma and vessel wall adhesive protein von
      Willebrand factor (VWF) is thought to be involved in both of these processes, so strategies
      aimed at reducing its secretion or reactivity, which could decrease complications in
      patients with SCD, are being tested.

      Based on prior studies, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment may decrease VWF activity in
      patients with SCD and may be a useful adjunctive treatment in this disorder.

      This is a pilot study in patients with hemoglobin homozygous S (HbSS) or hemoglobin S with
      beta zero thalassemia(HbS-Î²o thalassemia), with the aim of examining the effect of NAC
      treatment on VWF parameters. As a first step, the investigators will examine whether
      intravenous or oral administration of NAC, in doses used to treat other conditions, changes
      VWF content, activity, multimer size, or extent of oxidation. In prior studies,
      investigators have shown that a number of patients followed in the sickle cell clinic at the
      University of Washington have ultralarge VWF multimers and high VWF:total activity (TA).
      Only patients with elevated VWF are eligible for this pilot study.

    <description>Eligible subjects who did not participate in Intravenous NAC or subjects who are at least 4 weeks after participation in Intravenous NAC, will be given Oral NAC at a dose of 2400mg daily, in two equally divided doses, for 4 weeks. Subjects will have blood drawn prior to beginning the phase and weekly for 4 weeks. Women will have a pregnancy test at each visit. Subjects will maintain a diary.  At each visit interim medical events and adverse events will be collected.</description>

    <description>Eligible subjects who did not participate in Oral NAC or subjects who are at least 4 weeks after participation in Oral NAC will be administered NAC by IV infusion at 75mg/Kg loading dose over 60 minutes, followed by a 75mg/Kg dose by continuous infusion over 7 hours. At least four weeks after the first infusion, and if the subject tolerated the first infusion, the subject will receive NAC by IV infusion at a 150mg/Kg loading dose over 60 minutes followed by a 150mg/Kg dose over 7 hours. Blood will be drawn prior to the infusion, at the end of the loading dose, at the conclusion of the infusion, and 24 and 72 hours post infusion.  Vital signs will be monitored and adverse events collected. Females will have a negative pregnancy test prior to starting the infusion.</description>
