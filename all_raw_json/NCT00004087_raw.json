Peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by monoclonal\n      antibody therapy used to kill tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody\n      plus peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have metastatic or\n      recurrent colorectal cancer or pancreatic cancer that has not responded to previous\n      treatment."

Determine the maximum tolerated dose and secondary organ toxicity of high\n      dose yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody MN-14 (90Y-hMN-14) plus autologous peripheral blood\n      stem cell rescue in patients with metastatic or recurrent colorectal or pancreatic cancer.\n      II. Compare the tumor to organ dose ratio between 90Y-hMN-14 and iodine 131 monoclonal\n      antibody MN-14 (131I-MN-14) in these patients. III. Determine the antitumor effects with\n      myeloablative doses of 90Y-hMN-14. IV. Evaluate the immunogenicity of 90Y-hMN-14 in these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation of yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody MN-14 (90Y-hMN-14),\n      multicenter study. Patients are stratified by prior radiotherapy (yes vs no). Patients\n      receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously on days -18 to -14 and peripheral blood stem cell\n      (PBSC) collection on days -15 to -13. If an adequate number of CD34+ cells are not\n      harvested, bone marrow is also collected. Patients receive pretherapy imaging with indium In\n      111 monoclonal antibody MN-14 (IN111-MN-14) IV on days -7 to 0. Patients receive 90Y-hMN-14\n      for up to 40 minutes on day 0. PBSC are reinfused on days 7 to 14. Patients receive G-CSF SQ\n      until blood counts recover. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 90Y-hMN-14\n      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at\n      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at\n      1-4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 weeks, and then every 6 months thereafter for up to 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
