  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity, which afflicts ~65% of the U.S. population and more than 1 billion
      people worldwide, increases the risk of developing hypertension. Activation of the renin
      angiotensin system (RAS) is an important mechanism by which obesity leads to hypertension.
      In addition to its vasoconstricting and sodium retaining actions, angiotensin II also has
      potent pro-inflammatory actions including macrophage infiltration and expression of
      proinflammatory cytokines in target tissues. Adipose tissue and skeletal muscle appear to be
      a key sites for the generation of proinflammatory cytokines. Although angiotensin II
      receptor blockade reduces inflammation in many tissues, the effects on adipose tissue and
      skeletal muscle in humans are not clear. Importantly, the chronic low grade inflammatory
      state that accompanies obesity complicates hypertension by contributing to insulin
      resistance and accelerating cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the general aim of the
      present proposal will be to determine the influence of angiotensin II receptor blockade on
      adipose tissue and skeletal muscle inflammation and its relation to improvements in insulin
      sensitivity, if observed, in obese hypertensive humans.  To address these aims, 44 obese
      (BMI&gt;30 kg/m2) hypertensive (BP&gt;140 systolic and/or 90 diastolic) individuals (age=50-65
      years) will be randomized to receive 8 weeks of either the angiotensin II receptor
      antagonist, olmesartan medoxidil, or no treatment in a crossover manner. Subcutaneous
      adipose tissue and skeletal muscle biopsies will be obtained and insulin sensitivity
      (intravenous glucose tolerance tests) will be assessed at baseline and following 8 weeks of
      each intervention. A two week washout period will separate the interventions.

    <description>Subjects will be provided with daily 20 mg of olmesartan for the first 2 weeks. Subjects receive additional daily doses of 40 mg olmesartan for the remainder of the study period. The dose remains at 20 mg per day, however, if BP falls below 110/70 during the first 2 weeks. Subjects will continue taking the drug during the 2-week follow-up period. Subjects will take no drug during the control period (ie., no placebo is provided).</description>
