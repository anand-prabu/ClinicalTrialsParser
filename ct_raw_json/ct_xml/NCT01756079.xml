  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to find out if the addition of boceprevir to standard of care (SOC)
      treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b (PegIFN-2b) + ribavirin (RBV) is effective for
      participants with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1 and cirrhosis who were not
      successfully treated by previous SOC.  All participants will receive treatment with SOC
      alone for 4 weeks and then boceprevir will be added to the treatment regimen for 44
      additional weeks of combined treatment.
