Given that a considerable number of\n      glaucoma patients also suffer from cataract, it is reasonable to test Hyaluronan Thiomer\n      i.o. during a combined procedure of phacoemulsification and deep sclerectomy. This is also\n      of importance because a combined procedure avoids the need of a second operation in this\n      group of patients. Finally, it has been shown that combined phacoemulsification - deep\n      sclerectomy does not induce a further risk compared to deep sclerectomy alone(open phase I\n      study).\n\n      Safety will be assessed based on the occurrence of adverse events.\n\n      Efficacy assessments will be performed at every visit and efficacy analysis will include:\n\n        -  Proportion of subjects at each study time point which will need additional IOP lowering\n           drug therapy to achieve an IOP reduction to values < 21 mmHg. If a subject needs more\n           than one drug to achieve target IOP, the number of drugs needed to achieve adequate IOP\n           reduction will be recorded.\n\n        -  Proportion of subjects at each time point which will need Neodymium:YAG goniopuncture\n           to achieve an IOP reduction to values < 21 mmHg."
