  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orthostatic hypotension following total hip arthroplasty is known to limit the ability of
      patients to perform physical therapy (PT) and increase the length of hospital stay and
      costs. Our goal is to prospectively study the effects of oral midodrine on the signs and
      symptoms of orthostatic hypotension in 20 patients and the effects of intravenous fluid on
      the signs of symptoms of orthostatic hypotension in 10 patients. Midodrine will be
      administered to patients with suspected low SVR, and an intravenous fluid bolus will be
      administered to patients with low CO. 120 patients will be consented with a view to studying
      30 patients who meet the inclusion criteria for orthostatic hypotension. Patients who
      receive midodrine or the fluid bolus will undergo hemodynamic measurements at 30 min, 1 hr,
      2 hrs, 3 hrs, and 4 hrs post-intervention. All patients will undergo measurements for blood
      pressure, arterial augmentation index, and heart rate at baseline (pre-op; holding area) and
      the time of first PT attempt. Patients will be monitored up to post-operative day 3. The
      working hypothesis is that midodrine or fluid therapy will significantly raise the mean
      arterial blood pressure (MAP) by 5 mmHg+ and/or cause a significant change in the
      Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (characterized by a two-point improvement in symptom
      score).
