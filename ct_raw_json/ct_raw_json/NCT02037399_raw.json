The causes of pain associated\n      with ESD or gastric polypectomy are thought to be associated with transmural burn or\n      transmural air leak. How control localized pain for patients who suffered from pain after\n      ESD is appearing as new medical interests. There are few studies about management strategy\n      for pain after ESD. Glucocorticoids are used to reduce inflammation and tissue damage in\n      various clinical settings including inflammatory disease, rheumatic disease, and so on. The\n      efficacy of glucocorticoids for reducing pain after surgery has recently been investigated.\n      Glucocorticoids are thought to locally inhibit collagen deposition and fibrosis and finally\n      reduce scar-tissue formation. Especially systemic steroids are easy to achieve a continuous\n      effect through stable serum concentrations. If pain was partially associated with acute\n      inflammation, we assumed intravenous dexamethasone could be helpful to relieve pain after\n      ESD based on previous studies. we aimed to assess the efficacy of single dose postoperative\n      intravenous dexamethasone for pain relief after ESD."
