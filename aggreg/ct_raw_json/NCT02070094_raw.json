T-DM1 represents colony monoclonal antibody ( trastuzumab ) , associated with\n      chemotherapy . Antibodies to T-DM1 target marker on breast cancer cells called HER2, which\n      allows the drug to go directly to the cancer cells . Using T-DM1 in this study considers a\n      standard type of cancer treatment in this study. ABT- 737 is an oral medication ( taken by\n      mouth ), which researchers believe may help T-DM1 work better and demonstrate the value of\n      this combination compared with the agents used alone.\n\n      In the case of breast cancer , it has been particularly difficult because of the very\n      heterogeneous nature of the genetic changes that underlie this condition. Known molecular\n      concentrate for treatment of breast cancer is the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway . Last treat of\n      218 cases, the majority of tumors showed that forty-two % of the main tumor and one hundred\n      % of metastases inhabiting genomic aberrations in this pathway .\n\n      Hence, there is substantial energy to rationally combine PI3K-AKT inhibitors into mixture\n      treatment protocols."
