      Exploring the relationship between serum VAP-1 and cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy in
      subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus

    <textblock>
      The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is increasing recently, especially in the urban area of
      developing countries. Subjects with diabetes have higher rate of hospitalization and have
      higher mortality. Diabetes results in various complications including diabetic retinopathy,
      nephropathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular complications. Among these, cardiovascular
      autonomic neuropathy is one of clinical important complication of diabetes. Diabetic
      subjects with reduced cardiovascular autonomic function have been shown to strongly
      associate with an increased risk of silent myocardial ischemia and increased mortality. They
      also have higher risk of sudden death, intraoperative and perioperative cardiovascular
      instability. Formation of advanced glycation end product (AGE) and oxidative stress are
      important causes of diabetic neuropathy. Vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1), an adhesion
      molecule with an activity of semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidases (SSAO), which can
      catalyze endogenous amines to produces corresponding aldehydes, H2O2, and ammonia. We have
      demonstrated that serum VAP-1 is a source of systemic AGE and oxidative stress, and is
      associated with nephropathy and atherosclerosis. There are reports demonstrating that
      subjects with diabetic retinopathy or stroke have higher serum VAP-1. To our best knowledge,
      there is no report regarding the relationship between serum VAP-1 and neuropathy. In present
      study, we will measure serum VAP-1 and check cardiovascular autonomic function. We will also
      explore the relationship between serum VAP-1 and cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy in
      subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
