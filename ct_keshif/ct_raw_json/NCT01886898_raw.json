Growth and other measurements will be\n      collected on five separate occasions during this period, ie 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks of\n      life. Although the study intervention formally ends at 16 weeks, it will be useful to have a\n      follow up visit at 26 weeks to collect further data on the gut microflora in the sub-group\n      of infants who have already provided a stool sample at 8 weeks.  This follow-up visit will\n      be of benefit to the subject as they receive a weight check and clinical examination by a\n      paediatrician and will be offered to all subjects (no invasive procedures will be carried\n      out)."
