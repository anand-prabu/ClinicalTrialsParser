  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through many years, the standard care has been to use continuous sedation of critically ill
      patients during mechanical ventilation. However, preliminary randomised clinical trials
      indicate that it is beneficial to reduce the sedation level in these patients. The NONSEDA
      trial is an investigator-initiated, randomised, clinical, parallel-group, multinational,
      superiority trial designed to include 700 patients from at least six ICUs in Denmark, Norway
      and Sweden, comparing no sedation with sedation and a daily wake-up trial during mechanical
      ventilation. This is a substudy of the NONSEDA trial, concerning 250 patients included at
      trialsite Kolding, Denmark. The aim of the substudy is to assess the effects of no sedation
      on posttraumatic stress disorder after discharge from ICU.

      Our hypothesis is that critically ill patients who are not sedated during mechanical
      ventilation will have less posttraumatic stress disorder after discharge.
