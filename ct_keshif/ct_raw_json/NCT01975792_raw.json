In response to stress, the\n      fetal thymus gland may shrink, or involute. The investigators propose a prospective cohort\n      study that will enroll pregnant women admitted to labor and delivery for the management of\n      preterm labor and/or preterm premature rupture of membranes from 28-36 weeks gestation.\n      Based on sonographic thymus measurements, the investigators will develop a clinical\n      prediction tool to identify babies who are at increased risk for adverse neonatal outcomes.\n      A reliable non-invasive predictor of adverse neonatal outcome using thymic ultrasound\n      measurements has the potential to affect clinical management, improve outcomes for premature\n      babies, and direct further research efforts."
