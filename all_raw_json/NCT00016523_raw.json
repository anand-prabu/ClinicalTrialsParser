The trial compared iNO therapy to\n      mock gas delivery as the control, and otherwise incorporated conventional management\n      strategies (including treatment with surfactant and high frequency ventilation as adjuncts\n      to iNO therapy).\n\n      During the initial dosing, iNO was started at 5 ppm and could be increased to 10 ppm. If the\n      infant did not respond, study gas was discontinued. For infants who responded to study gas,\n      a gradual weaning was initiated. The total exposure to study gas did not exceed 336 hours\n      (14 days). Infants were monitored for signs of toxicity.\n\n      Medical and neurodevelopmental outcome of surviving infants were assessed at 18 to 22 months\n      corrected age by masked, certified examiners."
