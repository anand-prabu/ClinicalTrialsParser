Determine the response rate in patients treated with this drug. III. Determine the\n      toxicity of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the overall survival of patients\n      treated with this drug. V. Determine whether overexpression of epidermal growth factor\n      receptor and expression of cyclo-oxygenase-2 can predict the effectiveness of this drug in\n      these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.\n\n      Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for up to 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 7-10 months."
