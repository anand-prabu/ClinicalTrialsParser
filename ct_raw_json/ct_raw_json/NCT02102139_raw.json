            "textblock": "Dexmedetomidine (DXM) is a recently released and approved alpha 2 agonist with a relatively\n      high ratio of \u03b12/\u03b11-activity and an almost fourfold shorter half-life than clonidine.It's\n      sympatholytic, sedative, and analgesic properties makes DXM a useful anaesthetic adjuvant\n      for general anaesthesia. While there are some reports of the beneficial effects of DXM on\n      anaesthetic requirements and haemodynamic responses to endotracheal intubation, the effect\n      of a single preoperative injection of DXM in terms of attenuating haemodymanic responses to\n      surgical stimulation in robot-assisted thyroidectomy is unknown.\n\n      When a robotic thyroidectomy using the bilateral axillary breast approach (BABA) technique\n      is performed, subcutaneous tunnelling in the neck and anterior chest, which is defined as\n      hydrodissection, is mandatory. Unfortunately, the procedure leads to significant\n      haemodynamic responses, such as increases in blood pressure and heart rate.\n\n      We hypothesised that preoperative DXM administration would attenuate the haemodynamic\n      responses to hydrodissection. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of a single\n      preoperative administration of DXM on haemodynamic responses to hydrodissection in robotic\n      thyroidectomy by comparing the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of remifentanil\n      needed to maintain haemodynamic stability during hydrodissection between DXM and control\n      groups. We also investigated the effects of preoperative DXM administration on total doses\n      of remifentanil and propofol administered intraoperatively."
