            "textblock": "Men who have sex with men (MSM) bear a disproportionate burden of the Human Immunodeficiency\n      Virus (HIV) epidemic in Canada, and HIV incidence appears to be rising among Canadian MSM\n      (1). MSM comprised nearly half (44.1%) of new positive HIV tests in 2009 (2). Among MSM in\n      Ontario, from 2001 to 2006, HIV diagnoses increased 26% (3). Given the alarmingly high HIV\n      prevalence rates among MSM in North American cities, there is a critical need for HIV\n      prevention interventions for MSM in Canada. Social anxiety, or anxiety about being evaluated\n      in interpersonal situations, is a reliable risk factor for unprotected anal intercourse\n      (UAI) among MSM (4 and 5). Social anxiety is highly modifiable via cognitive-behavioural\n      therapy, a form of psychotherapy (6). Social anxiety may also increase substance use in\n      sexual situations, which is another risk factor for HIV among MSM (7 and 8). As such, an\n      empirically-based social anxiety treatment may also reduce HIV risk behaviours among MSM.\n      The present study will provide Phase I trial data for a novel and innovative HIV prevention\n      intervention for MSM. This is a proposal to test a novel integrated HIV prevention\n      intervention that combines empirically supported treatments for social anxiety with HIV risk\n      reduction counseling to reduce HIV sexual risk behaviour."
