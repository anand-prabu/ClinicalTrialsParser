            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - People who have the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) often take several medications to\n      control their disease. They may also need to take medicine to prevent blood clots. Taking\n      both kinds of medicine together can cause bleeding or other problems. But this might not\n      happen if the medications are taken at different times. Researchers will study two\n      particular HIV drugs (ritonavir and cobicistat) and how they interact with blood clot\n      medications.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      -To understand how HIV medicine and blood clot medicine interact, so doctors can choose what\n      to prescribe for people who take both.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Healthy adults between 18 and 70 years old who are not on any medications.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples\n           will be collected. Urine samples will be collected from participants who might become\n           pregnant.\n\n        -  Participants will visit the National Institutes of Health 7 times after the screening\n           visit. Three visits will last about 12 hours. The other 4 will last about 1 hour.\n\n        -  Participants will take a daily dose of either study medication for 22 days. They will\n           keep a diary of medicine they take and any side effects.\n\n        -  Treatment will be monitored with blood tests over about 2 months.\n\n        -  When the study of one drug is completed, the next drug study will begin with a\n           different group of participants."

            "textblock": "Advances in antiretroviral (ARV) pharmacotherapy have translated to increased longevity and\n      improved quality of life in people living with HIV; hence, elderly individuals comprise an\n      increasing proportion of today   s HIV population. Moreover, HIV infection itself has become\n      recognized as a condition characterized by a hypercoaguable state and premature immunologic\n      aging. Potential interactions between ARVs and anticoagulant medications are of particular\n      concern considering that many elderly, and even non-elderly HIV patients will require\n      short-term or chronic anticoagulation to prevent and/or treat systemic embolism. Dabigatran,\n      administered as dabigatran etexilate, is an oral irreversible, competitive direct thrombin\n      inhibitor, which has been shown to be superior to warfarin, and non-inferior to enoxaparin,\n      in preventing thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation and undergoing orthopedic\n      surgery, respectively.\n\n      While dabigatran itself is not a substrate of Permeability-glycoprotein (P-gp), its\n      inactivepro-drug, dabigatran etexilate, is a substrate of P-gp. Co-administration of\n      dabigatran etexilate with P-gp modulators has resulted in significant changes in dabigatran\n      exposure. The pharmacokinetic enhancers, ritonavir and cobicistat, as inhibitors of P-gp,\n      are expected to increase plasma concentrations of dabigatran; however, neither agent has\n      been studied in combination with dabigatran etexilate, to date. Hence, the purpose of this\n      study is to determine whether the separate co-administration of ritonavir or cobicistat with\n      dabigatran etexilate increases the systemic exposure of dabigatran in healthy volunteers,\n      and if so, whether adjusting the administration times of these medications can circumvent\n      this interaction.\n\n      In this open-label study, 32 healthy volunteers will be assigned to 1 of 2 groups. Group A\n      will consist of 16 subjects who will take 22 days of ritonavir; Group B will consist of 16\n      subjects who will take 22 days of cobicistat. All subjects will receive 3 separated single\n      doses of dabigatran etexilate. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) sampling for\n      dabigatran will occur on Days 0     1, Day 19  1     20, and Day 26  1     27.\n\n      The PD effects of dabigatran will be characterized via ecarin clotting time (ECT)\n      measurements. Dabigatran PK/PD parameters will be determined using non-compartmental methods\n      with the WinNonlin   professional computer program (version 5.2; Pharsight Corporation,\n      Mountain View, CA). The following PK/PD parameters will be compared between the groups: area\n      under the curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24), maximum total dabigatran plasma concentration\n      (Cmax), area under the curve from 0 to infinity hours (AUC0-   ), time to maximum plasma\n      concentration (tmax), terminal half-life (T (Omega)), apparent oral clearance (CL/F), area\n      under the effect curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUEC0-24), and the maximum effect ratio over\n      baseline (ERmax)."
