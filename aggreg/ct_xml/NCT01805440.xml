  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is to see if the
      investigational medication, uridine, reduces symptoms of depression in adolescents and young
      adults with bipolar disorder.  Uridine is a naturally occurring chemical that is made by the
      human liver.  Uridine is part of a family of compounds called pyrimidines and is normally
      involved in many of the body's processes, such as the use of energy by cells.  The reason
      for the MRI component of this study is to learn about new ways to see inside the brain. The
      investigators will use magnetic fields and radio waves to look at the brain and chemicals in
      the brain. The investigators hope that this technique will have medial use in the future.

      The primary hypothesis is that compared to placebo, 500 mg of twice daily uridine for six
      weeks will be associated with a significant increase in phosphocreatine (PCr) and
      glutamate-glutamine-GABA (Glx) brain concentrations. A secondary hypothesis is that
      decreased depressive symptoms measured with the Children Depression Rating Scale-Revised
      (CDRS-R) and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) will be reciprocally
      correlated with a significant increase in PCr concentrations in subjects randomized to
      uridine compared to placebo. Additionally, we hypothesize that 500 mg of twice daily uridine
      for 6 weeks will be associated with a significant decrease in Glx compared to placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants 18 years of age and older must be able to grant consent and participants
             under the age of 18 years must be abel to grant assent and parent/guardian
             permission.

          -  Participants must be between the ages of 13 and 21 years.

          -  Participants must meet DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar Disorder (Type I, II, or NOS),
             with current mood state depressed for at least 2 weeks.

          -  Participants must have current CDRS-R score of 45 or greater or MADRS score 25 or
             greater.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must not meet DSM-IV criteria for a psychotic or developmental disorder
             or substance dependence.

          -  Participants must not currently be experiencing clinically significant suicidal or

             ferromagnetic implant or claustrophobia).

          -  Participants may be outpatients or inpatients, but incarcerated persons will be
             excluded because this study is not approved for &quot;Research Involving Prisoners.&quot;
