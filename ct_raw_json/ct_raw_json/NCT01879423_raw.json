Venous blood (2 ml\n      each) is taken immediately before dosing (pre-dose) and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12,\n      24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144 and 168 hours post dose to determine the lamotrigine\n      concentration in serum. Drug concentration in serum at different time points will be\n      determined for each subject with a validated bioanalytical method using LC/MS/MS method. The\n      main pharmacokinetic parameters such as Cmax, tmax, AUC(0-inf), AUC(0-t), t1/2, \u03bbz, CL/F and\n      Vd/F are calculated for subjects using non-compartment analysis method.\n\n      Physical examination, electrocardiogram and clinical laboratory tests are conducted at\n      screening and 168 hours after administration of each dose; vital signs are measured at\n      scheduled time; adverse events are recorded throughout the study. Clinically relevant safety\n      measurement values are tabulated to evaluate the safety and tolerability of lamotrigine\n      dispersible/chewable tablet. Safety evaluation lasts up to 168 hours after the second oral\n      administration."
