The microphone for the dosimeter was suspended from the inside of the incubator such\n      that it hung 1 foot above the infants nose and mouth. The exhalation port for NCPAP was\n      placed outside of the incubator. Repeated measurement periods on the same mode of support\n      were made within a 72 hour period. Each infant the acted as their own control and was\n      switched within 7 days to the alternative respiratory support method that maintained similar\n      SaO2 goals and repeat measurements were obtained. Comparisons of mean decibel levels during\n      recording were compared using paired t-tests."
