  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the new vehicle formulations containing ingenol
      mebutate are as safe and effective as Picato® gel 0.05% (it's current vehicle formulation)
      when applied to AK lesions on the forearm for two consecutive days.

      This study will be run in 2 parts.  The first part involves applying escalating
      concentrations of the new vehicle formulations containing ingenol mebutate to AKs on the
      forearms.  Reactions and safety will be compared to Picato®  (a registered and marketed
      ingenol  mebutate gel) to ascertain if the new vehicle formulations are at least as safe and
      effective as Picato® .  The purpose of part 2 is to select the concentration in the &quot;new
      formulation&quot; that produces this same, if not better response, as Picato® and with a similar
      or better safety profile.
