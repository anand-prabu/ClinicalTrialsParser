    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ipilimumab when given together
      with brentuximab vedotin in treating patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and brentuximab vedotin, can block cancer growth
      in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find
      cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of the
      combination of brentuximab vedotin and ipilimumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate complete response (CR) rate, partial response (PR) rate and overall response
      rate (ORR), for the combination of brentuximab vedotin and ipilimumab.

      II. To evaluate the duration of remission (DOR) to the combination of brentuximab vedotin
      and ipilimumab, and compare with the DOR achieved with the most recent prior systemic
      therapy.

      III. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) and the overall survival (OS) in
      patients receiving the combination of brentuximab vedotin and ipilimumab.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the ability of the combination of brentuximab and ipilimumab to alter tumor
      specific T cell immunity.

      II. To evaluate a panel of cytokine and T cell specific biomarkers from the peripheral blood
      as a potential immune signature of treatment response to therapy with brentuximab vedotin
      and ipilimumab for patients with relapsed / refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).

      III. To evaluate using gene expression profiling (GEP) a signature of response to the novel
      combination of an antibody drug conjugate with immunomodulatory therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ipilimumab.

      Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1 of courses 1-4, 8,
      12, and 16 and brentuximab vedotin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for up to 16 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 years.

Given limited data, the analyses of PD-1, co-expression of Tim-3 with PD-1, ICOS, sCD30, galectin-1 and the peripheral blood absolute lymphocyte to monocyte ratio will be mainly exploratory and will be summarized descriptively at the time-points described above.

    <description>Differentially expressed genes will be identified using a rank-based method developed by Dr. Hong (RankProd, R package, Bioconductor Project) with multiple comparison adjustment using a false discovery rate approach. A two-way unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis will be applied to both the genes and the samples to illustrate whether GEP can separate two groups or is associated with other clinical factors. The genes ranked as most significant will be assessed by gene ontology and pathway analysis for their potential functions in lymphoma biology and treatment failure.</description>
