A low dose\n      of an old anesthetic drug, ketamine, administered during surgery can possibly reduce pain\n      and morphine consumption in these patients. Our purpose is to investigate the effect of low\n      dose ketamine on morphine consumption and pain after spine surgery in patients with a daily\n      use of opioids. Our hypothesis is that low dose ketamine can reduce morphine consumption,\n      pain and side-effects after spine surgery."

Intraoperative ketamine in subanesthetic doses can\n      possibly reduce hyperalgesia and reduce opioid-tolerance in these patients. Ketamine is a\n      non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that works by blocking the\n      NMDA receptors in the central and peripheral nerve system. It can be used for general\n      anesthesia but the drug also has other properties including lowering of central excitability\n      and reducing postoperative opioid tolerance by modeling the opioid receptors. Further more\n      it can possibly reduce chronic pain by blocking wind-up effect when blocking the NMDA\n      receptors.\n\n      Our purpose is to investigate the effect of intraoperative ketamine on opioid consumption\n      and pain after spine surgery in opioid-dependent patients. Our hypothesis is that ketamine\n      can reduce opioid consumption and reduce postoperative pain and side effects compared to\n      placebo."
