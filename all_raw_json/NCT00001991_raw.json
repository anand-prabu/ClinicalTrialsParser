The clinical condition of the\n             patient and appropriate physiologic criteria should be used in evaluating patients\n             for therapy with 566C80.  Patients who are rapidly progressing in disease severity or\n             have severe disease as evidenced by sustained tachypnea (e.g., sustained respiratory\n             rate > 30 breaths/minute), rapid deterioration in (A-a)DO2 and chest radiograph may\n             not be appropriate candidates for oral therapy, including 566C80.  Therapy with\n             parenteral pentamidine should be undertaken in these cases.  Treatment with IV\n             trimetrexate or primaquine / clindamycin should be considered for these patients\n             unless the patient is known to have dose-limiting intolerance to these agents.\n             Patients with severe PCP who are intolerant and/or unresponsive to therapy with TMP /\n             SMX and parenteral pentamidine may enroll in the 566C80 open-label compassionate plea\n             protocol.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria\n\n        Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded: History of serious or\n        dose-limiting adverse experience during previous 566C80 therapy, thought to be\n        attributable to the drug."
