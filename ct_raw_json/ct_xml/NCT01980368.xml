  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-adjusted colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality has declined over the past two decades for
      both genders leading to significant increase in the proportion of CRC survivors. Fatigue is
      one of the most consistently identified problems among CRC survivors, persisting a year or
      more after diagnosis for some. Physical activity is critical to improve fatigue symptoms
      among CRC survivors. It has been established in previous studies that CRC survivors who
      engage in physical exercise report reduced fatigue and better quality of life compared to
      those who lack physical exercise (Paddle, Au, &amp;amp; Courneya, 2008). However, it can be a
      challenge to engage fatigued CRC survivors in physical activity. An alternative form of
      physical exercise is Tai Chi Easy (TCEasy), a simple and repetitive form of exercise that
      consists of movements with meditation. When performed at a moderate level, TCEasy provides
      an alternative to standard moderate intensity aerobic exercise. Our Arizona State University
      collaborators in this proposed study have experience in testing the same form of exercise
      among women with breast cancer survivors. We intend to further study the effects of TCEasy
      in improving fatigue and fatigue related symptoms among the colorectal cancer survivors.
