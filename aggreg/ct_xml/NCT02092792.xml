    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolera bility, and
      PK of escalating doses of DLYE5953A administered to patients with in curable, locally
      advanced, or metastatic solid malignancy that has progressed on standard therapy. The Phase
      I study consists of two stages: Stage 1 dose-escala tion and Stage 2 expansion in selected
      patients. In Stage 1, a 3 + 3 dose-escala tion design will be used to examine the safety,
      tolerability, and PK of increasi ng doses of DLYE5953A. In Stage 2, patients will be
      enrolled to further characte rize the safety, tolerability, and PK of the proposed dose and
      schedule for futu re studies.
