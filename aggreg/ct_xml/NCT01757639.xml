      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ipilimumab in treating patients
      with relapsed or refractory high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some
      block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill
      them or carry cancer-killing substances to them.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety and toxicity associated with the administration of ipilimumab in
      terms of dose limiting toxicities (DLT), and maximally-tolerated dose (MTD) in a cohort of
      patients with high risk myelodysplastic syndrome who failed hypomethylating therapy, and
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent induction therapy but are not
      planned for further intensive chemotherapy. (Dose-escalation) II. Determine the optimal dose
      of ipilimumab for the dose-expansion phase of the trial. (Dose-escalation) III. Better
      define immunologic profiles associated with ipilimumab use in terms of regulatory T-cells
      (T-regs) dynamic changes in 2 separate cohorts of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML
      patients at the optimal dose level. (Dose-expansion) IV. Obtain preliminary efficacy data of
      ipilimumab in terms of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and hematological
      improvement (HI) in both cohorts. (Dose-expansion)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Define immunologic profiles associated with ipilimumab use in terms of T-regs dynamic
      changes at different dose levels. (Dose-escalation) II. Define toxicity profiles of
      ipilimumab at the optimal dose in both patient cohorts. (Dose-expansion) III. Obtain
      preliminary data on potential correlations between noted ipilimumab-induced immunologic
      changes and observed toxicity and clinical responses. (Dose-expansion)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      INDUCTION: Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) on day 1. Treatment repeats every
      21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive ipilimumab IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 12 weeks for
      up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at least monthly for 6 months.

    <description>Changes in T-regs percentages at designated time points will be correlated with clinical responses and toxicity after ipilimumab. The response will be modeled as the vector for each individual from multiple measures of T-regs percentages as a function of time and group (MDS vs AML). T-regs percentages will be transformed onto the log-scale, and t tests will be used to compare groups at specific time points. Regression models that use generalized estimating equations will be implemented when all time points are considered to account for within-subject correlation of repeated measures.</description>

          -  Patients with chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or hepatitis C
             infections should be excluded because of potential effects on immune function and/ or
             possible drug interactions
