Initial studies indicate\n      choline-supplemented TPN may reverse TPN-associated hepatic steatosis.\n\n      Choline chloride or placebo will be added to each patient's TPN for 16 weeks by the hospital\n      or pharmacy providing their usual TPN.  Patients will receive their TPN in the hospital\n      until they are medically stable for discharge.  If patients are discharged before study\n      completion, the pharmacy will deliver the TPN supply to them.  Evaluation of hepatic\n      steatosis is done by CT scans and blood analyses.  Blood will be drawn on a biweekly basis\n      during the first 4 weeks and at Week 8, 12, 16 or withdrawal.  CT scans will be done at Week\n      4, 8, 16, or withdrawal."
