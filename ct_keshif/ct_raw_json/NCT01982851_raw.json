The investigators hypothesize that the duration of the first stage of\n      labor will be no different in nulliparous patients who receive either intrathecal fentanyl\n      or intrathecal fentanyl and bupivacaine, as part of a CSE technique. However, the duration\n      of the first stage of labor will be shorter in parturients who receive intrathecal analgesia\n      (as part of a CSE technique) compared to those who receive an epidural de novo technique\n      with fentanyl and bupivacaine."

            "textblock": "At the first request for neuraxial labor analgesia, the cervix will be examined. If < 4.0\n      cm, the patient will be randomized to either Combined spinal epidural (CSE) technique with\n      intrathecal fentanyl, CSE technique with intrathecal bupivacaine and fentanyl, or epidural\n      de novo technique.\n\n      Labor analgesia will be administered in the sitting position, at either the L2-3 or L3-4\n      interspace. All patients will receive a 500mL intravenous bolus of Lactated Ringer's\n      solution. The epidural space will be located using the loss-of-resistance technique\n      utilizing a 17-G Tuohy epidural needle. Patients assigned to an intrathecal dose will\n      utilize the standard needle-through-needle technique. A 19-G epidural catheter will be\n      inserted 5 cm in the epidural space and maintenance epidural analgesia will be initiated.\n      Patients assigned to an epidural de novo technique will have the epidural space identified\n      with a similar loss-of-resistance technique. The epidural catheter will be inserted 5 cm\n      into the epidural space. Epidural analgesia will be initiated with fentanyl 100mcg +\n      bupivacaine 0.125% 10-20 mL (in divided doses). Maintenance epidural analgesia will then be\n      initiated.\n\n      Maintenance epidural analgesia will consist of patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA)\n      with bupivacaine 0.0625% and fentanyl 1.95 mcg/mL at the following parameters: basal rate of\n      8 mL/hr with bolus dose = 8 mL, lock-out interval = 10 min and maximum volume = 32 mL/hr.\n\n      Breakthrough pain in all groups will be managed using anesthesiologist administered epidural\n      boluses of bupivacaine 1.25 mg/mL, 10-15mL, without fentanyl. If instrumental vaginal\n      delivery is required, patients will receive anesthesiologist administered epidural boluses\n      of chloroprocaine 30 mg/mL, 5-10 mL. If a patient does not have an adequate level of\n      analgesia or has a one-sided block, despite epidural redoses, the epidural catheter will be\n      replaced at another level and 0.125% bupivacaine 5-15 mL will be administered until an\n      adequate level of analgesia is established.\n\n      The primary outcome of the study is duration of first stage of labor. Regular cervical\n      examinations are necessary. Typically, full cervical dilation is diagnosed with a cervical\n      examination only when the patient complains of rectal pressure, which is likely to be at a\n      later time period in women with effective neuraxial analgesia compared to women with\n      systemic opioid analgesia. Therefore, the duration of the first stage of labor will be\n      artificially prolonged if regular cervical exams are not performed. The investigators intend\n      to perform sterile cervical examinations at the first request for labor analgesia, then at\n      routine times during the course of labor per the managing OB provider's discretion, and then\n      every 2 hours after the patient reaches 90-100% cervical effacement until complete cervical\n      dilation.\n\n      Fetal heart rate (FHR) tracings without information about group assignment or other\n      treatment modalities will also be assessed by a perinatologist."
