In facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD), one of the most\n      common muscular dystrophy, the aerobic training showed its physiological and functional\n      efficiency without affecting the quality of life of patients. The issue of exercise therapy\n      extended to all neuromuscular diseases, as has been rigorously analyzed, shows that the use\n      of a training program combining endurance exercise targeted exercises and strength is even\n      more relevant.\n\n      To complete the multidimensional assessments be managed by each team ( physiological\n      assessments, functional tissue and quality of life) it is relevant to continue , for a\n      descriptive study quantitative and qualitative analyzes by muscle imaging and spectroscopy\n      (MRI and Nuclear Resonance Imaging (NMR) spectroscopy )."
