More than 2 billion\n      persons in tropical and subtropical regions of the world are at risk for acquiring dengue,\n      which is why development of a dengue vaccine is a top public health priority.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of a single dose of TetraVax-DV-TV003\n      (TV003) vaccine to protect against infection with rDEN2\u220630, an attenuated candidate DENV-2\n      vaccine.\n\n      This study will enroll healthy adults with no history of previous infection with a\n      flavivirus (any of a group of viruses that includes the dengue virus). Participants will be\n      randomly assigned to receive either the TV003 vaccine or placebo vaccine on Day 0 (study\n      entry). At Day 180, all participants will receive an injection of the \"challenge\" virus,\n      rDEN2\u220630, an attenuated (weakened) DENV-2 vaccine. For at least 30 minutes after each\n      vaccination, participants will remain in the study clinic to be monitored for any adverse\n      effects of the vaccines. Participants will record their temperature at least 3 times a day\n      for 16 days after the first and second vaccinations.\n\n      In addition to vaccination visits at Day 0 and Day 180, participants will attend study\n      visits at Day 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 21, 28, 56, 90, 150, 182, 184, 186, 188, 190, 192,\n      194, 196, 201, 208, 236, 270, and 360. At all study visits, participants will give a medical\n      history and undergo a blood collection; at most study visits, participants will undergo a\n      physical examination. Female participants will have a pregnancy test at select study visits."
