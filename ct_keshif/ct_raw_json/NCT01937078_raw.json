            "textblock": "Levodopa-induced dyskinesia is a common problem in Parkinson's disease (PD).  In particular,\n      targeting non-dopaminergic systems may be an option for reducing dyskinesia without\n      worsening motor symptoms. One such target may be histamine. The central histaminergic system\n      is involved in diverse biological functions including thermoregulation, eating, and sleep; a\n      role in motor activity is suggested by strong histaminergic innervation of the basal\n      ganglia. Histamine H2 receptors are highly expressed in the striatum, particularly on the\n      GABAergic striatal-pallidal and striatal-nigral pathways Histamine H2 stimulation modulates\n      acetylcholine release. Previous studies have demonstrated that blocking acetylcholine with\n      anticholinergic agents can induce chorea. The investigators  propose that histamine H2\n      receptor stimulation decreases acetylcholine in the striatum and increases activity of the\n      direct striatal output pathway, a key component of the neural mechanisms underlying\n      dyskinesia.\n\n      The investigators hypothesise that H2 antagonists would reduce activity of the direct\n      striatopallidal pathway and so potentially reduce levodopa-induced chorea\n\n      Famotidine has also been assessed in schizophrenia in a small cases series to treat\n      schizophrenia, with tolerability. Clinical experience thus suggests the suitability of using\n      this agent as a histamine H2 antagonist in clinical studies for PD."
