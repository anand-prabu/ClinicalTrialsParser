Patients were aged between 20 and 65. The maintenance of\n      anesthesia in each group varies as follows: Patients in Group 1 were all maintained with\n      Total Intravenous Anesthesia, Group 2 with Sevoflurane at 1% and propofol infusion, Group 3\n      with only sevoflurane.   Muscle paralysis is maintained using a closed-loop computer gated\n      infusion of Cisatracurium which kept T1 <1% by giving increasing the infusion rate\n      intra-operatively when required. Analgesia was maintained by intermittent bolus dose of\n      10-20 \u00b5g of Sufentanil."
