      This is a Phase II open-label study in approximately 240, and up to 400, healthy males and
      non-pregnant females, aged 6 months to 17 years.  This study is designed to assess the
      safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of an unadjuvanted subvirion monovalent
      inactivated influenza H3N2v vaccine manufactured by sanofi pasteur.  Subjects will be
      stratified by age (approximately 60-100 subjects 6-35 months old, approximately 60-100
      subjects 3-8 years old and approximately 60-100 subjects 9-17 years old) to receive two
      doses of vaccine, delivered intramuscularly as 15mcg HA/0.5mL dose, 21 days apart.  In
      addition, approximately 60-100 subjects 6-35 months old will receive two doses of vaccine,
      delivered intramuscularly as 7.5mcg HA/0.5mL dose, 21 days apart. The duration of the study
      for each subject will be approximately 7 months.

      This is a Phase II open-label study in approximately 240 (up to 400) healthy males and
      non-pregnant females, 6 months to 17 years old, inclusive.  This study is designed to assess
      the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of an unadjuvanted subvirion monovalent
      inactivated influenza H3N2 variant (H3N2v) vaccine (MIV) manufactured by sanofi pasteur.
      Subjects will be stratified by age (approximately 120 (up to 200) subjects 6-35 months old,
      approximately 60 (up to 100) subjects 3-8 years old, and approximately 60 (up to 100)
      subjects 9-17 years old).  Subjects in the 6-35 months old cohort will be randomized to
      receive either two doses of H3N2v MIV, delivered intramuscularly as 7.5 micrograms (mcg) of
      hemagglutinin (HA)/0.25 milliliter (mL) dose (approximately 60 (up to 100) subjects), 21
      days apart or two doses of H3N2v MIV, delivered intramuscularly as 15mcg HA/0.5mL dose
      (approximately 60 (up to 100) subjects), 21 days apart.  All subjects in the 3-8 years old
      cohort and 9-17 years old cohort will receive two doses of H3N2v MIV, delivered
      intramuscularly as 15mcg HA/0.5mL dose, 21 days apart.  Subjects may receive licensed
      seasonal influenza vaccine prior to (2 weeks if given the inactivated vaccine or 4 weeks if
      given the live, attenuated vaccine) the first H3N2v vaccination.  Alternatively, subjects
      may receive licensed seasonal influenza vaccine at any time after completion of the Day 42
      visit or following an early termination visit. Safety will be measured by the occurrence of
      solicited injection site and systemic reactogenicity on the day of each H3N2v vaccination
      through 7 days after each H3N2v vaccination, adverse events through 42 days after the first
      H3N2v vaccination, and serious adverse events (SAEs) and new-onset chronic medical
      conditions through 7 months after the first H3N2v vaccination. For subjects 6-35 months old
      and 3-8 years old, immunogenicity testing will include performing hemagglutination
      inhibition (HAI) and neutralizing (Neut) antibody assays on serum obtained on the day of and
      prior to each H3N2v vaccination (Days 0 and 21) and approximately 21 days after the second
      H3N2v vaccination (Day 42). For subjects 9-17 years old, immunogenicity testing will include
      performing HAI and Neut antibody assays on serum obtained on the day of and prior to each
      H3N2v vaccination (Days 0 and 21), approximately 8 days after the first H3N2v vaccination
      (Day 8), and approximately 21 days after the second H3N2v vaccination (Day 42).

             during the 7-month study period.

          -  Participated in an influenza A/H3N2v vaccine study in the past in a group receiving
             vaccine (does not apply to documented placebo recipients) or have a history of

          -  Plan to travel outside the U.S. (continental U.S., Hawaii and Alaska) in the time
             between the first H3N2v vaccination and 42 days after the first H3N2v vaccination.

          -  Females who are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed at any given time during the

          -  Occupational exposure to or substantial direct physical contact with pigs in the past
             year or during the 42 days after the first H3N2v vaccination. Casual contact with

             from study participation.
