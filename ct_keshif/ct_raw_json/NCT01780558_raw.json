Transfer of thawed embryos will be performed 4 days after LH\n      /HCG administration or 3 days after ovulation is observed. In group HRT-B, oral estradiol, 2\n      mg, once daily, is introduced on cycle day 3 with an increasing doses protocol. If the\n      endometrial thickness is greater than 7mm, progesterone 40-60 mg in oil will be administered\n      via intramuscular injection.
