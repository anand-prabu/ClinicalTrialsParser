So it is necessary to verify the efficacy and safety of TUDCA in the\n      treatment of adult primary biliary cirrhosis. In this randomized, double-blinded,\n      double-dummy, parallel-controlled and multicenter clinical trial, we detect the proportion\n      of patients who had AKP decline more than 25% as the primary outcome; decline of AKP, total\n      bilirubin, GGT, ALT and AST as secondary outcomes after patients were treated with TUDCA or\n      UDCA for 24 weeks."
