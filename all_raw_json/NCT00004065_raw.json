Patients are stratified\n      according to disease (chronic myelogenous leukemia [CML] or Philadelphia chromosome [Ph]+\n      acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL] vs solid tumor).\n\n      Patients receive 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) IV over 60-90 minutes\n      twice weekly. Courses repeat every 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression (after at\n      least 2 courses for CML or Ph+ ALL patients) or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n        -  Accelerated phase: Single patients receive escalating dose levels of 17-AAG until one\n           patient experiences a first course grade 3 or greater toxicity or two different\n           patients experience grade 2 toxicity during any course.\n\n        -  Standard phase: Cohorts of 3-6 patients in each stratum receive escalating doses of\n           17-AAG until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the\n           dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting\n           toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 51 patients will be accrued for this study."
