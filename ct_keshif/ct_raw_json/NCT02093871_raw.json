This mimics chemotherapy\n      treatments, in concordance with the fractional cell kill hypothesis of cytotoxic agents.\n\n      As this study is for safety, only, metastatic peritoneal or ovarian cancer, of any histology\n      (epithelial, sex-cord stromal, germ cell, or sarcoma) that has progressed after 2 cycles of\n      chemotherapy, and is considered incurable, will be included. All patients must meet\n      performance status and organ function entry criteria.  Patients must have first undergone\n      standard first line primary surgery and chemotherapy, and have then gone on to fail second\n      line chemotherapy treatment, (with or without secondary cytoreductive surgeries). Patients\n      must be candidates for, and expecting treatment by, the usual third line chemotherapy agent\n      palliation traditionally offered by medical oncology. Patients may have received treatment\n      beyond third-line therapy, as long as they meet entry requirements for this study."
