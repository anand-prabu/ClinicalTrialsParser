The first objective was to\n      demonstrate the non-inferiority of PKEP compared to OP concerning Qmax at one year\n      postoperatively.\n\n      To explore the long-term efficacy, we compared the efficacy, safety, and morbidity of PkEP\n      with those of OP in BPH patients with prostate glands larger than 100 g over a follow-up\n      period of 6 years."
