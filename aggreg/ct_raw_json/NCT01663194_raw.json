Recently, our single center study demonstrated that preprocedural\n      neutrophil/lymphocyte (N/L) ratio is an independent predictor of impaired coronary flow\n      after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and of in-hospital major advanced\n      cardiac events (MACE) in patients with STEMI.Several previous studies also evaluated the\n      role of N/L ratio in long-term outcomes among patients with STEMI; however, they evaluated\n      the association between long-term mortality and in-hospital N/L ratio, they were\n      single-center studies and they evaluated a relatively small study population.\n\n      In the present multicenter experience, the investigators aimed to investigate the\n      association of the preprocedural N/L ratio with the in-hospital and long-term outcomes in\n      patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI."
