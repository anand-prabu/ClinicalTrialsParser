The mechanism of action of SNS is still not fully understood\n      but recent studies have shown changes in both colonic motility and rectal sensibility. The\n      investigators have previously shown IBS patients to benefit from sacral nerves stimulation.\n      With the present study, the investigators aim to evaluate if sacral nerve stimulation alters\n      the gastro-colic response in IBS patients."
