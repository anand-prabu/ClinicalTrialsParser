    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the body's response to aerobic vs. resistance
      exercise.  Throughout this study, we will examine food intake, appetite, and physical and
      mental well-being before, during, and after aerobic and resistance exercise.

    <description>The subjects will complete 2 resistive exercise sessions on non-consecutive days that will be supervised by our laboratory staff.  The following exercises will be performed using the Keiser Sports Health equipment in Ismail Health, Exercise, and Nutrition Center:   seated row, double leg press, seated leg curl, chest press, and leg extension.  The subjects will individually perform 3 sets of 8-10 repetitions at an exercise intensity of 70% of pre-determined maximal strength for these exercises.  Each repetition will be performed in a slow (six to eight seconds) uniform fashion, giving equal time to the concentric (muscle shortening) and eccentric (muscle lengthening) portions.  One minute of rest will be allowed between sets.  The last repetition of the third set of each exercise will be done to voluntary fatigue or the performance of 12 repetitions.</description>

    <description>The subjects will complete 2 aerobic exercise sessions on non-consecutive days that will also be supervised by our laboratory staff.  The subjects will perform 45 minutes of aerobic exercise on a stationary bike at an exercise intensity of 70% of their heart-rate reserve.</description>

    <description>The subjects will also complete 2 non-exercise sessions on non-consecutive days that will also be supervised by our laboratory staff.  These sessions will consist of incorporating diversionary tasks throughout a 45 minute period consisting of a variety of motor and psychological tasks (tests of hand steadiness, alertness, optical illusions, mental acuity, etc.)</description>
