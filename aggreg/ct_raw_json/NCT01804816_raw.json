            "textblock": "The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of acupuncture treatment on cardiac\n      sympathetic/vagal activity in chronic heart failure patients. The investigators would like\n      to investigate the effect of acupuncture treatment on cardiac function and the general\n      health score of the quality-of-life.  The investigators would like  to further explore the\n      mechanism of acupuncture treatment on autonomic imbalance and chronic inflammatory reaction\n      in heart failure patients by comparing the treatment and sham groups, the baseline before\n      the treatment and the changes after treatment.\n\n      Chronic heart failure affects millions people and is a leading cause of death in US. Despite\n      of advance in diagnoses and treatments, the long-term prognosis and quality of life of\n      chronic heart failure patients remain poor. The mortality of chronic heart failure is\n      estimated 50% within 4 years, and is more than 50% in patients with severe chronic heart\n      failure.\n\n      Chronic heart failure results from the left ventricular (LV) systolic and/or diastolic\n      dysfunction. Autonomic imbalance with sustained sympathetic overdrive and vagal withdrawal\n      plays an important role in the development of chronic heart failure. This autonomic\n      dysregulation is related to increased heart rate, excess inflammatory response, progressive\n      LV dysfunction, increased mortality and morbidity in chronic heart failure patients.\n      Sympathetic active inhibition with beta-adrenergic receptor blockers has shown significant\n      reduction in mortality and morbidity in chronic heart failure patients. Also modulation of\n      parasympathetic activation with electrical vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has demonstrated as\n      a potential therapy for chronic heart failure.\n\n      Acupuncture has been widely used in China for thousands of years to treat a variety of\n      diseases and their symptoms. Except pain disorders, increasing evidences have shown that\n      acupuncture may be useful for cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease,\n      hypertension and chronic heart failure. It has been demonstrated that certain acupuncture\n      points have shown to inhibit cardiac sympathetic activation or increase cardiac vagal\n      component in both experimental animals and clinical studies. Recently a small clinical trial\n      by Dr. Kristen, et al has found that acupuncture could improve exercise tolerance in chronic\n      heart failure patients.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that  acupuncture treatment may improve the cardiac function\n      and the quality of life in heart failure patients. These effects may be related to the\n      inhibition of sympathetic activity and/or increased vagal function.  The suppression of\n      inflammatory reaction with acupuncture treatment may also be associated with these outcomes.\n      In addition to optimized standard heart failure medications, acupuncture may be a safe\n      therapeutic strategy in chronic heart failure treatment.  Studies of acupuncture on cardiac\n      autonomic activity in heart failure may show more evidence of acupuncture treatment in\n      chronic heart failure patients."
