Radiotherapy group (experimental group) patients started simultaneously\n      radiotherapy for all gross tumors soon after randomization; non-radiotherapy group (control\n      group) received no radiotherapy for all gross tumors. Erlotinib was continuously used until\n      to disease progression or unbearable adverse effect, and the subsequently further salvage\n      therapies were determined by the investigators.

Metastatic NSCLC with distant metastases number \u2264 5 (for metastases in the same\n             organ, the number counted as the separate metastatic focus) and the longest diameter\n             of each metastatic foci on CT should > 1cm, but brain (including the parenchyma and\n             meninges) metastasis, malignant pleural/pericardial effusion, or abdominal effusion\n             were not allowed;\n\n          9. Have never received local treatment, including surgery, radiation therapy, and\n             radiofrequency ablation for primary and distant metastases;\n\n         10.

The diagnosis of bone and liver metastases:\n\n               1. On the basis of clinical symptoms, an imaging support was necessary for the\n                  clinical diagnosis of bone metastases; if the clinical symptoms were absent, two\n                  imaging supports of bone metastases were necessary for the clinical diagnosis of\n                  bone metastasis; adjacent bone metastases (such as the two adjacent vertebral\n                  metastases) was considered to be a single metastasis.\n\n               2. MRI or enhanced CT confirmations were needed for liver metastases diagnosis;\n\n         12. Have never received other targeted drug treatments for EGFR inhibition;\n\n         13. If metastases in a same organ \u2264 4 and the amount of metastatic focus \u2264 5, it should\n             be determined by the radiation therapists in the research group to judge if the\n             patients can tolerate all positive focus (including primary and metastatic focus)\n             receiving radiotherapy, the radiotherapy dose should be selected by treating\n             physician according to the patients' conditions from several regimens including\n             conventional split curative doses or palliative doses, and hypofractionated\n             radiotherapy (for details please refer to the radiation therapy section);\n\n         14.
