            "textblock": "Purpose The purpose of this study is to compare whether the investigational new drug called\n      RRx-001 increases survival in advanced, incurable colorectal cancer compared to the\n      FDA-approved standard of care drug, regorafenib. Patients who are suffering from advanced or\n      metastatic (meaning the disease has spread) colorectal cancer are invited to participate in\n      this study. There will be two groups of patients (Randomized, open label study), one of\n      these will receive RRx-001 and the other one will receive regorafenib. Qualifying patients\n      will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to the 'interventional arm' and receive\n      the experimental drug, RRx-001, or the 'control arm' where they will receive the current\n      standard-of-care, Regorafenib. Patients will have a 66% chance (2 out of 3) of receiving\n      RRx-001 and a 33 % chance (1 out of 3) of receiving regorafenib. Whether patients are given\n      RRx-001 or regorafenib, they will also receive best supportive care, which includes\n      treatments to help manage side effects and symptoms of cancer. This is an open label study,\n      which means patients will know to which of these treatments, RRx-001 or regorafenib, they\n      are assigned.\n\n      Background Oxygen is vital to life, we need it to breathe, for example, but at the same time\n      it gives rise to byproducts that are toxic called free radicals. Free radicals are defined\n      as \"oxidants\". Similarly, substances that interact with and neutralize free radicals, thus\n      preventing them from causing damage, are called \"antioxidants\". Examples of recognizable\n      antioxidants are Vitamin E, Vitamin C and beta-carotene. Antioxidants are also known as\n      \"free radical scavengers.\" When free radicals are present in excess of antioxidants damage\n      may occur.\n\n      A free radical is an unstable molecule with an unpaired electron, an electrically charged\n      particle, which seeks out another electron to return to a state of balance. An example of a\n      free radical is hydrogen peroxide, recognizable as the household product that \"bubbles\" when\n      it's poured on wounds. These bubbles come from oxygen free radicals, which are toxic to\n      bacteria and all living cells, including cancer. The fact that these free radicals are toxic\n      has to do with how reactive they are\u2014imagine free radicals as high-speed ball bearings that\n      smash into other molecules in order to \"steal\" back an electron and end their radical state,\n      which sets off a chain reaction that transforms once stable compounds into a string of\n      reactive radicals.\n\n      As new free radicals are created in this chain reaction, they randomly slam into whatever\n      molecules they are closest to and steal their electrons, corroding them, like a biological\n      form of rust. This process is repeated over and over, picking up speed, until an antioxidant\n      can \"neutralize\" the free radicals and put a stop to the snowball effect. In the same way\n      that this free radical bombardment can damage not only bacteria but also healthy tissues in\n      the body, it is also capable of destroying cancer cells.\n\n      The current consensus is that compared to normal tissue tumor cells may accumulate elevated\n      levels of free radicals, which contribute to the development of cancer. This is potentially\n      a fatal weakness, a form of biological \"Kryptonite\", which can be used to advantage since\n      the addition of even a small amount of free radicals may push the tumor over the edge, past\n      the tipping point, above tolerable thresholds, breaking the camel's back. Similar to the\n      expression \"live by the sword, die by the sword\", free radicals may lead to the development\n      of cancer but they also are capable of harming it when present in excess.\n\n      RRx-001 is a completely new type of drug that comes from the U.S. aerospace or rocket\n      science industry. It is activated to deliver free radicals to tissues that have low levels\n      of oxygen. Compared to normal tissues, which have higher levels of oxygen, most, if not all,\n      tumors exist in a low-oxygen environment, perhaps to prevent oxidation. In this way the free\n      radicals delivered by RRx-001 to cancer cells under low oxygen conditions are able, in\n      theory, to cause their targeted destruction without harming normal cells.\n\n      In general, colorectal tumors have low levels of antioxidants and, without this antioxidant\n      protection, these tumors are more likely to be harmed by free radicals, so a treatment like\n      RRx-001, which is able to increase the free radicals in the tumor, may benefit patients with\n      colorectal cancer; this is a reason for studying RRx-001 in colorectal cancer. So far, in a\n      Phase 1 study, 25 men and women with advanced, incurable cancer have received RRx-001 for\n      different lengths of time and at doses that ranged from 10 mg/m2 to 83 mg/m2 once a week.\n\n      Regorafenib is a drug approved by the FDA to treat colon cancer after previous chemotherapy\n      is no longer effective. It belongs to a class of targeted drugs known as tyrosine kinase\n      inhibitors. Tyrosine kinases, which play a key role in many cell functions including cell\n      growth and division, are commonly mutated or changed in cancer cells, becoming super-active\n      and producing cells that have uncontrolled growth, and, therefore, blocking them with drugs\n      like regorafenib may keep the cancer cells from growing."
