Slow wave sleep (SWS), in particular, with its\n      slow oscillating activity have shown to enhance declarative, hippocampus-dependent memory\n      representations. This impact of sleep on memory performance can be additionally enhanced by\n      exogeneous induction of transcranial slow oscillating stimulation (tSOS) within the\n      frequency range of SWS in humans (0,7- 0,8 Hz) during sleep, as has been demonstrated in\n      young, healthy subjects. If older adults that commonly experiencing cognitive decline,\n      including long-term retention of declarative memory - benefit from transcranial slow\n      oscillatory stimulation (tSOS) during sleep in the same way has not been studied so far. The\n      primary goal of the study is therefore to investigate the impact of oscillating current\n      stimulation (tSOS) during a daytime nap on declarative memory consolidation in older adults."
