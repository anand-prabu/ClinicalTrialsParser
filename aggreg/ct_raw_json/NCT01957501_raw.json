            "textblock": "Depression and bipolar disorder are major public health concerns for adolescents today.\n      Teenage depression and bipolar disorder are associated with social isolation, family stress,\n      school failure, substance abuse and suicide. Screening for depression and bipolar disorder\n      so that treatment can be started early in the course of illness is an urgent public health\n      priority. Many teens with bipolar disorder are incorrectly diagnosed as having unipolar\n      depression.  It is critical that adolescents receive proper screening and assessment that\n      leads to an accurate diagnosis and treatment. An efficient, cost-effective, blood-based\n      screening program could be performed on an annual or semi-annual basis to potentially detect\n      depression and then differentiate between unipolar and bipolar depression. If this type of\n      screening were able to detect a significant percentage of teens with depression or bipolar\n      disorder, the positive impact on U.S. public health would be substantial.  The purpose of\n      this study is to conduct a pilot study to assess the probability of detecting adolescent\n      unipolar and bipolar depression through blood samples."

The MDDScore\u2122 is determined using nine blood based biomarkers (inflammatory markers [4], stress related hormones [2], neuroendocrine [1] and metabolic proteins [2]) on physiological pathways related to MDD. The test results for the MDDScore\u2122 range from 1 to 10. If the patient's score is 1, the patient has a less than 10% likelihood of having MDD. If the patient's MDDScore\u2122 is 10, the patient has a greater than 90% likelihood of having MDD.  An MDDScore\u2122 of 5 or less is considered normal or negative and a score of 6 or more is considered \"diseased\" or positive. This same scoring system would hold true for classifying the likelihood of having bipolar disorder, as well.  Test characteristics, such as sensitivity and specificity, are calculated based on this determination.",
