Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim may increase\n      the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's\n      immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus\n      sargramostim in treating patients who have advanced, persistent, or recurrent cancer of the\n      uterus."

Patients\n      also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once every 12 hours on days -6 to -3\n      before the first chemotherapy course and then on days 2-15 and 23-26 of all chemotherapy\n      courses. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients achieving stable disease receive a maximum of 4 courses. Patients\n      achieving complete or partial response receive a maximum of 6 courses.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-43 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-28\n      months."
