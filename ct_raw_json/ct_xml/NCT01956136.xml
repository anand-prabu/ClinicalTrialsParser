  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of serious, life-long disability
      among adolescents and young adults. Especially the cognitive, emotional, and motors deficits
      caused by TBI often impair everyday psychosocial functioning, quality of life and ability to
      work. The purpose of the study is to determine the long-term effect of music-based
      rehabilitation on cognitive, motor, emotional, and social recovery after TBI in adolescents
      and young adults, and to study the neural mechanisms that underlie behavioural recovery and
      the efficacy of music.

    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of serious, life-long disability
      among adolescents and young adults. Especially the cognitive, emotional, and motors deficits
      caused by TBI often impair everyday psychosocial functioning, quality of life (QoL) and
      ability to work dramatically, thereby bringing about a lot of suffering and burden to the
      patients and their families as well as substantial social and economic costs to the society.
      Early rehabilitation is highly important for restoring lost skills and functioning, but
      often very difficult given the severity and extent of the TBI symptoms and the high strain
      that the available rehabilitation methods put on the patients. Music therapy is a highly
      motivating, versatile, and applicable form of TBI rehabilitation, but currently there is
      little scientific evidence for its efficacy or mechanisms in the TBI population. The purpose
      of the present project is to determine the long-term effect of Music-based Neurological
      Rehabilitation (MBNR) on cognitive, motor, emotional, and social recovery after TBI in
      adolescents and young adults, and to study the neural mechanisms that underlie behavioural
      recovery and the efficacy of music.

      The study is a single-blind, cross-over randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 60
      adolescents and young adults with a subacute moderate / severe TBI. During an 18-month
      follow-up, the patients receive MBNR (30 session, 3 x week, 1 hour sessions) and/or Standard
      Care (SC). The MBNR intervention utilizes structured cognitive-motor training with drums and
      creative musical expression (music playing, song writing) with piano that are geared towards
      engaging and training attention, executive functions, working memory, and upper-extremity
      functions and for enhancing emotional self-expression, adjustment, and mood after TBI. The
      SC consists of other types of conventional rehabilitation (e.g., physical therapy,
      neuropsychological rehabilitation) and medical care for TBI provided in private or public
      health care. Half of the patients receive the MBNR intervention during the first 10-week
      period and half during the second 10-week period (in addition, all patients receive SC
      during the whole follow-up period).

      Outcome measures comprise neuropsychological tests (measuring executive functions,
      attention, reasoning, and working memory and learning), neurological scales (measuring
      neurological symptoms, functional outcome, adjustment, and participation), motor tests
      (measuring motor dexterity, coordination, and upper limb functioning), and structural and
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI/fMRI, measuring gray and white matter structure
      and integrity and auditory-motor neural processing) performed at the start of the study
      (baseline), after the first 10-week period (3-month stage) and after the second 10-week
      period (6-month stage). At these time points as well as 12 months later (18-month stage),
      the patients and their caregivers are also given questionnaires measuring executive
      functions, depression symptoms, quality of life, and caregiver well-being and burden.

    <description>Structural and Functional Neuroplasticity is measured using structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI/fMRI) scanning performed at the baseline, 3-month, and 6-month stages. Overall, the purpose of the MRI/fMRI is to determine the exact location and size of the lesions and other pathological changes caused by the TBI and to study the changes in grey matter volume (using voxel-based morphometry, VBM), white matter volume and organization (using diffusion tensor imaging, DTI), and auditory-motor activity and connectivity (using fMRI) that take place in different brain areas during the 6-month follow-up and to correlate these changes to behavioral recovery. Changes from baseline to each follow-up point (3-month / 6-month) and between the follow-up points are studied.</description>
