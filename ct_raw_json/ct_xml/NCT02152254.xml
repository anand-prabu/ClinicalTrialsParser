  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to compare the effects of treatment based on molecular
      profiling to those of the standard-of-care.

      Treatment Assignment:

      From a tumor biopsy, a molecular profile of the disease is established.  Based on genetic
      profiling, the following interventions will follow:

      A) If there is no abnormality, patients will be treated according to the patient's doctor as
      to what is in their best interest.

      B) If there is an abnormality and there is an FDA-approved drug for the tumor type, patients
      will be offered that treatment.

      C) If there is an abnormality and there is no FDA-approved drug for the abnormality and the
      tumor type, patients will be randomly assigned to Arm A (targeted therapy) or Arm B
      (standard-of-care therapy).

      Patients whose tumors progress on protocol-assigned treatment will have achieved the primary
      study endpoint and have the option of crossing over to the other treatment arm.  Imaging
      studies will be repeated every 2 cycles after initiation of treatment in both randomized
      arms.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have pathologically confirmed metastatic cancer.

          2. Patients must have received 0-3 prior therapies.

          3. For patients with melanoma: biologics, cytokines, or cell therapies do not count as
             prior therapies.

          4. The patient has measurable disease.

          5. The patient has Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1.

          6. The patient has biopsy-accessible tumor. For patients who had no prior anticancer
             therapy and had surgical resection within a year and tumor tissue is immediately
             available, that tumor will be analyzed and no biopsy will be needed.

          7. The patient has normal organ and marrow function, defined as absolute neutrophil
             count&gt;/= 1,000/µl; platelets &gt;/=100,000/µl (unless these abnormalities are due to
             bone marrow involvement).

          8. The patient has adequate hepatic function as defined by a total bilirubin level&lt;/=1.5
             x the upper limit of normal (ULN), unless the patient has known Gilbert's disease,
             and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/ serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase levels (SGPT)
             &lt;/= 2.5 * ULN (unless the patient has liver metastases).

          9. The patient has serum creatinine clearance &gt;/= 50 ml/min by the Cockcroft-Gault
             formula.

         10. If the patient has brain metastasis, they must have been stable (treated and/or
             asymptomatic) and the patient must have been off steroids for at least 2 weeks.

         11. The patient is &gt;/=18 years of age.

         12. The patient has provided signed informed consent.

         13. The patient has had no previously treated malignancy, other than the patient's known
             cancer.

         14. Patients with a history of basal cell carcinoma of the skin or pre-invasive carcinoma
             of the cervix are eligible.

         15. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the
             duration of study participation. Childbearing potential will be defined as women who
             have had menses within the past 12 months and who have not had a tubal ligation,
             hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect
             that she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately.

         16. Male subjects must agree to use effective contraception or abstinence while on study
             and for 90 days after last dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are randomized to the control arm must not receive therapy based on
             prior molecular profiling.

          2. The patient has received chemotherapy, surgery, or radiotherapy within 3 weeks of
             initiating study treatment (4 weeks for bevacizumab or investigational drugs) or the
             patient has not recovered (grade ≥2 from side effects of the previous therapy).

          3. Patients for whom an FDA-approved therapy for the tumor type and the molecular
             alteration is available will be excluded from the randomization.

          4. The patient has cardiac conditions as follows: uncontrolled hypertension (BP &gt;
             140/90) despite optimal therapy, uncontrolled angina, ventricular arrhythmias,
             congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class II or above), baseline
             left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;/= 50%, prior or current cardiomyopathy,
             atrial fibrillation with heart rate &gt;100 bpm, unstable ischaemic heart disease (MI
             within 6 months prior to starting treatment or angina requiring use of nitrates more
             than once weekly).

          5. The patient has peripheral neuropathy &gt;/= grade 2.

          6. The patient is pregnant (confirmed by serum b-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), if
             applicable) or is breastfeeding.

          7. The patient has concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease that could
             compromise participation in the study (i.e., uncontrolled diabetes, severe infection
             requiring active treatment, severe malnutrition, chronic severe liver or renal
             disease).

          8. The patient has refractory nausea and vomiting or chronic gastrointestinal diseases
             (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease) or has had significant bowel resection that would
             preclude adequate absorption (for oral therapy only).

          9. The patient is unable to swallow capsules and/or has a surgical or anatomical
             condition that precludes swallowing and absorbing oral medication on an ongoing basis
             (for oral therapy only).
