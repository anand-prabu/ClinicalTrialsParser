Patients who\n      need only oxygen support, usually received low flow oxygen (< 15 Liters / min), as well as\n      in respiratory weaning. Now new devices can be used. They provide high flow oxygen with\n      different benefits. This high flow devices provide exact fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2),\n      allows a positive end expiratory pressure and supplies a wash out flow. The hypothesis of\n      this study is that the high flow oxygen enable more efficient oxygen administration than\n      conventional oxygen. In addition, it would improve the effectiveness of the ventilation of\n      the patient, through flushing the dead space."
