    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to evaluate patients who had In-vitro fertilization treatment and
      who had COH (controlled ovarian hyperstimulation) cycles applying long protocol with GnRH
      (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) analogue with suboptimal response to the rFSH.  The
      investigators evaluated and compared the addition of rLH, increasing the dose of rFSH and
      the control groups regarding the results of IVF in these patients.

      1. Aim

           -We aimed to evaluate patients who had In-vitro fertilization treatment and who had COH
           (controlled ovarian hyperstimulation) cycles applying long protocol with GnRH
           (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) analogue with suboptimal response to the rFSH.  We
           evaluated and compared the addition of rLH, increasing the dose of rFSH and the control
           groups regarding the results of IVF in these patients.

        2. Material and Methods -Between 01.01.2009-30.04.2011, 137 patients presented with
           infertility to the unit of Assisted Reproduction Techniques- of the Department of
           Obstetrics and Gynecology- Meram Medical Faculty-  Selcuk University and were planned
           for ICSI-ET (intracytoplasmic sperm injection-embryo transfer) with normal ovarian
           function, who had  long protocol of GnRH analogue and COH (controlled ovarian
           hyperstimulation) with rFSH  were included in the study. 52 patients were considered
           responsive to stimulation and composed the normal control group (Group 1). On the 7th
           day of stimulation transvaginal ultrasonography was carried out. Patients who had at
           least 6 follicles about 6-10mm but had no follicle above 10mm and E2 (Oestradiol) level
           of &lt;250 pg / ml were considered to have suboptimal response to stimulation and were
           divided into two groups. For Group 2 (n = 50), 75IU / L  rLH was added to the
           treatment, for Group 3 (n = 35), 75IU / L of  rFSH was added to the treatment. IVF
           results were compared between the groups.

    <description>On day 7 of the stimulation, if at least six follicles between 6-10mm were present but there was no follicle over 10 mm on transvaginal ultrasound, E2 level was under 180 pg/ml, it has been considered that the patients had suboptimal response to the stimulation and were divided into Group 2. Group 2  received supplemental r-LH ( Lutropin alpha; Luveris, Merck Serono, France), 75IU/day to r-FSH (Gonal-f) treatment.</description>
