The change in maternal and infant thiamine\n      level after administration of thiamine to either Cambodian mothers or their infants is\n      unknown. Normal human breast milk thiamine levels in thiamine-replete mothers are poorly\n      characterized. The aim of this study is to determine if thiamine administered to nursing\n      Cambodian mothers normalizes maternal and infant thiamine levels. Levels will also be\n      obtained in nursing Caucasian mothers residing in the United States."
