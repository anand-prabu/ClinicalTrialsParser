Patients are stratified according to\n      type of concurrent anticonvulsant (enzyme activating anticonvulsants vs valproic acid vs\n      other anticonvulsants).\n\n      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Treatment repeats every 21 days\n      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of\n      3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months for up to 4 years and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-25 patients will be accrued for this study."
