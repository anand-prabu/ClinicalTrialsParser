One of these is decreased\n      peripheral circulation impaired sensation leading to the development of foot ulcers that\n      lead to amputations of toes, feet and limbs. These complications not only have devastating\n      effects on the individual in terms of loss of functionality but also impact the patient's\n      ability to carry out and enjoy occupational, recreational and family functioning activities.\n      Furthermore, foot ulcers and associated problems often lead to prolonged hospitalization and\n      loss of productivity. All of these have personal as well as societal economical\n      implications.\n\n      This pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT) aims to evaluate the feasibility of an additional\n      patient education program to current management of foot care in patients with DM.\n\n      The study aims to test an alternative to current standard of care for patients with foot\n      ulcers. A RCT is the preferred method to establish efficacy for this alternative nurse\n      managed intervention; and if found to be effective, the current study will also allow an\n      evaluation of the cost effectiveness of this intervention and the potential economic\n      reduction in cost to the health care system.\n\n      The potential implications are major in terms of quality of life, reduction in morbidity in\n      disability days, and cost savings. It is anticipated that this intervention is at least as\n      effective as hospital stay, and being surrounded by their own loved ones without the threats\n      that a hospital setting presents. The findings will be important to consider whether\n      clinical practice can be changed to benefit patients. If the study results show that the\n      subjects in the IG have better skills in monitoring and treating their diabetic foot\n      ulcerations and eventually avoid developing further complications the intervention can be\n      applied to future patients."
