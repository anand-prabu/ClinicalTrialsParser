    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the activity of dexamethasone, wild-type reovirus, and
      carfilzomib in patients with multiple myeloma and viral protein production following
      treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone and carfilzomib, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. A virus called wild-type reovirus may be able to kill cancer
      cells without damaging normal cells and seems to work best when given with chemotherapy.
      Giving wild-type reovirus with chemotherapy may be a more active treatment than chemotherapy
      alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine safety and tolerability of reolysin (wild-type reovirus), carfilzomib and
      dexamethasone in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma.

      II. Obtain evidence of reovirus protein production by immunohistochemical localization of
      reoviral capsid protein in myeloma cells from bone marrow biopsies obtained on cycle 1 day
      9.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Obtain preliminary data on response as determined by International Myeloma Working Group
      criteria after protocol therapy.

      II. Obtain pilot overall and progression free survival data for all treated patients.

      III. Assess cytokine arrays of peripheral blood obtained on days 1, 2 and 9 to obtain
      exploratory data regarding inflammatory cytokine concentrations and their correlation with
      response.

      IV. Cryopreserve marrow aspirates obtained cycle 1 day 1 and all subsequent marrow aspirates
      while on trial for future studies of genetic and epigenetic changes focused in part on
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, autophagy and reovirus resistance studies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive dexamethasone intravenously (IV), carfilzomib IV over 10 minutes, and
      wild-type reovirus IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and then every 6
      months.
