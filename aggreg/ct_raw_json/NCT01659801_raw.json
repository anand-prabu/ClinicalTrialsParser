The only therapeutic solution to this problem is surgical\n      replacement of the crystalline lens with an intraocular lens (cataract surgery).\n\n      In addition to the cataract, the person might suffer from pre-existing cormeal astigmatism.\n      In cases of severe corneal astigmatism, the standard IOL might not provide the optimal\n      result, and additional surgical procedures as Incisional Keratotomy or Limbal Relaxing\n      Incisions might be required.\n\n      BunnyLens TR IOL is an Aspheric Toric intraocular lens providing a precise, superior\n      alternative to surgical treatment of pre-existing corneal astigmatism.\n\n      The BunnyLens TR IOL is designed for micro-incision cataract surgery (MICS), through 1.8mm\n      incisions.\n\n      The aims of this study are to:\n\n        -  Demonstrate a reduction in refractive cylinder compared to pre-operative corneal\n           astigmatism\n\n        -  Exceed monocular best corrected distance visual acuity results provided in ISO\n           guidelines."

Units\n      of the measurement: logMAR.\n\n      There are no complications related to the BunnyLens TR implantation beyond those that might\n      be expected in standard cataract surgery.
