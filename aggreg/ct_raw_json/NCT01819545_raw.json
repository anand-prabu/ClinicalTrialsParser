We have amended the aMCI diagnostic criteria of\n             the Petersen Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) cut-off score in order to be\n             consistent with the low level of education in elderly Chinese people. Research\n             (mingyuan Zhang et al, 1988) found that with the Chinese version of MMSE, AD subjects\n             who had not been educated (NO ED) exhibited MMSE scores of <18, those with elementary\n             school education exhibited MMSE scores of <21, and those with higher than middle\n             school education exhibited MMSE scores of <25. In the present study, the aMCI\n             analysis was carried out on NO ED subjects with MMSE cut-off scores of over 18,\n             elementary school educated subjects with MMSE cut-off scores of over 21, and higher\n             than middle school educated subject with MMSE cut-off scores of over 25.\n\n          -  The cognitively-normal elderly formed the normal control (NC) group, was\n             independently-functioning community dwellers with no neurological or psychiatric\n             conditions.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  All participants underwent a screening process that included a review of their\n             medical history, physical and neurological examinations, laboratory tests, and MRI\n             analysis. The clinical assessment of mild cognitive impairment or dementia included\n             neuropsychological tests, as well as behavioral and psychiatric interviews conducted\n             by the attending psychiatrist. AD patients recorded scores of < 4 on the Hachinski\n             Ischemia Scale and showed no history of significant systemic or psychiatric\n             conditions, or traumatic brain injuries that could compromise brain function."
