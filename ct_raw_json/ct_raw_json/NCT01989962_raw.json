            "textblock": "Two waves of the E4E intervention will be delivered to family physicians who have Aboriginal\n      patients with type 2 diabetes on and off reserves. A mix-method approach will be employed in\n      this evaluation study. Evaluation instruments include: (1) chart reviews, (2) patient\n      experience surveys, and (3) patient interviews.\n\n        1. Chart review: A randomized, controlled, pre- and post intervention study design will be\n           used to evaluate the effect of the E4E intervention on type 2 diabetes clinical\n           outcomes of the Aboriginal patients. A retrospective chart audit will be used to gather\n           the clinical data from 12 months prior to and 12 month after the intervention, not\n           including the time during intervention.\n\n           Sample Size for chart review: The primary outcome measure of HbA1C value will be used\n           to identify the impact of E4E intervention on the clinical outcome of Aboriginal\n           patients with type 2 diabetes. It is hypothesized that the A1C value would be reduced\n           in the E4E Intervention Group's patients whose A1C values are at or above 8.0% prior to\n           the E4E intervention (baseline) compared to the patients in E4E Late Intervention\n           Control Group. A 0.5% difference of patients' A1C values between these two groups will\n           be a clinically significant difference.  The sample size needed to detect such a\n           difference is estimated to be 98 eligible patients charts with A1C at or above 8.0%\n           from E4E Intervention Group and 98 eligible patient charts from E4E Late Intervention\n           Control Group, with an a=0.05 and \u00df=0.15. Given the proportion of 61.1% of Aboriginal\n           patients with type 2 diabetes having A1C at or above 8.0%, we need to review 163\n           patient charts to obtain 98 eligible charts from each group. When 10 charts extractions\n           per physician are performed, we need 17 physicians from each group. Considering a\n           possible 20% loss to follow up, we need to recruit 20 physicians from E4E Intervention\n           Group and 20 physicians from E4E Late Intervention Control Group, a total of 40\n           physicians to be invited to participate in chart reviews.\n\n           Recruitment of physicians: After obtaining ethics approval from Queen's University\n           Research Office, we will recruit 8-10 physicians to participate in the project at each\n           potential site. Once recruitment is completed on each site, physicians will be\n           randomized into E4E Intervention Group and E4E Late Intervention Control Group (sham\n           comparator) who will participate in the second wave of E4E intervention 12 month later.\n           Letters of information and consent form will be sent to the physicians to obtain their\n           signed consent to participating in E4E chart review, patient survey and patient\n           interview.\n\n           Data collection regarding chart reviews for diabetes: The evaluation team will require\n           the consenting physicians to create a list of all of their Aboriginal patients with\n           type 2 diabetes using billing code 250, removing non-Aboriginal patients. This process\n           can either be managed by the practice (with staff being reimbursed for time required)\n           or can be conducted by the research staff at time of the chart audit. Each physician\n           will then be asked to review the list for accuracy. Random number generation will be\n           used to select charts at random from the list until the required number of eligible\n           patient charts has been identified. Chart reviewers will be trained staff from the\n           evaluation team and travel to each selected location to conduct chart audits.\n\n        2. Patient experience survey: Two (2) patient experience surveys will be conducted to\n           evaluate the experience of Aboriginal patient with type 2 diabetes with his/her\n           physician, respectively at the point of 3-month after the E4E intervention and at the\n           point of 12-month after the intervention.\n\n           Sample size for patient experience surveys: An effective sample size needed for patient\n           experience survey, with an a=0.05 and power 85% (\u00df=0.15), is estimated to be 102\n           eligible Aboriginal type 2 diabetic patients from E4E Intervention Group and the same\n           number of eligible Aboriginal patients from E4E Late Intervention Control Group. We\n           will recruit 10 eligible Aboriginal patients from each of the physicians in E4E Group A\n           and 10 eligible Aboriginal patients from each of the physicians in E4E Group B. A total\n           of 400 patients will be recruited to participate in Patient Experience surveys. This\n           sample size (200 from each group) is more than sufficient to achieve 85% power even\n           after allowing for drop out of physicians and any unanticipated difficulties in patient\n           recruitment.\n\n           Data collection regarding patient experience surveys: The Patient Experience Surveys\n           will take approximately 15-20 minutes to complete and will be completed on the day of\n           patient visit. Patient Experience Survey is designed in two sections: pre-visit section\n           and post visit section. Consent needs to be obtained from patients in pre-visit\n           section.\n\n             -  The receptionist of the selected practice will notify eligible patients about the\n                study, and ask if they are willing to discuss with support/research staff about\n                participating in a Patient Experience Survey. If the patient is interested, the\n                receptionist will refer her/him to the onsite support/research staff, or provide\n                access to a private phone with toll free number to contact support/research staff.\n\n             -  Support/Research staff will review the information letter with the patient and\n                obtain informed consent.\n\n             -  The patient completes the pre-visit section and sign on the consent before seeing\n                the doctor.\n\n             -  After seeing the doctor, the patient will be asked to complete the post-visit\n                survey and return it to the support/research staff before leaving the clinic. For\n                patients who are not able to do so, they will be offered a choice to complete the\n                survey by toll free telephone or fill in a hard copy of questionnaire and mail it\n                out by pre-paid mail.\n\n             -  Regular updates will be performed during data collection process to keep tack of\n                patients participation in the survey.\n\n        3. Interview: Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with Aboriginal patients with\n           type 2 diabetes about their perception of any changes in care delivery received from\n           their physicians following the E4E education program.\n\n      Sample size for patient interview: 20 Aboriginal diabetic patients will be recruited from\n      the patient roster of the physicians who are in E4E Intervention Group, on an average of 4\n      patients will be recruited from each site.\n\n      Data collection re: patient interview:  Semi-structured interview will be conducted by a\n      research staff or a trained facilitator, either on site or by telephone. Patient interview\n      will be conducted 12 months after the completion of early E4E intervention. Written consent\n      will be obtained from patients.  If it is a telephone interview, patient oral consent will\n      be recorded. The interview guide is open to new topics that emerge from interviews, and the\n      probes will be used to explore new themes and topics in detail. Each interview will take\n      approximately 20-30 minutes, be audio taped and transcribed verbatim.\n\n      In keeping with the updated TCPS2 guidelines on research involving aboriginal peoples,\n      aboriginal input and partnership in the project has been central since its inception and\n      will continue.  There is a steering committee of key leaders in aboriginal health that\n      includes elders and traditional knowledge holders.  As recruitment proceeds, appropriate\n      local aboriginal partner organizations will be engaged and formal research agreements made\n      with each of them prior to conducting research involving the local aboriginal community.\n      Given the range of potential sites this may include agreements with band or tribal councils,\n      native friendship centres or other local aboriginal organizations."
