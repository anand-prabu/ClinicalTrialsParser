            "textblock": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common type of cancer in men and the\n      seventh in women and is the third most common cause of death from cancer worldwide. The\n      overall incidence of HCC remains high in developing countries and is steadily rising in most\n      industrialized countries.\n\n      TACE with Doxorubicin-eluting beads  (DEB-TACE) has recently been developed as a novel\n      therapy option for HCC. In order to maximize its therapeutic efficacy, doxorubicin-loaded\n      beads were developed to deliver higher doses of the chemotherapeutic agent and to prolong\n      its permanence within the tumor. The comparison of efficacy and safety of drug-eluting bead\n      (DC bead\u00ae) TACE in comparison with conventional TACE (cTACE) showed that response and time\n      to progression in the DC bead\u00ae group was significantly higher than that of the cTACE group.\n      DC bead\u00ae TACE thus appears to be a feasible and promising approach to the treatment of HCC.\n\n      This study's purpose is evaluating treatment efficacy, survival rate and safety of DEB-TACE\n      using doxorubicin for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma."
