Sequential cohorts\n      of eight patients with PD will be administered ascending oral doses of AVE8112 (n=6) or\n      placebo (n=2) once a day for 14 days.  Dosing for subsequent cohorts will only proceed, and\n      the dose level selected, after the safety and tolerability of the previous cohort has been\n      reviewed. Doses are planned to be 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 mg once a day for 14 days.  These\n      are planned treatments, but doses may be modified based on safety review of previous\n      cohort(s). In addition, cohorts may be added to reconfirm a previously administered dose,\n      and/or a titration strategy may be employed to reach a desired dose.\n\n      Patients will be assessed in clinic for 30 hours following the initial oral dose of AVE8112\n      or placebo. Subsequent dosing will occur on an outpatient basis.  Patients will receive\n      telephone calls on Days 3 and 10 to monitor for adverse events (AEs) and concomitant\n      medications, and will also be assessed in the clinic on Study Days 7 (outpatient), 14\n      (outpatient), and 28 (\u00b1 3 days) (Follow-up visit). Safety assessments will include physical\n      examinations, vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory evaluations, Movement Disorder Society\n      Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), and Columbia Suicide Severity Rating\n      Scale (C-SSRS).   Pharmacodynamic assessment will include the Parkinson's Disease Cognitive\n      Rating Scale (PD-CRS)."
