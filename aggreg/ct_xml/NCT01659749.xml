    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to study the effectiveness of teaching teens and young women
      with Phenylketonuria (PKU) or Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) about their disease and
      nutrition related issues in a camp environment. It will also look at pregnancy outcome
      results in women with PKU who attended Metabolic Camp and compare their results to other
      women with PKU who have not attended the Metabolic Camp.
