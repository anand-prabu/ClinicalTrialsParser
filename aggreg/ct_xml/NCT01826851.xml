  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exparel is a new local analgesic (numbing medication) that is intended to be longer acting
      than currently available local analgesics. The purpose of this study is to determine whether
      use of Exparel to numb the nerves along the breastbone after open heart surgery, will
      decrease pain and pain medication use after surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, single-institution, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,
      placebo-controlled trial of patients undergoing a median sternotomy for primary
      cardiopulmonary bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.

      78 subjects (39 per treatment arm) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a
      single-dose, parasternal nerve block with either 266 mg Exparel or placebo (0.9% normal
      saline solution). The nerve blocks will be performed under direct visualization at the end
      of surgery, just prior to sternal closure.
