  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new, more specific skin test to detect tuberculosis has been developed by Statens Serum
      Institut in Denmark. The new skin test is named C-Tb and like the current Tuberculin a
      positive test result will show as redness and/or induration at the injection site, while a
      negative test will leave no reactions.

      The aim of this study is to address if the size of induration and the sensitivity of C-Tb is
      influenced by concomitant injections of C-Tb and Tuberculin. Furthermore, the intention is
      to evaluate the safety of C-Tb when injected alone or concomitantly with Tuberculin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The TESEC-07 trial is a GCP double blind randomised controlled phase II/III trial
      investigating if concomitant injections of the diagnostic agents C-Tb and 2 T.U Tuberculin
      PPD RT 23 SSI affect the induration responses in combination with a safety assessment of
      C-Tb. TESEC-07 is a multi-centre trial and will be conducted in South Africa in patients
      recently diagnosed with TB comprising 360 HIV negative and 90 HIV positive adults allocated
      to 3 trial groups.

        -  A within group paired comparison of 0.1 μg/0.1 mL C-Tb and PPD RT 23 in 150 TB
           patients. The C-Tb and PPD RT 23 agents are given concomitantly to each volunteer in
           the RIGHT AND LEFT forearms according to a randomisation scheme.

        -  A group of 150 TB patients will only receive the C-Tb agent randomised to either RIGHT
           or LEFT forearm.

        -  A group of 150 TB patients will only receive the reference agent PPD RT 23 randomised
           to either RIGHT or LEFT forearm.
