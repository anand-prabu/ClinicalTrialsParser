All participants will be asked to keep a voiding diary\n      for 2 consecutive days and to complete a QoL questionnaire after 1st visit and before each\n      subsequent visit. This multi-centre trial will be conducted in Belgium. The overall time to\n      participate in this study is up to 12 weeks. Participants will make 3 visits to their\n      healthcare provider."
