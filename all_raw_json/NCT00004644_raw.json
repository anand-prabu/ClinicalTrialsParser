Evaluate whether high-dose acyclovir decreases acute and long-term morbidity\n      and mortality in neonates with central nervous system or disseminated herpes simplex virus\n      (HSV) infection.\n\n      II.  Evaluate whether high-dose acyclovir is safe and tolerated in the newborn. III.  Assess\n      resistance to antiviral medication. IV.  Amplify disease classification for the purpose of\n      predicting prognosis. V.  Assess any changes in viral excretion patterns. VI.  Evaluate\n      whether antigens and antibodies specific for HSV glycoproteins within the cerebrospinal\n      fluid (CSF) predict long-term neurologic outcome.\n\n      VII.  Evaluate whether specific antigens and antibodies in the CSF appear late after\n      treatment and are indicative of insidious reactivation of virus in the brain."
