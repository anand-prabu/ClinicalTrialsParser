  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New approaches to increase eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in our
      diet are needed, but any new approach needs to demonstrate the bioavailability of EPA+DHA,
      and its safety and palatability. The HS-Omega-3 Index is a prime parameter to demonstrate
      bioavailability in the long-term. Study hypothesis is that increased intake of EPA+DHA will
      increase the HS-Omega-3 Index. Study aim is to investigate how supplementing various
      sausages with omega-3 fatty acids influences the HS-Omega-3 Index in healthy volunteers, as
      compared to unsupplemented matching sausages. Safety and palatability of the sausages are
      also to be assessed.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must be willing to eat 80 g of the sausage to be investigated per day.

          2. Age: 20 - 60 years

          3. Low HS-Omega-3 Index (&lt;5%)

          4. Subjects must have adequate fluency in German or English to complete baseline and
             follow-up interviews.

          5. Stable intake of food containing EPA+DHA before and during study

          6. Subjects must be able and willing to give written informed consent, and to comply
             with study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects for whom the intake of omega-3 fatty acids is mandatory according to recent
             treatment guidelines or who take omega-3 fatty acids supplements on a regular basis.

          2. Subjects consuming  &gt;2 portions of fatty fish / week

          3. Subjects with serious bleeding disorder. Use of platelet inhibitors or conventional
             anticoagulation with a target INR of 2.0 - 3.0 is not an exclusion criterion.

          4. Subjects with any acute and life-threatening condition, such as collapse and shock,
             acute myocardial infarction (last three months), stroke, embolism.

          5. Subjects with significant medical co-morbidity, seriously limiting life expectancy or
             insulin-treated diabetes mellitus or a BMI&gt;30

          6. Allergy/intolerance or history of hypersensitivity to components of study
             intervention.

          7. Pregnant subjects and breastfeeding subjects. In addition, women of childbearing
             potential who will not practice a medically accepted method of contraception will be
             excluded.

          8. Subjects who, in the investigator's judgement, will not likely be able to comply with
             the study protocol or with known drug- or alcohol abuse/dependence in the past 2
             years.

          9. Use of any investigational agents within 30 days prior to t0
