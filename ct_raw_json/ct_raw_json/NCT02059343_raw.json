It is also often used after surgery and may be particularly\n      helpful for children with heart disease. In order for this medication to be helpful and to\n      minimize risks associated with taking the medication, it is important to provide correct\n      dosing for this medication. Based on evidence from studies of other medications used during\n      heart surgery, it is likely that dosing of dexmedetomidine while on cardiopulmonary bypass\n      is different from dosing in other settings. The purpose of this study is to evaluate how the\n      heart-lung bypass machine affects dexmedetomidine levels in the body."
