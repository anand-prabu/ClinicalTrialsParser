Patients were randomly assigned to either the brand-name analgesic or to its\n      (purportedly) cheaper generic version. In reality, all participants obtained the same\n      brand-name medication. The medication was provided at no cost, and patients were instructed\n      to take the first pill while at the clinic. They were informed that they could (a) increase\n      the dosage of the prescribed analgesic to twice daily if necessary and (b) stop taking the\n      medication when no longer needed. Any other changes to the regimen were discouraged, and\n      patients were instructed to consult with the dentist before any such changes. Telephone\n      follow-ups were conducted at 24 hours, 4 days, and 7 days after surgery. Two main dependent\n      variables were obtained: the number of prescribed analgesics consumed and the number of\n      non-prescribed analgesics consumed. The patients also reported the pain felt during the\n      period."
