            "textblock": "Eating a diet rich in tomatoes has been associated with decreased risk for a variety of\n      diseases.  Tomatoes contain red-colored lycopene (one type of pigment in the class of\n      pigments called carotenoids), which has been associated with the decreased risk of disease\n      in those consuming tomato products; however, tomatoes also contain flavonoids, which may\n      also have health promoting effects.  The Tangerine tomato, a unique tomato variety, contains\n      lycopene in a different form that in red tomatoes and this contributes to their\n      characteristic orange color.  This \"orange lycopene\" is more similar to the most common form\n      of lycopene found in the blood and tissue of people who eat a tomato-rich diet, and may be\n      more easily absorbed by the body.\n\n      The objectives of this study are to determine if carotenoids and flavonoids from Tangerine\n      tomatoes are more easily absorbed by the body than red tomatoes, and to examine if eating\n      Tangerine versus red tomatoes impacts markers of inflammation (response to harmful\n      substances by the body)."
