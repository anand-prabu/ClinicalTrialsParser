In Arm\n      B, RO6839921 will be given to patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia\n      (AML). The arms will escalate independently. Escalation will begin in solid tumor patients\n      (Arm A) in single patient cohorts, using a new Continual Reassessment Method (n-CRM).\n      Escalation for AML patients will be initiated at or below the dose level that causes >/=\n      Grade 2 hematologic side effects in Arm A. Escalation in AML patients will follow a rolling\n      6 design.\n\n      In both arms, RO6839921 will be administered by IV infusion on Days 1-5 of 28-day cycles.\n\n      There will be no intrapatient dose escalation.
