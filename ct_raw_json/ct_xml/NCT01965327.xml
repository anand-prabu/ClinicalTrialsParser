  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of children and adults
      for which there is presently no therapy. Recently, a study reported that interferon gamma
      (IFN-g) could raise frataxin protein levels in both cell lines derived from patients with
      Friedreich ataxia and in a mouse model with Friedreich ataxia. The present study will test
      whether IFN-g is safe, tolerated and potentially efficacious in a heterogeneous cohort of
      children with FRDA.

      Study Objectives:

      Primary:

      • To assess the effect of Interferon Gamma-1b (IFN-g) on increasing frataxin expression and
      protein in children with FRDA.

      Secondary:

        -  To assess the effect of IFN-g on neurological outcomes (FARS, performance measures, and
           hearing) in subjects with FRDA.

        -  To assess the effectiveness of IFN-g on quality of life in subjects with FRDA.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of IFN-g at the currently approved dose in the
           FRDA population.

      Study Phases:

      Screening - During screening, subjects will be assessed for inclusion and exclusion
      criteria.

      Intervention - Subjects will begin treatment at baseline visit and the dose of study
      medication will be increased to the maximum dose over four weeks. The subjects will be
      maintained at the maximum dose for 8 weeks. After 12 weeks, treatment will stop. Study
      medication will be administered via subcutaneous injections three times per week for 12
      weeks.

      Follow-up - Follow-up visits will occur at 7 and 28 days after the subject has completed the
      12 weeks of active treatment.

    <description>Assess the effect of IFN-g on frataxin protein levels.  This is will be done in parallel in buccal cells and whole blood in children with FRDA. Samples are assessed by lateral flow assay using an immuno assay for frataxin. Frataxin levels in blood and buccal cell will be measured at each study visit. Change in frataxin level relative to frataxin level at screening will be analyzed.</description>

    <description>Assess the effectiveness of IFN-g on quality of life in subjects with FRDA via a series of questionnaires. Questionnaires include an activities of daily living form, the modified fatigue impact scale, and the clinical global impression scale (performed by the PI and parents separately).  In addition, parents and study subjects will complete a Pediatric Quality of Life questionnaire, which is age-specific.</description>

    <description>Subjects will begin by taking 10 mcg/m2 of IFN-g -1b for the first two weeks of the study.  Dose will be escalated to 25 mcg/m2 of IFN-g -1b for weeks three and four of the study.  Finally, the dose will be escalated to 50 mcg/m2 of IFN-gamma-1b for the last eight weeks of the study, which is the current dose approved by the FDA for children.
All doses will be administered via subcutaneous injection.</description>
