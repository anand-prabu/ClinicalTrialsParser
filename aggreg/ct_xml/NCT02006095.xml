    <textblock>
      Carotid revascularization can significantly reduce the risk of stroke in patients with
      severe carotid stenosis; however, it has been associated with cognitive decline in 25% of
      the older adults who undergo the procedure.  Characterizing risk factors for cognitive
      decline following carotid interventions and individualizing treatment strategy based on
      those risks can minimize procedure-associated cognitive dysfunction.  Neuroimaging
      techniques that characterize white matter integrity and regional hypoperfusion have the
      potential to provide sensitive brain structure indicators that may be associated with memory
      decline following revascularization procedures. In this protocol, we hope to determine how
      cerebral blood flow and baseline white matter abnormality in the vulnerable region modify
      the frequency and cognitive effect of microembolization following carotid revascularization
      procedures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is male or female &gt;40 yrs of age.

          -  Patient has occlusive extracranial carotid stenosis (≥70%)

          -  Patient is scheduled to undergo a carotid revascularization procedure

          -  Patient agrees to voluntarily participate in the study and signs an informed consent.

             testing procedures.

          -  Patient has sufficient visual and auditory acuity for cognitive testing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is unable to safely and comfortably undergo MR imaging procedures (e.g.,
             claustrophobia, implanted medical devices that are MRI incompatible such as
             pacemaker, defibrillator, neural stimulator etc)

             varices, pancreatitis).

          -  Patient with a history of neurological (e.g., multiple sclerosis, seizure disorder,
             Parkinson's disease) or systemic illness affecting central nervous system function.
