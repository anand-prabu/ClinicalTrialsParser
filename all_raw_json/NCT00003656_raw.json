(Phase I closed to accrual as of 9/24/03.)\n\n      Patients receive tretinoin liposome IV over 30 minutes once weekly and interferon alfa-2b\n      subcutaneously on five consecutive days (M-F) for 8 weeks. Courses repeat every 8 weeks in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tretinoin liposome until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) has been determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at\n      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is\n      determined additional patients are accrued and treated at that dose. (Phase I closed to\n      accrual as of 9/24/03.)\n\n      During the first 3 weeks of the study, patients receive interferon alfa-2b at weekly dose\n      escalations. After week 3, patients continue at the highest acceptable dose level of\n      interferon alfa-2b for the remainder of the study. (Phase I closed to accrual as of\n      9/24/03.)\n\n      Patients are followed at 30 days after the last treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-18 patients will be accrued into the phase I portion of this\n      study (Phase I closed to accrual as of 9/24/03). A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued\n      into the phase II portion of this study."
