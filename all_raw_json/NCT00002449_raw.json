Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a\n      substance naturally produced by the body's white blood cells that plays an important role in\n      helping the body fight infection. IL-2 may be able to boost the immune systems of people\n      with HIV infection."

Ascending dose cohorts of five patients are studied. The\n      safety and tolerability of L2-7001 is assessed in preparation for the second phase of the\n      study and to estimate an MTD. Phase B involves randomization of 190 patients to (a) one of\n      three dose levels of L2-7001 plus ART, (b) one of two dosing levels of Proleukin plus ART,\n      or (c) ART alone. L2-7001 and Proleukin are given SC every 12 hours for the first 5 days of\n      an 8-week cycle for three cycles. Serum IL-2 levels, soluble IL-2 receptor levels, and\n      levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are evaluated in 8 patients randomized to each\n      treatment cohort of Phase B. All patients completing this phase of the protocol are eligible\n      to be screened for enrollment in a maintenance use protocol which will allow for  access to\n      L2-7001."
