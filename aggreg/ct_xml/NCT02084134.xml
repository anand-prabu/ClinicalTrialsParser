  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During transsphenoidal resection of pituitary tumors and cysts, surgery is performed by a
      neurosurgeon and ear nose and throat surgeon.  The pituitary tumor or cyst is reached by
      making a small hole in the back of the nose into the bottom of the skull.  The surgeon is
      able to see the pituitary and tumor with an endoscope and remove the tumor through the hole.

      Surgery on the pituitary can cause disruption in the secretion of ACTH and cause adrenal
      failure (lack of cortisol secretion) which can cause nausea, vomiting, low blood pressure,
      and rarely can be fatal.  There is no consensus among endocrinologists and neurosurgeons
      about the use of perioperative steroids in pituitary patients.  Traditionally, all patients
      undergoing pituitary surgery were given steroids before, during, and after surgery because
      of the assumption that there would be some compromise in the amount of ACTH released by the
      pituitary as a result of surgical trauma.  Studies have failed to show, however, that ACTH
      secretion is in fact compromised during transsphenoidal pituitary microsurgery.  As a
      result, there are some centers that routinely give perioperative steroids to all patients
      undergoing pituitary surgery and there are some centers that do not routinely give
      perioperative steroids.  There are several retrospective and prospective studies that have
      addressed this issue and have shown that withholding perioperative steroids is safe, but
      there has never been a prospective study comparing the two approaches.

      Objectives: The goal of this study is to prospectively compare two approaches to the
      perioperative management of patients undergoing transsphenoidal resection of a pituitary
      tumor or cyst.  One protocol includes the routine use of perioperative steroids and the
      other does not.  The investigators hypothesis, based on previous studies, is that patients
      who are adrenally sufficient do not routinely need to be treated with perioperative
      steroids.  The investigators also hypothesize that the use of perioperative steroids may be
      associated with a higher rate of adverse outcomes

      Patients who are scheduled to undergo transsphenoidal resection for a pituitary tumor or
      cyst at the investigators institution will be screened prior to surgery for eligibility for
      this study. All patients deemed eligible will undergo a cosyntropin stimulation test to
      evaluate for adrenal insufficiency.  Patients with adrenal insufficiency will be excluded
      from the study.
