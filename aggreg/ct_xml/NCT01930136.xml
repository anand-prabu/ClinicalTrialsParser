  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigates whether a long-term 25% caloric restriction can prevent onset and/or
      progression of renal function deterioration, retinal involvement and cardiovascular
      complications in overweight/obese type 2 diabetic patients, trough the amelioration of
      concomitant metabolic abnormalities such as visceral obesity, insulin resistance,
      dyslipidemia, hypertension and inflammation.

      The main aim of the study is therefore to evaluate the role of calorie restriction (CR) on
      subjects at risk of nephropathy. Secondary aims are to better understand the relationship
      between CR and the following aspects: renal disease and its associated metabolic
      abnormalities, retinopathy and cardiovascular complications, quality of life and treatment
      cost.
