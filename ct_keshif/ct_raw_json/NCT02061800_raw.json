            "textblock": "CD34+ stem cells (the cells that make all the types of blood cells in the body) are selected\n      (removed) from the donor's peripheral blood stem cells. In doing this, T-cells (a type of\n      blood cell) are also removed. T-cells are the cells which are responsible for severe acute\n      and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD). GVHD is a condition that results from a\n      reaction of the transplanted donor T-lymphocytes (a kind of white blood cell) against the\n      body and organs. There are two forms: acute (early) and chronic (late). Acute GVHD may\n      produce skin rashes, liver disease, diarrhea, and an increased risk of infection. Chronic\n      GVHD can also appear in subjects without prior acute GVHD. Chronic GVHD may also produce\n      skin rashes, liver disease, diarrhea and an increased risk of infection. Chronic GVHD may be\n      mild and respond to agents which suppress the immune system, or it could be very severe. It\n      may also last for over a year.\n\n      Once this CD34 selection process is complete, the CD34+ stem cell AlloSCT is given to the\n      recipient without most of the T-cells to see if this therapy will lessen the incidence and\n      seriousness of graft versus host disease (GVHD). CD34+ stem cell selection AlloSCT has been\n      studied in adults with malignant and non-malignant disease with successful engraftment and\n      has shown some improvement in GVHD. We do not know if CD34+ stem cell selection will work to\n      prevent severe GVHD in children, adolescents and young adults.\n\n      Subjects are being offered this experimental treatment involving the use of a Miltenyi\n      CliniMacs CD34+ selection device to remove T-cells from the peripheral blood stem cell\n      transplant in order to decrease the risk of acute and chronic GVHD. There will be about 25\n      subjects participating in this study at Columbia University Medical Center. The purpose of\n      this study is to learn more about the effects of CD34+ stem cell selection on GVHD in\n      children, adolescents and young adults.\n\n      The goals of this study are:\n\n        -  To determine how often acute GVHD occurs and how severe the acute GVHD is in the\n           children, adolescents and young adults receiving CD34+ selection of their peripheral\n           blood stem cell transplant from a family member or adult unrelated donor.\n\n        -  To determine how often primary graft failure and secondary graft failure occurs in the\n           children, adolescents and young adults receiving a peripheral blood stem cell\n           transplant from a family member or adult unrelated donor.\n\n        -  To see how quickly neutrophils (infection fighting white blood cells) will recover\n           following CD34+ selection of their peripheral blood stem cell transplant from a family\n           member or adult unrelated donor.\n\n        -  To see if the time for the immune system (the body's defense system) to recover will\n           benefit from receiving CD34+ selection of their peripheral blood stem cell transplant\n           from a family member or adult unrelated donor.\n\n        -  To see how often bacterial, viral, fungal and atypical mycobacteria (TB-like)\n           infections will occur in the children, adolescents and young adults receiving CD34+\n           selection of their peripheral blood stem cell transplant from a family member or adult\n           unrelated donor.\n\n      No tests will be performed for research purposes only. All required testing in this protocol\n      is for the purpose of standard of care clinical assessment specific to the subject's\n      disease. The only procedure specific to research will be the selection of CD34+ cells from\n      the donor's peripheral blood stem cells using the Miltenyi Clinimacs CD34+ selection device.\n\n      Study specific requirements occur up to 2 years post-transplant, although the study team\n      will collect data on the progress of subjects yearly until termination of the study to\n      observe if subjects are responding to therapy and have no worsening GVHD."
