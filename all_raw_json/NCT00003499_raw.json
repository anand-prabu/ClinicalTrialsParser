Treatment\n      continues for at least 12 months in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable\n      toxicity. After 12 months, patients with responding or stable disease may continue\n      treatment.\n\n      Tumors are measured every 8 weeks for the first 6 months, every 3 months for the first 2\n      years, every 6 months for years 3 and 4, and yearly for years 5 and 6.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
