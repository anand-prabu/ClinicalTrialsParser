RSV illness can range from mild\n      upper respiratory tract illness (URI) to severe LRI, including bronchiolitis and pneumonia.\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a single dose of a\n      RSV vaccine in healthy children. Study researchers will first evaluate the vaccine in\n      healthy RSV-seropositive children and will then evaluate the vaccine in healthy\n      RSV-seronegative infants and children.\n\n      This study will first enroll healthy RSV-seropositive children ages 12 to 59 months (Group\n      1). At study entry, participants will undergo a medical history review, physical\n      examination, blood collection, and a nasal wash procedure. Participants will be randomly\n      assigned to receive either the RSV vaccine or placebo vaccine, administered as nose drops.\n      Subjects will be actively monitored for 28 days following administration of vaccine or\n      placebo; monitoring will include medical history reviews, clinical assessments, and at some\n      visits, nasal washes. On the days where no study visit is scheduled, study researchers will\n      contact participants' parents or guardians for medical follow-up.\n\n      Study researchers will evaluate the study data of participants in Group 1 before enrolling\n      participants in Group 2, and study data from Group 2 will be reviewed before enrolling\n      participants in Group 3. Participants in Groups 2 and 3 will include healthy\n      RSV-seronegative infants and children ages 6 to 24 months. These participants will also be\n      randomly assigned to receive either the RSV vaccine or placebo vaccine, administered as nose\n      drops. Subjects will be actively monitored for 56 days following administration of vaccine\n      or placebo; monitoring will include medical history reviews, clinical assessments, and at\n      some visits, nasal washes. On the days where no study visit is scheduled, study researchers\n      will contact participants' parents or guardians for medical follow-up. At a study visit on\n      Day 56, participants will undergo a medical history review, blood collection, and a nasal\n      wash procedure.\n\n      For participants in Groups 2 and 3, from November through March following each participant's\n      vaccination visit, parents or guardians will monitor participants for RSV-associated\n      illnesses and report these on a weekly basis via telephone calls to study researchers.\n      Participants may have additional study visits that may include blood collection and/or nasal\n      wash procedures during this follow-up period."
