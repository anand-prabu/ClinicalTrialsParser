Calcitriol may help solid tumor cells develop into normal\n      cells. Combining calcitriol with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of calcitriol combined with carboplatin in\n      treating patients who have advanced solid tumors."

Patients are stratified according to disease\n      (brain tumor vs other solid tumor) and accrued in parallel. Patients are assigned to one of\n      two treatment groups.\n\n        -  Group 1: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 20-30 minutes on day 1 and calcitriol\n           subcutaneously (SC) or orally daily on days 2-4 for the first course only. For\n           subsequent courses, patients receive calcitriol SC or orally daily on days 1-3 and\n           carboplatin IV over 20-30 minutes on day 3.\n\n        -  Group 2: Patients receive calcitriol SC or orally daily on days 1-3 and carboplatin IV\n           over 20-30 minutes on day 3 for the first, third, and subsequent courses. For the\n           second course only, patients receive carboplatin IV over 20-30 minutes on day 1 and\n           calcitriol SC or orally daily on days 2-4.\n\n      In both groups, treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Sequential dose escalation of calcitriol is followed by sequential dose escalation of\n      carboplatin. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of calcitriol and then\n      carboplatin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination is determined. The MTD\n      is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting\n      toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-50 patients will be accrued for this study."
