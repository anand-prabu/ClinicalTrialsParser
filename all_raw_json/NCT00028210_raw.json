People with an\n      amputated upper limb have an expanded brain representation of the lip that may correlate\n      with heightened tactile spatial acuity.\n\n      Normal volunteers will be recruited for this study. Candidates will be screened with\n      physical and neurological examinations. (Amputee volunteers will be studied at the amputee\n      clinic at the University of Tubingen, Germany.)\n\n      Participants will sit comfortably in a chair, wearing a blindfold, during the following\n      experiments:\n\n        -  Plastic domes with grooves are placed on parts of the lower lip on either side for a\n           few seconds. The volunteer is then asked to identify the direction of the grooves\n           relative to the long axis of the lip.\n\n        -  The participant's arm is placed in a cast and the index finger is immobilized. The same\n           test done on the lip is repeated on the distal part of the index finger.\n\n      Each part of the test lasts about 20 minutes, and the entire experiment takes about 2 hours."

It is conceivable that this enlargement of the\n      lip representation may translate into a behavioral gain.  The purpose of this protocol is to\n      test the hypothesis that upper limb amputation in humans results in higher tactile spatial\n      acuity at the lip.  This would represent the first demonstration of chronic\n      deafferentation-induced behavioral gains within the somatosensory system."
