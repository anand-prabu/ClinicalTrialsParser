Heating paclitaxel to several degrees above body temperature\n      and infusing it to the affected area around the tumor may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of paclitaxel given\n      by hyperthermic perfusion in treating patients with lung cancer or lung metastases that\n      cannot be removed by surgery."

Patients receive\n      paclitaxel over 90 minutes administered via hyperthermic retrograde isolated lung perfusion.\n      The entire surgery lasts approximately 4 hours.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of paclitaxel until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1 and 2 months. Patients with responding disease continue to be\n      followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 31 patients will be accrued for this study."
