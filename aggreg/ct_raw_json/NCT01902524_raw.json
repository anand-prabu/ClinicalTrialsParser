The\n      patch is designed to systematically release the adsorbed fentanyl percutaneously, in a\n      constant rate for three days (72 hours). The study will be conducted for 12 weeks. The\n      efficacy and safety will be evaluated at week 1, week 4, week 8 and week 12 visits. All\n      participants will use the patch at least once during the study. The drug efficacy will be\n      evaluated by the percent change in pain intensity before and after treatment and by\n      improvements in the following activities: daily life, walking, meal intake, mood regulation.\n      The overall safety will be assessed based on the adverse events reporting."
