In these autoimmune cases, a daily dose of chloroquine at 250 mg for 12\n      weeks has shown improvement in symptoms and decreases in inflammatory cytokines synthesis\n      and a reduction in TLR -mediated immune activation. Study findings could help provide\n      information about where and under what circumstances chloroquine treatment may reduce T cell\n      activation and help restore circulating CD4 T cells."
