  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinoid X receptors (RXR) are nuclear receptors that have been linked to numerous metabolic
      pathways relevant to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Aβ (harmful protein) production and
      removal. The study drug &quot;bexarotene&quot; is an FDA approved anti-cancer agent but is not
      approved for use in Alzheimer's disease. Bexarotene acts as an RXR agonist that has reduced
      Aβ (harmful protein) in the brain in experimental models of Alzheimer's disease.

      This study aims to determine the safety and effect on abnormal  proteins found in the brain
      (based on brain scans) of 300 mg of &quot;bexarotene&quot; administered for one month compared to
      placebo (inactive agent).
