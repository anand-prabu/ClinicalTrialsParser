      The purpose of this study is to determine if 68Gallium-octreotate and 18Fluorodesoxyglucose
      uptake, apparent diffusion coefficient and post 177Lu-octreotate SPECT/CT dosimetry are
      reliable predictors for lesion-by-lesion treatment outcome.

      This is a feasibility study evaluating the use of 177Lutetium-octreotate in the treatment of
      advanced refractory Neuroendocrine Tumors.

      Objectives of the study:

        1. primary (on a lesion basis): To assess the value of the following parameters (obtained
           through functional and molecular imaging) for predicting the lesion-by-lesion treatment
           outcome: 68Ga-octreotate and 18FDG uptake on PET/CT scans as well as apparent diffusion
           coefficient on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (absolute values at
           baseline and after each cycle and their relative differences) and post 177Lu-octreotate
           SPECT/CT dosimetry after each cycle.

        2. secondary (on a patient basis): To generate a patient-based response model based on the
           aforementioned parameters.

      Treatment will consist of 177Lu-octreotate infusions in fixed activities of 7,4 GigaBecqurel
      each, given 8-11 weeks apart, injected intravenously with simultaneous infusion of an amino
      acid solution. (Before amino acid nephroprotection solution, ondansetron, methylprednisolone
      and metoclopramid, are given intravenously in order to prevent nausea or vomiting).
      Approximately 30 min after the beginning of the amino acid solution, 177Lu-octreotate is
      co-infused over 15-30 minutes. The amino acid infusion is continued at the same rate for 3-5
      more hours (total infusion lasts 4-6 hours).

      In total, 4 cycles are planned. However, the total number of administered cycles will be
      limited by critical organ (kidneys and bone marrow) cumulated absorbed doses.

      Treatment efficacy will be assessed:

        -  on a lesion-basis (change of longest transversal diameter).

        -  on a patient-basis using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors  (RECIST) 1.1.
