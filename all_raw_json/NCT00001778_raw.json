The purpose of this protocol is to study the natural history of HAM/TSP\n      with emphasis on defining its virological and immunological changes with respect to clinical\n      progression.\n\n      Study Population:\n\n      Patients with HAM/TSP who fulfill World Health Organization diagnostic criteria are eligible\n      to participate in this protocol.  Asymptomatic seropositive individuals and individuals with\n      indeterminate HTLV-1 serology are also eligible to participate.\n\n      Design and Outcome Measures:\n\n      A longitudinal assessment of clinical, virological and immunological progression in HAM/TSP\n      will be accomplished through periodic testing and evaluation.  Asymptomatic seropositive\n      individuals, those with serodeterminate HTLV-I serology and normal volunteers may serve as\n      controls.  Longitudinal standardized neurological examinations will be performed.\n      Longitudinal samples of serum, plasma, and lymphocytes will be obtained from participants.\n      Lumbar punctures may be performed on individuals with HAM/TSP.  These samples will be used\n      virological and immunological assays.  A focus is on the relationships between the\n      characteristics of viral infection, the immune response and the genetic makeup."
