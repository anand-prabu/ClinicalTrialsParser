Acute therapy must have been\n        completed 14 days prior to the time of study entry.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria\n\n        Co-existing Condition:\n\n        Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded:\n\n        Malignancy requiring systemic therapy.\n\n        Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded:\n\n          -  History of acute or chronic pancreatitis.\n\n          -  History of generalized peripheral neuropathy.\n\n          -  Inability to tolerate ddI at 200-400 mg/day or d4T at 60-80 mg/day.  For purposes of\n             this study, intolerance will be defined as the same recurrent toxicities requiring\n             dose interruptions and dose reductions or permanent discontinuation of the drugs\n             (other than Grade 3 or 4 anemia).\n\n        Prior Medication:\n\n        Excluded:\n\n        Antiretroviral therapy. If antiretroviral-experienced, no prior NNRTI's or HU and no more\n        than 12 weeks experience with ddI and/or d4T. Protease inhibitor experience is allowed.\n        Experienced patients must be on a stable antiretroviral therapy 30 days prior to study\n        screening and continue this regimen until study entry.\n\n        Risk Behavior:\n\n        Excluded:\n\n        Current ethanol abuse by personal history or a report from a primary physician."
