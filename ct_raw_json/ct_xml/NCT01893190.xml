      Phase 1/2a Multicenter, Controlled, Randomized, Open Label, Dose Escalation, Safety,
      Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetic Study Comparing EG-1962 and Nimodipine in Patients with
      Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2a multicenter, controlled, open label, and randomized, study.

      Part 1 of the study is a single dose escalation period to determine the MTD of EG-1962.
      During this period, a maximum of 6 dose level cohorts with up to 12 patients per cohort will
      be enrolled. In each cohort, patients will be randomly assigned in a ratio of 3:1 to receive
      either intraventricular EG 1962 or enteral nimodipine, respectively. The first cohort will
      receive 100 mg EG 1962. Upon completion of the dose escalation period, a safe and tolerable
      dose will be selected for further study.

      Part 2 of the study is a treatment period to assess the safety and tolerability of the
      selected dose of EG-1962.

      The safety and tolerability of a single intraventricular dose of EG 1962 will be compared to
      enteral nimodipine (60 mg given every 4 hours orally or via nasogastric or gastrostomy tube)
      for 21 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female between the ages of 18 to 75 years, inclusive;

          -  WFNS Grade 2, 3, or 4 assessed after treatment of the aneurysm but prior to
             administration of EG-1962;

          -  Ruptured saccular aneurysm confirmed by angiography (catheter or CTA) and treated by
             neurosurgical clipping or endovascular coiling;

          -  Subarachnoid hemorrhage on baseline CT scan that is diffuse (clot present in both
             hemispheres) thick (&gt;4 mm) or thin, or local thick;

          -  External ventricular drain (EVD) in place;

          -  The patient is able to receive EG-1962 within 48 hours of the onset of subarachnoid
             hemorrhage (SAH). Onset of SAH is defined as the time the patient experiences the
             first symptom of SAH (e.g., severe headache or loss of consciousness). If found
             unconscious, the onset of SAH is defined as the last time the patient was seen at
             baseline neurological state;

          -  Weight &gt;45 kg;

          -  Historical eGOS of 7 or 8 prior to the onset of aSAH;

          -  Hemodynamically stable after resuscitation with systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥90 mm
             Hg without the use of inotropic agents;

          -  Signed informed consent from the patient or the patient's legal representative; and

          -  Female patients of child bearing potential must have negative pregnancy test . Male
             patients must agree to use adequate birth control during the study and up to 1 month

             interfere with the interpretation of study results;
