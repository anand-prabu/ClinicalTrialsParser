When diet and treatment is relaxed after\n      childhood, adult and adolescent patients with phenylketonuria are at risk for malnutrition,\n      depending on the compliance with treatment and the intake of amino acid supplements.\n\n      In this study, nutrition status of patients with PKU and hyperphenylalaninemia is\n      systematically assessed under ongoing current treatment, in relation to Phe-tolerance,\n      compliance with treatment, and psychosocial issues.\n\n      Study participants do not undergo any specific therapeutic or diagnostic intervention."
