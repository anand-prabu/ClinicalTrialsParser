  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colistin is amphipathic, cannot be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is
      administered intramuscularly, intravenously (IV) or via inhalation. In the case of
      pneumonia, this route of administration is favorable as it presumably delivers a high
      concentration of drug directly to the infection site. Colistimethate sodium is an FDA
      approved drug, however, its aerosolized use represents a new method of administration not
      currently FDA-approved in the United States. In this proposal, the inactive prodrug
      colistimethate sodium has been selected to use for aerosolization as it is better tolerated
      than colistin sulphate. It is a randomized, open-labeled Phase 1 trial of aerosolized and/or
      IV formulations of colistin as multiple doses over seven days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Colistin&quot; (also known as polymyxin E) is one of at least 13 derivatives of the inactive
      prodrug colistin methanesulfonate). It is amphipathic, cannot be absorbed from the
      gastrointestinal tract and is administered intramuscularly, intravenously (IV) or via
      inhalation. While approved for aerosolized use in the United Kingdom, and used in Europe for
      decades as such, aerosolized colistin is not FDA-approved in the United States. The
      intravenous formulation is approved for use in the U.S., but due to the age of the drug, it
      did not undergo rigorous trials prior to FDA-approval. Thus, detailed pharmacokinetic data
      are limited and dosing is not standardized, although the maximum IV dose should not exceed
      5mg/kg/day, divided into two to four equal doses. In the United Kingdom, the recommended
      dosing of nebulized colistin for adults is one million units (1MIU) twice daily. Despite the
      paucity of dosing and safety guidelines, aerosolized colistin is being prescribed regularly
      out of necessity given the emergence of multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs). MDROs are
      strongly associated with nosocomial pneumonia and several strains are only susceptible to
      this older drug, thus there is an urgent need for clarification on the safe use of colistin,
      including in aerosolized form as this delivers a high concentration of drug directly to the
      infection site. It is a randomized, open-labeled Phase 1 trial of aerosolized and/or IV
      formulations of colistin as multiple doses over seven days.
