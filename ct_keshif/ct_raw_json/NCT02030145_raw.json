Pulmonary function measures will include spirometry and lung volume.\n      The pulmonary function testing will be done baseline, 30 minutes post-treatment, and 3 hours\n      post-treatment.  The study protocol treatment consists of a five-minute treatment session of\n      one of the two studied treatment techniques given in a random order.  After a washout period\n      of at least four weeks, the subject will return for a second treatment session using the\n      other technique."
