    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare LY2605541 and human insulin NPH using the following
      measures for participants treated for up to 26 weeks:

        -  Change in participants' overall blood sugar control

        -  The number of night time low blood sugar episodes

        -  The number of participants that reach blood sugar targets without low night time blood
           sugar episodes

        -  The total number of low blood sugar episodes reported
