Subjects with asymptomatic brain metastases are eligible. (Systemic steroids should\n             be avoided if possible, or the subject should be stable on the lowest clinically\n             effective dose of steroids as they may interfere with the activity of ipilimumab if\n             administered at the time of the first ipilimumab dose.)\n\n          4. Must be at least 28 days since treatment with surgery or radiation, or immunotherapy\n             (IFN-alpha), and recovered from any clinically significant toxicity experienced\n             during treatment. Palliative radiation therapy outside of the brain or therapeutic\n             radiation to the brain after the subject's condition is stabilized and steroid\n             decreased to the lowest fixed dose possible does not require the 28- day waiting\n             period.\n\n          5. Easter Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2.\n\n          6. Life expectancy of more than 16 weeks.\n\n          7. Subjects must have the complete set of baseline (screening/baseline) radiographic\n             images, including but not limited to brain, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and bone scans.\n             The images can be accepted if obtained 6 weeks before initiation of ipilimumab.\n\n          8.

If a subject was discontinued from\n             the prior anti-CTLA-4 treatment due to an AE or SAE, regardless of the type of event,\n             that discontinuation constitutes an exclusion criterion. If irAEs were serious enough\n             to require a subject's withdrawal from prior treatment, the subject should be\n             excluded from this study. c) Prior treatment with\n             chemotherapy/biochemotherapy/immunotherapy for systemic disease for melanoma.\n\n          3.
