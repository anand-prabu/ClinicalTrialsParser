Patients will be given\n      direct feedback regarding activity in this brain area while they are undergoing functional\n      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning, and will try to learn to control activity in the\n      region during these feedback sessions.  In separate sessions, patients will be given sham\n      feedback based on the brain patterns of a prior subject rather than their own brain\n      patterns. Our primary hypothesis is that the biofeedback training will reduce their tic\n      symptoms more than the sham feedback."
