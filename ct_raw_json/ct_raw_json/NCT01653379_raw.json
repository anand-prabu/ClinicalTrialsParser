DP001 is a highly potent vitamin D compound.\n\n      In two clinical trials testing DP001 in postmenopausal women, oral DP001 reduced PTH levels\n      in a dose-dependent manner, with a dose of 220 ng lowering PTH by at least 30% in a majority\n      of patients following one or six months of daily dosing.\n\n      This study is an open-label, dose-ranging study of DP001 in ESRD patients with secondary\n      hyperparathyroidism.  Cohorts of up to 6 patients will be enrolled and administered oral\n      DP001 at 110 ng three times per week for four weeks.  Laboratory data from each cohort will\n      be assessed and used to determine a dose for the next cohort.  Up to 5 dose-ranging cohorts\n      will be studied, with the goal of identifying an appropriate dose for a randomized,\n      placebo-controlled study of oral DP001 for 12 weeks.  The data will also be used to select\n      an appropriate dose for an additional cohort of 12 open-label patients in the current study\n      in which the pharmacokinetics of DP001 following a single dose and after repeated doses will\n      be studied."
