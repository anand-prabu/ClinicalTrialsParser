They will be asked to participate in a qualitative interview to describe the newly\n      diagnosed experience (diagnosis through first 10 weeks of treatment) of having a loved one\n      with a malignant brain tumor.\n\n      A convenience sample of 20 patients and their primary caregivers will be enrolled for Phase\n      II of this pilot project. The first ten patients and caregivers enrolled will receive usual\n      care (Phase II, Arm A).

To explore the experience of being a caregiver of a patient newly diagnosed with a\n           malignant brain tumor.\n\n        3. To determine the effect of the PRESENCE Intervention on patient and caregiver distress,\n           anxiety, and depression.\n\n        4. To determine the effect of the PRESENCE Intervention on caregiver reaction (benefit and\n           burden) and caregiver mastery."
