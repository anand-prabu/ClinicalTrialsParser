Identify the dose limiting toxicity and safety profile of COL-3 in these\n      patients. III. Define the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of COL-3 in these patients.\n      IV. Observe any evidence of antitumor activity through standard response criteria or\n      biologic surrogate markers.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive oral COL-3 once daily. Treatment\n      continues in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxic effects. Cohorts of\n      3-6 patients each receive escalating doses of COL-3. Dose escalation to the next level\n      occurs after 3 patients have completed 28 days of treatment without dose limiting toxicity\n      (DLT). Dose escalation continues until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The\n      MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 or more of 6 patients experience DLT.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 30 patients will be accrued within 1 year for this study."
