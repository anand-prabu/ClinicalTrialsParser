Previous studies suggests that dynamic contrast\n      enhanced MRI is ideally suited to show small structures in the eye and eye socket as well as\n      to provide information about the eye socket such as blood circulation. This research may\n      also provide information about the likelihood of the tumor spreading from the eye into other\n      organs as well as correlate the study images with all other clinical imaging"

To determine the feasibility of DCE-MRI (dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance\n      imaging) as non-invasive imaging tool to image contrast enhancement in ocular and orbital\n      tumors.\n\n      II. To compare contrast enhancement and its distribution within orbital tissue. III. To\n      assess potential differences in contrast enhancement which help to characterize malignant\n      lesions as well as discriminate these from benign tissue.\n\n      IV. To compare image characteristics between clinical high field end ex-vivo ultra high\n      field magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.\n\n      V. To correlate imaging findings with obtained histology by comparing contrast enhancement\n      parameters, e.g. maximum signal intensity, to histology characteristics, e.g. vascular\n      density.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients undergo DCE-MRI.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5\n      years."
