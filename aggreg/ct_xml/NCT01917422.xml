      Dengue virus serological reagent, included antigen and antiserum, is a serum test for
      identification of serum antibodies to dengue virus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The developed assay helps to diagnose diseases caused by this virus and to provide
      information on disease epidemiology. This virus is mainly transmitted by mosquito bites to
      people and will make flu-like symptoms, including fever, fatigue, cough and headache, which
      can cause severe hemorrhagic dengue.

        Inclusion Criteria:A total of 95 cases and 100 controls (suspected cases(&gt;50 %) and normal
        subjects) are expected to enroll.

          1. Case group: adults having a medical visit or admission due to dengue / dengue
             hemorrhagic fever / dengue shock syndrome, and medical care of by (defined by CDC).
             Any of the following positive test results for the case of 100 adults.

               1. clinical specimens (blood) isolated and identified dengue virus.

               2. clinical specimens positive for molecular detection of nucleic acids.

               3. serological antigen (referring to non-structural proteins of dengue virus
                  non-structural protein 1, NS1) testing positive (based on the test of Bio-Rad
                  DENGUE NS1 Ag STRIP).

               4. paired serum (restored period and acute phase), the dengue virus specific
                  immunoglobulin M or immunoglobulin G antibodies or negative or â‰§ 4 times
                  increase.

          2. Suspected cases: adults having medical visits or admissions due to infectious
             disease, but their NS1 (based on the test of Bio-Rad DENGUE NS1 Ag STRIP),
             immunoglobulin G,immunoglobulin M, real time-Polymerase chain reaction testing were
             negative.

          3. Control group: adults without having medical visits or admissions due to Fever. -
