Since physiological parameters such as cardiac\n      rhythms, respiratory rate, voice characteristics and actigraphy seem to be related to the\n      onset of a mood episode, information collected through the combined monitoring of multiple\n      selected physiological parameters (such as cardiac rhythms, respiratory rate, movements,\n      voice) during wake and sleep time, using wearable user friendly systems included into\n      garments as well as with a smartphone, may offer a new perspective in the long-term\n      treatment of BD."

Participants meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for bipolar disorder I or II subtypes or\n             Participants meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for rapid cycling BD, which is defined by a\n             pattern of presentation accompanied by 4 or more mood episodes in a 12-month period,\n             with a typical course of mania or hypomania followed by depression or vice versa. The\n             episodes must be demarcated by a full or partial remission lasting at least 2 months\n             or by a switch to a mood state of opposite polarity.\n\n          3. Female participants must agree to use efficient contraceptive methods during the\n             study duration.\n\n          4. Participants must have signed informed consent documents indicating that they\n             understand the purpose and procedures required for the study and are willing to\n             participate in the study and comply with the study procedures and restrictions.\n\n          5. Patients must be affiliated with or a beneficiary of a social security system.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Any clinically relevant acute or chronic diseases which could interfere with the\n             participants' safety during the trial, or expose them to undue risk or which could\n             interfere with the study objective. This last perspective includes :- Attention\n             deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)- Borderline personality disorder (BPD)\n\n          2. Current MDD episode or manic episode, according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria\n\n          3. Current major suicidal ideation (suicidal thoughts several times a day)\n\n          4. History of recent (less than 1 year preceding inclusion) substance abuse or\n             dependence (tobacco dependence excepted)\n\n          5. Pregnant women as determined by the patient or breast-feeding women\n\n          6. Any history of significant allergy.\n\n          7. No legal capacity or limited legal capacity or unable to give an informed consent.\n\n          8. Participants unlikely to co-operate in the study, and/or poor compliance anticipated\n             by the investigator\n\n          9. Participants being in the exclusion period according to the French National File for\n             participants participating in a biomedical research.\n\n         10. Total annual amount of compensation earned from participating in clinical studies\n             exceeding 4500 Euros.\n\n         11. Patients with pacemaker, defibrillator, or any implanted electronic device (to avoid\n             any hazard - see section 7.3.2 of the Psyche device User Manual)."
