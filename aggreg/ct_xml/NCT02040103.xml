  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted to the intensive care unit are at high risk of developing clots in the
      veins of the lower extremities.  The objective of this study is to examine whether the use
      of a device that provides intermittent compression to the legs in addition to the use of
      low-dose blood thinners, provides an additional protection when compared to the use of blood
      thinners alone.  Patients who are admitted to the intensive care unit are receiving low-dose
      blood thinners to prevent clots are candidate for this study.  Patients who are enrolled
      will continue to receive blood thinners but some will additionally receive the leg
      compression.  The additional use of leg compression may provide protection from clots.  The
      main side effect is possible skin abrasions but this is usually mild.  The study is
      sponsored by King Abdullah International Medical Research Center(KAIMRC) and King Abdulaziz
      City for Science and Technology(KACST) and will be conducted in several hospitals in Saudi
      Arabia, Canada, USA, India, and possibly other countries. The study is planned to start on 1
      February 2014 and to continue for 4 years.
