  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Roughly one third of disability pensions issued in Norway are classified as mental and
      behavioral disorders. The proposed study aims to evaluate the effect of an innovative
      intervention for returning people with moderate to severe mental health disorders to work:
      Individual Placement and Support (IPS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current employment schemes offered to this diagnostic group are primarily based on a
      train-and-place principle with assisted or sheltered employment. Building on a
      place-and-train principle, rather, the IPS model of supported employment in real-life
      competitive work settings has proven largely successful in previous studies, but has never
      been tested in this group in the Norwegian context.

    <description>Labor market participation is operationalized as being registered in the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administrations (NAV) State Register of Employers and Employees, and not as a recipient of unemployment or sickness benefits, not receiving work assessment allowance or disability pension with a higher degree of disability than by study inclusion, and registered yearly income.</description>

    <description>Individual Placement and Support (IPS) is a well-defined intervention aiming to help people with disabilities participate in the competitive labor market by working in jobs they prefer with the professional help that they need. IPS actively facilitates job acquisition and provides ongoing support once the client is employed.</description>
