  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a research initiative established to explore the use of magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) as a tool for detecting organ motion as it pertains to planning radiation
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal with radiation therapy is to treat the defined tumor and spare the surrounding
      normal tissue from receiving dose above specified tolerance doses. There is evidence of
      improved local control and survival with higher doses of radiation, however, at the same
      time there is the need to spare normal tissues from higher doses of radiation.  Technologies
      that allow the delivery of an increased radiation dose to the tumor while sparing normal
      tissue have the potential of improving the therapeutic ratio. However, the development of
      these technologies has been hampered by organ respiratory motion particularly in the case of
      the lungs and liver. Inadequate radiation coverage of a tumor secondary to organ motion can
      lead to delivering a lower dose to a portion of the tumor. Making the field of radiation
      larger to account for organ motion results in unnecessary radiation dose to surrounding
      healthy tissues.  It is therefore desirable to document the extent of motion of the organ in
      question prior to carrying out the radiation treatment planning. The organ motion impacts
      directly on the radiation dose distribution in the treatment volume.

    <description>MRI and CT ( all subjects will have  a standard of care CT scan) data in DICOM format will be collected for analysis using commercial or customized - developed software. Image quality will be assessed based on signal-to-noise (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and the presence of image artifacts. Data to be computed include, but are not limited to, tumor volumes (gross tumor volume, internal target volume, planning target volume, etc.), tumor motion parameters (range, trajectory, frequency, variation, probability distribution, etc.), and treatment plan parameters (target coverage, dose-volume-histogram, etc.).</description>
