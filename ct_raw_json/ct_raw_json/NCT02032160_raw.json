Regular use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (by any route of administration\n             including topical) within 6 months of Visit 1 (screening) considered by the study\n             physician as likely to interfere with immune responses.\n\n          5. Receipt of a vaccine within 30 days of visit 2. Other vaccines (e.g. for travel) may\n             be administered between visit 13 and 14 only.\n\n          6. Currently participating in another clinical study with an investigational or\n             non-investigational drug or device, or has participated in a clinical study within\n             the 3 months preceding Visit 1.\n\n          7. Any condition that, in the investigator's opinion, compromises the subject's ability\n             to meet protocol requirements or to complete the study.\n\n          8. Receipt of blood products or immunoglobin, or blood donation, within 3 months of\n             screening.\n\n          9.
