  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare 2 surgical treatments of severe fecal incontinence
      (defined as more than a major leak per week). The hypothesis of this &quot;non-inferiority&quot; trial
      is that magnetic anal sphincter is clinically as effective as SNS, but more cost-effective
      in managing fecal incontinence

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe anal incontinence, defined as the uncontrolled passing of stool at least once a week,
      is a problem that has a serious impact on the quality of life. In the event of failure of
      conservative treatments, surgery can help improve continence problems in a significant
      number of cases.

      Sacral nerve stimulation is currently the standard surgical treatment for severe anal
      incontinence when sphincter repair (sphincteroplasty) is not recommended.

      A new method of treatment based on sphincter reinforcement through the implanting of a band
      of magnetic beads*, has proved to be reliable and efficient on a small series of cases,
      particularly after the failure of sacral nerve stimulation.

      The aim of our trial, which compares the &quot;magnetic anal sphincter* and sacral nerve
      stimulation&quot; in a homogeneous population of patients affected by severe anal incontinence is
      to define the position of this new approach in the treatment algorithm of this functional
      disorder, determining its clinical and medical/economic advantages compared to those of the
      current standard treatment.
