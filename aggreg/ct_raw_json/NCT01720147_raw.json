Current\n      therapies for children with Fanconi anemia (FA) and bone marrow failure, i.e. androgens or\n      bone marrow transplantation, are associated with significant morbidity and mortality.\n\n      This is a pilot study aiming to assess feasibility, toxicity and pharmacokinetics of oral\n      Quercetin therapy in patients with FA. This is a first step towards a clinical study of the\n      efficacy of Quercetin therapy in delaying progression of BMF in FA.\n\n      Additional correlative studies will include assessment of impact of Quercetin on reduction\n      of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), maintenance or improvement of hematopoietic stem cell\n      (HSC) reserve, improvement of hematopoiesis (i.e. peripheral counts) and insulin\n      sensitivity/glucose tolerance.\n\n      This study is an open-label single arm study.\n\n      Funding Source - FDA OOPD"
