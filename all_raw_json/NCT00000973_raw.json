Untreated, the encephalitis is\n      fatal. The best treatment for this disease has not been determined. Presently it is standard\n      practice to administer a combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine. Little is known\n      about the pharmacokinetics of pyrimethamine in patients with AIDS receiving AZT.\n      Furthermore, there are reports that patients already exposed to toxoplasmosis may not have\n      uniform absorption of pyrimethamine."
