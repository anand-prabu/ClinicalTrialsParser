Pts will receive intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in once-daily fractions (Monday through Friday, excluding holidays). A total dose of 70Gy is planned. Pts will be seen weekly during radiation as per standard procedure at MSKCC. Approximately 3 months after completion of radiation, radiologic response assessment will be performed as per our standard guideline. This will include a FDG PET/CT scan, as well as a recommended cross-sectional imaging of the primary tumor (with CT scan &/or MRI).
