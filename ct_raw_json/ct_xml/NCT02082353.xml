  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an inherited immune system abnormality in which bone
      marrow transplantation has been shown to be curative. However the risks of transplantation
      are high and not all patients with CGD may need to undergo this high risk procedure.  This
      study will determine the long term medical condition and daily functioning of patients with
      CGD after a transplant and if possible, compare these results to patients who do not undergo
      a transplant.

      This multi-center study combines a longitudinal and cross-sectional evaluation (both retro
      and prospectively) of subjects with confirmed CGD who have already received  hematopoietic
      cell transplant (HCT) since 1995 or who will receive HCT during the study period. This study
      will investigate which subjects benefit most from HCT, and the overall outcomes in CGD
      patients with and without transplant. The study aims to identify variables contributing to
      best outcomes of HCT in subjects with CGD.

                       below); AND Clinical history consistent with CGD (see B below).

                       *************************************************************************

                       Patients must have BOTH &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;:

                       A. Function: Assays of NADPH Oxidase Function

                       I. Dihydrorhodamine (DHR) Assay:

                         -  Blood sample was obtained at a time when patient was clinically stable
                            and not critically ill, with control samples performed simultaneously
                            indicating a qualified assay; and

                         -  Assay unequivocally demonstrates CGD with an SI &lt; 35 or equivalent.
                            Assay report, including mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) from
                            unstimulated and stimulated samples and gating strategy, must be
                            de-identified and provided. OR

                       II. Nitroblue Tetrazolium Oxidation Test (NBT):

                       o Diagnostic of CGD (reported as reduced granulocyte oxidative response).
                       Report must be de-identified and provided. AND

                       B. Clinical History: One or More of the Following:

                         -  Severe and/or recurrent infection (liver, perirectal or lung abscess;
                            pneumonia; adenitis; or osteomyelitis) due to, for example,
                            Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia sp, Serratia marcescens,
                            non-albicans Candida sp, Aspergillus sp or other mold; or Nocardia sp
                            or other deep tissue infection characteristic of CGD

                         -  Sterile granulomatous disease in respiratory, gastrointestinal or
                            urogenital tracts; or Crohn's disease-like colitis

                         -  A family history consistent with either X-linked or autosomal
                            recessive CGD

                       In cases where either functional assay (A) or history (B) is equivocal, one
                       or more of the following may be used to confirm a diagnosis of CGD:

                       C. Absent or significantly reduced in expression or abnormal size of any of
                       the 5 phox components (gp91 phox, p47 phox, p22 phox, p67phox, and p40phox)
                       of NADPH oxidase, by either:

                         -  Western blot

                         -  Northern blot OR D. Mutation in a gene encoding one of the 5 phox
                            components (gp91 phox, p47 phox, p22 phox, p67 phox, and p40 phox) of
                            NADPH oxidase that is predictive of a decreased or absent oxidative
                            burst. (Nonsense, frameshift, or previously described missense
                            mutation associated with CGD).

                       Molecular Diagnosis is Desirable In addition, molecular diagnosis (gene
                       sequencing and expression analysis) of CGD is desirable and should be
                       performed when possible.

                    2. Further Characterization of Oxidase Level, Longitudinal Study, Prospective
                       Cohort Patients who are to undergo transplantation during the study period
                       must be further characterized as oxidase-null or oxidase positive by level
                       of oxidase production by either:

                         -  DHR assay stimulation Index: where SI ≤ 2.5 will be classified as
                            oxidase-null CGD. Those with SI &gt; 2.5 will be classified as oxidase
                            positive CGD. A single validated test that is accepted by the PID-CGD
                            Review Panel is adequate, but testing on two occasions for validation
                            is desirable. OR

                         -  Ferricytochrome C reduction assay of granulocytes with O2 &lt; 2.3 nmoles
                            /106 cells/h classifed as oxidase-null CGD. A single validated test
                            that is accepted by the PID-CGD Review Panel is adequate, but testing
                            on two occasions for validation is desirable.

                       OR

                       o Genetic sequencing reporting a mutation that is unequivocally associated
                       to absent oxidase production. (e.g. null mutations) will be classified as
                       oxidase-null CGD (See discussion in Appendix I for how family history,
                       genotype and CGD mutation information will be applied to assigning patients
                       lacking any quantitative oxidase activity measurements to residual
                       oxidase-null or residual oxidase-positive groups).

                    3. Longitudinal Study, Retrospective Cohort Patients who have already been
                       transplanted will be included regardless of whether further
                       characterization by oxidase level (or genotype/mutation data) is possible
                       or not.

               -  Non-Transplanted CGD Patients with Birth Year In or After 1988 A non-transplant
                  (conventional therapy) group of GGD subjects will be enrolled in the
                  longitudinal study. The non-transplant subjects will be selected from the
                  potentially eligible (retrospective) patient cohort with diagnosis of CGD
                  treated with conventional non-transplant therapy. Participating sites will enter
                  their entire retrospective cohort of CGD patients having birth year in or after
                  1988 into the registration cohort for this protocol. Baseline for both
                  non-transplant subjects and HCT subjects for the purpose of comparing survival
                  will be the year of birth. However, for non-transplant subjects, many of the
                  detailed analyses such as infection and autoimmune complication rates will be
                  assessed in the year preceding the date of last contact.

          -  Participant Inclusion Criteria (Part 2 - Cross-Sectional Analysis) To participate in
             the Cross-Sectional Analysis, patients must have previously been enrolled into the
             Longitudinal Analysis of Protocol 6903. All transplanted subjects in the
             Cross-Sectional Analysis are surviving and shall have at least 3 years of follow-up
             post-transplant to be included. Non-transplanted CGD subjects will become eligible
             for consideration for the Cross-Sectional Analysis if they were eligible and enrolled
             in the retrospective cohort of the Longitudinal Analysis, and if/when they are &gt; 3
             years post-diagnosis of CGD. Provision of written informed consent will be required
             for inclusion in the Cross-Sectional Analysis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant Exclusion Criteria (Longitudinal and Cross- Sectional Analyses)

               -  Presence of other primary immunodeficiency syndromes that do not meet the
                  clinical and laboratory criteria for CGD.

               -  Rac2 Deficiency

               -  MPO Deficiency

               -  Glutathione deficiency

               -  Leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome

          -  Non-transplant subjects:

               -  The above exclusions pertain.

               -  In addition, non-transplant subjects will be excluded if the only assessment of
                  oxidase function available is the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test (a
                  non-quantitative test).
