            "textblock": "Consistent with NIH priorities, our long-term objective is to reduce the rates and risk of\n      childhood obesity via school-based nutrition and physical activity policies. We propose to\n      monitor and evaluate how Connecticut's first-ranked School Wellness Policy, in the New Haven\n      Public School district, is implemented and determine its impact on children's obesogenic\n      behaviors, weight outcomes, and school performance.  We will evaluate a strategy of\n      implementation at 12 targeted schools using a randomized design. Focusing on targeted\n      schools will enable a more rigorous evaluation of School Wellness Policy implementation,\n      barriers/facilitators, and ultimately the behavioral and health impacts of school-based\n      policies on childhood obesity. We propose a multi-level assessment of factors that may\n      influence childhood obesity using the Ecological Model as a guiding framework.\n\n      Thus we propose a multi-sectoral, multi-level approach, focused on children, families,\n      schools, and community. This ambitious project is possible because of the expertise and\n      strong collaborative partnerships between The New Haven Public Schools and two Yale\n      University research centers: The Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity and CARE: Community\n      Alliance for Research and Engagement. Our partnership builds on Principles and Guidelines\n      for Community-University Research Partnerships developed by a 12-member committee of\n      community and university leaders and endorsed by Yale University and community partners in\n      2009.\n\n      This study is designed to significantly advance empirical research on school wellness\n      policies:  focused on implementation and measurable impact on student health. No matter how\n      well written, a school wellness policy must be effectively implemented to achieve its\n      potential impact. Further, students within schools represent only two components of a larger\n      socio-ecological system that influences eating behavior, physical activity, and weight\n      status. The federal mandate for school wellness policies requires districts to address many\n      aspects of the school environment (e.g., nutrition education, nutrition standards for foods\n      sold, and opportunities for physical activity). To maximize improvements, this type of\n      multi-component policy is needed. However, this complexity makes it difficult to evaluate\n      policy impact and draw conclusions about the causal relationships between specific policies\n      and student health. With our team's unique strengths and these challenges in mind, we\n      designed this research study with the following Specific Aims:\n\n        1. Track and evaluate a strategy of targeted implementation of a School Wellness Policy.\n\n        2. Identify factors that facilitate or impede implementation of The School Wellness\n           Policy, including neighborhood, school, and student determinants; and\n\n        3. Evaluate the impact of implementation of The School Wellness Policy on obesogenic\n           behaviors and health outcomes as well as school performance.\n\n      We will collaborate with the District to implement a subset of nutrition and physical\n      activity policies in 12 schools using a randomized 2 x 2 research design. This will permit\n      comparison of the potential unique and synergistic effects of these nutrition and physical\n      activity policies on student behaviors and related health outcomes. We will follow a cohort\n      of 5th grade students (N\u2248700) annually for four years to assess potential changes to student\n      eating behaviors, physical activity levels, and BMI. We use a multi-method approach to\n      collect data and examine predictors of these outcomes from across levels of the\n      socio-ecological framework: student variables, family characteristics, school policies, and\n      neighborhood features.\n\n      This multidisciplinary proposal is synchronous with specific research objectives articulated\n      in Program Announcement (PA-10-052) School Nutrition and Physical Activity Policies,\n      Obesogenic Behaviors and Weight Outcomes. As noted, few studies to date have examined the\n      policy implementation process.  We directly target the implementation and impact of\n      health-related policies in schools, measuring obesogenic behaviors and BMI as primary\n      outcomes. We have an active tracking system to monitor impact of policies, and we focus on\n      minority populations traditionally vulnerable and underserved.  As stated by NIH in this\n      program announcement, policy-based approaches to combat obesity in schools exist; however,\n      knowledge is lacking in key areas concerning the optimal policies, key implementation\n      strategies for such policies, and the impact of these policies on important health and\n      social outcomes. The proposed project will advance scientific knowledge and understanding in\n      this arena and provide important evidence to guide future interventions in schools and\n      communities translating science to improved health of the public."
