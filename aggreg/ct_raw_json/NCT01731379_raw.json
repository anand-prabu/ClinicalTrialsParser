Optical spectroscopy enables the\n      possibility to specifically differentiate between different (human) tissues. The hypothesis\n      is that incorporation of this technique into existing medical devices (e.g. medical blade)\n      would enlarge the accuracy and reliability of these devices. Sparing of nerve bundles during\n      surgery can lead to decreased postoperative morbidity rates."
