            "textblock": "Peanut allergy is a common allergy in the United States, with a prevalence in the general\n      population as high as 1%. So far, there is no approved treatment of peanut allergy. Peanut\n      allergy management is based on strict peanut avoidance and injectable epinephrine after the\n      allergic systemic reactions have started. Specific Immunotherapy methods currently available\n      have shown some limitations in their use because of safety issues. Hence, there is an\n      important unmet medical need for efficient and safe treatment of peanut allergy.\n\n      DBV Technologies has developed an epicutaneous delivery system, called Viaskin, a method\n      based on delivering precise quantity of the allergen on the upper layers of the skin.\n      Avoiding contact between the allergen and the bloodstream should confer to epicutaneous\n      immunotherapy (EPIT) a higher level of safety as systemic reactions should be circumvented\n\n      The OLFUS-VIPES study is an open-label follow-up study for subjects who previously were\n      randomized and have completed the VIPES efficacy and safety study. Subjects will be offered\n      enrollment in this follow-up study to receive an additional 24 months of Viaskin Peanut\n      treatment followed by a period of 2 months without treatment while maintaining a peanut-free\n      diet.\n\n      The trial will be conducted at the same sites as the VIPES study with investigators and\n      staff trained and experienced in the diagnosis and the management of peanut allergy and\n      anaphylaxis, and who are capable of performing a double-blind placebo-controlled food\n      challenge (DBPCFC) in adult and/or pediatric subjects.\n\n      Subjects entering the OLFUS-VIPES study who had previously received Viaskin Peanut at any of\n      the three doses in the VIPES study will continue at the same dose (i.e. 50 mcg or 100 mcg or\n      250 mcg of peanut protein). Subjects entering the OLFUS-VIPES study who had previously\n      received placebo in the VIPES study will be re-randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive\n      Viaskin Peanut at one of the three doses of peanut protein. The study will remain blinded\n      for all subjects until the VIPES study is unblinded.Once analyses of the VIPES study have\n      been completed and the optimal clinical dose has been demonstrated, the initial treatment\n      groups will be unblinded. It is planned that all subjects in the OLFUS-VIPES study will be\n      switched to this optimal clinical dose of Viaskin Peanut. From this stage onwards, the study\n      will continue in a full open-label manner at one dose. All subjects completing the\n      OLFUS-VIPES study should receive overall 24 months of active treatment followed by a period\n      of 2 months without treatment for those subjects being assessed for sustained\n      unresponsiveness."
