This blood may be used in the future to treat the child if he/she turns out to be\n      HIV-positive.\n\n      Blood from the umbilical cord contains a certain kind of cell called a stem cell. Stem cells\n      eventually turn into one of the many types of blood cells. If HIV infection can be prevented\n      in these stem cells, then, when these stem cells are injected back into the infant, the new\n      cells that develop will also be protected from HIV. This study will provide the blood needed\n      to test whether this type of gene therapy is safe and effective."

            "textblock": "Gene therapy may provide a new therapeutic approach to pediatric AIDS. Putting an\n      HIV-resistant gene into umbilical cord blood stem cells and transplanting the cells back\n      into the patient could lead to the production of cells that resist HIV infection. If a\n      patient's cells could be engineered to be resistant to supporting the growth of HIV-1, the\n      cells may have improved survival in the presence of HIV-1. To date, an umbilical cord blood\n      bank for HIV-positive deliveries has not been established in the United States. This\n      protocol establishes a repository of banked umbilical cord blood as a first step toward the\n      potential application of gene therapy for the treatment of HIV-infected infants.\n\n      HIV-infected mothers have about 20 ml of blood drawn to test for infectious diseases (e.g.,\n      hepatitis).  At time of delivery maternal HIV viral load is measured.  After delivery, about\n      60 ml of blood is collected from the umbilical cord; this blood is labeled and transferred\n      to the umbilical cord blood bank for possible use in future gene therapy studies on the\n      infant.  At birth, infant HIV status and general health are assessed.  If the infant is\n      found to be HIV-infected, the mother may be approached about the infant's participation in a\n      future gene therapy study. If the infant is not HIV-infected, the cord blood is stored for\n      up to four years and is then released to the mother, or, with her consent, to the research\n      community."
