Attaining a positive surgical margin is also possible. Endoscopic full-thickness\n      resection (EFTR) can be used for tumor resection by direct visualization of the tumor from\n      inside the stomach lumen leading to a free surgical margin with little resection of healthy\n      tissue. In order to overcome current endoscopic technical limitations, we will combine the\n      conventional laparoscopic approach with EFTR."
