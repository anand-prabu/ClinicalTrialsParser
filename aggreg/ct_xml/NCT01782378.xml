    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if an experimental treatment can help thinking
      ability, and memory in Veterans with Gulf War Veterans Illnesses (GWVI). The experimental
      treatment is called transcranial, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), that are applied outside the
      skull, to the head.  The LEDs are applied to three sets of placements on the head.  Each
      placement set is treated for 6 and a half minutes.  The participants receive a series of LED
      treatments which take place as outpatient visits at the VA Boston Healthcare System, Jamaica
      Plain Campus.  The LEDs contain red and near-infrared diodes.  The FDA considers the LED
      device used here, to be a non-significant risk device. The LEDs do not produce heat.

      Rationale:

      The rational for using red and near-infrared LEDs is two-fold: 1) These wavelengths have
      been shown to improve ATP production, especially in hypoxic or compromised cells.  2) Recent
      studies in humans have also shown an increase in regional cerebral blood flow subjacent to
      where the near-infrared LEDs were placed on the scalp (Schiffer et al., 2009; Nawashiro et
      al., 2012).

      General Explanation of the Light-Emitting Diode (LED) Treatment Procedure:

      The LED treatments take place as outpatient visits at the VA Boston Healthcare System
      (VABHS) Jamaica Plain Campus (JP Campus), 150 South Huntington Ave., Boston, MA, 02130.

      The Transcranial LED treatment procedure is painless, non-invasive and no heat is generated.
      It involves placing a lightweight helmet on the head.  The helmet contains some
      light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Some of the LEDs are in the visible range of light that one
      can see (red wavelengths of light); some of the LEDs are not visible (near-infrared
      wavelengths of light). The participant will be asked to wear some goggles/glasses during
      each LED treatment. These goggles/glasses will block out the red wavelengths of light, so
      that the participant will not be aware of when the lights are on, or off.

      During some of the LED treatments, the lights are turned on. During some of the LED
      treatments, the lights are not turned on. All participants who are part of this study will
      receive some LED treatments when the LED lights are turned on.

      The participant will not feel anything when the LED lights are on; it is a painless,
      noninvasive treatment procedure. There are small fans built into the LED helmet (to assist
      in cooling). The participant will always hear the fans, during each LED treatment, whether
      the LEDs are on, or they are not on.

      There are 3 sequential parts to each LED treatment visit, while the LED helmet is on the
      head:

      Part 1:  The LEDs in the center of the helmet are on for 6 and a half minutes; then turned
      off.

      Part 2:  The LEDs in the right side of the helmet are on for 6 and a half minutes; then off.

      Part 3:  The LEDs in the left side of the helmet are on for 6 and a half minutes; then off.

      The entire treatment with the LED helmet in place on the head is about 20 minutes, per
      treatment visit. There is no potential for eye damage, because LED light is not a laser
      light.

      The participant will remain in street clothes, and will be treated in a soft recliner chair.
      Each visit lasts about 35 to 45 minutes, allowing time for record keeping.

      No liquids or gel are used to hold the LEDs in place on the head. Each participant will be
      provided with his/her own clear plastic liner for the LED helmet. This clear plastic liner
      will be assigned to each participant, and only used by that participant. It will be kept in
      a locked filing cabinet in the treatment room, and discarded after the participant's
      completion of the study.

      There are 15 visits in each LED treatment series; and each participant will participate in
      two LED treatment series. Each LED treatment series lasts for 7.5 weeks. Each LED treatment
      visit is scheduled twice per week, with at least 48 hours between each visit.

      All appointments are scheduled ahead, for a specific day and time of day, at the convenience
      of the participant. If the participant needs to miss an appointment, that appointment will
      be re-scheduled. However, if the participant misses more than 1 appointment in a row, over a
      two-week period, he/she will be withdrawn from the study. This is because it is very
      important to treat at least two times per week for the 7.5 weeks, until all 15 LED
      treatments have been completed, in each of the two LED treatment series.

      The length of time for participation in the actual treatment portion of this study is four
      months (two treatment periods of about two months, each).  The total time of participation
      including pre- testing, and final follow-up testing at 2 months after the last LED treatment
      visit, is about 6 months.

      This study is sponsored by the Department of Veterans Affairs, Clinical Science Research and
      Development. There are no potential conflicts of interest associated with this research.

      Referral and Screening of Potential Participants:

      As mentioned in a separate section on Subjects and Inclusion Criteria, the participants for
      this study are referred by Maxine Krengel, PhD, a Neuropsychologist who has been following
      Veterans in the New England region who had been deployed to Kuwait in 1990-91. As part of
      Dr. Krengel's current research project (funded by the Department of Defense) participants
      will have answered 'Yes' to the following questions: 1) Difficulty concentrating; and/or 2)
      Difficulty remembering recent information.

      After referral to this study by Dr. Krengel, the potential participant is contacted by
      telephone, and a description of the full study protocol is explained, including that three
      blood draws are involved, as well as the time required, and reimbursement for time and
      effort. After the initial contact by telephone, an initial visit to the VABHS, JP campus may
      be scheduled with Dr. Naeser , the PI, or someone on her staff. At this time, the entire
      study will be explained and questions answered. If the potential participant wishes to do
      so, he/she may sign the Informed Consent Form (ICF) at this first visit.

      After the ICF has been signed, an appointment is then scheduled for Neuropsychological
      Screening testing. These tests measure the ability to think and remember recent information.
      If results from the Neuropsychological Screening tests show that the potential participant
      is eligible for entry into this study, an additional appointment is scheduled where
      Additional Neuropsychological Testing is performed, and Additional Health Information is
      obtained.

      The Additional Neuropsychological Tests also measure the ability to think and remember
      recent information. These tests take place at the VABHS, JP. They are administered by Dr.
      Krengel or her staff, and they require a two-hour visit.

      During the same two-hour visit, Additional Health Information (paper and pencil) is acquired
      in the following areas: 1) any pain experienced on a regular basis; 2) fatigue that is
      experienced on a regular basis; 3) mood (including depression); and 4) questions regarding
      health - for example, how often in the past 30 days symptoms may have been present from each
      of nine body systems:  cardiac, pulmonary, dermatological, gastrointestinal, genitourinary,
      musculoskeletal, neurological, and psychological.

      The Additional Neuropsychological Tests (and the Additional Health Information) are each
      acquired four times during participation in the study:

      Time 1)  Within 1 or 2 weeks before the 1st LED Treatment

      Time 2)  Within 1 week after the 15th LED treatment in the First Series of LED Treatments

      Time 3)  Within 1 week after the 15th LED treatment in the Second Series of LED Treatments

      Time 4)  At 2 months after the 15th LED treatment in the Second Series of LED Treatments

      Three Blood Draws

      Blood samples (venipuncture from the participant's arm) will be taken at three time points
      during participation in the study. Each blood draw involves one visit to a Quest Lab located
      near the participant's home or place of work.

      Time Schedule for Blood Draws:

      Time 1)  Within 1 or 2 weeks before the 1st LED Treatment

      Time 2)  Within 1 week after the 15th LED treatment, in the 1st LED Treatment Series (7.5
      Weeks)

      Time 3)  Within 1 week after the 15th LED treatment, in the 2nd LED Treatment Series (7.5
      Weeks)

      In summary, there are a total of 4 visits for the areas of &quot;Additional Neuropsychological
      Tests and Additional Health Information,&quot; and 3 visits to a Quest Lab for the Blood Tests.

      Statistical Analyses and Power Statement:

      There will be two groups of participants, 80 participants per group.

      A score for each of 3 cognitive domains will be analyzed pre- and post- LED intervention:

        1. Attention/Executive Function: Digit Span Subtests (WAIS-IV; Wechsler, 2008);
           Trail-Making Test (Delis, Kaplan, Kramer, 2001); and Stroop Test (&quot;Color-Word&quot; test)
           (Delis, Kaplan, Kramer, 2001)

        2. Learning and Memory: California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II; Delis, Kramer,
           Kaplan, &amp; Ober, 2000)

        3. Psychomotor/Visual Spatial;  Continuous Performance Test (Administered on computer;
           RVisual CPT, NES3) (Letz &amp; Baker, 1988; Rosvold et al., 1956); Rey Osterrieth Complex
           Figure Test (ROCF) (Knight &amp; Kaplan, 2004)

      Power Analysis:

      Power was computed under the following assumptions for ANOVA: a) alpha = .05 (1-tail); b) to
      establish clinical relevance, Cohen's large effect size (.25) was used. Power = .86 to
      detect a significant between-group difference in change from Baseline to end of Treatment
      for an interim analysis.
