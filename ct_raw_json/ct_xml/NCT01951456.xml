    <description>Participants will attend two, 45-60-minute progressive, moderate intensity resistance training sessions per week for 12 weeks. The program will maintain a format of a 5-minute warm-up, 35-50 minutes of resistance training and a 5-minute cool-down with flexibility and abdominal exercises.</description>

    <description>Participants in the control group will be required to attend the exact same number of sessions as those in the Resistance Training group. Each session will last approximately 45-60 minutes. Sessions will include a practical component/demonstration, an informational video, and a handout on a pertinent healthy lifestyle topic for adults.</description>
