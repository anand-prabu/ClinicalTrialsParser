Having a peripheral\n      stem cell transplant to replace the blood-forming cells destroyed by chemotherapy, allows\n      higher doses of chemotherapy to be given so that more plasma cells are killed. By reducing\n      the number of plasma cells, the disease may progress more slowly.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving high-dose melphalan together with\n      peripheral stem cell transplant works in treating patients with primary amyloidosis or\n      amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma."

Patients\n      receive high-dose melphalan on 2 consecutive days, followed by 1 day of rest, then by PBSC\n      transplantation. G-CSF is given from 1 day after transplantation until the neutrophil count\n      is greater than 1,500 for 3 consecutive days.\n\n      Patients are followed at 100 days and 1 year post-transplant.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A very small number of patients are expected to be accrued over 5-10\n      years."
