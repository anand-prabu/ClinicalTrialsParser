Various methods are available for sedation during this procedure. Because\n      of some side effects related to intravenous administration of sedatives, oral administration\n      of these drugs is under attention. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine which is used mainly in\n      treatment of anxiety. Hence, we determine the efficacy of oral and sublingual alprazolam as\n      for sedation during this procedure. We hypothesize that sublingual alprazolam is more\n      effective than that oral form and both forms more effective than placebo in reducing anxiety\n      and pain/discomfort related to the procedure."
