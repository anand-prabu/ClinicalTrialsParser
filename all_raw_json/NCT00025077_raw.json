Giving a chemotherapy drug before surgery or radiation therapy\n      may shrink the tumor so that it can be removed during surgery or radiation therapy.\n      Peripheral stem cell transplant may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by\n      chemotherapy or radiation therapy and allow doctors to give higher doses of chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well combination chemotherapy followed by\n      surgery or radiation therapy and peripheral stem cell transplant work in treating patients\n      with recurrent medulloblastoma or primitive neuroectodermal and pineal tumors."

Treatment repeats after discontinuation of G-CSF for 2-4\n           courses. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested after each course of\n           cyclophosphamide. Patients undergo surgical resection or radiotherapy after the\n           completion of chemotherapy. Patients achieving complete response proceed to\n           myeloablative therapy.\n\n        -  Myeloablative Phase: Patients receive thiotepa IV over 3 hours on days 1-3. Autologous\n           PBSC are reinfused on day 5 and patients receive G-CSF SC once daily beginning on day\n           10 and continuing until blood counts recover. Beginning 2 days after the completion of\n           G-CSF, patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Autologous PBSC are\n           reinfused on day 5 and patients receive G-CSF SC once daily beginning on day 10 and\n           continuing until blood counts recover.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years."
