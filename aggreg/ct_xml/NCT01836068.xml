      To find out if it is possible for HIV-1 patients to maintain antiretroviral medications
      during allogeneic bone marrow transplant
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Determine the feasibility of maintaining optimal ART in HIV-1 infected patients during
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).  The primary outcome is the fraction
      of patients who maintain any form of anti-retroviral therapy, including enfuvirtide
      monotherapy, through day 60 post-transplant.  If patients are unable to take oral
      anti-retroviral medications, but are able to tolerate subcutaneous enfuvirtide monotherapy
      this will be considered maintenance of ART.  Failure to maintain ART will be defined as ≥ 24
      hours without any anti-retroviral therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infection, as documented by a rapid HIV-1 test or any FDA-approved HIV-1 enzyme
             or chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit and confirmed by western blot at
             any time prior to study entry.  Alternatively, two HIV-1 RNA values &gt; 200 copies/mL
             at least 24 hours apart performed by any laboratory that has CLIA certification, or
             its equivalent may be used to document infection.

          -  Patients must be ≥ 18 years of age.

          -  Plan to undergo a Myeloablative, HLA matched or partially HLA-mismatched
             (haploidentical), related-donor bone marrow transplantation that includes high-dose
             posttransplantation Cy using bone marrow from a related donor:

          -  Plan to undergo a Nonmyeloablative, HLA matched or partially HLA-mismatched,
             related-donor bone marrow transplantation that includes high-dose posttransplantation

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Patients with a known history of enfuvirtide resistance will not be eligible for this
        trial.
