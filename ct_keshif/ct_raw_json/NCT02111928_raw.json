For NovaTears the performance claimed is lubrication of the eye surface, stabilization of the tear film and relieve of symptoms associated with dry eye. These parameters are operationalized by multiple ophthalmological assessment which are part of routine ophthalmologic examinations including tear fluid volume as determined by the Schirmer I test, stability of the tear film as determined by Tear Film Break-Up Time and relieve of symptoms as determined by subjective patient symptom severity questionnaires and objective assessments of the corneal and conjunctival epithelia.",
