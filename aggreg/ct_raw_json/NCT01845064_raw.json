In addition, the effect of the\n      compound on the body will be investigated (this is called pharmacodynamics).\n\n      This study is not intended to improve anyone's health, but is necessary for the further\n      development of DM199.\n\n      The study consists of 4 parts. Each part (A, B, C and D) will consist of one or several\n      periods.
