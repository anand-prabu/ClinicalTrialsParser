In\n      general, conservative treatment is the initial option of choice for patients with PFPS,\n      however, the lack of a specific causal factor makes it difficult to choose the best\n      treatment so early. This way, the purpose of this study is investigate the effects of the\n      quadriceps femoris strengthening versus hamstring stretching in patients with\n      pattellofemoral pain."
