For lamivudine\n      (LAM), the rtM204V/I and rtL180M mutations occur in more than 70% after 5 years of therapy.\n      In Korea, primarily owing to limited subsidization policy in the health insurance system,\n      many patients with LMV-resistance had been treated with either rescue ADV or ETV 1.0 mg\n      monotherapy, ultimately leading to the higher prevalence of MDR strain. For those patients,\n      rescue therapies of combining ADV with either ETV or LAM had been tried, but frequently with\n      suboptimal responses. Rescue TDF monotherapy or TDF-based combination therapy are available\n      in Korea for patients who had \"difficult-to-treat\" antiviral resistance owing to prior\n      treatment failures. However, which is the better has not been evaluated yet. A long-term\n      efficacy and safety of TDF-based rescue therapies in real practice for those patients should\n      be necessary to revise the Korean guideline for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in near\n      future."
