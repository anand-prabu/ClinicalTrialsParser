This study included a majority of cardiac surgery patients. Others studies have\n      suggested that the beneficial effect of insulin-based tight perioperative glycemic control\n      might be hampered by iatrogenic hypoglycemia. Moreover, insulin therapy failed to obtain\n      perioperative glycemic stability in most patients.\n\n      Exenatide (Byetta \u00ae) is an incretin mimetic, characterized by an anti-hyperglycemic effect\n      that depends on the blood glucose level.\n\n      We hypothesize that continuous intravenous infusion of exenatide could improve perioperative\n      glycemic control and stability and could reduce the risk of iatrogenic hypoglycemia compared\n      to a conventional insulin therapy during the perioperative period of cardiac surgery."
