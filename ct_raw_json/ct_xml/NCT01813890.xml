  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of tapentadol
      immediate-release (IR [CG5503]) for use in the relief of moderate to severe acute pain,
      compared with placebo, in adult Taiwanese patients with acute pain following bunionectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing bunionectomy (a surgical procedure to remove a bunion, an enlargement of
      the joint at the base of the big toe comprised of bone and soft tissue) often experience
      moderate to severe acute pain post-surgery. Normally such pain is controlled when patients
      receive repeated doses of opioid analgesics. Tapentadol (CG5503) is a newly synthesized
      opioid drug acting as a centrally acting analgesic like opioid analgesics but has a
      different mode of action. This study, a randomized (patients are assigned different
      treatments based on chance), double-blind (neither investigator nor patient knows which
      treatment the patient receives), placebo-controlled (placebo is an inactive substance that
      is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect in a clinical trial),
      parallel-group (each group of patients will be treated at the same time), multicenter study
      (the study is performed at more than one clinic) is designed to evaluate the effectiveness
      (level of pain control) and safety (side effects) of tapentadol immediate-release (IR) 50 mg
      or 75 mg versus placebo. The study will consist of a screening phase, during which the
      patients will be evaluated for study entry (Days -28 to -2) followed by the surgical period
      (Day -1) during which the bunionectomy will be performed and which will start with the first
      surgical incision and continues until termination of the popliteal sciatic block (PSB)
      infusion. During the qualification period (Day 1) which starts after termination of the
      post-operative continuous PSB infusion, patients will be evaluated for entry in the double
      blind treatment phase. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups
      to receive either 50 mg tapentadol IR, 75 mg tapentadol IR or a placebo if their PI is equal
      to or greater than 4 on a 0-10 numerical rating scale. The inpatient double-blind treatment
      period will be 72 hours in duration and will include a final end-of-double-blind evaluation
      (on Day 4, i.e., 72 hours after the administration of the first dose) for all patients. Any
      patient requiring analgesia for pain relief in addition to study drug during the
      double-blind treatment period will be discontinued from the study due to lack of efficacy.
      All patients who discontinue for lack of efficacy will complete pain assessments and the
      Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) before receiving rescue medication. Pain
      intensity and pain relief will be periodically assessed during the treatment period using
      rating scales. Safety evaluations include monitoring of adverse events, physical
      examinations, and clinical laboratory tests. The study length, including the screening
      period, will be up to a maximum duration of 32 days.

    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The SPID48 score incorporates the cumulative analgesic effects of tapentadol IR on pain intensity over an extended period allowing an evaluation of multiple doses of drug, even when dosing frequency may vary. Scoring is derived from the Numerical Rating Scale where 0 represents &quot;No pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;Pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. A positive difference between mean SPID48 for an active study drug and placebo would indicate a numerically larger analgesic effect for patients dosed with active study drug than in the placebo group. A higher value in SPID indicates greater pain reduction.</description>

    <time_frame>at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Total pain relief (PAR) is calculated on a 5-point Numeric Rating Scale. Patients indicate how much relief they had from the starting pain on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 represents &quot;no relief&quot; and 4 represents &quot;complete relief&quot;.</description>

    <time_frame>at 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The SPRID is calculated using the formula: SPRID equals SPID plus TOTPAR.</description>

    <description>The PGIC scale indicates the patient's overall status. Patients' PGIC is assessed on a 7-point Numerical Rating Scale where 1 represents &quot;very much improved&quot; and 7 represents &quot;very much worse&quot;.</description>

    <description>Pain Intensity will be calculated using an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale. Patients are asked to rate their current pain intensity on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 represents &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;pain as bad you can imagine&quot;.</description>
