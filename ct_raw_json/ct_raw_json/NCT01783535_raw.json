The main biology\n      objective is to improve our understanding of the biology and tumorigenesis (how tumor\n      develops) of retinoblastoma when biology specimens are available. As clinicians, the primary\n      goal of the investigators for children with retinoblastoma is to provide optimal therapy\n      using multiple treatment approaches [chemotherapy (into the vein and directly into membrane\n      of eyeball), cryotherapy (freeze and destroy tumor), thermotherapy (laser or heat to destroy\n      tumor), radiation therapy, and surgical removal of eye if needed) in an attempt to preserve\n      the eye and vision whenever possible, while still curing the disease. Therefore, all\n      children with non-metastatic retinoblastoma at St. Jude will be offered enrollment on this\n      study.\n\n      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\n        -  To evaluate the response (complete + partial response) rate of bilateral disease\n           participants who have at least one eye with advanced intraocular retinoblastoma\n           (Stratum B) to two upfront courses of therapy consisting of subconjunctival carboplatin\n           and systemic topotecan.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n        -  To evaluate the ocular survival of eyes and event-free survival of participants by\n           strata.\n\n        -  To prospectively analyze intraocular disease tissue for participants with at least one\n           eye undergoing enucleation in order to identify the mechanism of RB1 bi-allelic\n           inactivation. Participants may undergo upfront enucleation (due to advanced disease at\n           diagnosis) or may receive enucleation due to progressive disease during protocol\n           therapy."

Adjuvant therapy will be based on\n      histopathology:\n\n        -  low risk participants:  Participants in whom the enucleated eye does not show\n           extra-retinal disease (see definition of intermediate and high risk below); will not\n           receive any additional treatment.\n\n        -  intermediate risk participants:  Participants in whom the enucleated eye shows presence\n           of tumor in the anterior chamber, invasion of the ciliary body/iris, massive invasion\n           of the choroid, and invasion of the optic nerve beyond the lamina cribrosa with\n           concomitant invasion of the choroid, will receive 4 courses of adjuvant chemotherapy\n           with vincristine-carboplatin-doxorubicin (VCD).\n\n        -  high risk participants: Participants in whom the enucleated eye shows involvement of\n           the sclera, or involvement of the optic nerve at the level of the cut-end, will be\n           treated with 6 courses of chemotherapy, with alternating courses of VCE and VCD.\n\n        -  High-risk participants with extra-ocular extension (i.e. tumor extending beyond the\n           sclera/cornea or beyond the cut end of the optic nerve) will be candidates for\n           external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to the entire orbit, including the optic nerve,\n           administered after 2 or 3 courses of treatment. Patients with extra-ocular extension\n           may be considered for enrollment on an alternative therapeutic protocol for metastatic\n           retinoblastoma (or best clinical management).\n\n      STRATUM D:\n\n      Management of participants with bilateral retinoblastoma is often complex; and some\n      participants will have one eye enucleated upfront due to advanced disease. The decision for\n      enucleation will be made after thorough consideration by the treating team. The treatment of\n      the remaining eye will depend on a combination of two factors: a) R-E group of the remaining\n      eye, and b) Histology of the enucleated eye. Though we have accumulated some information\n      regarding the use of vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin in the treatment of\n      intraocular retinoblastoma, it is not considered standard of care. Therefore, participants\n      with intermediate and high risk features will be treated with 6 courses of vincristine,\n      carboplatin, and etoposide (VCE). Those participants in whom the enucleated eye shows only\n      low risk histology and in whom the remaining eye is R-E IV-V, will still be eligible to\n      proceed with stratum B therapy, including consideration of periocular administration of\n      carboplatin."
