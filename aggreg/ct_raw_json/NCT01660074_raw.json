Each subject was fed equivalent 50 g available carbohydrate of test foods or reference food in random order. To minimize day to day variation of glucose tolerance, the reference food was tested in triplicate in each subject. All test and reference foods were served with 220 mL of water. An automatic lancet device (Safe-T-Pro Diagnostics GmbH Mannheim, Germany) was used to collect finger capillary blood samples (1.5 mL). Blood samples were taken immediately before the start of the study (0 min) and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min after the start of eating.",
