In a second step, the patient is asked to associate multiple items sensation shape and texture, shape and weight. In a third step is used everyday objects.\nDesensitisation techniques find their interest mainly when symptoms or dysesthetic hyperesth\u00e9sique. The objective is to increase the threshold of sensitivity to textures and particles eventually reduce dysaesthetic sensations.\nThe patient class in order of increasing tolerance 10 textures. Dysesthetic area is stimulated 5 to 10 minutes by the first texture to numb the area by saturation of the action potential. This helps promote functional work and recognition of objects. As soon as the texture causes more trouble we go to the next texture by applying the same job."

The hand is a sensory organ\n      that transmits the cerebral cortex protopathic sensitive information, proprioceptive or\n      epicritiques. The view-hand association plays an important role in the understanding of the\n      environment. Its exploratory use remains an essential and voluntary basis. The process of\n      recognition of the object passes through manipulation, but operates instantaneously. The\n      brain is able to do a quick summary of the information it receives to determine the nature\n      of the manipulated object. The exploration takes a posteriori, the brain can then determine\n      the details component object (texture, shape, composition, temperature and weight).\n\n      Neurophysiological mechanisms that would explain the analgesic effects of transcutaneous\n      electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) are not fully understood. Several theories underlying\n      its use as a neuromodulator of pain. The gate control theory has led to the development of\n      TENS devices. Recruitment of myelinated, large caliber, by the TENS electrodes afferent\n      fibers increases the control exerted on spinal level, thereby inhibiting the action of\n      afferent fibers of small caliber related to nociception. This stimulation strengthens the\n      blocking of \"gate\" at the corresponding cell bodies of spinothalamic tract and reduces the\n      transmission of nociceptive impulses to the spinal cord dorsal horn. This is segmental\n      presynaptic inhibition depends on the area and stimulated.\n\n      The objective of this study is to improve the quality of life through improved sensitivity\n      disorders of the hand in patients with MS, thanks to reeducation of the hand."
