Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor\n      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Celecoxib may stop the\n      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving\n      capecitabine and celecoxib together may be an effective treatment for solid malignancies."

To compare steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) (primarily minimum concentration [Cmin],\n      maximum concentration [Cmax], and area under the curve [AUC]) of celecoxib on day 7 of\n      monotherapy versus on day 14 of concomitant administration with capecitabine.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To develop a celecoxib PK drug interaction model using longitudinal data and determine\n      whether the results are concordant with results from the primary objective.\n\n      II. To assess the impact of known cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) pharmacogenetic variants with\n      reduced enzyme activity (CYP2C9*2 and *3) on the between subject variability in celecoxib\n      PK.\n\n      III. To assess tumor response by the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST,\n      version 1.1) and explore whether there is any correlation between celecoxib PK and response.\n\n      IV. To assess toxicity by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version\n      4.0) and explore whether there is any correlation between celecoxib PK and toxicities\n      related to either celecoxib or capecitabine.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive celecoxib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 7 days (course 0) and then on\n      days 1-21 of course 1 and all subsequent courses. Patients also receive capecitabine PO BID\n      on days 1-14 beginning in course 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity."
