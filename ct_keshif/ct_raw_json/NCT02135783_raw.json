About one third of people with ICH die\n      early after onset and the majority of survivors are left with major long-term disability.\n      Hematoma removal (HR) surgery is the primary treatment for ICH which volume is more than\n      30ml. But whether decompressive craniectomy (DC) should be employed during the HR surgery\n      still has considerable controversy. Outcomes in this study will be measured at 3 months\n      after surgery via a postal questionnaire including the Glasgow Outcome scale, Modified\n      Rankin Scale, and Barthel index. Two hundred patients will be recruited to the trial over 36\n      months. Follow-up will take three months with analysis and reporting taking one year."
