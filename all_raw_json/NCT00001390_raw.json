We\n      plan to utilize the NIH Clinical Center Clinical Research Volunteer Program to solicit paid\n      participation from healthy adults.  Study procedures are accomplished in 2-3 outpatient\n      visits that include an interview, saliva collection, lip biopsy, clinical laboratory\n      studies, dry eye examination, and lip biopsy follow up, as needed.  These are routine\n      diagnostic procedures and their possible hazards are minor.  Biopsy specimens may be used in\n      clinical and laboratory studies, such as in vitro biochemical analysis or in vivo\n      transplantation.\n\n      Some of the Healthy Volunteers may be asked to participate in an MRI study of the salivary\n      glands."
