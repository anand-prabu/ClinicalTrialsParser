The UroLift\u00ae System is indicated for the treatment of symptoms due to urinary outflow obstruction secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men 50 years of age or older. During the procedure, an implant is delivered into the prostatic lobe obstructing the urethra and restricting urine flow. The distal end of the device is used to compress the lobe then the implant is delivered to retain the lobe in position, thereby increasing the urethral opening and reducing the fluid obstruction through the prostatic urethra.",
