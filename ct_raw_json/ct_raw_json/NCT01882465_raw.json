The subject must be between 18 and 35 years of age.\n\n          5. The subject must be an adapted (minimum of 4 week history of daily wear prior to the\n             baseline study visit) soft contact lens wearer in both eyes.\n\n          6.

The subject must come in with a current (no more than 12 month old) spectacle or\n             contact lens prescription as indicated. (NB: Emmetropic subjects who wear contact\n             lenses for enhancement purposes only will also require a current contact lens\n             prescription).\n\n          8. The subject's vertex corrected spherical equivalent distance refraction must be in\n             the range of PLANO to -6.00D in each eye.\n\n          9.

The subjects own a wearable pair of spectacles (as indicated by current prescription)\n             and wear them to all visits including the screening visit as required for vision\n             correction. They must be willing to wear their spectacles during the 24 hour washout\n             period leading up to each treatment visit (NB: Emmetropic subjects who do  not own\n             spectacles must   agree to no lens wear on all visit days including the screening\n             visit).\n\n         11.

Have any systemic disease, autoimmune disease, or use of medication, which may\n             interfere with contact lens wear. This may include, but may not be limited to\n             diabetes, hyperthyroidism, recurrent herpes simplex/zoster, Sjogren's syndromes,\n             xerophthalmia, acne rosacea, Stevens-Johnson syndromes.\n\n          4.

Had any previous, or have planned, ocular or intraocular surgery (e.g., cataract\n             surgery, radial keratotomy, PRK, LASIK, ect.).\n\n          7. Have any grade 3.0 or greater slit lamp findings (e.g., edema, corneal\n             neovascularization, corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival injection)\n             on the Efron classification scale or any other ocular abnormality that may\n             contraindicate contact lens wear.\n\n          8. Have any known hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to contact lenses (As assessed\n             by ocular history).\n\n          9. Have any ocular infection.\n\n         10. Have any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable\n             contact lens wear.\n\n         11. Have participated in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 14\n             days prior to study enrollment.\n\n         12.

Currently wear their contact lenes on an extended wear basis.\n\n         14. Is an employee of the investigational clinic (e.g., Investigator, Coordinator,\n             Technician).\n\n         15. Currently wears toric or multifocal contact lenses. If the subject wears soft contact\n             lenses for monovision, they must be willing to wear distance only correction in both\n             eyes for the study."
