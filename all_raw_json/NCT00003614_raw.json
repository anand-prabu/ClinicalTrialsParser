Determine the objective response rate after\n      treatment among the patients with bidimensionally measurable disease.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive estramustine orally twice a day on days 1-3 of each week for 6\n      weeks. Patients also receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 2 of each week for 6 weeks.\n      Courses repeat every 8 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity and disease\n      progression. Quality of life is assessed prior to treatment and at weeks 4, 8, 20, and 24.\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for years 2-5, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 17-52 patients accrued into this study over 14 months."
