    <textblock>
      Reliable identification of parathyroid glands is critical to the success of thyroid and
      parathyroid surgery. In thyroid surgery, inadvertent injury to parathyroid glands may cause
      temporary or permanent hypoparathyroidism (low calcium levels needing long term treatment).
      In parathyroid surgery, early identification of normal and/or enlarged parathyroid glands
      helps in deciding on the extent of surgery and increases the chances of postoperative normal
      calcium levels.

      Methylene Blue (Methylthioninium chloride, MB) is a dye that when given intravenously in
      high doses, is taken up differently by thyroid and parathyroid tissue. It is currently used
      during parathyroid surgery by some surgeons to help identify enlarged parathyroid glands by
      visual examination alone. Such visual examination is unhelpful in the identification of
      'normal' parathyroid tissue.  MB exhibits fluorescent properties in the near-infrared range
      (light just beyond the visible spectrum). This can be picked up by an appropriate imaging
      system. This has potential to identify and differentiate between 'normal' parathyroid,
      'abnormal' parathyroid and thyroid tissue during surgery.

      The investigators have established the feasibility of the intra-operative use of a near
      infra-red fluorescent imaging device called Fluobeam® and demonstrated the ability of this
      device to pick up near infra-red fluorescence from human tissue after administration of
      intravenous MB. Animal experiments have shown that doses as low as 0.1mg/kg of MB given
      intravenously enable fluorescent visualisation of thyroid and parathyroid glands.

      This study will aim to optimise the dose and timing of administration of MB in human thyroid
      and parathyroid surgery and to develop a protocol which would then subsequently be assessed
      for effectiveness in a multi-centred randomized controlled setting.

    <textblock>
      Around 13,000 thyroid and parathyroid operations are performed per year in England for both
      benign and malignant disease. Reliable identification of parathyroid glands is critical to
      the success of thyroid and parathyroid surgery. In thyroid surgery, inadvertent injury to
      parathyroid glands may cause temporary or permanent hypoparathyroidism (low calcium levels
      needing long term treatment); the latter is associated with significant long term problems.
      In parathyroid surgery, early identification of normal and/or enlarged parathyroid glands
      helps in deciding on the extent of surgery and increases the chances of postoperative normal
      calcium levels.

      Methylene Blue (Methylthioninium chloride, MB) is a dye that when given intravenously in
      high doses, is taken up differently by thyroid and parathyroid tissue. It is currently used
      during parathyroid surgery by some surgeons to help identify enlarged parathyroid glands by
      visual examination alone. At these doses, there is a risk of adverse effects from
      administration of MB. Such visual examination is unhelpful in the identification of 'normal'
      parathyroid tissue. MB is not currently used in surgery for thyroid pathologies.  MB
      exhibits fluorescent properties in the near-infrared range (light just beyond the visible
      spectrum). This can be picked up by an appropriate imaging system. This has potential to
      identify and differentiate between 'normal' parathyroid, 'abnormal' parathyroid and thyroid
      tissue during surgery.

      The investigators have established the feasibility of the intra-operative use of a near
      infra-red fluorescent imaging device called Fluobeam® and demonstrated the ability of this
      device to pick up near infra-red fluorescence from human tissue after administration of
      intravenous MB. Animal experiments have shown that doses as low as 0.1mg/kg of MB given
      intravenously enable fluorescent visualisation of thyroid and parathyroid glands.

      This study will aim to optimise the dose and timing of administration of MB in human thyroid
      and parathyroid surgery and to develop a protocol which would then subsequently be assessed
      for effectiveness in a multi-centred randomized controlled setting.

A congenital anomaly in the offspring of a participant The reporting period for Serious Adverse Events will be from the time of induction of anaesthetic until 30 days after the day of surgery.
