  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this follow-up study is to evaluate the persistence of antibodies against all
      the vaccine antigens 10 years after booster vaccination with either Tdap or Td, and also to
      assess immunogenicity and safety of another dose of Boostrix, administered in this study.
      This protocol posting deals with objectives and outcome measures of the extension phase. The
      objectives and outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a separate protocol
      posting (NCT number = NCT00109330).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects were previously vaccinated with either Boostrix or a control Td vaccine in study
      NCT00109330. Only subjects who were part of the primary study will be invited to participate
      in this study. All subjects will receive a single dose of Boostrix at Visit 1 (Day 0) and
      subjects will be observed till Visit 2 (Day 30) for safety in terms of solicited adverse
      events (during 4 days post vaccination), unsolicited adverse events (during 31 days post
      vaccination) and serious adverse event (during the trial period). A blood sample will be
      collected from all subjects before vaccination (Visit 1) and one month after vaccination
      (Visit 2) for antibodies estimation.

      This summary has been updated following Protocol amendment 2 dated 03 October 2013. The
      protocol is being amended to facilitate enrolment by:

        -  -  Extending the window period for re-vaccination from ± 6 months to ± 300 days from
           the Year 10 time point.

        -  -  Extending the recruitment period from 6 months to 14 months. The format of
           non-inferiority criterion of the first co-primary objective has been updated to keep it
           aligned with the format of non-inferiority criterion of the second co-primary
           objective.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the
             requirements of the protocol (e.g. completion of the diary cards, return for
             follow-up visit).

          -  Subjects who have received a dose of Tdap or Td vaccines 10 years (+/-300 days) back,
             in study NCT00109330.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject.

          -  Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before
             entering into the study.

               -  Non-childbearing potential is defined as pre-menarche, current tubal ligation,
                  hysterectomy, ovariectomy or post-menopause.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the

             pertussis-containing vaccine.

          -  History of any neurological disorders or seizures.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required).
