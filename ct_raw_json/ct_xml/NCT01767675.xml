  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the investigators can improve the treatment of this
      type of cancer. They want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, giving heated
      chemotherapy into the belly, known as hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), has
      on the patient and this type of cancer.

      The goal of HIPEC is to expose any cancer left in the abdomen after surgery to high doses of
      chemotherapy. The chemotherapy is heated in the hope that this will make it easier for it to
      get into and kill the cancer cells. The drug used for HIPEC will be carboplatin, a Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug for use in ovarian, fallopian tube or primary
      peritoneal cancer.

             unacceptable risk for participation in the study.

          -  Patients under the age of 21. This protocol does not include children because the
             number of children with these types of cancer is limited, and because the majority is
             already part of a nationwide pediatric cancer research network.

          -  Patients with known carboplatin or cisplatin allergy.

          -  Evidence of extensive intraperitoneal adhesions at the time of surgery, as determined
