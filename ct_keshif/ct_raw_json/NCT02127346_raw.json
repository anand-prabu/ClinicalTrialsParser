            "textblock": "Periodontal disease including chronic periodontitis results from interaction between\n      pathogens and the host in\ufb02ammatory response. This interaction triggers a complex process of\n      in\ufb02ammatory events, which in turn promote connective tissue destruction and alveolar bone\n      remodeling. Periodontitis is described as a multifactorial irreversible and cumulative\n      condition, initiated and propagated by bacteria and host factors.\n\n      Vitamin D and calcium are fundamental for bone mineralization and for the prevention of\n      osteoporosis Severe vitamin D deficiency lead to mineralization defects but chronically low\n      intake of vitamin D and calcium leads to bade calcium balance and bone loss, and it is\n      reasonable to expect this effect to occur in alveolar bone as it does in other bones of the\n      body. A study has showed a positive association between low bone mass or osteoporosis and\n      alveolar bone loss and tooth loss.\n\n      Vitamin D serum concentrations might affect periodontal disease both through an effect on\n      bone mineral density (BMD) and through immunomodulatory effects. Vitamin D is well\n      established as being essential for bone growth and preservation. A potential\n      anti-inflammatory effect of vitamin D is supported by an increasing amount of literature.\n      The active metabolite of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25dihydroxyvitamin D, has been found to\n      inhibit cytokine production and cell proliferation.\n\n      Low serum levels of vitamin D have been linked with a loss of periodontal attachment. Data\n      from over 11,000 subjects were analyzed for serum vitamin D levels and attachment loss. In\n      subjects less than 50 years of age, there was no signi\ufb01cant association reported between\n      vitamin D levels and attachment loss. In patients 50 years or older, serum vitamin D levels\n      were inversely associated with attachment loss for men and women. It was concluded that the\n      increased risk for periodontal disease might be attributable to low levels of vitamin D,\n      which would reduce bone mineral density, or to an immunomodulatory e\ufb00ect.\n\n      In van der Putten et al study, based on the literature available to date, the association of\n      vitamin D, and calcium de\ufb01ciencies with periodontal disease in elderly people is essentially\n      still unknown and not well researched. To produce conclusive evidence on the subject of this\n      systematic literature review, longitudinal cohort studies and follow-up randomized\n      controlled trials are needed\n\n      The aim of this study is to explore chronic periodontitis status and serum vitamin D and\n      calcium concentrations in Syrian males and compare these figures with matched healthy\n      volunteers with no periodontitis."
