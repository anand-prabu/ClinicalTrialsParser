It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is\n      more effective following surgery for breast cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy\n      consisting of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil with or without epirubicin in\n      treating women who have early stage breast cancer."

Compare the effects of 4 courses of epirubicin followed by 4 courses of\n      cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil (CMF) versus 8 courses of CMF as adjuvant\n      chemotherapy in women with node positive early breast cancer, as measured by overall and\n      event free survival from the date or randomization. II. Compare the effects of 4 courses of\n      epirubicin followed by 4 courses of CMF with 8 courses of CMF as adjuvant chemotherapy in\n      these patients, as measured by acute and chronic toxicities. III. Compare the effects of 4\n      courses of epirubicin followed by 4 courses of CMF versus 8 courses of CMF as adjuvant\n      chemotherapy in these patients, as measured by quality of life.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized into 2 treatment\n      arms within 4 weeks of surgery. Treatment begins within 6 weeks of surgery. One treatment\n      arm receives 8 courses of cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil (CMF) given\n      intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks. The other arm receives 4 courses of epirubicin followed by\n      4 courses of CMF given IV every 3 weeks. Patients are followed annually for 10 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,000 patients will be accrued over 3 years."
