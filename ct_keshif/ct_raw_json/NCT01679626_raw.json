            "textblock": "In anesthesia, intubation is a technique used to secure an airway. This technique is not\n      always straightforward. Sometimes it is difficult to place an endotracheal tube. There are\n      two manners of giving pressure to the patients neck, to improve view and facilitate\n      intubation.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that by giving this pressure the effective work area is likely\n      to be smaller. The investigators would like to quantify this effect by measuring the\n      effective work area, using a specially designed computer program."

The measurements assessed during BURP and CP\n      will be expressed relative to the measurements when no external pressure is applied."
