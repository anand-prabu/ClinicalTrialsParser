Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more cancer cells. Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the number of\n      immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system\n      recover from the side effects of chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy and filgrastim followed\n      by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have chronic myelogenous\n      leukemia."

Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested 4-7 times\n      between days 10 and 21 beginning when blood counts recover (CD34+ cells are selected from 2\n      of these PBSC collections and transduced with the LN NEO virus prior to cryopreservation).\n\n      In the transplant phase, patients who have not received prior radiotherapy receive\n      cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours daily on days -7 and -6 and total body irradiation on days\n      -4 through -1. Autologous PBSC and LN NEO transduced CD34+ cells are reinfused on day 0.\n      Patients also receive G-CSF IV daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts\n      recover.\n\n      Patients who have received prior radiotherapy receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on days\n      -10 through -7 and cyclophosphamide IV daily on days -6 through -3. Autologous PBSC and LN\n      NEO transduced CD34+ cells are reinfused on day 0. Patients also receive G-CSF IV daily\n      beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover.\n\n      All patients then receive interferon alfa SQ daily until disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 3 weeks; at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months; and then annually\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 4-26 patients will be accrued for this study."
