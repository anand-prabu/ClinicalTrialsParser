The relationship has\n      even been noted to be independent of metabolic syndrome and kidney function.  It has been\n      repeatedly noted that hyperuricemia was an independent risk factor of death in those at high\n      cardiovascular disease risk.  A recent review concluded that there is strong evidence that\n      hyperuricemia and gout are coupled with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events.\n\n      Although this correlation of hypertension and hyperuricemia is known, there has only been\n      one published study that has evaluated if lowering the uric acid would reduce the blood\n      pressure.  The authors concluded that in newly diagnosed hypertensive adolescents,\n      allopurinol decreased the blood pressure.  Despite this, further evaluation of this\n      therapeutic approach has not been studied.\n\n      The hypothesis of this study is that febuxostat, a new xanthine oxidase inhibitor, has blood\n      pressure lowering effects superior to allopurinol in patients diagnosed with gout."
