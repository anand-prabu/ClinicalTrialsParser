Califf, MD). Its goals are to (1) improve population-level diabetes management,\n      health outcomes, and quality of life for diagnosed and undiagnosed adults living with type 2\n      diabetes, (2) reduce disparities in diabetes management, health outcomes and quality of life\n      for adults living with type 2 diabetes, and (3) reduce healthcare costs associated with type\n      2 diabetes. This already funded diabetes care project provides a cost-effective platform for\n      conducting an add-on project to examine the feasibility of the CTN's clinical decision\n      support algorithms for SBIRT in primary care settings, as the study team can leverage\n      existing organizational and research infrastructure to facilitate the completion of the\n      study. The add-on study is supported by strong rationale, including the fact that primary\n      care settings serve as common points of contact for adults and provide many opportunities to\n      detect drug misuse and to intervene early in low or mild severity (better outcomes), which\n      in turn may reduce substance use, increase awareness and drug-medication interactions,\n      enhance patient medication adherence, and decrease high inpatient costs and repeat emergency\n      department visits."
