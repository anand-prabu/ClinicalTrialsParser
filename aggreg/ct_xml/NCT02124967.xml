  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      South Asian (SA) women living in Ontario have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes
      and coronary heart disease (CHD) compared to the general population. Various explanations
      for these differences have been established, one of which is based on low levels of physical
      activity in people of SA origin, particularly in Muslim women.

      This pilot trial will test the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of a
      Mosque-based exercise and educational intervention designed for SA Muslim women.

        1. What is the feasibility of a mosque-based intervention to promote physical activity
           that is culturally and gender sensitive to South Asian Muslim women?

        2. What is the acceptability of a mosque-based intervention to promote physical activity
           that is culturally and gender sensitive to South Asian Muslim women?

        3. What is the effectiveness of a mosque-based intervention to promote physical activity
           that is culturally and gender sensitive to South Asian Muslim women?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      South Asian (SA) women (people with origins in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh or Sri Lanka)
      living in Ontario have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes and coronary heart
      disease (CHD) compared to the general population. Various explanations for these differences
      have been established, one of which is based on low levels of physical activity in people of
      SA origin, particularly in Muslim women. Studies suggest that they participate in less
      physical activity or recreational exercise compared to other SA women. Practical barriers
      (e.g. lack of time, childcare) are often interwoven with cultural barriers, such as
      restrictions leaving the home alone to enter mixed-gender settings, and lack of
      socialization into sporting and other outdoor activities) inhibit participation.

      The provision of culturally and gender sensitive facilities, such as women-only exercise
      sessions at mosques could serve as a solution for Ontario SA Muslim women to be more active.
       Studies indicate health promotion programs in religious institutions (e.g. churches) have
      demonstrated clinical and psychosocial benefit to women of various ethnic groups.  Similar
      to Canadian churches, mosques have key elements identified in the literature to be
      beneficial in providing physical activity opportunities for Muslim women: partnerships,
      available and accessible space and supportive social relationships.

      To the investigators' knowledge, mosque-based physical activity interventions for SA Muslim
      women have not been implemented and evaluated in Ontario. Such interventions are needed to
      help attenuate the risk of diabetes and CHD in this ethnic group who represent a significant
      part of the Ontario population.
