It is not yet known if the addition of photodynamic therapy to\n      combined therapy with surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy is more effective than\n      combined therapy alone for supratentorial gliomas.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of surgery, radiation\n      therapy, and chemotherapy with or without photodynamic therapy in treating patients who have\n      newly diagnosed or recurrent malignant supratentorial gliomas."

Patients are stratified\n      according to clinical center.\n\n      Newly diagnosed patients (Study 1)\n\n        -  Patients are randomized to receive either high light dose photodynamic therapy (arm I)\n           or no photodynamic therapy (arm II):\n\n             -  Arm I: Patients receive porfimer sodium (Photofrin) IV one day prior to surgery.\n                Craniotomy and tumor resection are performed. Upon completion of resection,\n                patients undergo intracavitary photoillumination with a high light dose.\n\n             -  Arm II: Craniotomy and tumor resection are performed. Postoperatively, all\n                patients receive external beam radiotherapy 5 days per week for 5-6 weeks. After\n                completing radiotherapy, patients receive nitrosourea (carmustine or lomustine)\n                chemotherapy.\n\n      Recurrent tumor patients (Study 2)\n\n        -  Patients receive Photofrin IV one day prior to surgery. Craniotomy and tumor resection\n           are performed.\n\n             -  Arm I: Patients receive high dose light therapy during surgery.\n\n             -  Arm II: Patients receive low dose light therapy during surgery. Patients receive\n                chemotherapy with procarbazine for 28 days beginning 2-4 weeks after surgery.\n                Courses repeat every 56 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n                toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed on both studies at 4 weeks postsurgery, then every 3 months until\n      death or for 1 year after study closure.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 150 patients with newly diagnosed tumor will be accrued for\n      this study within 4 years (Study 1). A maximum of 120 patients with recurrent disease will\n      be accrued within 4.5 years (Study 2)"
