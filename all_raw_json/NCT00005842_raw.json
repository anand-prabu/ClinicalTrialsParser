Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate\n      tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming\n      normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from\n      dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining trastuzumab with R115777 may kill more tumor\n      cells."

Determine the maximum tolerated dose of R115777 when administered with trastuzumab\n      (Herceptin) in patients with advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma.\n\n      II. Assess the toxicities and pharmacokinetics of this treatment regimen in this patient\n      population.\n\n      III. Determine the antitumor activity of this treatment regimen in these patients.\n\n      IV. Determine the relative biologic endpoints of this regimen and correlate them with\n      toxicity and pharmacokinetic parameters in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study of R115777.\n\n      Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 plus\n      oral R115777 twice daily for 3 weeks.
