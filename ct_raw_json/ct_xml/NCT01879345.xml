    <textblock>
      Single centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study of two dosage regimens of
      BIA 2-093 - 1800 mg (Group 1) and 2400 mg (Group 2) - in two groups of healthy male
      volunteers
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within each group (n=9) 3 volunteers were randomised to receive placebo and the remaining 6
      volunteers to receive BIA 2-093. No volunteer was a member of more than one treatment group.
      In each group, the study consisted of a single-dose period (Phase A) followed by a 7-day
      multiple-dose period (Phase B). The multiple-dose phase started 96 h post single-dose.
      Progression to the 2400 mg dose (Group 2) only occurred if the 1800 mg dose (Group 1) was
      considered to be safe and well tolerated. An appropriate interval separated the
      investigation of the two groups in order to permit a timely review and evaluation of safety
      data.

      Treatment consisted of a single-dose (Phase A) followed by a once-daily dose for 7 days
      (Phase B). Doses were prepared as follows: Group 1 = 3 tablets of BIA 2-093 600 mg plus 1
      placebo tablet, or 4 placebo tablets; Group 2 = 4 tablets of BIA 2-093 600 mg, or 4 placebo
      tablets.
