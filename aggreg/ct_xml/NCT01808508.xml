  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many individuals with Down syndrome (DS)have breathing problems during sleep. This is called
      obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). OSAS is very common in individuals with Down
      syndrome because of the shape of their face and tongue and because of their low muscle tone.
      OSAS can cause a lot of health problems including behavioral and learning problems as well
      as heart problems.

      The purpose of this research study is to look at the effects of treating OSAS in individuals
      with Down syndrome with a  machine called Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). The
      investigators want to see if treatment of OSAS improves learning, behavior and heart
      problems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All individuals participating in the study will be evaluated for obstructive sleep apnea
      syndrome (OSAS) with a baseline sleep study. Based on the results of the sleep
      study,individuals with OSAS will be randomly assigned into two groups. One group will
      receive continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and the other intervention group will
      receive sham CPAP(placebo) for four months. CPAP is a machine with a mask that fits over the
      nose, is worn during sleep and helps keep the airway open. Sham CPAP (placebo) is a machine
      that looks and sounds like a CPAP machine but does not give pressure so it does not treat
      OSAS. Individuals with normal breathing during the sleep study will not receive a machine,
      and will serve as controls.

      Individuals will also have baseline tests including blood tests, an echocardiogram (pictures
      of the heart), a walking test and learning tests. After 4 months, the baseline tests will be
      repeated in all participants. At the end of the study, all individuals with OSAS will get
      treatment.

    <description>The primary aim of the study is to assess the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS)and the neurocognitive and behavioral outcomes of individuals with Down syndrome.

    <description>The secondary aim of the study is to assess the relationship between the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and cardiovascular function of individuals with Down syndrome. As secondary outcome we will use the left ventricular mass index as measured on echocardiography.We hypothesize that subjects with OSAS who are randomized to therapeutic CPAP will have greater improvements in cardiac structure/function than will subjects randomized to sham CPAP or DS control subjects without OSAS.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that these improvements will correlate with the degree of CPAP use. We hypothesize that subjects with OSAS who are randomized to therapeutic CPAP will have greater improvements in cardiac structure/function than will subjects randomized to sham CPAP or DS control subjects without OSAS.</description>

    <description>The third aim of the study is to determine the effect of 4 months of treatment of OSAS on the neurocognitive and cardiovascular function of individuals  with DS. Subjects with DS and OSAS will be randomized to 4 months of treatment with therapeutic CPAP or sham CPAP, and objective CPAP adherence will be monitored. DS controls with normal breathing during sleep will be followed for 4 months without treatment.
We hypothesize the individuals with OSAS and DS who receive CPAP will have greater improvement in their neurocognitive and behavioral testing versus individuals with OSAS on sham CPAP.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that these improvements will correlate with the degree of CPAP use.</description>
