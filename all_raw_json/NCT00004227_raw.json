It is not yet known if\n      radiation therapy is more effective with or without cetuximab for cancer of the oropharynx,\n      hypopharynx, or larynx.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy with\n      or without cetuximab in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV cancer of the\n      oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx."

Patients are stratified by Karnofsky\n      performance status (60-80% vs 90-100%), nodal stage (N0 vs N+), tumor stage (T1-3 vs T4),\n      and radiotherapy schedule (concurrent boost vs once daily vs twice daily).\n\n      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms:\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy beginning on day 1. Patients are assigned to 1 of\n           3 radiotherapy groups:\n\n             -  Group 1: Patients undergo concurrent boost radiotherapy comprised of radiotherapy\n                once daily 5 days a week for 3.5 weeks followed by radiotherapy twice daily 5 days\n                a week for 2.5 weeks.\n\n             -  Group 2: Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 7 weeks.\n\n             -  Group 3: Patients undergo radiotherapy twice daily 5 days a week for 6-6.5 weeks.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive a test dose of cetuximab IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Patients\n           who do not experience grade 4 anaphylactic reaction receive a loading dose of cetuximab\n           IV over 2 hours beginning 30 minutes after completion of test dose. Patients receive\n           maintenance cetuximab IV over 1 hour on day 8. Maintenance cetuximab repeats every week\n           for 7 courses.

There must be an hour interval between the\n           completion of cetuximab infusion and the start of any radiotherapy.\n\n      Patients with more than N1 neck disease at initial presentation undergo neck dissection 4-8\n      weeks after the completion of radiotherapy.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed before initiation of study therapy, at 8 weeks, and then every 4\n      months for 1 year.\n\n      Patients are followed at 8 weeks, every 4 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 3\n      years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 416 patients (208 per arm) will be accrued for this study\n      within approximately 5 years."
