            "textblock": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) complicates 5 to 30 % of pregnancies. GDM is defined as\n      hyperglycemia with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. Because it is a forerunner\n      of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), professional associations recommend T2DM postpartum\n      screening (T2DM-pPS) at 6 weeks/6 months post delivery, using a 75g oral glucose tolerance\n      test (OGTT).\n\n      However, less than a quarter of these women are screened. This recommendation has failed for\n      multiple reasons; the most important being that busy new mothers must deal with the major\n      inconveniences of returning to a sampling center for a 2h testing session, bringing baby\n      along or paying for a sitter, transportation, parking\u2026 A mother-friendly solution is direly\n      needed.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that, in these women, results of an OGTT performed after\n      delivery on the last day of their hospital stay (OGTT-1) will predict results of the\n      recommended OGTT (OGTT-2) at 6 weeks/6 months postpartum.\n\n      The main aim of our project is to determine the optimal cut-off value for the 2h glucose\n      result during OGTT-1 in order to predict abnormal glucose tolerance status at OGTT-2 (the\n      gold standard), in the same woman."
