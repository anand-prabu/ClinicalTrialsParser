All patients scheduled to undergo elective colorectal\n      resections (CRR) at London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC) will be identified at the time of a\n      pre-operative clinic visit with one of the 13 surgeons performing CRR at their institution.\n      Included patients will be randomized to receive either usual care or usual care plus NPWT.\n      All patients will be followed for 30 post-operative days to identify the development of an\n      SSI and other secondary outcomes. Given the nature of the intervention, the surgeon and\n      patients cannot be blinded to the intervention.
