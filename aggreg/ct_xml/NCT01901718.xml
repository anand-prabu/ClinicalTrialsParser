  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain patients who experience breakthrough pain in the background of controlled
      persistent pain with opioids will be followed for 3 months in order to assess the safety and
      titration trends in the clinical practice setting of a novel fentanyl sublingual spray
      (Subsys™) for the treatment of breakthrough pain.

             equivalent analgesic) for at least 7 days.

          -  Who are currently using Actiq® for their breakthrough pain and are being discontinued

          -  Are able to follow and complete all necessary study procedures.

          -  Are willing and able to give written informed consent before participating in the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are not opioid tolerant.

          -  Using a rapid onset opioid other than Actiq® to manage their breakthrough pain.

          -  Have physical abnormalities of the floor of the mouth that could affect absorption as
             determined by investigator.

          -  Are subjects with uncontrolled or rapidly escalating pain.

          -  Are subjects with a history of alcohol or substance abuse within the last 3 years.

          -  Have a clinically significant medical history (past or present) of any disease that
             would compromise the study or the well-being of the subject.

          -  Are subjects who have participated in another clinical trial with an analgesic within
             the last month.

          -  Are female subjects with a positive pregnancy test or who are currently lactating.

          -  Are subjects who are taking medications that are known inhibitors of the CYP3A4
             isozyme, such as ketoconazole.

          -  Are subjects who have taken a monoamine inhibitor within 14 days before a dose of
             study medication.

          -  Opioid being used for chronic migraine or acute pain.

          -  Are subjects who are unsuitable for inclusion for any other reason, in the opinion of
