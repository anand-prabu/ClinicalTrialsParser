    <textblock>
      African-Americans suffer from increased prevalence of both type 2 diabetes and diabetes
      complications, reflecting a combination of psychobehavioral factors as well as metabolic
      dysfunction.  In this process, depression may contribute to both the genesis of type 2
      diabetes (through impact on neurohormonal activation, inflammatory mediators, and insulin
      resistance), and difficulties in management (through decreased adherence to diet plans,
      medication, and scheduled appointments). Our preliminary data from the Grady Diabetes Clinic
      indicates that depression may be common in African-Americans with diabetes, that depression
      is a factor in non-adherence, and that non-adherence leads to poor glycemic control - a
      direct cause of diabetes complications.  What is not known is: how treatment of depression
      could lead to both neurohormonal and psychobiological improvement, with improved patient
      adherence and glycemic control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the psychobehavioral and neurohormonal mechanisms of effective treatment, we
      will conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with major
      depression, who will receive either:  (i) computer-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
      program entitled &quot;Beating the Blues&quot; + placebo, or (ii) computer-based cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) program entitled &quot;Beating the Blues&quot; + the SSRI antidepressant escitalopram.
      We will assess (a) glycemic control (levels of HbA1c), in relation to (b) adherence (keeping
      scheduled return appointments, diet, exercise, and glucose monitoring), (c) depressive
      symptoms (neurocognitive and neurobehavioral symptoms determined by self- and observer-rated
      scales), and (d) the four pathways of neurometabolic function.

      Study visits will occur once a month for 6 months.  Should patients report severe
      environmental stressors (such as marital conflict, loss of family member or job, being
      exposed to trauma), patients will be offered an intensification of their contact with study
      personnel, e.g. weekly contact by phone or &quot;in-person&quot; visits to see study personnel at the
      Grady Diabetes Clinic.

      After completion of 6 months, patients may enter an open-label treatment with escitalopram
      or be tapered off their study medication.  If patients develop worsening depressed mood, at
      any time during the study they will be offered treatment with open-label escitalopram or an
      alternative antidepressant for the remainder of the 52 weeks of the study.
