            "textblock": "Summary: Since darker skin pigmentation and aging are known factors influencing the body's\n      ability to synthesis adequate amounts of Vitamin D, we hypothesize that: 1) the usual sun\n      exposure in the southern United States may not be sufficient to maintain adequate vitamin D\n      levels in elderly African American women, 2) recommended supplementation of Vitamin D 400\n      IU/d may not be adequate to prevent Vitamin D deficiency which in turn could lead to calcium\n      deficiency and possibly sub-clinical hyperparathyroidism.\n\n      This study will enroll 60 African American women age 65 or older who do not have renal,\n      hepatic or gastrointestinal disorders that could affect Vitamin D and calcium absorption and\n      metabolism. Patients will have two scheduled office visits. Demographic data will be\n      collected with attention to dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D, and the patient's\n      customary degree of sun exposure. Ca, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, PTH and serum CTX (a bone\n      resorption marker) are measured on enrollment day and repeated 6 weeks later.  All patients\n      not already taking  1000 mg Calcium with 400 IU of Vitamin D orally daily were given samples\n      of this supplement to last for 6 weeks without making any change in diet or sun exposure\n      recommendations.  The study period will extend April to June - a time when there should be\n      ample sunlight but it is not so hot as to stop the elderly from going outdoors. Statistical\n      analysis will be performed as to the effect(s) of ethnic background, age, diet, and\n      intensity of sun exposure as related to Ca, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, PTH and serum CTX."
