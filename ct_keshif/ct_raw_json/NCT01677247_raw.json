Immediately after\n      drug administration, subjects were administered 100 ml of 10% glucose at approximately 0.5,\n      1.5, 2, 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5 hours. In addition, 20% glucose solution was given to any subject\n      who exhibited symptoms of hypoglycaemia. One week after the first drug administration\n      (wash-out period), the procedure was repeated using the alternate drug.\n\n      The plasma concentrations of glimepiride were determined by high performance liquid\n      chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV). The pharmacokinetic parameters assessed\n      are AUCt, AUCinf, Cmax, tmax, and t1/2."
