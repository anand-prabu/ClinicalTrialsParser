  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine the safety of LY2922470, taken as oral
      capsules, once or twice daily for approximately 28 days, in participants with diabetes. It
      also aims to determine how long the drug stays in the body and how it affects blood sugar
      levels. A screening appointment is required within 28 days before the start of the study and
      a follow up appointment is required approximately 14 days after the last study dose is
      taken.
