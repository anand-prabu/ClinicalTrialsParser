The tumour and/or the mammary piece (and the axillary piece) of\n      dissection will be directly imaged \"ex vivo\" using the PDE camera (in comparison with\n      standards of known fluorescence intensity).\n\n      In the Laboratory of Pathology:\n\n      The fresh mammary piece will be processed as usual, but the \"gross-thick\" sections will be\n      imaged using the PDE and the fluorescent areas will be defined (and later analyzed in\n      comparison with standards of known fluorescence intensity).\n\n      After fixation, the tumoral tissues as well as - if identified - non tumoral fluorescent\n      foci will be thereafter processed \"as usual\".\n\n      All the slides obtained will be analyzed using the NIR fluorescent microscope for the\n      presence or not of detectable ICG and the ICG-positive tissues or compartments (vascular\n      spaces, interstitial spaces, normal and/or tumoral cells, macrophages\u2026) will be determined.\n\n      If fluorescent foci are identified at the level of the axillary piece, they will be isolated\n      and analyzed like the other lymph nodes. Using the NIR fluorescent microscope, these\n      isolated macroscopically fluorescent structures will be analyzed (lymph node? Other?).\n\n      Additionally, metastatic lymph nodes will also be controlled for their microscopic\n      fluorescence or not."
