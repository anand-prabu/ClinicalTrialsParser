Additionally, we will evaluate\n      how these skills affect patient outcomes by comparing thoracenteses performed by\n      simulator-trained residents to those who have \"traditional\" training. This project will\n      evaluate these overall hypotheses: simulation-based training using the mastery learning\n      approach improves medicine resident's thoracentesis skills and improves patient outcomes and\n      satisfaction."

            "textblock": "Given medical procedures are the second most common cause of the complications that afflict\n      3% of hospitalized patients, simulation-based mastery learning should be applied to\n      procedures done in all medical centers. In academic hospitals, bedside procedures such as\n      thoracentesis procedures are often performed by unsupervised medical trainees.\n      Traditionally, medical trainees learn procedures relying on the historic \"see one, do one,\n      teach one\" mentality. Unfortunately, this approach subjects patients to procedures before\n      trainees are competent.\n\n      Through the use of medical simulation, medical educators can increase the essential\n      knowledge and skills of trainees while assuring procedural competence and reducing patient\n      exposure to undue risk. Medical simulation training using the mastery learning model\n      improves clinical skills and reduces the risk of procedure-associated injury. Our research\n      group pioneered the use of this evidence-based approach for teaching medical trainees.\n      Mastery learning requires that all trainees demonstrate a uniformly high level of skill\n      before training completion. This ensures competence on a medical simulator before actual\n      patient encounters."
