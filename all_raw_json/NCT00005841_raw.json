Determine the maximum tolerated dose of filgrastim (G-CSF)-fetal liver\n      tyrosine kinase-3 (Flt3K) fusion protein when combined with melanoma peptide vaccine\n      comprising tyrosinase:368-376 peptide, gp100:209-217 antigen, and MART-1:26-35 antigen\n      emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 in patients with completely resected stage III or IV\n      melanoma. II. Determine the toxicity and safety of this regimen in these patients. III.\n      Determine the immune responses to tyrosinase, MART-1, and gp100 antigens in patients before,\n      during, and after receiving these vaccinations.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study of filgrastim (G-CSF)-fetal liver\n      tyrosine kinase-3 (Flt3K) (G-CSF-Flt3K) fusion protein. Patients receive melanoma peptide\n      vaccine comprising tyrosinase:368-376 peptide, gp100:209-217 antigen, and MART-1:26-35\n      antigen emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously (SQ) monthly for 6 months, and then at\n      9 and 12 months for a total of 8 vaccinations. Patients receive G-CSF-Flt3K fusion protein\n      SQ daily for 3 days before, immediately after, and then daily for 6 days after each\n      vaccination. Cohorts of 6-10 patients receive escalating doses of G-CSF-Flt3K fusion protein\n      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose\n      preceding that at which 2 of 6-10 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are\n      followed every 3 months through year 2 after resection, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter until disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
