  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the functional, molecular and genetic profile of
      fibroblasts from Fibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD) patients. This cellular profile will be
      compared against the profile of fibroblasts obtained from age- and gender-matched healthy
      control subjects. This cellular data will be supplemented by a detailed clinical history and
      evaluation, assessment of circulating protein and cytokine levels in FMD versus healthy
      control subjects, and DNA sequencing aiming to define the causative genetic mutation(s).

      Specific aims

        -  Specific aim 1: To establish a library of fibroblasts, DNA, plasma and serum from
           patients with FMD and unaffected healthy control subjects.

        -  Specific aim 2: To compare the in vitro characteristics of fibroblasts from FMD
           patients and healthy control subjects.

        -  Specific aim 3: To define and compare the genetic (DNA sequencing) and circulating
           cytokine profile of FMD versus healthy control subjects.

      Fibroblasts and other cell lines generated under this protocol and all blood-derived

      bio-repository (as appropriate).

        Will enroll up to 200 FMD patients and controls at the Mount Sinai Hospital.  Healthy
        controls will also be recruited to this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients of any age and freely willing to participate. For patients &lt; 18 years of age
             consent will be via parents.

          -  Fluency in either English or Spanish.

          -  Signed, informed consent

          -  For FMD subjects - a clinical diagnosis of FMD, with fulfillment of standard
             diagnostic criteria.

          -  For healthy controls - no clinical features of FMD, and absence of any major ongoing
             systemic disease including any condition requiring hospitalization, immune
             suppression, intravenous or injected medications or that result in functional
             impairment in the performance of activities of daily living. Where possible, healthy
             controls will be unaffected family members. Healthy controls will be matched to
             enrolled FMD patients on the basis of gender and approximate age (within a 5 year
             window of another FMD subject).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have co-morbidities which reduces life expectancy to one year.

          -  Patients with any solid organ or hematological transplantation, or those in whom
             transplantation is considered.

          -  Active autoimmune disease.

          -  Illicit drug use.

          -  HIV positive.

          -  Prior malignancy.

          -  Any other form of vascular disease, including coronary artery disease or peripheral
             vascular disease
