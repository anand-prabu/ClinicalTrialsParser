Principal limitations of these studies\n      are the cross-sectional study design, self-report sleep duration and poor measurement of\n      blood pressure. The investigators propose to study an insomniac population with complete\n      evaluation of quality and quantity of sleep, associated to complete hemodynamic measurement\n      of hypertension."

In our study, sleep duration is evaluated by complete\n      evaluation of quality and quantity of sleep: one night PSG, associated with sleep agenda\n      during 3 weeks, actigraphy, and several sleep questionnaires. We join to this sleep\n      evaluation, a complete hemodynamic evaluation with: path way velocity and central BP\n      obtained by tonometry, ambulatory BP measurement (ABBM), and self- BP measurement.\n\n      The primary objective of this epidemiological study is to show an increase risk of\n      hypertension when sleep duration is less than 7 hours, with objective measurement of sleep\n      duration and hypertension.\n\n      Secondary objectives are to evaluate role of complain of insomnia in the risk of\n      hypertension, and to determine cardiovascular risk in insomnia with hemodynamic\n      explorations."
