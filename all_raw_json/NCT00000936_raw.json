            "textblock": "Renal transplantation is recognized as the treatment of choice for children with chronic\n      renal failure. However, patient and graft survival rates in young children are unacceptably\n      low.  In preliminary studies, OKT3 (a monoclonal antibody) induction therapy received post\n      transplant has been more successful than standard immunosuppression alone in improving graft\n      survival. This study is designed to assess the impact of induction therapy on graft survival\n      in pediatric kidney transplant patients.\n\n      Patients are assigned to OKT3 induction or no induction in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization to\n      oral cyclosporine of either Sandimmune or Neoral is also done in a 1:1 ratio. Group 1\n      receives OKT3 intraoperatively followed by Neoral. Group 2 receives OKT3 intraoperatively\n      followed by Sandimmune. OKT3 is administered at 2.5 mg (if weight less than 30 kg) or 5 mg\n      (if weight above 30 kg) per day for a maximum of 14 days. Group 3 receives IV cyclosporine\n      followed by Neoral. Group 4 receives IV cyclosporine followed by Sandimmune. Oral\n      cyclosporine is administered in a masked preparation. The dose for Sandimmune and Neoral is\n      the same; patients 6 years of age and older begin at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day and patients\n      under 6 years of age receive 500 mg/m2/day. Patients will receive concomitant medications\n      including steroids (IV and po), Nifedipine, anti-CMV therapy, Bactrim, Azathioprine or\n      Mycophenolate Mofetil. Kidney function, incidence of viral infection, graft survival, and\n      incidence of malignancy will be measured to assess the role of OKT3 induction and the role\n      of rejection in graft failure. Graft function will be evaluated at 1-, 2-, and 4-year\n      intervals."
