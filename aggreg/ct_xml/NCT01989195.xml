  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hope to introduce a novel MRI contrast agent with SeeM ore ™ that directly defines viable
      myocardium. Identifying viable myocardium non-invasively using cardiac MRI is still a moving
      target and a question we plan to answer more definitively with the SeeMore ™ contrast.
      Though well tested. in small and large animals and Phase I &amp; II clinical trials, we would
      like to determine the efficacy of the SeeM ore TM contrast further in a clinical setting.

      SeeM ore ™ is a new manganese (Mn)-based intravenous imaging agent being developed to
      enhance magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While Mn has long been known to have desirable
      magnetic and kinetic properties for MRI, use in humans was not initially possible due to
      cardiovascular depression and electrocardiogram (ECG)changes, including prolongation of PR
      and QTc intervals, associated with intravenous administration [1-5]. Chelation of Mn, as had
      been done with gadolinium for use with MRI, provided relevant safety, but sacrificed
      desirable magnetic and kinetic properties [6]. SeeM ore rM provides Mn in a form that
      maintains the desired magnetic and kinetic properties while overcoming the cardiovascular
      toxicity of Mn. SeeM ore rM is taken up into heart cells .(primarily via addition of calcium
      to avoid cardiotoxic effects; please refer to US patent #5,980,863). The potential to
      distinguish healthy heart tissue from unhealthy heart tissue based on a specific sustained
      pattern of enhancement provides a basis for evaluating the performance of SeeM ore rM in
      heart patients. MRI offers benefits over other imaging technologies. Relative to radioactive
      nuclear imaging procedures, MRI is 3-dimensional, provides good soft tissue discrimination,
      and is of high spatial and temporal resolution. These features have been reported to
      identify smaller defects (e.g., subendocardial infarcts) and match angiographic results more
      closely than other modalities such as SPECT [7,8]. It may be possible to enhance the utility
      of MRI for heart disease further through the use of an imaging agent that is specifically
      taken up into heart cells. SeeM ore rM is the only cardiac-specific agent being developed
      for this purpose. Unlike nuclear perfusion agents, SeeM ore rM is not radioactive and does
      not require special handling, shielding, transport or storage. In addition, the specific
      pattern of enhancement achieved in the heart muscle persists over time, offering potential
      .benefits over the nonspecific extracellular agents currently available for MRI or X-ray/CT
      procedures. This feature allows full use of the high resolution of MRI, since there is not a
      trade-off of high spatial resolution for temporal (first-pass) resolution. It is anticipated
      the features offered by SeeMore™ along with the high resolution, three dimensional
      attributes of MRI will result in higher accuracy than is available with other current
      modalities in practice, including stress echocardiograms, cardiac MRI using gadolinium
      contrast and nuclear studies such as SPECT and PET. This will be evaluated in this study and
      serve as the basis for pivotal registration studies.

      All components of SeeMore™ are USP and are approved for use as drugs in man, orally and/or
      intravenously. A summary of the Phase I safety and PK (pharmacokinetics)study are provided
      below.

      The Phase I study evaluated the safety and tolerance of SeeM ore ™ in humans, with special
      emphasis on cardiovascular safety, and assessed its PK profile.
