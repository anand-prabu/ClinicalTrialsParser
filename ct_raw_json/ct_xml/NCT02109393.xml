  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative disease whose characteristics
      include supranuclear, initially vertical, gaze dysfunction accompanied by extrapyramidal
      symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. Patients typically have bradykinesia, the appearance of
      a fixed stare and a soft, slurred, growly voice. Gait disturbance is recognized as one of
      the core diagnostic criteria and may present as short, shuffling steps, gait freezing,
      lurching unsteady gait or spontaneous falls, which may become the dominant features.
      Impaired postural reflexes are an other cardinal manifestations of PSP.  No medication is
      effective in halting the progression of PSP. Physical therapy and rehabilitation medicine
      involvement may help maximize ambulation safety and facilitate instruction in the use of a
      walker, wheelchair, or other aids. Robotics and related technologies are realizing their
      promise to improve the delivery of rehabilitation therapy. The electromechanicaldriven gait
      orthosis Lokomat has demonstrated its utility for gait rehabilitation in several
      neurological condition (for example in post-stroke patients). The mechanism by which Lokomat
      enhance recovery is still unknown. The activation of muscles by weightened summation of
      activation signals has been demonstrated to represent the spatiotemporal components that
      determine motor behavior during walking. Exoskeleton robotic devices as Lokomat are now
      often used in the rehabilitation practice to assist physical therapy of individuals with
      neurological disorders. These devices are used to promote motor recovery by providing
      guidance force to the patients. The guidance should in principle lead to a muscle
      coordination similar to physiological human walking and to the influence of these robotic
      devices on locomotor patterns.

      Pathologically, PSP is defined by the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles in various
      region of the central nervous system. Different rates, localizations, and patterns of the
      accumulation of phosphorylated tau protein may account for the clinical phenomena seen in
      PSP such as imbalance and gait disturbances.

      In this study, the researchers will evaluate the efficacy of Lokomat in gait retraining
      during a rehabilitation cycle on gait disturbances, imbalance and impaired postural reflexes
      in patients with PSP.

    <description>MIRT: a 4-week cycle of physiotherapy that entailed three daily sessions, 5 days a week. The rehabilitation treatment was administered each day in different sessions. The first session comprised cardiovascular warm-up activities, relaxation exercises, muscle-stretching, exercises to improve the range of motion of spinal, pelvic and scapular joints, and exercises to improve the functionality of abdominal muscles and postural changes in the supine position. The second session included exercises to improve balance and gait using a stabilometric platform with a visual cue and treadmill training associated with auditory and visual cues (treadmill plus).
The last was an occupational therapy.
Lokomat: 40 minutes Lokomat assisted training 3 times/week for 4 weeks.</description>
