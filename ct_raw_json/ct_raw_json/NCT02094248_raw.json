However, indication for platelet transfusion is\n      relatively strict. No early intervention could be done according to this guideline. Previous\n      studies have shown that recombinant human thrombopoietin can reduce severe sepsis with low\n      platelet 28-day mortality in patients with hyperlipidemia, effectively improve peripheral\n      platelet number, reducing the probability of platelet transfusion.The primary objectives of\n      this study are to assess the impact of rhTPO on mortality among severe sepsis patients with\n      thrombocytopenia, as well as changes of platelet counts and platelet transfusion rates."
