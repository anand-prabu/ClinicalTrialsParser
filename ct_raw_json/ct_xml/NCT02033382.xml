  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will identify and evaluate relevant biomarkers and structural brain imaging for
      understanding potential biological illness related mechanisms in medication-naïve subjects
      with early psychosis before and after initiation of antipsychotic medication

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is currently unknown whether deterioration early in the course of psychotic illness
      represents medication toxicity or the natural course of the illness. The study will help
      clarify this issue in observing 20 schizophrenic patients before and after they are
      prescribed an antipsychotic via standard of care.

      In addition, schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder and a putative brain-derived
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF) deficit, while possibly a common pathway, may not fully capture
      the biological diversity—the supplemental biomarkers will allow us to perform a more
      comprehensive assessment of factors contributing to clinical course. Taken together analysis
      of these biomarkers in relation to clinical course and in relation to healthy subjects will
      inform us about biological mechanisms contributing to illness onset, effects of
      antipsychotic medication on these mechanisms, and the predictive value of the biomarkers for
      clinical course. This information will provide the foundation for future early intervention
      trials targeting biological mechanisms utilizing a personalized medicine approach.

      The baseline visit for 20 schizophrenic patients and 20 healthy age and gender matched
      controls consists of structural and functional  MRI in addition to a blood draw for
      biomarkers including BDNF, inflammation markers, DNA, oxidative stress, and folate status
      and additionally a salivary cortisol sample collection.  Biomarkers and imaging will be
      repeated after 8 weeks of antipsychotic treatment in patients.

        Subjects will be 20 patients , ages 16-40, with first episode schizophrenia or
        schizophreniform disorder with onset before age 35 who are medication naive and do not
        meet  criteria  for  major  depression  or  significant  suicidal  ideation  or  substance
         abuse  (except  nicotine) and 20 age and gender matched healthy controls. Subjects will
        be recruited by physicians in the Bellevue Hospital emergency room, outpatient clinic and
        on the Bellevue psychiatric inpatient units.

        Potential subjects will be identified by clinicians and asked whether they would like to
        speak to a researcher.  Healthy subjects will be recruited through advertising by using a
        flyer.  Potential subjects referred by a clinician or expressing interest in participation
        will meet with study staff for an informational meeting.  The study will be explained to
        the individual and in the event that he or she is interested in participating will then be
        given the consent form to read and review.
