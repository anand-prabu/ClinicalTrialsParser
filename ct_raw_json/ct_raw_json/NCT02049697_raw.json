Approximately 6 participants\n      will be receiving  the  14C-JNJ-39823277 in the study. Safety will be evaluated by the\n      assessment of adverse events, vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram,\n      and clinical laboratory tests which will be monitored throughout the study. The total\n      duration of study will be up to approximately 6 weeks."
