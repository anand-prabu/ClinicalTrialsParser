If the LNG IUD is found to be safe and\n      acceptable, the introduction of this method to HIV positive women in developing countries\n      could significantly reduce unplanned pregnancy and mother-to-child transmission of HIV, and\n      confer non-contraceptive benefits to HIV-positive women in Sub-Saharan Africa."

Recruitment will take approximately\n      18 months.  After enrollment, each participant will be followed for 24 months.\n\n      Primary Objectives: To compare LNG IUD safety to the safety of the C-IUD by comparing HIV\n      progression between the two study arms.\n\n      Secondary Objectives: 1) To measure LNG IUD safety with respect to genital viral load\n      shedding, a surrogate for HIV infectivity, as compared to the C-IUD. 2) To measure LNG IUD\n      acceptability through device continuation and other measures as compared to the C-IUD.\n\n      Primary Endpoints: HIV-1 Viral Load (VL) change, CD4 change, hemoglobin change, time to\n      antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, incidence of sexually-transmitted infections (STIs)\n      and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)\n\n      Secondary Endpoints: 1) Initiation/acceleration of detectable HIV RNA genital shedding 2)\n      IUD continuation and expulsion rates and acceptability measures through quantitative and\n      qualitative methods\n\n      Study Site: Gugulethu Community Health Centre (GCHC), Cape Town, South Africa"
