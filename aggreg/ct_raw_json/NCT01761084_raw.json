The purpose of this pilot study is determining the feasibility\n      of recruitment, retention and adherence of an international multicentre randomized\n      controlled study evaluating the efficacy of thrice-weekly home exercise for one year among\n      women with vertebral fracture. As secondary objectives, the investigators will examine the\n      effects of exercise on function, balance, quality of life, pain, falls and fractures. The\n      primary hypothesis is that the investigators will successfully recruit and retain the target\n      sample, and achieve an adherence rate of 60%."

            "textblock": "There is limited data available from which to develop guidelines for safe and effective\n      exercise prescription among individuals with hip or vertebral fractures. The long-term goal\n      of our research team is to conduct a large multi-centre randomized controlled trial (RCT) to\n      investigate whether participating in a thrice-weekly home exercise program for one year can\n      reduce incident fragility fractures among women aged 65 years or older with a history of\n      vertebral fracture compared to no intervention. The current study is a pilot study with the\n      principal objective of determining the feasibility of recruitment, retention and adherence\n      of an international multicentre RCT evaluating the efficacy of  thrice-weekly home exercise\n      for one year among women with vertebral fracture. The intervention was developed by experts\n      in exercise prescription based on a rigorous literature review and Cochrane meta-analysis we\n      have conducted. Physiotherapists will conduct 6 home visits with participants to deliver the\n      intervention (or social visit for controls) using a similar model to previous work by our\n      team and others. Secondary outcomes of the pilot study are those hypothesized to be among\n      the causal pathway linking exercise to fracture risk, including lower extremity strength,\n      posture, balance, as well as falls and fractures. Additional secondary outcomes include\n      quality of life, pain, exercise self-efficacy, the cost of the intervention, and the risk of\n      adverse events associated with exercise. The recruitment and retention process will be\n      summarized using a CONSORT flow diagram, and the reporting of results will be in accordance\n      with the CONSORT criteria. Analyses of feasibility objectives will be descriptive or based\n      on estimates with 95% confidence intervals, where feasibility will be assessed relative to\n      criteria defined a priori. Differences in secondary outcomes will be evaluated in intention\n      to treat analyses via independent student T-tests, Chi Square or logistic regression. The\n      Bonferroni method will be used to adjust the level of significance for secondary outcomes so\n      the overall level is alpha=0.05. Even if the larger trial proves not to be feasible, the\n      current trial will be one of the largest exercise studies among a representative group of\n      women with vertebral fracture to date, and will evaluate the feasibility and costs of a\n      comprehensive home exercise program, and its effect on important secondary outcomes.\n      Osteoporosis Canada has defined a need to develop patient resources on exercise and recently\n      announced a shift in priority to individuals with existing fractures; the proposed pilot\n      study is timely and will directly inform these knowledge translation initiatives."
