  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate if the study drug, ACTH Gel helps decrease
      the disease symptoms in people with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) who are already taking
      medications prescribed by their physician and are still experiencing disease symptoms.

      ACTH gel has been a Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for Rheumatoid Arthritis
      since 1952, and in 2010 the FDA retained RA as a disease approved for ACTH gel use. Despite
      its FDA approval there is very limited data on its how well ACTH gel works in improving the
      symptoms of people with RA.
