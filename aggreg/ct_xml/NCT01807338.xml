      The purpose of this study is to document the long-term safety and tolerability after
      intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of sNN0031 (PDGF-BB) in patients who
      participated in study sNN0031-001

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous participation in study sNN0031-001 with completion of 12 study weeks without
             development of clinically significant safety concerns, defined as being any
             drug-related or device related serious adverse event that resulted in premature
             termination of treatment or a medical device incident that could not be resolved
             during the conduct of study sNN0031-001

          -  The patient has a diagnosis of idiopathic PD

          -  The patient has been given written and verbal information about the follow-up study,
             has had the opportunity to ask questions about the study, and understands the time
             and procedural commitments

          -  The patient has provided written informed consent to participate in the follow-up
             study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has been included or participates in another clinical study after
             participation in Study sNN0031-001

          -  The patient has, since participation in study sNN0031-001, had functional
             neurosurgical treatment for PD (e.g., deep brain stimulation).

          -  Patients will only be excluded from participation in the event of a laboratory test
             abnormality that is indicative of a medical condition requiring treatment which, in
             the opinion of the investigator, is not compatible with participation in the present
             study
