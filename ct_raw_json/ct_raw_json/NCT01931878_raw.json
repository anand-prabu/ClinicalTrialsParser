This study has a double blind cross over\n      design. Cross over means that you will have two sets of injections. The first set of\n      injections can be either Xeomin or placebo. The order of injection will be reversed at the\n      three month point following the first injection. Double blind means neither the\n      investigators nor you know which one of the two (Xeomin or placebo) you received."
