    <textblock>
      This phase II trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of obinutuzumab and bendamustine
      treatment in patients with refractory or relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
      Patients received up to six 28-day cycles of treatment. Treatment consisted of IV
      administration of Obinutuzumab and Bendamustine. Treatment time is expected to last 6
      months, and patient follow-up will last 2 years.
