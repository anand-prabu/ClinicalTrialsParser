If improvement to a non-exclusionary grade or resolution is\n             documented within 45 days of providing informed consent for screening, the\n             participant may be enrolled.\n\n          6.

Pap result Grade 2 or higher** Note: Otherwise eligible participants with an\n                  exclusionary test may be re-tested during the screening process.\n\n             Note: Women with a documented normal result within the 12 months prior to Enrollment\n             need not have a Pap smear during the screening period. Women with a Grade 1 abnormal\n             Pap smear can be enrolled upon completion of the initial phase of evaluation if no\n             current treatment is indicated (based on local standard of care for management of\n             abnormal cervical cytology). Need for a repeat Pap within 6 months does not preclude\n             Enrollment prior to that result becoming available. If the participant has had a\n             hysterectomy for reasons not related to cervical dysplasia, a Pap smear need not be\n             performed.\n\n          9. Has any other condition that, in the opinion of the IoR/designee, would preclude\n             informed consent, make study participation unsafe, complicate the interpretation of\n             study outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives\n             *Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse\n             Events Version 1.0, December, 2004 (Clarification dated August 2009) **Female Genital\n             Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies Addendum 1 to the Division of AIDS\n             (DAIDS) Table for Grading Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Version 1.0, December\n             2004 (Clarification dated August 2009)"
