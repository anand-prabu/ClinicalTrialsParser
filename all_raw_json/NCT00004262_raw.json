Determine the frequency and grade of toxicity of gadolinium texaphyrin as a\n      radiosensitizer at two dose levels in patients with supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme\n      undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery.\n\n      II. Compare the tumor, normal brain, and plasma concentrations of this drug regimen to 1.5\n      and 8 Tesla MRI images in this patient population.\n\n      III. Determine if the 8 Tesla images provide more data than the 1.5 Tesla images in terms of\n      the radiosensitizing drug distribution in the tumor in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.\n\n      Within 5 weeks following surgery, patients receive daily external beam radiotherapy five\n      days a week for 5 weeks. Within 2 weeks following completion of radiotherapy, patients\n      receive gadolinium texaphyrin IV over 2 hours followed 3 hours later by stereotactic\n      radiosurgery. Patients undergoing surgical debulking of tumor prior to external beam\n      radiotherapy receive gadolinium texaphyrin IV over 2 hours, 3 hours prior to surgery in\n      addition to the dose prior to stereotactic radiosurgery.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gadolinium texaphyrin until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2\n      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, and then every 3 months for 5 years or until\n      death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 12-18 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
