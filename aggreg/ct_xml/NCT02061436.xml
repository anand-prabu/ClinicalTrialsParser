  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of chronic total occlusions (CTOs) is increasingly
      being performed in patients with advanced coronary artery disease, but there is limited
      information on the techniques utilized and the procedural outcomes. The goal of this
      multicenter, investigator initiated registry is to collect information on treatment
      strategies and outcomes of consecutive patients undergoing CTO PCI among various
      participating centers. The information collected will be used to determine the frequency of
      CTO PCI performed at the participating sites and examine the procedural strategies utilized,
      and the procedural (both immediate and during follow-up) outcomes.

    <description>Procedural success is defined as achievement of technical success with no in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE).  In-hospital MACE includes any of the following adverse events prior to hospital discharge: death from any cause, Q-wave myocardial infarction, urgent repeat target vessel revascularization with PCI or coronary bypass surgery, tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis or surgery, or stroke.</description>

    <description>In-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) include any of the following adverse events prior to hospital discharge: death from any cause, Q-wave myocardial infarction, urgent repeat target vessel revascularization with PCI or coronary bypass surgery, tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis or surgery, or stroke.
MACE during clinical follow-up include death, myocardial infarction, target lesion and target vessel revascularization.</description>
