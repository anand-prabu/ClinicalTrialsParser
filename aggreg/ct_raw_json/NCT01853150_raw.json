Patients descirbe their feeling of the feet\n      suddenly being glued to the floor.  Transcranial magnetic stiumation is a noninvasive\n      procedure using electromagnetic induction to stimulate brain. Transcranial magnetic\n      stiumation (rTMS) can selectively change brain activity to enhance desired effects. The aim\n      of this study is to the therapeutic effect of rTMS for the FOG."
