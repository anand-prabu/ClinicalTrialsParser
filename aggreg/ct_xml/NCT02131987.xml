  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Between January 1 2006 and December 31 2013, at our department 324 patients underwent
      hemiarthroplasty (HA) for displaced femoral-neck fracture with a bipolar prosthesis
      (Variokopf, Link®, Germany) by the use of the posteriolateral approach. Patients with
      pathological fractures and HA performed with direct lateral approach were excluded. A
      retrospective cohort study were conducted. Patients with prosthetic dislocation formed one
      group and patients without dislocation formed the control group.

      As standard, post surgery radiographs  (anteroposterior and lateral) were taken. After these
      were performed patient started weight bearing as soon as possible. Clinical data regarding
      patient demographics, details of the surgical procedure and the medical comorbidities were
      collected by the use of patient and operative records. Radiological analysis with position
      evaluation was performed using the post surgery radiographs by measuring Wiberg angle,
      inequality of leg length and femoral offset of the prostheses and compared with non-operated
      hip joint using the post surgery x-ray images.

      Our hypothesis were that patients with single- or recurrent dislocations had shortened
      postoperative leg length, decreased femoral offsed and a Wiberg angle less than 25 degrees.
