To determine the proportion of subjects implanted with the Cell Pouch\u2122 and transplanted\n           with islets into the Cell Pouch\u2122 who achieve and maintain insulin independence after\n           islet transplantation.\n\n        2. To obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of the Cell Pouch\u2122 to maintain adequate\n           immunological protection against both allo- and autoimmunity of islet transplant\n           recipients.\n\n        3. To determine through retrospective analysis comparative metabolic function and\n           engraftment efficiency using patients undergoing standard intraportal islet\n           transplantation under the current alemtuzumab standard of care protocol."

Reduced awareness of hypoglycemia, as defined by the absence of adequate autonomic\n             symptoms at plasma glucose levels < 3.0 mmol/L, indicated by, 2 or more episodes of\n             severe hypoglycemia requiring third party assistance within 12 months, a Clarke score\n             \u22654, HYPO score \u22651,000, lability index (LI) \u2265400 or combined Hypo/LI >400/300\n\n          2.

An initial LFT panel with any values  >1.5\n             times the upper limit of normal (ULN) will exclude a patient without a re-test; a re\n             test for any values between ULN and 1.5 times ULN should be made, and if the values\n             remain elevated above normal limits, the patient will be excluded.\n\n         14.

Patients with Graves disease will be excluded unless previously adequately treated\n             with radioiodine ablative therapy.\n\n         24.
