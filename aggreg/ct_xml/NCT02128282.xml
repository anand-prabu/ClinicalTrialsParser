  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study considers the safety and tolerability of increasing doses of CX-4945 in
      combination with gemcitabine plus cisplatin to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD),
      followed by a randomized study that compares antitumor activity in cholangiocarcinoma
      patients receiving the standard of care gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus CX-4945 at the
      combination MTD with gemcitabine plus cisplatin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Protein kinase CK2 is a constitutively active serine/threonine kinase with a long history as
      a pro-survival, anti-apoptotic kinase.  Given the wide spread overexpression of CK2 in
      multiple cancers and its role in multiple non-oncogenic processes required to sustain the
      cancer phenotype, a selective inhibitor of CK2 is an attractive targeted approach to
      treating cancer.

      CX-4945 is a tetracyclic, small molecule carboxylate acid salt that exhibits potent and
      highly selective inhibition of CK2.  Protein kinase CK2 is also known to play an important
      role in the DNA damage repair mechanisms of cancer cells, and this study of CX-4945 in
      combination with gemcitabine plus cisplatin will determine if inhibition of CK2, in
      conjunction with the use of chemotherapy drugs, will result in improved clinical outcomes
      for patients with non-resectable cholangiocarcinoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of an unresectable liver mass consistent with cholangiocarcinoma, for which
             treatment with gemcitabine plus cisplatin is intended.

          -  For patients enrolled in the Dose Escalation Phase, one or more tumors measurable on
             radiograph or CT scan, or evaluable disease defined as non-measurable lesions per
             RECIST v. 1.1 (e.g., malignant ascites). All patients enrolled to the Randomized
             Study Phase must have measurable disease only.

             screening visit. Acute toxicities from prior therapy must have resolved to Grade â‰¤ 1
             above baseline.

          -  Patients with a history of another malignancy within 3 years of the baseline visit.
