  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When a patient is admitted to the ICU this often happens so suddenly that this can create a
      significant amount of stress and anxiety for family members for several reasons. Firstly,
      the family does not have a pre existing relationship with the ICU team. Secondly, the
      urgency of the situation and the technic it requires is often such that minimal information
      can be given to family members. And finally, as a result of the unpredictability of each
      patient's condition, it can be difficult to predict outcome for family members. Together,
      these factors compound the stress and anxiety of family members. This anxiety is natural and
      it is important for health caregivers to be able to offer the best support possible. A high
      quality communication provided by structured information given by physicians and nurses as
      well could improve support to the families and lead to greater satisfaction.

      Giving information to families during meetings is crucial at 3 moments: at the first day
      when the patient is admitted, at day 3, weekly and each time important news is given
      (surgery, deterioration in condition, end-of-life).

      The purpose of this project is to evaluate if the involvement of nurses during those
      meetings could improve quality in communication which is assessed by mixed methods. Families
      and healthcare workers satisfaction will be assessed by qualitative methodology. Family
      peritraumatic stress, symptoms of anxiety and depression and PTSD will be assessed using
      validated scales.

      Training of healthcare workers will be done by role play. Information to the families is
      delivered using a framework for physicians and nurses. All the meetings of the study will be
      audited by a psychologist.

      -Randomized trial with two arms: arm 1: information is delivered by a team (physician and
      nurse) arm 2: information is delivered by the physician alone

      -During the different meetings of the study: at day 1, at day 3, weekly and in case of
      deterioration of the patient condition.

      The other days, family information is delivered as usually in both arms.
