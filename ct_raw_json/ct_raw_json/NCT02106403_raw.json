For each subject, three superficial wounds will be induced on two volar forearms, by\n      sequential tape strippings until a glistening layer is visualized. After wounding, a\n      randomised test product will be sprayed twice on test site, and the subject will be asked to\n      complete a questionnaire evaluating product cooling performance and overall liking."
