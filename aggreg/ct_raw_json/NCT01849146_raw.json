WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 may stop the growth\n      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy\n      uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as\n      temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing\n      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 together with\n      radiation therapy and temozolomide may work better in treating glioblastoma multiforme."
