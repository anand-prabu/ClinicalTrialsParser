  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the visual outcome and number of injections required during an optical coherence
      tomography (OCT)-guided treat and extend regimen with intravitreal aflibercept for treatment
      of subfoveal neovascular age-related macular degeneration (NVAMD).

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how using &quot;treat and extend,&quot; a method of determining
      how often a patient with NVAMD should visit the retina clinic and receive treatments,
      affects vision in patients with this condition after treatment. The treatment the
      investigators are using in this study is an eye injection of a drug called aflibercept (also
      called EYLEA). Eylea is FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved for treatment of wet age
      related macular degeneration.

      The investigators hope that &quot;treat and extend&quot; strikes the right balance between making sure
      patients get all of the treatments needed, but not giving patients too many treatments (so
      that the side effects of treatments are minimized and so that patients don't have to make
      more visits than they need to maintain maximum visual gain).  The experimental part of this
      study is determining this &quot;right balance&quot; of eye injections.

    <description>Patient receives treatment at baseline and week 4 visit. The first time extension criteria are met the follow-up interval will be increased by 4 weeks. If a patient is being followed at an 8 week interval but fails to meet extension criteria at a particular visit, treatment will be administered as usual and the follow up interval will be reduced to 4 weeks. If patient is being followed at 10-16 week interval but fails to meet extension criteria at a particular visit, treatment will be administered but the follow-up interval will be reduced by 2 week increments.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients older than 55 years with treatment naïve, active subfoveal NVAMD
             demonstrating macular fluid on optical coherence tomography (OCT) and leakage on
             fluorescein angiography (FA).

          -  Only one eye for each patient demonstrating a pre-treatment acuity of 20/25 - 20/320
             is eligible

          -  Patients cannot have concurrent progressive retinal disease in the study eye.

          -  Willing and able to comply with clinic visits and study-related procedures

          -  Provide signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment for NVAMD in the study eye,

          -  Prior experimental treatment of NVAMD in either eye

          -  Prior treatment with systemic anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) agents

          -  Prior treatment with verteporfin, plaque brachytherapy, or external-beam radiation
