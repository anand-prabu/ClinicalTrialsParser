  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurofeedback has proved to be effective in treating Attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD) in experimental settings. This study investigates whether neurofeedback can
      be used as a therapeutic intervention in regular outpatient care. The investigators compare
      high frequent neurofeedback with high frequent self-management therapy and suppose that both
      result in comparable effects.
