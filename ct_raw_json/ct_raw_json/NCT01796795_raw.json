The diagnosis of CW is based on visual inspection by an experienced dermatologist.\n\n          3. Patient with \u2264 5 CW lesions; for patient with only 1 lesion, the size needs to be\n             measuring 2 to 15 mm in diameter; each of the target lesion(s) to be treated needs to\n             be \u2264 15 mm in diameter.\n\n          4. Patient agrees to apply the study medication on  target CW lesion(s) with an\n             occlusive dressing for at least 20 hours per day.\n\n          5. Patient or the legally acceptable representative of patient under 20 years of age, is\n             willing and able to provide written informed consent.\n\n          6. Patient agrees not to use wart-removing product/modality (prescription  or\n             over-the-counter) other than the study product during the course of the study; and is\n             willing to refrain from using cosmetics or other topical products in the treatment\n             area for the duration of the study.\n\n          7. Any non-target CW receiving wart-removing procedures including cryotherapy and\n             surgical therapy should be at least 5 cm apart from the target lesions.\n\n          8. Patient is free of any systemic or dermatologic disorder, which, in the opinion of\n             the investigator, will interfere with the study results or increase the risk to the\n             patient.\n\n          9. Patient is judged to be in good health based upon the results of physical\n             examinations (PEs), medical history, and safety laboratory tests.\n\n         10.

Patient who has immune-compromised conditions, have required or will require systemic\n             intake of immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory medication (oral or parental\n             corticosteroids are included) within 30 days prior to the Randomization visit or\n             during the course of the study. Routine use of inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids\n             during the study is allowed.\n\n          5.

Current uncontrolled infection,  current skin infections and/or skin disorder in\n                  the treatment area other than CW and/or in the area surrounding the warts that\n                  may confound or affect study assessment procedure of the study endpoints.\n\n               3. Chronic or acute medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may\n                  interfere with the study results or place the subject at undue risk (including\n                  human immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosis, active viral\n                  hepatitis, etc.).\n\n          6.
