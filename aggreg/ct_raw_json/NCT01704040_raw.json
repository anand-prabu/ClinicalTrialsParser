In Part 2, following administration of CNTO 3157 or placebo and\n      inoculation with HRV-16, efficacy and safety will be assessed in asthmatic participants\n      using standard assessments to evaluate asthma treatments. The study (Parts 1 and 2) will be\n      completed when the last participant completes the last visit (Week 11) in Part 2."
