This specific\n      exercise should promote motor skills of trained patients, as we have observed in different\n      mouse models. Patient's motor skills will be assessed using different scales including MFM\n      and Hammersmith.\n\n      This clinical trial attempts to develop a new non-invasive motor scale with sophisticated\n      instruments.\n\n      This scale will be useful in future clinical trials on SMA, given the lack of sensitivity of\n      currently available scales.\n\n      In addition, the study attempts to validate a questionnaire on post-exercise physical\n      well-being."
