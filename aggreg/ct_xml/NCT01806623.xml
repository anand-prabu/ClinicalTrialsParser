  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As for the indication of vulvovaginal candidiasis, a single oral administration of
      fluconazole 150 mg has been approved and is recommended by guidelines overseas. However in
      Japan oral therapy with antifungal triazole such as Fluconazole has not been approved, and
      topical therapies such as vaginal tablets, pessary and cream are used clinically. The
      purpose of this trial is to confirm the efficacy and safety of single oral administration of
      fluconazole 150 mg for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis in Japanese patients.
