      This is a phase III double-masked, randomized, controlled study evaluating the efficacy of
      EBI-005 as compared to vehicle given as a topical ophthalmic solution in each eye to
      subjects with moderate to severe DED three times daily for 12 weeks.  Approximately 730
      subjects at up to approximately 50 centers in the United States will be screened, enrolled
      into the study.
