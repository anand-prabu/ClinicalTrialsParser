The program also includes assessments with 1) an occupational\n      therapist, and 2) a vocational rehabilitation counsellor at the end of the program to help\n      participants identify and obtain necessary changes at work. People from three provinces will\n      be recruited from collaborators' patient and program recipient lists. The study group will\n      receive the program intervention and the control group will receive \"usual care\" and printed\n      educational material. All participants will be followed for five years. The effectiveness of\n      the program at improving at work productivity and reducing work cessation will be evaluated\n      compared to a control group receiving printed material on employment and arthritis."
