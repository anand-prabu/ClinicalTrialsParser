We will test the hypothesis that\n      malaria transmission, as measured by the prevalence of asexual parasitaemia, will be lower\n      in communities surrounding the intervention schools, than those surrounding the standard\n      care schools."

            "textblock": "Study overview:\n\n      We are proposing to evaluate the community-level impact of intermittent preventive treatment\n      (IPT) for malaria in schoolchildren on clinical outcomes and malaria transmission, using a\n      cluster-randomised design. The intervention will involve the administration of\n      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) to schoolchildren monthly for one school year.\n\n      Study site:\n\n      The study will be conducted in Jinja district, an area with low to moderate malaria\n      transmission.  The annual EIR in Jinja district was estimated to be 6 infective bites per\n      person/year in 2001-02. There are 11 sub-counties in Jinja district. Of these, 5\n      sub-counties are more densely populated. The 6 more rural and less populated sub-counties\n      (Budondo, Butagaya, Buwenge, Buyendo, Busedde, and Kakira) will be included in the study\n      population.\n\n      Clusters:\n\n      For this trial, a cluster will be defined as one (or more) primary schools plus the 100\n      closest households surrounding the school. The clusters will be defined prior to\n      randomisation using the digitally enumerated maps.We plan to include a total of 78 clusters\n      in the study, 39 in each study arm, focusing on public or private day schools that are\n      well-spaced geographically, and aiming to maximize the buffer zone between clusters to\n      minimize contamination. To ensure that we identify at least 78 clusters, in some cases we\n      may include more than one school per cluster, if multiple schools are in close proximity.\n\n      Randomisation:\n\n      The randomisation will be conducted by a member of the study personnel who is not directly\n      involved in the field activities. Primary schools will be stratified by type of ownership\n      (public vs private). Restricted randomisation will be employed to ensure balance on type of\n      school and geographical location. Specifically, restrictions will be applied that exclude\n      the allocation of all clusters originating from a single sub-county, or that are otherwise\n      in close geographical proximity from being allocated to the same arm of the trial.\n\n      Study population:\n\n      The intervention will be delivered to children attending participating primary schools that\n      are randomized to the intervention group.  Of the 78 clusters, 39 will be randomized to the\n      intervention and 39 to the control.  We estimate that the average number of schools per\n      cluster will be 1.25.  Thus, approximately 50 schools will participate in the intervention.\n      The overall mean number of children enrolled in the primary schools is approximately 500;\n      thus approximately 25,000 students will participate in the intervention.\n\n      The intervention:\n\n      IPT with DP will be delivered to all schools located in the 39 intervention clusters.\n      Treatment will be administered to participating students each month for one school year\n      (approximately 9 treatments), and will not be blinded. Schools within clusters randomised to\n      the control arm will not receive IPT.\n\n      Administration of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine:\n\n      All enrolled students will receive DP (Holley Cotec Pharmaceuticals) given once a day for 3\n      consecutive days. DP will be dosed according to weight-based guidelines. DP will be\n      administered orally by study personnel, and all treatments will be directly observed. All DP\n      treatments given will be recorded.\n\n      Evaluation procedures:\n\n      Outcomes will be measured through surveys of communities, schoolchildren, and mosquito\n      vectors. The potential feasibility of the IPT intervention will also be assessed.\n\n        1. Community surveys. At baseline (prior to implementing the intervention) and one year\n           later, 138 community members from randomly selected households will be surveyed from\n           each of the 78 clusters (total 10,764).  The survey will include a household\n           questionnaire and clinical & laboratory evaluation.\n\n        2. School surveys. At baseline and one year later, 80 randomly selected schoolchildren\n           will be surveyed from each of the 78 clusters (total 6240).The survey will include a\n           brief questionnaire and clinical & laboratory evaluation.\n\n        3. Entomology surveys. Mosquitoes will be collected using Centers for Disease Control\n           (CDC) light traps from 5 randomly selected households in 20 purposively selected\n           clusters per arm (100 households per arm; 200 total). Households will be sampled\n           monthly for the duration of the intervention.\n\n        4. Qualitative assessment. A historical review of published and unpublished literature on\n           programmes that have integrated health interventions into the education sector;\n           ethnographic observation of intervention activities; in-depth interviews with key\n           stakeholders (12-15), and teachers and health workers (12-15)."
