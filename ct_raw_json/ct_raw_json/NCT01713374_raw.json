The investigators hypothesize that the\n      three interventions under study will increase FMC while causing a blunting in FMD.\n\n      Further, the investigators plan to study the circadian variability of FMC and FMD. The\n      investigators hypothesize a peak of FMD in the late hours of the day and a peak of FMC in\n      the early hours."
