  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to determine whether everolimus pharmacokinetics in elderly and obese patients is
      different compared to control patients.

      Furthermore the investigators will investigate the relation between metabolic response
      assessed with [18F] Fluorodeoxyglucose-Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) and everolimus
      exposure and clinical benefit.

      The investigators will explore whether dose escalation in patients who are hypothetically
      underexposed will result in an increase in metabolic response.

    <description>The primary aim is to show a difference in everolimus exposure (AUC0-24hr) of at least 25% in elderly patients (≥70 years) and obese patients (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) compared to the control group (≤ 70 years; BMI ≤ 30 kg/m2), after reaching steady state everolimus pharmacokinetics (day 14, but at least after 7 days of everolimus therapy).</description>

    <description>To explore and calculate the predictive value of early metabolic response assessment with clinical benefit (PFS defined as disease progression according to RECIST version 1.1 or death, whichever occurs first) as primary outcome measure.
