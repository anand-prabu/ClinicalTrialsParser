This intervention will improve the volunteer's body\n      composition and reduce their risk of developing diabetes.\n\n      Extensive tests will be conducted before and after the dietary intervention using emerging\n      technologies with current state-of-the-art methods. These tests will monitor the numerous\n      physiological adaptations that have occurred on a gene, cell, organ and organismic level.\n\n      The study will, therefore, aim for a scientific breakthrough by developing a series of novel\n      biological \"markers\" that can accurately determine an individual's health status."
