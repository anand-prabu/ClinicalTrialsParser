            "textblock": "Tropical fevers have been a diagnostic challenge from the antiquity. Nowadays, despite the\n      availability of good diagnostic capacities, undifferentiated febrile illnesses continue to\n      be a thorny problem for travel physicians. In developing countries, the scarcity of skilled\n      personnel and adequate laboratory facilities makes the differential diagnosis of fevers even\n      more complex. Health care workers must often rely on syndrome-oriented empirical approaches\n      to treatment and might overestimate or underestimate the likelihood of certain diseases. For\n      instance Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) contribute substantially to the burden of\n      persistent (more than 1 week) fevers in the Tropics, causing considerable mortality and\n      major disability. These diseases are however rarely diagnosed at primary health care (PHC)\n      level. The difficulty in establishing the cause of febrile illnesses has resulted in\n      omission or delays in treatment, irrational prescriptions with polytherapy, increasing cost\n      and development of drug resistance.\n\n      In resource-limited settings, clinical algorithms constitute a valuable aid to health\n      workers, as they facilitate the therapeutic decision in the absence of good laboratory\n      capacities. There is a critical lack of appropriate diagnostic tools to guide treatment of\n      NTDs. While clinical algorithms have been developed for some NTDs, in most cases they remain\n      empirical. Besides, they rarely take into account local prevalence data, do not adequately\n      represent the spectrum of patients and differential diagnosis at the primary care level and\n      often have not been properly validated. The purpose of the study is to develop\n      evidence-based Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT)-supported diagnostic guidelines for patients with\n      persistent fever (\u2265 1 week) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Sudan, Cambodia\n      and Nepal."
