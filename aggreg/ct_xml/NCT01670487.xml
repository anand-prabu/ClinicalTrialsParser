    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy and safety of vapocoolant  stream (Pain Ease  Medium Stream ) in
      decreasing the pain of intravenous cannulation.

      To compare vapocoolant  stream (Pain Ease medium Stream) with control (e.g. sterile water)
      stream.

      Vapocoolant sprays have been used to decrease the pain associated with painful medical
      procedures such as immunizations, needle aspirations, injections, venipuncture and
      intravenous cannulation.  In general, vapocoolant sprays , have been found to be effective
      in decreasing the  pain of various medical procedures.  Moreover, the use of vapocoolant
      sprays ,unlike other local anesthetics , such as infiltrative lidocaine , is not associated
      with a painful injection and does affect the success rate of the procedure including
      intravenous cannulation and may even increase the success rate of the intravenous
      cannulation.
