Healthcare costs related to these\n      diseases are rising; prevention or delay of onset of disorders associated with overweight is\n      needed. Food ingestion exerts a transient suppressive effect on appetite and further food\n      intake by releasing gastrointestinal hormones. Proteins have been shown to be more satiating\n      than carbohydrates and fat. Intraduodenal administration (via a naso-duodenal intubation) of\n      pea protein has been shown to reduce food intake and increase satiety hormone levels in\n      humans, in contrast to orally dosed (unprotected) pea protein. In the present study we aim\n      to investigate the effects of human gastric fluid on the degradability of five different\n      protected pea protein products. Further, in an ex vivo experiment on freshly obtained human\n      duodenum tissue applying Ussing chamber technology; we aim to investigate the intestinal\n      satiety hormone release by the five different prototypes. The prototype that is less\n      degraded by human gastric fluid and is most effective in intestinal satiety hormone release\n      will be used in a future clinical trial."
