This\n      study will measure the agreement between margin status of the WLE specimen and the\n      metastatic status of dissected lymph nodes as determined by CLI and by histopathology. This\n      is a pilot study to assess feasibility before proceeding to pivotal studies to determine\n      diagnostic performance."
