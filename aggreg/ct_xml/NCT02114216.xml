  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) receptor has been implicated in the
      mechanism of acid induced inflammation in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and its
      expression has been demonstrated to be mediated by neurotrophic factors, such as nerve
      growth factor (NGF) and glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). We aimed to evaluate
      TRPV1, NGF and GDNF mRNA expression level in the GERD patients and its relationship with
      reflux symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All the subjects receive upper GI endoscopy and completed questionnaires about GERD symptoms
      under the supervision of a well-trained interviewer. Subjects are excluded if there was a
      history of gastrointestinal surgery, Barrett's esophagus, esophageal motility disorder,
      duodenal ulcer, benign gastric ulcer or gastroduodenal cancer and if he or she had any
      history of systemic disease requiring chronic medication (except for hypertension and
      diabetes mellitus).

      The subjects are classified into 2 groups after upper GI endoscopy and completing
      questionnaires about GERDsymptoms ; Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) and control
      group.

      During the endoscopic examination, two biopsies of the distal esophagus are taken. Biopsies
      are taken using standard biopsy forceps from between esophagitis erosions at a fixed
      position 3cm above the squamo-columnar junction in order to achieve sample consistency in
      all GERD subjects.
