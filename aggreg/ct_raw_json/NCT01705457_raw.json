            "textblock": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease where Th1 like responses from\n      myelin-specific CD4+ T cells, as secretion of pro-inflammatory IFN\u03b3, are believed to play a\n      major role in the pathogenesis. The myelin-specific T cells that mediate tissue destruction\n      in MS are believed to become activated outside the central nervous system (CNS) in lymphoid\n      tissue and when they cross the blood brain barrier they will re-encounter their antigen.\n      Immune deviation is the redirection of the immune response from most often Th1 like\n      responses to Th2 like responses, even though the opposite can also occur. Vitamin A or\n      Vitamin A-like analogs known as retinoids, are potent hormonal modifiers of type 1 or type 2\n      responses but a definitive description of their mechanism(s) of action is lacking. High\n      level dietary vitamin A enhances Th2 cytokine production and IgA responses, and is likely to\n      decrease Th1 cytokine production. Retinoic acid(RA) inhibits IL12 production in activated\n      macrophages, and RA pretreatment of macrophages reduces IFN\u03b3 production and increases IL4\n      production in antigen primed CD4 T cells. Supplemental treatment with vitamin A or RA\n      decreases IFN\u03b3 and increases IL5, IL10, and IL4 production by increase of retinoic acid\n      receptor and retinoic x receptor .\n\n      Record Verification Date:  August 2011"
