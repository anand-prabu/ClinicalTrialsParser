      This is an open-label, single-arm, multicentre, global, Phase II, study designed to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of AZD6094 in patients with PRCC who are treatment naïve or
      previously treated.

      An independent central pathology review of tumour samples will be used to confirm the
      diagnosis of PRCC of all patients enrolling.  However, locally available pathology results
      confirming PRCC will be allowed for timely study entry.

      All patients entering the study will take AZD6094 600 mg by mouth (PO) once daily (QD).
      Treatment will be given continuously.
