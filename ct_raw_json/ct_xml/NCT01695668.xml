    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to:

        1. Evaluate the safety and efficacy of a steroid eye drop (Lotemax) in patients who have
           been diagnosed with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which is a complication that may
           occur after bone marrow transplant where the newly transplanted material attacks the
           patient's body and may cause eye dryness.

        2. Assess the safety and efficacy of Lotemax in decreasing the eye's reaction to the
           process in GVHD before the patient undergoes bone marrow transplant.

        3. Compare how well Lotemax works in decreasing the process in GVHD with an
           immunosuppressive eye drop (Restasis), which has been commonly used in the treatment of
           this condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation result in Graft-versus-Host
      disease.  Ocular symptoms may be the first presentation of GVHD and may be seen in the
      absence of systemic manifestations.  GVHD is categorized into acute and chronic forms as
      defined by 100 days after the transplant.  Acute GVHD is characterized by dermatitis,
      hepatitis, and enteritis.  Chronic GVHD involves the skin, mouth, liver, gastrointestinal
      tract, lungs, and eyes.  Ocular GVHD is a common cause of dry eye symptoms in patients who
      have undergone bone marrow transplant (BMT), and can be defined as ocular surface disease in
      the context of GVHD.  Dry eyes develop in 76% of acute GVHD patients and between 62.5% and
      81.8% of chronic GVHD patients.  Current treatment for ocular GVHD includes topical
      cyclosporine 0.05% (Restasis, Allergan). Topical loteprednol etabonate 0.5% (Lotemax, Bausch
      and Lomb) has been shown to be safe and efficacious in treatment of inflammatory ocular
      disorders, but has not been prospectively studied in ocular GVHD.

      2. Hypothesis: We anticipate that topical loteprednol etabonate 0.5% will be safe and
      efficacious in treatment of ocular GVHD patients, and would add to the armamentarium of
      therapeutics for this disease.  Further, by following the natural progression of the disease
      prior to a patient's Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT), we may elucidate a new standard of care
      for these patients - one that involves referral to an ophthalmologist before ocular GVHD
      symptoms arise.
