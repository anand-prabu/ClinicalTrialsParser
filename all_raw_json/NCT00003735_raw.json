Determine the toxic effects and pharmacokinetics of this regimen in\n      these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by disease type (acute lymphocytic leukemia vs acute\n      myeloid leukemia). Patients receive oral topotecan once daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat\n      every 28 days in the absence of blasts in the blood, M3 bone marrow, or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients (25 per stratum) will be accrued for this study\n      within 2 years."
