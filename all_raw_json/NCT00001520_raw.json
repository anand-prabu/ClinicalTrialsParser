In patients with contraindications to succinylcholine or in whom a\n      difficult airway is anticipated, a neuromuscular blocking agent with a pharmacodynamic\n      profile similar to succinylcholine would be an attractive alternative.  Rocuronium, a new\n      intermediate-acting nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent produces paralysis within\n      60 seconds, similar to succinylcholine, but has a duration of paralysis of approximately 20\n      to 30 minutes.  If rocuronium-induced paralysis could be chemically reversed within 10 to 15\n      minutes after the administration of an intubating dose, it may be an appropriate alternative\n      in patients with contraindications to succinylcholine or in patients whom a difficult airway\n      is anticipated.  Neostigmine is an anticholinesterase agent which inhibits the hydrolysis of\n      acetylcholine by competing with acetylcholine for attachment to acetylcholinesterase.\n      Inhibition of the breakdown of acetylcholine allows the neurotransmitter to be present in\n      the neuromuscular junction for a longer period of time, so that each molecule can bind\n      repeatedly with the acetylcholine receptor.  The purpose of this study is to determine the\n      dose of neostigmine necessary for the early reversal of rocuronium-induced paralysis."
