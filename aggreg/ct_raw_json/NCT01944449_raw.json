            "textblock": "Type 2 diabetes is associated with elevated blood pressure, atherogenic dyslipidemia,\n      exacerbated postprandial lipid responses, all of which are contributory factors for\n      developing increased cardiovascular risk and complications in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n      Milk and Whey consumption has been associated with lower risk of developing metabolic\n      disorders, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n\n      Whey protein that accounts for 20% of whole milk protein seems to induce insulinotropic\n      /\u03b2-cell-stimulating and glucose lowering effects via bioactive peptides generated during its\n      gastrointestinal digestion. These bioactive peptides stimulate the release of GLP-1, serve\n      as endogenous inhibitors of DPP-4 and cause  inhibitory activity against \u03b1-glucosidase\n      activity, which might be an additional mechanism accounting for the glucose lowering effects\n      of Whey.\n\n      It  was shown that acute supplementation with Whey protein causes an postprandial\n      insulinotropic and glucose lowering effects in healthy adults (9-13) and in type 2 diabetic\n      subjects. This was associated with increased postprandial response of the t-GLP-1 and of\n      a-GLP-1, suggesting that the peptides generated from Whey protein may have dual beneficial\n      effects (increasing incretin production and decreasing incretin degradation by DPP-4) on\n      glycemia regulation in subjects with type 2 diabetes.\n\n      Addition of Whey protein to the meal, significantly decreased postprandial lipemia in\n      healthy and in type 2 diabetic subjects and there are also clinical evidence in\n      non-diabetics individuals, that acute and chronic administration of Whey protein has\n      antihypertensive activity. It has been reported that Whey protein via bioactive peptides,\n      exerts ACE inhibitory actions, nevertheless it is not clear if  this putative ACE inhibitory\n      effect of Whey, beside of reducing AngII, also increases its conversion to Ang 1-7, a novel\n      vasodilator and  blood pressure lowering peptide.\n\n      The effect of chronic administration of Whey protein on HbA1c, BP, AngII, Ang 1-7 and on\n      postprandial lipids, glucose, insulin and incretin responses, have not been examined\n      previously in type 2 diabetics."
