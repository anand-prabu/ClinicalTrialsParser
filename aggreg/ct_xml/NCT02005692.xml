      The study is designed to test the DynaSense system, which is a patient movement and
      orientation monitoring system. The study is intended to determine that:

        -  the DynaSense system identifies patients that are not turning adequately on their own
           and therefore require caregiver-assisted turns.

        -  the DynaSense system identifies patients that are turning adequately on their own and
           therefore do not require a caregiver-assisted turn.

        -  the DynaSense system helps ensure compliance with an institution's established patient
           turning protocol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult male or female 18 to 110 years of age;

          -  Inpatient currently on the unit and expected to remain for at least 12 hours;

          -  Able and willing to comply with the study procedures;

          -  Subject (or his/her agent) is able to read, understand, and provide Informed Consent
             in the English language.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is a female subject under the age of 60 who is pregnant, planning on becoming
             pregnant, or is currently breastfeeding.

               1. Any woman under the age of 60, must have a negative urine pregnancy test prior
                  to being enrolled in the study; OR

               2. Be postmenopausal for at least 2 years, OR

               3. have had a bilateral tubal ligations, OR

               4. have had a bilateral oophorectomy, OR

               5. have had a hysterectomy.

          -  Subjects with a known tape allergy or sensitivity to EKG leads or similar types of
             adhesives used in common medical products.

          -  Subjects who cannot have the patient sensor applied on the surface of the patient's
             anterior torso.

          -  Subjects who have a pacemaker or implantable cardiovascular-defibrillator (ICD).

          -  Subjects with dementia, Alzheimer's disease or other mental disabilities and
             incapacitation that would prevent the subject from providing written informed
             consent. If the subject is unable to provide informed consent due to mental
             incapacity, then the subject's Durable Power of Attorney may provide informed consent
             and sign the informed consent on behalf of the subject.

          -  Subjects who refuse to have an area of hair on their chest be clipped or shaved, if
             needed for patient sensor adhesion.

          -  Subjects, who in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, are at increased risk by
             participating in the clinical study.

          -  Subjects who have participated in another clinical study within the past 30 days or
             are currently participating in another clinical study at the time of screening.
