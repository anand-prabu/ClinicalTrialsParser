All patients must have failed primary therapy (defined as two induction\n             chemotherapies), have relapsed, or are not suitable candidates for intensive\n             induction chemotherapy.\n\n          3. Patients who have a dry aspirate or extramedullary disease only are eligible for this\n             study if they have a pre-treatment marrow or tissue biopsy demonstrating AML M4 or M5\n             subtype or high eIF4E.\n\n          4. ECOG performance status 0, 1, 2 or 3.\n\n          5. Life expectancy > 4 weeks.\n\n          6. Age is > 18 years\n\n          7. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (beta-HCG)\n             pregnancy test within 14 days of starting protocol and must not be breastfeeding. Men\n             and women of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective means of\n             contraception throughout the study and for at least six months after completion of\n             protocol.\n\n          8. Adequate renal and hepatic function: serum creatinine < 1.5 x ULN; AST or ALT < 2.5 x\n             ULN (or < 5 x ULN if liver involvement with leukemia); serum bilirubin < 1.5 x ULN\n\n          9. Provide written consent after the investigational nature, study design, risks and\n             benefits of the study have been explained.\n\n         10. Accessible for treatment and follow up.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Patients with low adenosine kinase (ADK) and equilibrative nucleoside transporter\n             ENT1.\n\n          2. Uncontrolled central nervous system involvement by AML.\n\n          3. Active cardiovascular disease as defined by New York Heart Association (NYHA) class\n             III-IV categorization.\n\n          4. Intercurrent illness or medical condition precluding safe administration of the\n             planned protocol treatment or required follow-up.\n\n          5. Received any previous therapy for AML within 28 days prior to the study entry. Hydrea\n             is permitted for the treatment of leukocytosis but must be stopped prior to starting\n             study drugs.\n\n          6. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n\n          7. Concurrent treatment with other anti-cancer therapy.\n\n          8. Known infection with HIV.\n\n          9. History of other malignancy.  Subjects who have been disease-free for 2 year or\n             subjects with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer or\n             successfully treated in situ carcinoma are eligible.\n\n         10. FAB AML M1, 2, 6, 7 will be excluded if they do not have high eIF4E expression. AML\n             M3 is always excluded."
