  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature infants are at risk of having pauses in breathing, or apneas, due to their
      immaturity. Premature infants are routinely given caffeine, a respiratory stimulant, on the
      first day of life to prevent apneas. However, if they continue to have apneas, they may
      require a breathing tube to be placed in the trachea.  There are risks to having a breathing
      tube, so it would be beneficial to avoid it if possible. If caffeine is given earlier, it
      may decrease the need for a breathing tube. Some studies also suggest that caffeine may also
      improve heart function which may prevent low blood pressure if given early.

      The primary aim of our study is to compare the respiratory effects of caffeine administered
      in the first 2 hours versus 12 hours of life in infants &lt;29 weeks' gestation. Our primary
      hypothesis is that caffeine administered in the first two hours of life can prevent the need
      for endotracheal intubation in the first 12 hours of life. Secondary aims include detailing
      the acute hemodynamic effects of caffeine and comparing the hemodynamic effects of receiving
      caffeine . These evaluations are critical in determining both the safety and efficacy of
      early caffeine therapy.

    <description>Infants will receive a blinded dose of either placebo (IV normal saline) or IV caffeine citrate 20mg/kg infused over 15 minutes within the first 2 hours of life. If the infant is in the early caffeine group, the blinded drug will be IV caffeine citrate 20mg/kg in the first 2 hours and placebo at 12 hours of life.</description>

    <description>Infants will receive a blinded dose of either placebo (IV normal saline) or IV caffeine citrate 20mg/kg infused over 10 minutes within the first 30 minutes of life. They will receive a blinded dose of the opposite of what they received in the DR (placebo or caffeine) at 6 hours of life. Therefore, the intervention is timing of initial caffeine dose.</description>
