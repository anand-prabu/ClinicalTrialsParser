The study seeks to: 1) compare changes in iron status indicators\n      among women receiving an iron-rich organic food supplement versus ferrous sulfate\n      supplement, and 2) determine the suitable level of food supplement needed to prevent/reduce\n      iron deficiency anemia  among women in developing country settings.\n\n      A double-blind, randomized, controlled, intervention trial will be implemented in women of\n      childbearing age,  60 women with iron deficiency anemia and 60 women with iron deficiency.\n      After screening potential subjects (up to 500 expected), approximately 30 will be recruited\n      into each of four study groups; assuming 30% dropout rate, to detect an increase of 30% in\n      ferritin as significant between the two time points at 80% power and alpha value of 0.05.\n      Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized into the four groups consisting\n      of: 2 control groups (daily 60mg ferrous sulfate (FS-60) or daily 10mg ferrous sulfate\n      (FS-10)), and 2 test groups (daily 60mg iron-rich supplement (IRS-60) or 10mg iron-rich\n      supplement (IRS-10)). Subjects will take daily FS-60 and IRS-60 under supervision for 8\n      weeks while subjects taking FS-10 and IRS-10 will take the supplement under supervision for\n      12 consecutive weeks."

The dietary data will be\n      analyzed using nationally-generated food composition tables together with the ESHA food\n      processor software. In addition, body weight and height will be measured using standard\n      methods at baseline and end of the study. Weekly monitoring of side effects will be\n      recorded. Fasting blood samples will be collected at baseline and endline to enable\n      determination of anemia status and other indicators including serum ferritin, transferrin\n      receptor and full blood count, together with C-reactive protein."
