The study assessed compliance of the providers with the different\n      protocols.  Placental transfusion (PT) has been shown to increase infant body iron stores at\n      6 months of age without increasing adverse outcomes. However, the optimal protocol to\n      achieve adequate placental transfusion is not known. The practice of cord clamping at birth\n      is not uniform among obstetrical providers because adequate evidence to support early or\n      late cord clamping has been lacking.\n\n      Women were eligible to enroll in the study if they had no pregnancy complications, did not\n      smoke, planned to breastfeed, and planned to deliver vaginally between 37 and 416/7 weeks.\n      Women were enrolled prenatally on the labor and delivery unit. At birth, women were assigned\n      to one of four cord clamping/milking groups. A cohort of infants with immediate cord\n      clamping serves as reference group. Infants had blood samples drawn with the routine newborn\n      screening blood samples done at 36 to 48 hours.  Information on infant health and feeding\n      was  completed through an in-hospital visit to the mother and by home visit at two weeks of\n      age. The primary outcome measures were placental residual blood volume and compliance with\n      the various assigned cord clamping protocols. It was expected that infants with delayed cord\n      clamping or cord milking would have less placental residual blood volume and that most\n      providers would comply with the various random assignments."
