The consequences of diffusive sodium flux into the\n      patient can be chronic sodium overload leading to overhydration, hypertension,\n      cardiovascular disease, and other problems. Diffusive sodium flux out of the patient can\n      lead to intradialytic blood pressure instability.  A simple strategy for alignment of\n      dialysate and serum sodium concentrations was implemented starting in April/May 2010 in\n      order to minimize the problems particularly associated with chronic sodium overload."

This will lead to the\n      development of a matched cohort of equal size unexposed to dialysate to serum sodium\n      alignment.\n\n      The analysis is planned to investigate treatment effects, and test the effects of dialysate\n      to serum sodium alignment for interactions and associations between those laboratory and\n      clinical parameters. The extent and magnitude of sodium alignment (the operational change)\n      will also be assessed."
