            "textblock": "Investigators plan to carry out a study to investigate two different pills, Vitamin D and\n      melatonin, and whether they can reduce the spread of cancer cells in the tumors of women\n      with breast cancer. These pills are inexpensive and have very few side effects. A large\n      number of studies using cell cultures and animals have shown that both vitamin D and\n      melatonin can help destroy breast cancer cells. However thoughtful and well-designed studies\n      are necessary on humans to see if they can decrease the spread of breast cancer, and\n      possibly even prevent breast cancer. The proposed study aims to understand the anti-cancer\n      activity of vitamin D and melatonin. This knowledge will assist in creating efficient cancer\n      prevention strategies for Canadians. This study will include women with breast cancer who\n      are being planned for surgery, and will assess whether treatment with vitamin D (dose of\n      2000 IU per day) in a group of 36 women, or melatonin (dose of 20mg per day) in another\n      group of 36 women, or both pills together in yet another group of 36 women, reduces the\n      spread of cancer cells when compared to a fourth group of 36 women who are treated with\n      sugar pills. To do this we will measure a substance in the blood called Ki67, which provides\n      information about the spread of cancer. Investigators will compare the Ki67 levels in the 4\n      groups, and all women will receive identical appearing pills so they will not know which\n      treatment they received."
