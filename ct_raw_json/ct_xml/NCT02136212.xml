  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of a computerized approach/avoidance
      training (AAT) procedure in a sample of individuals diagnosed with social anxiety disorder
      (SAD). The training procedure is designed to modify automatic approach responses for
      positive social stimuli. Previous research has shown that a single administration of
      approach-positive AAT influences social behavior in the laboratory. The goal of this study
      is to examine the effects of a four-session AAT procedure on measures of positive
      social-emotional functioning. The investigators hypothesize that individuals assigned to the
      approach-positive AAT condition will demonstrate larger increases in positive affect and
      improvements in social relationship functioning from pre- to post-assessment compared to
      those assigned to the control condition.
