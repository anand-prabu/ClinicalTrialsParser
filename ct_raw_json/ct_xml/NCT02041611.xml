      The primary goal of this study is evaluate T cell immune status and immune reconstitution
      and the association with specific cytokines in patients with newly diagnosed HGGs undergoing
      the standard RT/TMZ and adjuvant TMZ.

      Numbers of T-cell subtypes at six time points in patients with newly diagnosed HGGs
      undergoing standard RT/TMZ and adjuvant TMZ:

        1. Baseline within 2 weeks before initiation of RT/TMZ

        2. At the end of RT/TMZ approximately week 6

        3. Before adjuvant TMZ approximately week 10

        4. After 2 cycle of TMZ approximately week 18

        5. After 4 cycle of TMZ approximately week 26

        6. Three month after last cycle of TMZ

      Secondary Endpoints

        1. Changes in serial T cell subtypes and cytokines levels

        2. Incidence of lymphopenia related infections

        3. Changes in T-cell numbers and subtypes with TMZ administration

        4. Overall survival
