Immunotherapy biological extracts may be useful as adjuvant therapy in\n      treating patients who have had surgery for breast cancer, colon cancer, or melanoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase III trial to study the effectiveness of Corynebacterium granulosum extract as\n      maintenance immunotherapy following surgery in treating patients with breast cancer, colon\n      cancer, or melanoma."

Patients are stratified by center and are matched with\n      case-controls by disease type and stage.\n\n      Beginning 2 weeks after surgical resection, patients receive Corynebacterium granulosum P40\n      subcutaneously weekly for 6 weeks, followed by rest for 3 months. Treatment continues for\n      life.\n\n      Patients are followed for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified"
