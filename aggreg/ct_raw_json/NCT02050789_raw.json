To investigate these issues, the investigators will be conducting a one-year,\n      prospective randomized trial to examine how flexibility of duty hour requirements affects\n      patient care when compared to current resident duty hour requirements.

Programs in the intervention arm will be granted a waiver from current duty\n      hour requirements by the ACGME and allowed to eliminate all resident duty hour rules with\n      the following exceptions: Duty hours limited to 80 hours/week averaged over 4 weeks, minimum\n      of one free day (no duty)/week averaged over 4 weeks, may not take in-house call more\n      frequently than every 3rd night, averaged over 4 weeks, allowed to increase duty requirement\n      flexibility for chief residents. The intent of the intervention arm is to allow flexibility\n      in surgical resident duty hours and improve continuity of care. Subsequently, the\n      investigators will compare multiple postoperative outcomes between the two study arms using\n      data collected through the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality\n      Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP). The results of this study will provide high-quality\n      empirical evidence upon which to base resident duty hour requirements in the future.\n\n      Updated April 1, 2014\n\n      Detailed statistical analysis plan available on the FIRST Trial website.\n      http://www.thefirsttrial.org/Approval/Approval\n\n      A listing of the 154 ACS-NSQIP hospitals that have elected to participate in the FIRST Trial\n      is available on the FIRST Trial website. http://www.thefirsttrial.org/Hospitals/Hospitals"
