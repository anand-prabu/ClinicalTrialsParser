A recently published randomized study from our\n      group shows the harmonic scalpel reduces blood loss in neck dissection but it did not offer\n      any reduction in OR time. The present study investigates the utility of the harmonic scalpel\n      in resections involving removal of oral cavity tissues as well as the neck. Oral cavity\n      resections are especially prone to blood loss and we believe the harmonic scalpel will\n      confer benefits in this type of surgery, potentially reducing the need for blood\n      transfusion."
