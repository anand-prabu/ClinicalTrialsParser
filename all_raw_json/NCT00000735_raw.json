The dose each patient receives is determined by the responses of earlier\n      patients. If the status of the HIV infection does not improve after the first 13 weeks,\n      ampligen will be stopped. Each patient maintains a daily diary listing any symptoms or\n      problems that occur such as headache, nausea, or change in appetite. Other anti-HIV drugs\n      cannot be taken during the trial, and aspirin or acetaminophen should not be taken for more\n      than 72 hours at any time during the trial without consulting the research staff. Blood will\n      be drawn at intervals during the 13-week trial and 8-week follow-up and used to determine\n      the effect of ampligen on HIV and the immune system as well as to monitor toxicity and side\n      effects."
