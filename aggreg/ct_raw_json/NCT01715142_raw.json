There is thus a rationale for\n      combining chemotherapy and antistromal drugs like nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane), a solvent\n      (Cremophor\u00ae EL)-free, albumin-bound form of paclitaxel that has been initially developed to\n      reduce the toxicities associated with Taxol injection while maintaining or improving its\n      chemotherapeutic effect. This unique protein formulation provides a novel approach of\n      increasing intra-tumoral concentrations of the drug by a receptor-mediated transport process\n      allowing transcytosis across the endothelial cell.\n\n      Abraxane has been approved for commercialization in 38 countries, including the US, Canada,\n      the EU, Australia, China, India and Korea for the treatment of women with metastatic breast\n      cancer. Abraxane alone and in combination is being evaluated in a number of cancers,\n      including metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and other solid\n      tumors."
