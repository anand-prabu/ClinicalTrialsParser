Determine the effects of CCI-779 on prostate-specific antigen levels in\n      these patients. III. Assess the pharmacokinetic parameters of CCI-779 in these patients. IV.\n      Assess the possible pharmacodynamic relationship of CCI-779 with clinical response in these\n      patients. V. Determine the impact of CCI-779 on the quality of life in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients\n      are randomized to 1 of 4 arms. Arm I: Patients receive low-dose CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes\n      weekly. Arm II: Patients receive high-dose CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes weekly. Arm III:\n      Patients receive low-dose placebo IV over 30 minutes weekly. Arm IV: Patients receive\n      high-dose placebo IV over 30 minutes weekly. Treatment continues in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who develop progressive disease while\n      receiving placebo may cross over to the equivalent dose of CCI-779. Quality of life is\n      assessed at baseline; at weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, and 36; and at final/cross-over visit. Patients\n      are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 150 patients will be accrued for this study."
