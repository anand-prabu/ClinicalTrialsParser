    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of navitoclax when given
      together with sorafenib tosylate in treating patients with solid tumors that have returned
      (relapsed) or do not respond to treatment (refractory). Navitoclax and sorafenib tosylate
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of ABT-263 (navitoclax)
      and sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate) in patients with advanced solid tumors. (Dose escalation
      cohort) II. To better characterize the toxicity profile of the combination of ABT-263 and
      sorafenib. (Expansion cohort) III. To identify any activity of this treatment combination in
      patients with metastatic cancer. (Dose escalation cohort) IV. To seek preliminary evidence
      of activity of this treatment combination in patients with hepatoma. (Expansion cohort)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the combination of ABT-263 and sorafenib induces apoptosis that can
      be detected by peripheral blood biomarker analysis. (Dose escalation cohort) II. To assess
      peripheral blood biomarkers in a more homogenous population. (Expansion cohort) III. To
      determine whether treatment is associated with myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) down
      regulation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). (Expansion
      cohort) IV. To assess in a preliminary fashion whether pretreatment tumor cell levels of
      Mcl-1, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), BCL2-like 1 (Bcl-xL),
      BCL2-associated X protein (Bax), and/or BCL2-antagonist/killer 1 (Bak) predict response to
      this regimen. (Expansion cohort)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of navitoclax.

      Patients receive navitoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 (days 1-28 course of 1
      only) and sorafenib tosylate PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 (days 8-28 of course 1 only).
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months.

The changes of the serum levels of M30/M60 at each time point against pre-treatment baseline will be correlated with toxicity and clinical endpoints. The relationships between M30/M60, caspase 3 and cytochrome c at various time points and dose levels will be explored in longitudinal data analysis.
