The cause of preeclampsia is still not\n      clear and the only therapy is preterm caesarean section. In severe preeclampsia an\n      accumulation of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins occurs. Therefore, lipid apheresis is\n      performed as lipid-removing therapy for treatment of preeclampsia in order to prolong\n      pregnancy and provide the fetus more time for maturation. In this individual treatment\n      patients with early preeclampsia (<= 32 weeks of gestation) will be offered a\n      H.E.L.P.-apheresis to postpone caesarean section and therefore prolong pregnancy."
