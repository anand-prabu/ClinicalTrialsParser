  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, two P2Y12 receptor inhibitors have been approved for clinical use: prasugrel and
      ticagrelor. Both prasugrel and ticagrelor have shown to be associated with more potent
      antiplatelet effects compared with clopidogrel and are associated with an improved net
      clinical benefit. However, to date there are limited head-to-head comparisons of these two
      new agents.

    <textblock>
      Dual antiplatelet therapy consisting of aspirin and clopidogrel is the cornerstone of
      treatment for prevention of thrombotic events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD)
      undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, there are a considerable
      number of patients who continue to have recurrent ischemic events despite this treatment
      regimen. These observations underscore the need for more potent antiplatelet therapies.
      Recently, two P2Y12 receptor inhibitors have been approved for clinical use: prasugrel and
      ticagrelor. Both prasugrel and ticagrelor have shown to be associated with more potent
      antiplatelet effects compared with clopidogrel. These more favorable pharmacodynamic effects
      translate into reduced ischemic event rates, at the expense of an increased risk of bleeding
      in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Overall, these drugs are associated with an
      improved net clinical benefit. These findings from large-scale clinical investigations have
      led to approval of prasugrel and ticagrelor. However, to date there are limited head-to-head
      comparisons of these two new agents.
