            "textblock": "Cystinuria is a rare genetic cause of kidney stones that leads to significant morbidity due\n      to the recurrent nature of the disease. Despite recent advancements in knowledge about\n      cystinuria, such as the discovery of the genetic defects that cause the disease, there have\n      been very few studies of clinical determinants of recurrent stone formation. An optimal\n      method of measuring cystine solubility in the urine has been lacking, and therefore response\n      to pharmacologic and dietary therapy is often not known. Recently, a new assay to measure\n      the amount of cystine in the urine was developed called Cystine Capacity, or CysCap.  It is\n      an assay that adds a pre-formed amount of cystine crystals to urine and measures the amount\n      of cystine the urine can take up from the solid phase (in undersaturated urine) or gives up\n      to solid phase (in supersaturated urine). This study seeks to examine how well this measure\n      of urinary cystine predicts stone occurrence, with the ultimate goal of helping to guide\n      therapy and preventing kidney stones in cystinurics.\n\n      This is an observational study over 3 years. Subjects who are enrolled in the study will\n      perform semi-annual 24-hour urine collections. They will undergo imaging of the kidneys\n      every 6 months to monitor kidney stone formation or growth, in order to correlate urinary\n      parameters with clinical events. The study will examine how well the urinary cystine\n      capacity predicts stone formation."
