            "textblock": "RATIONALE: Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the number of immune\n      cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover\n      from the side effects of chemotherapy. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell\n      transplant may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more\n      tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver\n      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining isotretinoin and\n      monoclonal antibodies may kill any remaining tumor cells following surgery. It is not yet\n      known which treatment regimen is more effective in treating neuroblastoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well combination chemotherapy with\n      or without filgrastim before surgery, high-dose chemotherapy, and radiation therapy followed\n      by isotretinoin with or without monoclonal antibody work in treating patients with\n      neuroblastoma."

Patients are stratified according to\n      disease stage (2 or 3 with MycN amplification vs 4). Patients are randomized to 1 of 8\n      treatment arms:\n\n      Arm I:\n\n        -  Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising vincristine IV, carboplatin IV over\n           1 hour, and etoposide IV over 4 hours on days 1 and 41; vincristine IV and cisplatin IV\n           over 24 hours on days 11, 31, 51, and 71; and vincristine IV on days 21 and 61 and\n           cyclophosphamide IV and etoposide over 4 hours on days 21, 22, 61, and 62. Patients\n           receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously on days 3-8, 12-18, 23-28, 32-38, 43-48,\n           52-58, 63-68, and 72 until peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection.\n\n        -  Patients undergo PBSC collection beginning on day 80. Patients then undergo surgery on\n           day 95.\n\n        -  Patients receive myeloablative therapy comprising oral busulfan 4 times daily on days\n           -6 to -3 and melphalan IV over 15 minutes on day -2. Patients undergo PBSC infusion on\n           day 0.\n\n        -  Patients undergo radiotherapy in 14 fractions over 21 days.\n\n        -  Beginning within 30 days after radiotherapy, patients receive oral isotretinoin twice\n           daily on days 1-14.
