These prototypes assist both\n      hearing rehabilitation (about 10% of the population) and tinnitus sufferers (about 17% of\n      the population).\n\n      Currently, the Brazilian Public Heath Care does not have any such hearing aids. So, the\n      development of devices for the hearing rehabilitation as well as the treatment of tinnitus\n      represents an advance in the implementation of Public Policies in Brazil.\n\n      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of the hearing aid with an integrated sound\n      generator and amplification alone for tinnitus control in patients with tinnitus associated\n      hearing loss."
