Patient has a pre-existing prosthetic valve in another position or requires\n             replacement of the mitral, pulmonary or tricuspid valve\n\n          2. Patient has had previous implant and then explant of the Model 400 aortic valve\n             bioprosthesis\n\n          3. Patient presents with active endocarditis or other systemic infection\n\n          4. Patient has a non-cardiac major or progressive disease, which in the investigator's\n             experience produces an unacceptable risk to the patient\n\n          5. Patient has a life expectancy of less than 2 years\n\n          6. Patient is participating in another investigational device or drug trial or\n             observational competitive study\n\n          7.
