            "textblock": "The study will take part at The Men's Health Center   It will involve men who have a\n      diagnosis of erectile dysfunction and also have high blood pressure.\n\n      High blood pressure can affect the lining of the arteries and cause stiffness in the\n      arteries. The arteries and veins throughout the body have a lining called the endothelium\n      which gives them the ability to stretch.  If the lining of the penile arteries becomes\n      impaired, it can decrease the stretching of the artery and decrease blood flow.   Decreased\n      blood flow in the penile arteries can cause problems obtaining an erection.\n\n      The study medication Nebivolol controls blood pressure by relaxing smooth muscle around the\n      lining of the arteries, thereby improving stretch and blood flow.\n\n      The primary objective is to determine if treatment with nebivolol improves endothelial\n      function and erectile function in men with pre-hypertension and stage 1 hypertension\n\n      70 men will be enrolled into the study.  Half of the subjects will receive active medication\n      and half will receive a placebo.  All men will receive educational informational handouts\n      about blood pressure and behavior modifications to improve blood pressure.  The study will\n      last for 3 months for each subject.  The expected recruitment time is one year, with a 2\n      year study completion goal. Subjects will have approximately 5 study visits.\n\n      Subjects will have initial/final blood work, a Rigiscan test (a take home penile erection\n      test), two EndoPat tests to assess endothelium function, 3 SphygmoCor tests to assess\n      central blood pressure, 2 sexual health questionnaires at 2 visits. Vital signs will be\n      monitored at each visit to assess safety and effectiveness of the study medication."
