  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 10 minute baseline survey will be administered to parents of healthy newborn infants while
      in the hospital after delivery at Brigham and Women's Hospital, to be followed by a 25
      minute survey 3-24 months later. We will measure parents' attitudes and preferences related
      to genome screening of newborns. The specific aims of this study are:

        1. To investigate whether parents' opinions regarding genome screening of newborns change
           between the first 48 hours post-partum and 3-24 months post-partum.

           a. We hypothesize that there will not be significant differences between interest in
           genome screening results in the 48 hours post-partum compared to 3-24 months
           post-partum.

        2. To determine whether seeing hypothetical genome screening results affects parents'
           decisions regarding whether they would want genome screening for their newborn.

             1. We expect many parents to state initially (in the 48 hours post-partum) that they
                would elect to have genome screening for their newborn if it were available. In
                the follow-up survey, half of study participants will receive hypothetical
                scenarios in which they will need to struggle with the probabilistic and ambiguous
                nature of the information that could be derived from genome sequencing. We will
                examine whether this alters their preferences. We will also explore whether
                parents who receive hypothetical genome screening results scenarios are more
                likely to alter their preferences than parents who do not receive hypothetical
                scenarios.

    <description>Newborn screening refusals are very rare. When they occur, they are tracked by nurses on the postpartum inpatient unit. At the start of all shifts for study recruitment, the research assistant will ask the nurse-in-charge if any patients refused newborn screening since the previous study recruitment shift.</description>
