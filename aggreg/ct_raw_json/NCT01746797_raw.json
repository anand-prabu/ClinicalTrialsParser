Specifically, these phases include: 1) the phase prior to egg\n      retrieval, 2) the phase after embryo transfer while a woman waits for the pregnancy test or\n      her menstrual period, and 3) the phase after the experience of a negative pregnancy test\n      (when applicable) following an IVF cycle. We seek to characterize factors associated both\n      with vulnerability to more depressive symptoms and to resilience in the context of the\n      different phases of IVF treatment.\n\n      Specific Aim #4 (exploratory): To identify biological markers of stress, including HPA axis\n      dysregulation and inflammation associated with depressive relapse, during IVF treatment.\n\n      Hypothesis: Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation, evidenced by increases\n      in diurnal salivary cortisol patterns and markers of inflammation, will be associated with\n      higher"
