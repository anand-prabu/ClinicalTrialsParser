  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current therapeutic approaches for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases like
      Alzheimer disease (AD) offer limited and often transient symptomatic benefits to patients
      but do not mitigate the insidious loss of neuronal cells. In this trial the investigators
      will evaluate Efficacy and Tolerability of MLC601 as a neuroprotective in Patients with Mild
      to Moderate Alzheimer Disease who Were Unable to Tolerate or Failed to Benefit from
      Treatment with Rivastigmine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An 18-month open-label pilot study would be conducted at three university referral centres
      in Tehran, Iran. All patients are at least 50 years old, met the criteria for AD according
      to the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV),
      and failed treatment with the cholinesterase inhibitor Rivastigmine for any reason. A
      baseline medical history will be taken and physical examination will be performed for all
      participants, and any comorbidities and concomitant therapies would be noted. Patients with
      controlled concomitant diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes, will be allowed to enter
      the study. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)10 and Alzheimer disease assessment
      scale-cognitive sub scale11 (ADAS-cog) will be used to measure treatment efficacy. MLC601
      will be prescribed as one capsule three times daily without an escalation dose. Safety and
      tolerability evaluations included physical examinations, electrocardiography, vital sign
      monitoring and laboratory testing weekly for the first 8 weeks and every 4 weeks thereafter.
      The MMSE and ADAS-cog will be recorded at each efficacy follow-up visit.
