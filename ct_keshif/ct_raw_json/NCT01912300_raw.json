To date no study has\n      been conducted to question whether or not such modern sedentary activities induce energy\n      consumption modification in youth. The aim of this work is to compare the impact of a\n      passive video games vs. active video games vs. physical exercise in terms of subsequent\n      energy intake and appetite feelings in normal weight and obese youth."
