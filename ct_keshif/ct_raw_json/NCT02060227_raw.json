At least 3 anchors will be used for the bankart repair for repair of the labrum with an inferior to superior capsular shift.  The suture anchors used will be at the discretion of the surgeon but will be of the screw-in variety.   The sutures are passed through the labrum, and the labrum is tied to the glenoid rim after the bone is prepared in the standard fashion.  The surgical times will be recorded on standardized forms."

Harvesting of a 2.5- to 3-cm coracoid graft allows use of 2 screws for fixation to the glenoid neck through a subscapularis-splitting approach. The stump of the CAL is repaired to the capsule with the arm positioned in neutral.  The graft is placed in a extra-articular fashion with capsular closure to the native glenoid rim."
