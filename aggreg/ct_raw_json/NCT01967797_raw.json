The 5As of Obesity Management suite of\n      tools is a robust, evidence-based approach to weight management, however its implementation\n      and uptake has been heterogeneous in primary care.\n\n      This project was co-created by, and will be implemented with, our partners the Southside\n      Primary Care Network (SSPCN).  A needs assessment on weight management by the SSPCN revealed\n      the need to change provider practice to increase the number of weight management visits.\n      Despite a robust didactic training session on weight management for all providers, which\n      includes the 5As, the uptake in practice has been highly heterogeneous. Thus, the 5AsT\n      intervention to address the implementation of the 5As of Obesity Management in clinical\n      practice was developed by the collaborative team. The SSPCN consists of 25 autonomous groups\n      of multidisciplinary professionals that provide service to a defined group of patients\n      within the SSPCN.\n\n      The 5As Team consists of multidisciplinary providers (Registered Nurse/ Nurse Practitioner,\n      dietician, mental health worker) who work collaboratively. The intervention is a learning\n      collaborative where these 12 different 5AsTs get together to work to address facilitators\n      and barriers to weight management in their settings over a 6 month period.  Half of the\n      teams (N=12) will remain as controls and deliver usual care. They serve as a comparison\n      group for the 5AsTs. This mixed methods study's primary outcomes will assess the change in\n      provider practice and the effectiveness of the intervention and implementation.\n\n      To assess the impact of 5AsT on patients, we will recruit patients presenting to the central\n      SSPCN programming, We will not intervene directly on patients; we will observe the impact of\n      the 5AsT and SSPCN programming on their health outcomes for a minimum of 6 months, and where\n      possible for 18 months.  Data collected includes demographics, weight (BMI), waist\n      circumference, vital signs,and Short Form-12 (SF-12,these measures are routinely measured in\n      the SSPCN), EuroQol-5 dimensions 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L), modified patient assessment of chronic\n      illness (PACIC), and observed adherence to routine clinical care for guideline recommended\n      laboratory monitoring (cholesterol panel, fasting glucose, HbA1c, where appropriate)."

            "textblock": "Obesity is a public health problem as it is associated with many co-morbidities, decreased\n      life expectancy and high health care costs. In 2008, prevalence of obesity and overweight,\n      combined, in Canada was 62.1%. Supported by Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR) and\n      Public Health Agencies of Canada Innovation strategy, the Canadian Obesity Network developed\n      a novel tool for obesity counseling and management in primary care settings know as the \"5As\n      of Obesity Management\". However, despite current dissemination strategies and extensive\n      provider education in the 5As, the uptake of current practices for weight management has\n      been inconsistent. Evidence suggests that treating obesity can reduce the incidence of a\n      number of chronic diseases, and that obesity is not effectively managed in our current\n      health care system.This project was co-created by, and will be implemented with, our\n      partners the Southside Primary Care Network (SSPCN).\n\n      The main goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a pragmatic intervention called the\n      5As Team Intervention(5AsT) which acts on health professionals, forming them into a 6 month\n      learning collaborative that undergoes an iterative, action based process to address\n      facilitators and barriers to weight management.\n\n      Primary Objective:\n\n      Increase the number of weight management visits conducted by SSPCN Registered Nurses/Nurse\n      Practitioners (RN/NPs).\n\n      Primary questions:\n\n        1. Does the 5As Team (5AsT) intervention affect the number of weight management visits\n           conducted by SSPCN practitioners (RN/NP) in their SSPCN practice?\n\n        2. Under what circumstances does the 5AsT intervention affect the number of weight\n           management visits conducted by the SSPCN practitioners?\n\n        3. Are changes in weight management visit rates sustained following the intervention\n           period?\n\n        4. What is the impact of implementation of 5AsT on practice level outcomes - on unique 5As\n           Teams and the SSPCN?\n\n      Secondary Objective:\n\n      To evaluate the impact of SSPCN weight management programming, with and without this 5AsT\n      intervention, on patient important outcomes including: weight (BMI), blood pressure, self\n      reported health status (EQ5D,SF-12), and patient-reported measures of chronic disease\n      management for obesity (modified PACIC), as well as completion of appropriate laboratory\n      studies (HbA1c for diabetics, fasting glucose, and cholesterol panel for age>40).\n\n      Design: This is a mixed methods, pragmatic cluster randomized trial in regular practice. The\n      quantitative portion focuses on provider weight management visits, and patient-important\n      outcomes above. For the patient study, 2 primary patient outcomes the study is powered for\n      are BMI and SF-12, the remainder above are secondary patient outcomes. The qualitative\n      portion seeks to understand the implementation process and the efficacy of the 5AsT\n      intervention. Practitioners affiliated with different clinical groups will be randomized to\n      intervention or control. All practitioners receive a robust didactic training program in\n      weight management. The intervention group practitioners will participate in a 6 month 5AsT\n      learning collaborative to address barriers to implementation of effective weight management\n      strategies based upon the 5As of Obesity Management tool kit. Interested patients presenting\n      to the central SSPCN programming will be recruited to participate in the study. There is no\n      study intervention on the patients; the study will only observe how they are doing on their\n      weight management journey in the SSPCN - whether they come from an intervention or control\n      practice group. We will conduct a rigorous qualitative analysis of the intervention process\n      using numerous qualitative tools to assess both the intervention itself and participant\n      views. A qualitative plan has been created that outlines the use of field notes, focus\n      groups and interviews to collect data and the use of Thematic Analysis and Nvivo software\n      for analysis.\n\n      Intervention: The 5As Team (5AsT) Program intervention in this study is based on behavior\n      change theory. The Teams are groups of SSPCN practitioners (RN/NP, Social work, Registered\n      Dietitian) who practice collaboratively in the community (N=25). The intervention group\n      (N=12 teams) will participate in an additional 6 month intensive learning collaborative\n      model designed around the 5As of obesity management, but which addresses areas identified as\n      barriers (i.e. weight bias, clinical environment, clinic processes & team based care, mental\n      health, counseling around emotional eating, caregiver fatigue, designing appropriate patient\n      follow-up, and additional topics identified by the professionals). A clinical Champion\n      identified by our partner SSPCN will be available to provide 1:1 support and coaching of the\n      practitioners & teams as needed. The practitioners will work collaboratively to do their own\n      needs assessment, and will identify additional resources or tools that they need to overcome\n      the barriers to weight management in their setting. The research team will use a Practice\n      Facilitation model to provide additional resource and support to the change process for the\n      practitioners.\n\n      Setting: The SSPCN is one of the largest Primary Care Networks (PCN) in Alberta, which\n      serves an ethnically and socially diverse population from 45 community family practices. The\n      SSPCN centralizes  programs that are not available at independent family practices. Also,\n      each primary care center has a SSPCN team of personnel who reports directly to the SSPCN,\n      and are responsible for delivering services to patients from that patient catchment."
