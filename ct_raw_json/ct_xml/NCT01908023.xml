  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every year, almost 3000 Norwegian women are diagnosed with breast cancer. Various symptoms
      of short-and long-term side effects may be experienced, such as physical deterioration,
      reduced quality of life and fatigue. At St.Olavs Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital,
      all out-patients undergoing post operative radiotherapy are currently offered participation
      in group exercise training sessions. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate these
      out-patient group exercise sessions.
