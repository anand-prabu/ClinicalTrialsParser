All of the children will be part of\n      the study for up to 2 years and will be asked to come back for study visits every 3 months,\n      when they come for their routine care. The study will also look at the records of all\n      children receiving care at the study health facilities and will enroll children already\n      taking ARVs for a one-time visit."
