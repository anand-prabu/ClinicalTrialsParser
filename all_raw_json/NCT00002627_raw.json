Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace\n      immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy used to kill tumor cells, allowing higher\n      doses of chemotherapy to be used.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel when added to high-dose\n      combination chemotherapy followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating women\n      with breast cancer at high risk of relapse."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel when given with high-dose\n      carboplatin/cyclophosphamide with autologous peripheral blood stem cell support in women\n      with high-risk stage II/III breast cancer. II. Assess the nonhematologic toxicities\n      associated with this combination. III. Assess the progression-free and overall survival of\n      these patients following this treatment.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-finding study. All patients undergo collection of peripheral blood\n      stem cells (PBSC) with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilization prior to\n      high-dose chemotherapy. Cohorts of 3-5 patients are treated at successively higher dose\n      levels of paclitaxel until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is found. Paclitaxel is given as a\n      single 6-hour infusion, followed by fixed doses of high-dose cyclophosphamide for 2 days,\n      then carboplatin for 3 days. Four days later, patients receive PBSC and G-CSF for\n      hematopoietic reconstitution. Additional patients are entered at the MTD. Patients are\n      followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, then every 4-6 months\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: It is expected that 24-30 patients will be accrued; a study duration of\n      1-1.5 years is anticipated."
