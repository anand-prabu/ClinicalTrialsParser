Clinical laboratory tests to\n      be performed include: a CBC with differential and reticulocyte count; PT/aPTT; and serum\n      chemistries (BUN, creatinine, total and direct bilirubin, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase,\n      and LDH). A chest x-ray and MRI/MRA of the brain will also be done at Screening to rule out\n      underlying disease.\n\n      If the patient is found through the screening process to be eligible, the 1st Treatment\n      Phase begins. Baseline safety assessments and measurement of biomarkers are completed, then\n      the subject is randomized to receive rivaroxaban or placebo.  After 4 weeks of treatment,\n      there is a 2-Week Wash-Out Phase. After the Wash-Out Phase,  another set of baseline studies\n      are performed and the 2nd Treatment Phase begins.  For this Phase of the study, the subject\n      \"crosses over\" to receive whatever treatment - rivaroxaban or placebo - that they did not\n      receive in the 1st Treatment Phase.  After taking the assigned study drug for 4 weeks, the\n      2nd Treatment Phase ends. The subject returns 2 weeks after the last dose of study treatment\n      for the Follow-Up Phase, consisting of a single end-of-study visit during which safety\n      assessments are repeated."
