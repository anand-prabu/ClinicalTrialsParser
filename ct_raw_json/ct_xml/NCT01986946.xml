      1. Protocol Title - A Comparison of Epidural Analgesia with Standard Care Following Lumbar
           Spinal Fusion:  A Prospective Randomized Study

        2. Purpose of the Study - This prospective randomized study will enroll 200 patients
           undergoing elective Lumbar Spinal Fusion at Duke University Hospital.  The primary
           objective is to determine the effect of epidural analgesia, as compared with standard
           care, on post-operative analgesia.

      Hypothesis:

      The investigators hypothesize that patients undergoing Lumbar Spinal Fusion surgery with
      epidural catheter placement will have superior post-operative analgesia compared to patients
      undergoing standard care.
