Patients enrolled in this study will be\n      pre-screened and have a diagnosis of an infrarenal AAA with or without the need for\n      treatment of iliac artery aneurysm, are candidates for endovascular repair, and meet the\n      eligibility criteria. Patients enrolled in the study will participate in follow-up visits 31\n      days, 6 months and at 1 year following the index procedure. At the follow-up visits there\n      will be a clinical assessment, blood collection, and abdominal CT imaging of the patient."
