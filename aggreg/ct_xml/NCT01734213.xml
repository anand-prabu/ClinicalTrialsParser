    <textblock>
      The investigators performed a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human
      trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Eriobotyra Japonica Lindley Extract on
      improvement of Cognitive Function. The investigators measured improvement of Cognitive
      Function parameters , including K-MMSE, Ability to perform working memory tasks, CNT and
      BCRS, and monitored their blood pressure.
