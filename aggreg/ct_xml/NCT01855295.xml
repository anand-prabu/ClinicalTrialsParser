  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor nutritional status as evidenced by low body mass index, low muscle mass or low serum
      albumin is a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality in dialysis patients.
      Hypercatabolism induced by inflammation is widely considered the cause of uremic
      malnutrition even though there is no clear evidence that hemodialysis patients with elevated
      C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are at greater risk of losing weight or muscle mass.
      Conversely, there is little data on whether dialysis patients with malnutrition and elevated
      C-reactive protein levels would gain muscle mass with protein supplementation.

      The investigator hypothesize that protein supplementation during dialysis will improve
      muscle mass, functional status and quality of life in inflamed malnourished hemodialysis
      patients. Therefore, the objectives of the current proposal are to examine in malnourished
      (BM &lt; 23 kg/m2 or serum creatinine &lt; 8 mg%) hemodialysis patients with inflammation (high
      sensitivity CRP &gt; 3 mg/dl), the effects of protein supplementation on

        1. Muscle mass as determined by creatinine kinetics

        2. Functional status as assessed by 6 min walk

        3. Quality of life as assessed by SF-12

      Design: Open labeled trial.

      Patient Selection Criteria: The study will consist of men and women (age ≥ 18 years) on
      hemodialysis for at least 3 months with inflammation (hsCRP &gt; 3 mg%) and either BMI &lt; 23
      kg/m2  or low muscle mass as evidenced by serum creatinine &lt; 8 mg% in the presence of anuria
      (urine output &lt; 200 ml/d) and adequate dialysis (URR &gt; 65%).

      Exclusion criteria: Unable to give informed consent, prisoner or pregnant women

      Recruitment and Randomization: Men and women aged 18 or older receiving care at the
      University of Utah dialysis centers.

      Study procedures: Men and women on hemodialysis for at least for 3 months with malnutrition
      (defined as BMI less than 23 kg/m2 or serum creatinine &lt; 8 mg%) will be approached to
      determine whether they want to participate in the study. If they are interested, the study
      purpose and procedures will be explained and informed consent obtained. 5 ml of screening
      blood will be obtained before dialysis to measure CRP. If it is greater than &gt; 3 mg%, that
      individual will be eligible to participate in the study. Participants will be asked to
      complete a brief questionnaire on demographics (age, gender, race, education), comorbid
      conditions, physical activity level and quality of life. Height, weight, and waist
      circumference will be measured.  Relevant data on dialysis, medications, laboratory markers
      will be obtained from the electronic medical records.

      The investigators anticipate to obtain screening blood draw in about 80 participants and
      that about half of these will have elevated CRP and qualify to participate in the study. The
      40 participants will receive dietary advice to increase protein intake to 1.2 g/kg/day and
      monitored for 12 weeks. Then, each participant will receive 45 grams of liquid protein
      supplement at each dialysis treatment for additional 12 weeks for total study duration of 24
      weeks. Compliance and tolerance of the supplement will be monitored.

      Protein supplementation such as Boost, Procel or liquid supplements is used regularly in
      dialysis patients. The protein supplement used in the study is Provide Sugar Free produced
      by Provide Nutrition LC. The Food and Drug Administration regulates it as a nutrition
      supplement. It is a liquid supplement made from enzyme hydrolyzed collagen protein. This
      supplement is used in malnutrition, bariatric surgery, dialysis, poor appetite, and wound
      care. The investigators chose this supplement because the investigators were able to get it
      at a reduced cost. There is no data available to show that this supplement is better or
      worse than any other supplements currently available. The manufacturer states that the sugar
      free Provide is phosphorous free. However, the investigators will monitor phosphorous levels
      in the study patients.

      Pre-dialysis blood sample (15 ml in lithium heparin tube) and post dialysis blood sample (5
      ml in lithium heparin tube) will be drawn at baseline, 4, 12, 16 and 20 weeks. Pre and post
      dialysis creatinine along with 44-hour urine collection for creatinine will be obtained at
      baseline 4, 12, 16 and 24 weeks for estimating muscle mass using creatinine kinetics2. SF-12
      for quality of life will be obtained at baseline 4, 12, 16, and 24 weeks. Distances walked
      during in 6-minutes will be recorded at baseline, 4, 12, 16 and 24 weeks.

      Assays of Serum analytes:

        1. Interleukin-6: The measurement of serum IL-6 will be performed using an IMMULITE 1000
           analyzer and reagents from Diagnostic Products Corporation.  The performance
           characteristics of this immunoassay include an analytic measurement range of 2 to 1000
           pg/mL, imprecision of &lt;7.6% from 88 to 1000 pg/mL, and a reference interval of &lt;6
           pg/mL.

        2. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha: The measurement of serum TNF- alpha will be performed
           using an IMMULITE 1000 analyzer and reagents from Diagnostic Products Corporation.  The
           performance characteristics of this immunoassay include an analytic measurement range
           of 2 to 1000 pg/mL, imprecision of &lt;6.6% from 17 to 788 pg/mL, and a reference interval
           of &lt;8 pg/mL.

        3. hsCRP: The measurement of serum C-reactive protein will be performed using the
           FDA-cleared Roche Tina-quant latex high sensitivity kit on a Roche MODULAR P analyzer.
           The performance characteristics of this turbidimetric assay include an analytic
           measurement range of 0.1 to 20 mg/L and imprecision of &lt;5.8%.

        4. Insulin: The measure of insulin will be performed using a Diagnostic Products
           Corporation kit on an IMMULITE 2000 analyzer.  The performance characteristics of this
           immunoassay include an analytic measurement range of 2 to 300 mIU/L , imprecision of
           &lt;7.4% from 8 to 291 mIU/L, and a fasting reference interval of &lt;29 mIU/L.
