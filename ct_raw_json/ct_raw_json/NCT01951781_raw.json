            "textblock": "Diagnosis of late-onset sepsis is difficult in the absence of specific clinical signs and\n      biological markers in the infection initial phase .The aim of this study is to determine the\n      performance of a new infection marker : Neutrophil CD64 for early diagnosis in nosocomial\n      infection (NI) in preterm newborns.\n\n      METHODS :\n\n        -  Monocentric prospective study including preterm newborn infants (<37 weeks of\n           gestationnal age ) with clinical suspicion of nosocomial infection in a neonatal\n           intensice care unit (Neonatal intensive care unit of Montpellier, France).\n\n        -  Patients will be enrolled in the study after informed consents. Rapid and automated\n           CD64 measurment will be realized during the  conventional blood sample including\n           C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Procalcitonin (PCT) and blood culture.\n\n        -  Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy can be started on the advice of clinician and blinded\n           the result of CD64. Patients will be then classed in three groups using CDC criteria\n           (center for disease control) : 1-no infection, 2-infection, 3-possible infection during\n           the multidisciplinary staff. Specificity, sensitivity, negative and positive value of\n           CD64 will be calculated and the performances of CRP, PCT and CD64 will be compared.\n\n           153 patients are needed in the study enrolled during a period of 12 months.\n\n      PERSPECTIVES Neutrophil CD64 monitoring might be help clinicians to manage nosocomial\n      infections in neonates.CD64 allow to integrate in a decision algorithm with the\n      determination of the best cut-off value to faster processing nosocomial infections and could\n      help to reduce unnecessary antibioc therapy. A rapid technique for determination of CD64\n      should be readily available in our unit."
