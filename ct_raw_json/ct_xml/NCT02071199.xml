      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of oral topical application of
      Amnion-derived Cellular Cytokine Solution (ACCS) in subjects with gingivitis

    <textblock>
      This randomized blinded study will evaluate the use of ACCS in subjects with gingivitis.
      Two doses of ACCS will be used.  It will be given topically intra-orally daily Monday
      through Friday for 2 weeks.  In the first cohort, a low dose of ACCS or saline will be given
      by random chance.  If there are no safety issues, cohort two will include a higher dose of
      ACCS randomized with saline.  Pocket depth, plaque index, gingival index, and bleeding on
      probing will be assessed.  To assess shifts in supragingival flora, a qualitative and
      quantitative microbial analysis will be performed for common oral bacteria. There will also
      be an analysis of inflammatory cytokines in crevicular fluid at the beginning and end of the
      study.  Comparisons of adverse events and outcomes will be made between the subjects
      receiving low dose ACCS, high dose ACCS, and saline.
