Assess the effect of immunosuppression with muromonab-CD3, cyclosporine,\n      methylprednisolone, and prednisone versus standard care in terms of death, heart\n      transplantation, or left ventricular assistive device placement in patients with giant cell\n      myocarditis.\n\n      II.  Compare left ventricular ejection fraction prior to and after 4 weeks of treatment in\n      these arms.\n\n      III.  Compare the degree of myocardial inflammatory infiltrate prior to and after 4 weeks of\n      treatment in these arms."

Oral cyclosporine is administered twice daily and oral prednisone is\n      administered once daily for 1 year.\n\n      Arm II: Patients receive standard care with or without immunosuppression (no muromonab-CD3\n      or cyclosporine).\n\n      Patients are followed for one year."
