Impaired\n      endothelial function (assessed as flow-mediated dilation) represents an early marker for\n      later cardiovascular events. Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that\n      consumption of tea is associated with lower progression of atherosclerosis and reduced\n      cardiovascular mortality.\n\n      Tea contains high amounts of polyphenols with important biological activities. The green tea\n      catechin epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the most potent physiologically active\n      compound in vitro. However, little is known about its contribution to beneficial effects of\n      tea in vivo.\n\n      In this crossover study the impact of a single dose of EGCG applied in different forms\n      (green tea beverage, green tea extract and EGCG) on flow-mediated dilation is investigated\n      in healthy volunteers two hours after ingestion. The amount of EGCG (200 mg) corresponds to\n      appr. 0.5 L of green tea. The results of the study will elucidate the contribution of EGCG\n      in cardiovascular protective effects of green tea in vivo. The outcomes will provide\n      insights about the role of EGCG in different application forms to improvements of\n      endothelial function in humans."
