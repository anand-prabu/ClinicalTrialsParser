            "textblock": "The goal of this research program is to implement a series of psychoeducational training\n      classes designed to teach individuals with schizophrenia the importance of medication\n      treatment, how to identify and manage medication side effects, and how to make appointments\n      and emergency plans.  The skills taught to the research subjects will lead to demonstrable\n      increases (compared to the control group) in adherence to both the prescribed medication\n      regimen and scheduled outpatient appointments and thereby cause a decrease (again compared\n      to the control group) in rehospitalization rates and bed-days during subsequent twelve\n      months following the intervention.  A secondary objective of this work is that if the CREP\n      program is successful and/or illness education is effective, the data will be able to\n      disseminated throughout the VISN 22 via the recently awarded Mental Illness Research\n      Education and Clinical Center (MIRECC) program."
