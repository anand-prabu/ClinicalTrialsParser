Combining vaccine therapy with interleukin-2 may be a more\n      effective treatment for follicular lymphoma .\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy plus interleukin-2 in\n      treating patients who have stage III, stage IV, or recurrent follicular lymphoma."

Patients are stratified according to prior therapy (no\n      prior biologic therapy or chemotherapy for lymphoma vs prior prednisone, doxorubicin,\n      cyclophosphamide, and etoposide (PACE) chemotherapy). Patients without prior therapy are\n      further stratified according to accessibility of lymph nodes (easily accessible (stratum Ia)\n      vs not easily accessible (stratum Ib)).\n\n      All patients undergo lymph node biopsy to obtain tissue for vaccine manufacture. Treatment\n      begins approximately 1 month after biopsy.\n\n        -  Stratum Ia: Patients receive autologous tumor cell vaccine and interleukin-2 (IL-2)\n           intranodally and subcutaneously (SC) on day 1.\n\n        -  Stratum Ib and stratum II: Patients receive autologous tumor cell vaccine and IL-2 SC\n           on day 1.\n\n      Treatment in each stratum continues every 4 weeks for a maximum of 5 courses in the absence\n      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1 and 4 months, every 3 months for 1 year, and every 6 months\n      thereafter until relapse or progression of disease.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients (10 per stratum) will be accrued for this study\n      within 1.5-2 years."
