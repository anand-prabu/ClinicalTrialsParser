            "textblock": "Treatment of infections in critically ill patients remains a significant challenge to\n      intensivists world-wide with persisting high mortality and morbidity. Compelling evidence\n      suggests that source control of the pathogen and appropriate antibiotic therapy remain the\n      most important interventions to improve patients' outcome, the latter including the\n      administration of a suitable molecule at an optimized dosage regimen.\n\n      Daptomycin is the first representative of a new family of antibiotics, the cyclic\n      lipopeptides. Its bactericidal effect against Gram-positive bacteria, including\n      meticillin-resistant strains, and its low renal toxicity, make it a useful antibiotic in\n      critically ill patients having infections due to resistant Gram positive strains.\n\n      Unfortunately, no PK study has been performed in infected critically ill patients without\n      renal replacement therapy. A vast array of pathophysiological changes can occur in infected\n      critically ill patients, leading to changes in volume of distribution and clearance of\n      antibiotics in these patients, which may affect the antibiotic concentration at the target\n      site.\n\n      It is therefore important to better characterize daptomycin PK in infected patients with\n      various degrees of renal failure in order to define optimal dosing regimens.\n\n      This project aims to identify optimal daptomycin administration schemes in critical care\n      patients with various degrees of renal impairment"
