  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine whether one week of phentermine compared to placebo
      administration results in changes in food intake during a laboratory meal.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to explore whether short-term measures of eating behavior can be related to
      later, longer-term weight loss. In a double-blind, randomized fashion, participants will be
      asked to take study medication for three weeks: one week of phentermine and two weeks of
      placebo. At the end of the first and third weeks, participants will be asked to participate
      in a range of eating behavior studies. Following this three-week, double-blind phase,
      participants will be offered 6 months of open treatment for weight loss.
