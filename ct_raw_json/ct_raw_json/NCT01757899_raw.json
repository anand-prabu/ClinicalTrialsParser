            "textblock": "Scientific background. Dysregulated systemic inflammation - characterized by protracted\n      elevation of inflammatory cytokines in the circulation - is a key pathogenetic mechanism for\n      morbidity and mortality in ALI/ARDS, and is associated with tissue insensitivity and/or\n      resistance to inappropriately elevated endogenous glucocorticoids. In one study, prolonged\n      methylprednisolone treatment of ARDS patients resulted in rapid and sustained reduction in\n      circulating and pulmonary levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and procollagen.\n\n      Preliminary work. Two recent metanalysis evaluating the use of low doses of corticosteroids\n      in acute lung injury/ARDS in adults reported a significant physiological improvement, a\n      sizable reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay and reduction\n      in mortality.\n\n      Hypothesis. We hypothesized that prolonged administration of low doses of methylprednisolone\n      in pediatric ALI/ARDS is safe and downregulates systemic inflammation and leads to earlier\n      resolution of pulmonary and extra pulmonary organ dysfunction and a reduction in duration of\n      mechanical ventilation and ICU stay.\n\n      Objective. To investigate the effects of prolonged low-dose methylprednisolone infusion on\n      pulmonary function (LIS and ventilation-free days),  extra pulmonary organ function (PMODS\n      score), inflammatory markers - RCP (Reactive C Protein), IL6 (Interleukine 6), TNF\u03b1 (Tumor\n      Necrosis Factor), IL8 (Interleukine 8), IL10 (Interleukine 10)  and length of Pediatric\n      Intensive Care Unit (PICU) stay in early ALI/ARDS in children.\n\n      Study design. Prospective randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial."
