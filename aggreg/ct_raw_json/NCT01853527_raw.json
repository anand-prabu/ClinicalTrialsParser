Better characterization of patients with symptomatic non-obstructive\n      CAD due to myocardial ischemia will be done by vascular assessment by tonometry, biochemical\n      and genetic markers as well as quality of life questionnaire. This interdisciplinary project\n      is expected to add new knowledge to the impact of multimodality cardiac imaging in improving\n      diagnosis in patients with symptomatic non-obstructive CAD."
