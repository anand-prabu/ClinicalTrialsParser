  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, blinded prospective study comparing the use of the usual
      cutting guides with a palm-sized digital surgical navigation system in unilateral total knee
      arthroplasty. Analysis of pre- and post-operative X-rays will be used to compare alignment
      of the tibial (shinbone) implant components. The investigators expect that the FDA-approved
      hand-held surgical navigation device will increase the accuracy and precision of the tibial
      cut by telling the surgeon the exact position of the cutting block before the surgeon makes
      the cut, allowing minor adjustments to be made. The investigators expect the conventional
      device to take less time to use, but that this difference will decrease as the surgeon
      becomes more familiar with the device. The investigators expect the intraoperative
      measurements acquired by the KneeAlign system to strongly correlate with the radiographic
      alignments measured postoperatively.

    <textblock>
      Medical records, private office charts, and electronic medical records will be utilized by
      the co-investigators to review data on patients who fit the previously stated inclusion
      criteria.  Demographic data including age, gender, height (cm), and weight (kg) will be
      collected.  Preoperative, standing anteroposterior hip-to-ankle radiographs will be measured
      for the lower extremity mechanical axis, the tibiofemoral anatomic alignment, and the distal
      femoral and proximal tibial anatomic angles. Intraoperative time measurements for use of
      both the conventional extramedullary alignment guide, and the KneeAlignTM system will be
      measured and recorded. The time required to utilize each alignment guide will be measured in
      seconds, starting from the time at which the surgeon is handed the alignment guide
      (KneeAlignTM or conventional, extramedullary), to the time at which the surgeon is handed
      the oscillating saw to make the tibial cut. Of note, no intraoperative alignment
      measurements are required or will be recorded for the conventional, extramedullary systems,
      while intraoperative alignments reported by the KneeAlignTM system will be recorded when the
      KneeAlignTM device is used. In addition, regarding the use of conventional, extramedullary
      tibial guides, each surgeon will utilize the guide (regardless of manufacturer) which they
      currently use most frequently when performing a total knee arthroplasty. While there may be
      minimal differences with regards each of the surgeon's conventional guides, they are all
      essentially the same with regards to utilizing an extramedullary rod for alignment of the
      tibial resection.

      Currently, a total knee replacement requires an average tourniquet time of 30-50 minutes
      depending on the surgeon. We estimate an approximate increase in total tourniquet time of
      5-6 minutes when using the hand-held surgical navigation system.

      For each procedure (either KneeAlignTM or conventional, extramedullary guides), after making
      the initial cut, if at any point in the procedure the surgeon re-cuts the tibia, they will
      be asked a series of questions postoperatively as to why they re-cut the tibia as part of
      the data collection. These questions will include:

        1. Did you re-cut the tibia because you thought more varus or valgus was required?

        2. Did you re-cut the tibia to increase or decrease the posterior slope?

        3. Did you re-cut the tibia to increase the amount of bone resected?

        4. Were you happy with the overall tibial alignment? Postoperative radiographs will be
           obtained as part of each surgeon's postoperative protocol, and will include a standing
           anteroposterior hip-to-ankle radiograph and a standing lateral knee-to-ankle
           radiograph, from which the lower extremity mechanical axis, the tibiofemoral anatomic
           alignment, the tibial component mechanical alignment, and the tibial component
           posterior slope will be measured.

      This study has the potential to provide significant information regarding the clinical
      accuracy and precision of the KneeAlignTM system compared to that of conventional,
      extramedullary alignment systems. If mechanical and tibial mechanical alignment is
      significantly improved with the use of the KneeAlignTM system, this may encourage surgeons
      to utilize this device to improve postoperative alignment in total knee arthroplasty. In
      addition, surgeon's may find this type of hand-held system more user-friendly (in contrast
      to a large console, computer-assisted surgical system), and this may stimulate future
      investigations into similar devices for femoral component alignment, and also total hip
      arthroplasty.
