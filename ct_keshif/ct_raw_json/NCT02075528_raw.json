Some second-generation\n      antipsychotics have been found that using the first 2 weeks' treatment results to predict\n      the fourth or sixth week's treatment response is acceptable.\n\n      The primary aim of this study is to investigate:\n\n        1. . whether the early prediction model used in other atypicals could also be applied in\n           paliperidone ER.\n\n        2. .
