A total of 48 volunteers will be followed for 12 week after initiation of daily\n      use of Lactobcillus casei Shirota or placebo, randomized in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n      We hypothesize that use of the Yakult product containing Lactobacillus casei Shirota after\n      12 weeks of continuous use will increase the level of CD4+ T-cells, at least, 50 cells/mm\u00b3.\n\n      We also propose to investigate several markers of immune response, including T cellular\n      activation and NK cells function, and changes in the intestinal microbiota."
