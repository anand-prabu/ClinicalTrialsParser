Available safety, PK and PD data\n      will be reviewed before each dose escalation. This will be followed by a food-effect arm in\n      the cohort that received what is deemed to be the target clinical dose. Part B is planned to\n      consist of up to two cohorts of subjects, each taking part in one 14 day repeat dose study\n      period. Subjects will be dosed on Day 1 and then on Days 3-15. It is planned that two doses\n      will be evaluated. The dose(s) to be tested will be selected based on safety, PK, and PD\n      from Part A.
