The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of adjuvant\n      endocrine therapy for operable ER-beta positive, ER-alpha/PR negative, Her-2 negative breast\n      cancer(triple negative breast cancer, TNBC) patients. The ER-beta positive TNBC patients who\n      had undergone modified radical mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery were randomly (1:1)\n      enrolled to receive toremifene (60 mg per day for premenopausal and perimenopausal patients)\n      /anastrozole(1mg per day for postmenopausal patients) or observation within 4 weeks after\n      adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy if necessary.The follow-up time will be at\n      least five years. The disease free survival(DFS) and overall survival(OS) between endocrine\n      group and observation group will be compared to evaluate the effectiveness."
