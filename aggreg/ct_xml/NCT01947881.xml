        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with 40 years of age or older.

          -  Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

          -  Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) ≤ 12% at screening visit.

          -  Presence of clinically significant DME involving the center (fovea) diagnosed in at
             least one eye that is eligible for anti-VEGF treatment in the opinion of the
             investigator. If both eyes are eligible, the one with the worse visual acuity, as
             assessed at screening visit, will be selected as the study eye.

          -  Visual impairment due to DME with BCVA ≥ 39 letters and ≤ 73 letters (≥ 20/160 and ≤
             20/40).

          -  Central subfield thickness ≥ 300µm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of any other ocular disease than DME in the study eye that may confound
             study results, such as Proliferative Retinopathy.

          -  Previous treatment with vitrectomy or intravitreous injections of triancinolone or
             anti-VEGF drugs in the study eye.

          -  Any previous laser photocoagulation (panretinal or focal) in the study eye within 6
             months prior to inclusion in this study.

          -  Active intraocular inflammation (grade trace or above) in either eye at screening
             visit.

          -  Any active infection (e.g. conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, uveitis,
             endophthalmitis) in either eye at screening visit.

          -  Important refractive errors (myopia &gt; 6D) or opacification of clear media that
             interferes with images evaluation.

          -  Patients with renal failure or other systemic conditions which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would preclude schedule study visits, completion of the study or a safe
             administration of study medication.

          -  Other criteria that in the opinion of the investigator should condition the
             evaluation purposed.
