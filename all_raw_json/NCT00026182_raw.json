Compare the objective response in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated\n      with rituximab and 2 different schedules of interleukin-12*.\n\n      II. Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients. III. Determine the\n      objective response rate in patients with mantle cell lymphoma treated with these regimens.\n\n      IV. Determine the overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with these\n      regimens.\n\n      V, Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. NOTE:\n      *Interleukin-12 will no longer be available after 6/30/05.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to\n      histology (mantle cell lymphoma vs other [closed to accrual as of 3/10/04]) and\n      International Prognostic Factor Index (low and low-intermediate risk [closed to accrual as\n      of 3/10/04] vs high-intermediate and high risk). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment\n      arms.\n\n      ARM I: Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients receive\n      interleukin-12* subcutaneously (SC) twice weekly beginning on day 2 and continuing until\n      disease progression.\n\n      ARM II (closed to accrual as of 11/14/03): Patients receive rituximab as in arm I. Patients\n      are evaluated at week 12. Patients with stable or progressive disease receive\n      interleukin-12* SC twice weekly until disease progression or for 24 weeks. Patients with a\n      complete or partial response after rituximab are monitored until disease progression and\n      then begin interleukin-12 SC twice weekly until further disease progression.\n\n      NOTE: *Interleukin-12 will no longer be available after 06/30/05. Patients proceed to\n      follow-up as outlined below.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 3 and 6 months.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for up to 4 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients (45 per treatment arm [arm II closed to accrual as\n      of 11/14/03]) will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
