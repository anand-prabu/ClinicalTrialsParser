  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate an imaging system using Indocyanine Green (ICG) to
      assist in real-time identification of anatomy during cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal).
      We propose to define the effectiveness of NIRF-C in identifying the cystic duct junction
      during cholecystectomy. Also, the knowledge gained from this study will be used in the
      development of a novel microbubble/ICG compound, which will serve as a dual mode,
      ultrasound/fluorescence imaging system for abdominal surgery.
