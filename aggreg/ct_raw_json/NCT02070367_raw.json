Several methods for measuring pain and sensitivity that emphasize the person's\n      evaluation of their own symptoms and the impact of these symptoms on their daily activities\n      will also be tested to make sure they are consistent and accurate.\n\n      Previous research has suggested one of the assessments may also be used to assist in the\n      identification of CRPS: this simple test will be evaluated to see if it can accurately\n      identify persons with this disorder (for which there is currently no diagnostic test).\n      Together, this will improve treatment of CRPS through early, accurate diagnosis and the\n      ability to measure important changes in this painful condition, and set up future studies\n      for this new rehabilitation treatment method."
