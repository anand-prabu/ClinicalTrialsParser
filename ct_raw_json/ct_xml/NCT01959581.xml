  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess: 1) how infants move their bodies to explore, play,
      and solve problems, 2) if this is different in a high-risk group of infants, and 3) if these
      abilities can be advanced in a high-risk group through the use of a movement assisting
      device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Certain conditions or diagnoses identified soon after birth are known to put infants at risk
      for having problems with their motor (movement) development as they get older. Infants with
      these diagnoses are at risk for additional developmental problems due to their inability to
      move their bodies to explore, learn, and play. This study tests how a device that assists
      movement can help exploration, learning, and play in children. The information gathered in
      this study will help us better understand how early learning happens and how we can help
      individuals become better movers, learners, and problem-solvers so they can increase their
      participation in everyday play activities.
