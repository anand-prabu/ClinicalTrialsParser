  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with lung cancer may develop a second primary tumor or recurrent disease after
      previous radiotherapy. Surgical salvage therapy is the mainstay of therapeutic options.
      However, in case of irresectable disease, re-irradiation should be considered. Also in the
      postoperative setting, re-irradiation is considered after surgical salvage in case of
      features in the pathology specimen indicating a high risk for subsequent recurrence. However
      after re-irradiation, there is a high risk of 43% grade 3 (late) toxicity at 5 years
      (including possible fatal complications) and a relatively low chance of locoregional control
      of 50% at 5 years. One out of three patients survives re-irradiation without recurrence and
      severe complications. Improvements in both the risk of radiation-induced complications and
      the oncological outcome are thus warranted.

      Compared to conventional radiotherapy with photons (CRT), particle therapy (PT) has the
      potential to inflict maximum damage on tumors with minimum collateral damage to neighboring
      healthy tissue. Given that the cost of particle therapy (PT) is considerably higher than
      that of conventional radiotherapy (RT) with photons, it is necessary to establish whether
      these higher costs are worthwhile in light of the expected advantages. Thus, clear evidence
      of the situations in which PT outperforms conventional photon treatment is needed.
      Publications on this topic are rare. The only recent publication has analyzed the results of
      37 NSCLC patients of whom 9 were re-irradiated with at least 50 Gy using helical tomotherapy
      [Kruser in press].

      We propose an in silico trial to investigate to what extend proton and 12C-ion therapy
      decrease the amount of irradiated normal tissue in lung cancer patients treated with
      radiotherapy after an initial radiotherapy treatment.

      For this in silico planning study all treatment plans will be performed in centers that are
      already operating and have experience in treatment planning. Photon treatment plans will be
      carried out in Maastricht, proton treatment plans at the University of Pennsylvania and the
      C-ion treatment plans at the University of Wisconsin.

      A dataset with state-of-the-art image data is available. 25 patients will be included
      according to a-priori defined selection criteria. Each patient will function as his or her
      own control. For this reason, the number of patients per tumor group can be limited to 25
      patients per tumor group (power = 80%, alpha = 5%).

      The datasets will be stored on a secure website hosted by MAASTRO. High quality CT-images
      will be used for radiotherapy treatment planning. If available, secondary image information
      such as FDG-PET and MRI will be used for GTV delineation. All relevant OARs will be
      delineated in both the primary and secondary studyset. GTV/CTV will be used accordingly to
      the actual treatment. New DVH's will be calculated for the added OAR. Dose restrictions for
      the re-irradiation plan will be defined for each individual patient based on the DVH dose in
      the primary photon treatment plan.

      Photons will be planned with direct Aperture Optimized Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy
      (IMRT). Protons will be planned using active beam delivery with Intensity Modulated proton
      therapy (IMPT)and carbon-ions with a  pencil beam delivery treatment planning technique with
      gantry. Each participating center will use its own treatment planning system according to
      standard practice at that center. The GTV to PTV margin will be determined by the individual
      institutes according to the treatment technique and treatment modality. The same tumor dose,
      overall treatment time (OTT) and an equal number of fractions will be used for all treatment
      modalities.

      Photon, proton and C-ion treatments will be compared based on dosimetric parameters on
      normal tissues. In addition, the NTCP for a fixed tumor dose or the same expected TCP will
      be determined. Cobalt Gy equivalent doses will be used when reporting the proton and
      carbon-ion dose. In the case of protons, a constant RBE value of 1.1 will be used for both
      the tumor and the normal tissues. The RBE of carbon-ions will be calculated based on the
      models used by the participating centers.

      Dose in the following structures will be taken into account:

        -  Lungs

        -  Spinal court

        -  Heart

        -  Oesophagus
