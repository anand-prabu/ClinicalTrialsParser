Neuromaix provides a protective environment for peripheral nerve regeneration\n      after injury. Neuromaix connects the proximal and distal ends of a transected nerve,\n      allowing regenerating axons to grow through the scaffold, into the distal nerve tissue\n      towards the target muscle or skin.\n\n      Neuromaix is composed of two parts. The Epimaix part provides the structural characteristics\n      needed to suture the nerve guide in place and to prevent ingrowth of scar tissue. The\n      Perimaix part provides a structure that mimics endoneurial tubes, providing guidance for the\n      regenerating axons while bridging the nerve gap."
