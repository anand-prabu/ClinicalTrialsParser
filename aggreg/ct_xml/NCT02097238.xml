  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well eribulin mesylate works in treating patients with
      osteosarcoma that has come back after treatment (recurrent) or has not responded to
      treatment (refractory). Microtubule inhibitors, such as eribulin mesylate, may stop or slow
      the growth of tumor cells by disrupting the cell cycle.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether eribulin (eribulin mesylate) therapy increases the disease control
      rate at 4 months to at least 42% in patients with recurrent osteosarcoma or demonstrates a
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) response rate of at least 22%.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of eribulin in subjects with recurrent
      osteosarcoma.

      II. To further describe the tolerability of single agent eribulin.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive eribulin mesylate intravenously (IV) over 2-5 minutes on days 1 and 8.
      Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up annually for 5 years.
