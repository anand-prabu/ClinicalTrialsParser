Genetic\n      sequencing of a tumor can be done, and in this study that information is sent to a company\n      called \"N-of-One.\"  They will match each patient's tumor's genetic profile to targeted\n      therapies.  The targeted therapies may be use of FDA-approved drugs, off-label use of\n      FDA-approved drugs, or use of experimental drugs in clinical research studies open at\n      various locations in the region.\n\n      The purpose of the study is to compare the length of time it takes for a tumor to grow in\n      people who receive the standard treatment for metastatic cancer to the length of time it\n      takes for a tumor to grow in people who receive a drug specifically targeted for their\n      cancer's genetic mutation.\n\n      Investigators will do a kind of genetic testing called \"DNA sequencing\".  Everyone who takes\n      part in this trial will have genetic testing done on their cancer tumor tissue here at\n      Dartmouth.  The results of the DNA sequencing will be sent to N-of-One as noted above.\n\n      The treatment participants get will depend on the results of the DNA sequencing and the\n      availability of targeted therapies that match the genetic profile of the tumor identified by\n      the DNA sequencing.\n\n      If there is no genetic mutation that can be identified with current DNA sequencing,\n      participants will receive the standard treatment for metastatic cancer.\n\n      If there is a genetic mutation that can be identified with current DNA sequencing and a drug\n      has been developed for this mutation, participants may be able to receive that drug.  If\n      there is more than one drug available, the participant and his/her oncologist will decide\n      which is the best one for the participant.\n\n      Because there are many drugs that may be used in this study, the investigator cannot advise\n      in advance whether or not the drug a participant might receive has been approved by the U.S.\n      Food and Drug Administration (FDA)."
