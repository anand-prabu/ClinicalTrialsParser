  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if using the combination of standard chemotherapy
      (gemcitabine and carboplatin) plus this new drug (panitumumab) can help to shrink the tumor
      before the patient undergoes surgery for bladder cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed muscle invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder
             at MSKCC (Note: urothelial carcinoma invading into the prostatic stroma with no
             histologic muscle invasion is allowed, provided the extent of disease is confirmed
             via imaging and/or EUA.)

          -  Clinical stage T2-T4a N0/X M0 disease.

          -  Medically appropriate candidate for radical cystectomy as per MSKCC attending
             urologic oncologist

          -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the institution

          -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN for the
             institution

          -  Cisplatin ineligibility based on one or more of the following criteria:

        Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 30-59 ml/min/1.73m2 using the CKD-EPI
        equation:(http://nephron.org/MDRD_GFR.cgi) :

        eGFR = 141 x min(Scr/k, 1)a x max(Scr/k, 1)-1.209 x 0.993Age x 1.018 [if female] x 1.159
        [if black] Scr is serum creatinine, k is 0.7 for females and 0.9 for males, a is -0.329

             opinion of the investigator may increase the risk associated with the study
             participation or investigational product(s) administration or may interfere with the
             interpretation of the results.

          -  Major surgery requiring general anesthesia within 21 days or minor surgery within 14

             clinical trials or non-treatment trials, e.g. QOL, are allowed.

          -  Ongoing treatment with therapeutic doses of warfarin (low dose warfarin up to 2 mg po
             daily for thromboembolic prophylaxis is allowed).

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding. Patients must be surgically sterile or be
             postmenopausal, or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of
             therapy and for two (2) months following the last dose of panitumumab. The definition
