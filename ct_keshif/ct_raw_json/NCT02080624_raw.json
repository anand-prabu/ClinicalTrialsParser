            "textblock": "Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a rare congenital neuro-cutaneous disorder considered as a\n      rare or orphan disease. SWS is characterized by a capillary vascular malformation (CM)\n      localized on the skin of the face, eyes and central nervous system. Given the localization\n      and the extent of the CM, children with SWS are particularly prone to developing severe\n      psychological problems. The standard treatment for CM is pulsed dye laser (PDL) although in\n      these cases whitening of the lesion is rarely achieved. Combining topical rapamycin, a\n      specific inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, with PDL is hypothesised to be a\n      good therapeutic option in these patients."
