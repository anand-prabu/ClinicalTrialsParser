Subjects\n      receive their prescribed pancreatic enzyme supplementation at the individual dose until\n      start of treatment with Creon Micro, if the subjects were on pancreatic enzyme\n      supplementation before start of the study. Subjects will be treated with Creon Micro during\n      the study. The treatment duration is 3 months."
