  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various issues had been pointed out when undergoing the anesthesia for elderly patients with
      sevoflurane, such as delayed emergence, post-operative trouble with swallowing.

      Desflurane, which has a lower blood/gas partition coefficient, is expected to contribute the
      better emergence, along with the recent progress on optimization of delivered amount of
      anesthesia.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the time to emergence in long elderly patient cases
      with desflurane or sevoflurane, with the recently developed drug-delivery optimization
      system &quot;AisysÂ®&quot; (GE Healthcare Japan).

    <description>When surgery ends, the fresh gas flow rate will be increased to 6L/min (100% oxygen). Patients will be asked to open eyes by touching the shoulder, calling the name every 15 seconds. Patients will be applied stimulus every 15 seconds until following commands. Extubation will be performed when the patient is judged to be awake and spontaneous breathing recovery substantially.</description>
