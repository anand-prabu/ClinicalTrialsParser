      The primary goal of this project is to determine if an innovative behavioral weight loss
      program that incorporates new developments from the field of behavior therapy produces
      superior weight control than standard behavioral treatment. A sample of 200 adults from the
      community are participating in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  You have a medical condition or psychiatric condition that may limit your ability to

             next three years.

          -  The research team identifies any factors that would render you potentially unable or
