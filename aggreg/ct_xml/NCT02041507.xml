  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The degree of protection afforded by colonoscopy against proximal colorectal cancer (CRC)
      appears to be related to the quality of the procedure, and the incomplete removal of lesions
      has been shown to increase the subsequent risk of developing a colon cancer.

      Some studies suggest that small polyps with advanced histology are more common in the right
      than in the left colon (right colon proximal to splenic flexure, left colon distal to the
      splenic flexure). The average size of polyps in the right colon with advanced pathology or
      containing adenocarcinoma was â‰¤9 mm, whereas in the left colon their average size was &gt;9 mm,
      P&lt;0.001. Inadequate prevention of right-sided CRC incidence and mortality may be due to
      right-sided polyps with advanced histology or that harbor malignancy. These presumptive
      precursors of cancer are smaller and possibly more easily obscured by residual feces, and
      more likely to be missed at colonoscopy.

      Water-aided colonoscopy (WAC) can be subdivided broadly into two major categories: water
      immersion (WI), characterized by suction removal of the infused water predominantly during
      the withdrawal phase of colonoscopy, and water exchange (WE), characterized by suction
      removal of infused water predominantly during the insertion phase of colonoscopy.

      In some reports WE appeared to be superior to both WI and air insufflation colonoscopy (AI)
      in terms of pain reduction and adenoma detection, particularly for &lt;10 mm adenomas in the
      proximal colon.

      In this multicenter, double-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) we test the hypothesis
      that that WE, compared to AI and WI, will enhance overall Adenoma Detection Rate (ADR) in
      CRC screening patients. Confirmation of the primary hypothesis will provide evidence that WE
      enhances the quality of screening colonoscopy.

      We also hypothesize that WE may be more effective in detecting proximal colon adenomas than
      WI and AI, particularly &lt;10 mm adenomas, thus increasing proximal colon ADR and proximal
      colon ADR &lt;10 mm. Confirmation of secondary hypotheses will provide justification for
      further testing that WE may provide a strategy to improve prevention of colorectal cancer by
      increasing detection of adenomas in screening colonoscopy.

      Unlike previous reports of single colonoscopist studies, the insertion and withdrawal phases
      of colonoscopy will be done by different investigators. The second investigator will be
      blinded to the method used to insert the instrument, thus eliminating possible bias about
      procedure related issues.

      Several secondary outcomes will also be analysed.

      Design: Prospective double-blinded multicenter randomized controlled trial. Methods:
      Colonoscopy with Air Insufflation, Water Immersion, Water Exchange to aid insertion of
      colonoscope; split dose bowel preparation. Sedation available at the start of the procedure
      or on-demand.

      Control method: Air insufflation colonoscopy. Study methods: Water Immersion colonoscopy,
      Water Exchange colonoscopy.

      Population: Consecutive 50 to 70 year-old screening patients. After informed consent,
      assignment to control or study arms based on computer generated randomization list with
      block allocation and stratification.

      Primary outcome: overall Adenoma Detection Rate. Secondary outcomes: proximal colon ADR,
      Mean Adenomas resected per Procedure (MAP), cecal intubation rate and time, total procedure
      time (including biopsy and/or polypectomy), maximum pain during colonoscopy assessed during
      insertion and at discharge, the need for sedation/analgesia and its dosage. In addition loop
      reduction maneuvers, position changes, abdominal compression, the amount of infused and
      suctioned water during insertion and withdrawal, and patients willingness to repeat the
      examination will be evaluated.

    <description>Pain will be measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS) with a score 0=absence of pain, 1-2=simply &quot;discomfort&quot;, 10=the worst possible pain. Before the procedure, an endoscopic nurse will explain the VAS scoring system to the patient. Patient will be informed that the request for pain information is not to remind that the examination should be uncomfortable, but to let the colonoscopist be alerted to the need to use maneuvers to minimize discomfort (e.g. loop reduction, removal of colonic content, abdominal compression and/or change in patient position). At regular intervals during colonoscopy (e.g. every 60 seconds) patients will be asked about discomfort or pain. The responses will be recorded, and the maximum pain score noted.</description>

    <description>All patients will be offered sedation for the procedure. Patients can accept or decline the medication. If they accept, the procedure will be started with the administration of 2 mg of Midazolam intravenously (minimal sedation). If the patient will choose on-demand sedation, minimal sedation will be offered when pain score reaches â‰¥2 on the VAS. Patients can accept or decline the offered medication. If they accept, minimal sedation will be administered as described above. To avoid bias by the colonoscopist, sedation medication will be administered based on the patients' confirmation that the pain is no longer tolerable, and not at the discretion of the colonoscopist. The colon segment in which patients requests sedation will be recorded. If additional medication will be required despite the abovementioned maneuvers and/or minimal sedation, it will be provided according to local standards and it will be recorded.</description>

Residual air in the colon will not be removed. Infused water and residual feces will be suctioned back predominantly during withdrawal. Insufflation not used until the cecum is reached. It will be allowed only 3 times and no more than 10 seconds each time (ITT failure if &gt;3) if the lumen cannot be seen. Withdrawal phase done using air insufflation.</description>

    <description>Insufflation not used until the cecum is reached. Infusion of a sufficient amount of water to render the lumen of the colon a slit to progress with the colonoscope. Part of the infused water will be constantly suctioned back exchanging clean for dirty or hazy water. Air pockets will be always aspirated to collapse the lumen. After cecal intubation as much residual water as possible will be aspirated before beginning the withdrawal phase. During withdrawal residual water and feces will be suctioned.
