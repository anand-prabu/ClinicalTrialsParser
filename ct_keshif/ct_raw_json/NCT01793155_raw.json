Lung cancer (LC)\n      surgery is associated with a high incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC),\n      having a negative impact on recovery. Although the causes of PPC are multifactorial,\n      respiratory muscle (RM) dysfunction has been proposed to be associated with the development\n      of PPC, explained by changes in RM mechanics- and function due to surgery. There is scarcity\n      of literature on the impact of RM dysfunction on surgical and functional outcomes after LC\n      surgery.\n\n      Aims: to describe longitudinal changes in RM strength in patients undergoing lung cancer\n      surgery and identify associations between RM strength and functional capacity. Furthermore,\n      to evaluate the effect of inspiratory muscle training on the recovery of respiratory muscle\n      strength in high risk patients referred for LC surgery.\n\n      Target population: 88 patients referred for lung cancer surgery at the Department of\n      Cardiothoracic Surgery, Aalborg Universityhospital.\n\n      Design: The core of this research is a prospective longitudinal observational study (study\n      1); included is a randomized controlled trial, based on a subpopulation from study 1.\n\n      Statistical analysis is based on mixed linear regression models and ANOVA. For the RCT we\n      use the generalized estimating equivalent method for parametric and Fisher\u00b4s exact test for\n      nonparametric data."
