  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesizes that an assumed cardiovascular performance reserve is physiologically
      detectable.

      High reserve at rest characterizes a healthy person while low reserve at rest characterizes
      low functional capacity e.g. heart failure. The lower the reserve the severer the morbidity.

      The reserve may be estimated through CVRI (cardiovascular reserve index) which is computed
      by an algorithm composed of physiological measurements taken during the patient visit.

      In this study the investigators evaluate CVRI capability in prediction of functional
      capacity in comparison with the clinical evaluation during the same visit.

      The study hypothesizes that an assumed cardiovascular performance reserve is physiologically
      detectable and continuously monitored by a physiological control (reserve control)not yet
      discovered.

      High reserve at rest characterizes a healthy person while low reserve at rest characterizes
      low functional capacity e.g. heart failure. The lower the reserve the severer the morbidity.

      The reserve is decreased reversibly with aerobic activity and may reach an exhaustion
      threshold in which the assumed reserve control induces a reversible fatigue and dyspnea
      which dissolve once the activity decreased.

      The reserve may be estimated through CVRI (cardiovascular reserve index) which is computed
      by an algorithm composed of physiological measurements taken during the patient visit
      (composed of blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, central venous pressure or its
      estimation, weight, height and gender.

      In this study the investigators evaluate CVRI capability in prediction of functional
      capacity in comparison with the clinical evaluation during the same visit (cross sectional
      comparison).
