Vaginal bleeding patterns of women taking NOMAC-E2\n      will be assessed and compared to those of women taking a norethisterone acetate + ethinyl\n      estradiol (NETA-EE) COC. The safety of NOMAC-E2 will also be assessed.\n\n      Participants will be randomized to receive either NOMAC-E2 or NETA-EE in a 3:1 ratio. As of\n      Amendment 1 (which increased the sample size of the NOMAC-E2 group), the randomization ratio\n      will be adapted accordingly for participants randomized after the sample size increase."
