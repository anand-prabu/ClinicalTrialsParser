  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methylphenidate is an amphetamine-like psychomotor stimulant drug currently approved for the
      treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), postural orthostasis
      tachycardia syndrome and narcolepsy. It is also often prescribed off label to people with MS
      to improve fatigue. It is proposed that methylphenidate may also improve imbalance and
      walking deficits in MS by improving concentration and central integration, one of the
      primary mechanisms thought to underlie imbalance and walking deficits in MS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot study will examine the effects of methylphenidate on imbalance and
      walking in 24 subjects with MS and imbalance.  The subjects will be randomly assigned to
      receive either an escalating does of methylphenidate, 20mg, 40mg or 60mg, divided into two
      doses each day, or matched placebo for 2 weeks at each dose.  If a subject does not tolerate
      dose escalation they will be instructed to discontinue use of the drug. The maximum safely
      tolerated dose for each subject will be noted. Changes from baseline in subject's walking
      speed, balance, vestibular function, cognitive function, and fatigue will be assessed at
      each dose.

    <description>The primary outcome of this study will be the difference between mean change in TUG time between methylphenidate and placebo treated subjects at each dose.  Changes in TUG times will be calculated by comparing the TUG time at each time point (i.e. dose) after intervention (T+2weeks, T+4weeks and T+6weeks) with the baseline TUG time.  Mean changes at each time point will be compared for active and placebo treated subjects using t-tests.</description>
