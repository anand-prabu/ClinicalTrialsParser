INC424 has shown efficacy in myelofibrosis (MF) and is approved in the US\n      and EU for the treatment of MF. BKM120 is a PI3K inhibitor. Preclinical and early clinical\n      experience support inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR pathway in MF as aberrant activation of the\n      pathway has been observed in MF models and may contribute to the pathogenesis of the\n      disease."
