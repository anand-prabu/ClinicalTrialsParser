However, the positive\n      or negative impact of physician self disclosure on IUC uptake or patient satisfaction is\n      generally unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if physician self-disclosure of\n      personal IUC use increases patient use of IUC or impacts patients' satisfaction with their\n      clinical encounter."
