To determine whether there is\n      evidence of a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response (a \"positive\" skin test) in these\n      patients, and also the dose of gp160 that elicits a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH)\n      response. Early immunity to HIV may play an important role in the long interval between\n      virus infection and the onset of clinical disease. Immune responses have been demonstrated\n      in HIV-infected individuals within weeks to months of infection. Although none of these\n      responses has been shown to be protective, it is possible that boosting anti-HIV immune\n      responses through immunization may slow the progression of HIV infection. DTH responses to\n      HIV-derived recombinant envelope glycoprotein could provide a means of measuring an\n      important immune function in infected patients, and serve as an easily measured surrogate\n      marker of cellular immunity. In addition to eliciting local, cutaneous DTH responses,\n      intradermal inoculation of skin test antigens may be immunogenic, resulting in new antibody\n      production and cellular immune responses. This study allows direct comparison of gp160\n      administered intradermally with alum-adjuvanted intramuscular preparation with respect to\n      immunogenicity in HIV seropositive patients."

This study allows direct comparison of gp160\n      administered intradermally with alum-adjuvanted intramuscular preparation with respect to\n      immunogenicity in HIV seropositive patients.\n\n      Each of 10 volunteers is initially injected with the lowest dose of intradermal antigen and\n      the injection site observed at 24, 48, and 72 hours. Clinical and laboratory evaluations are\n      performed 4 and 8 weeks after inoculation. If there is not delayed-type hypersensitivity\n      (DTH) response to the lowest dose, patients are retested at the next dose 8 weeks later and\n      dose escalation is continued at 8-week intervals until (1) there is a DTH response to gp160;\n      or (2) the maximum anticipated dose is reached. In any individual, a higher dosage is\n      administered only if there is no evidence of DTH response. Patients with a DTH may continue\n      to receive booster injections of gp160 at 3 month intervals up to week 70. Patients with an\n      immune response but no DTH may continue to receive injections for an additional year. A\n      second group of 10 asymptomatic individuals are recruited and inoculated with the dose found\n      to bring about either a DTH or lymphocyte proliferative response in 7 of the 10 patients in\n      the first group. If the second group confirms the results of the initial group, the study is\n      amended to include patients with AIDS-related complex (ARC) and AIDS."
