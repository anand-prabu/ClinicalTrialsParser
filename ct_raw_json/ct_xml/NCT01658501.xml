      Primary objective:

      The primary objective of this study is to define the dose response of Glymera as measured as
      the change from baseline in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) following 20 weeks of once-weekly dosing.

      Secondary objectives:

      The secondary objectives are to:

        -  Describe incidence, severity, and duration of reported gastrointestinal side effects of
           Glymera compared to active comparator;

        -  Compare change from baseline in HbA1c following 20 weeks of dosing compared to placebo
           and active comparator;

        -  Compare change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) following 20 weeks of
           dosing compared to placebo and active comparator;

        -  Describe the frequencies of adverse events in the treatment groups; and

        -  Describe the above endpoints for the following subgroups of subjects according to
           baseline type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) therapy: diet and exercise only, metformin
           only, sulfonylurea only, or metformin and sulfonylurea combination therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects 18 to 75 years of age, inclusive;

          -  Body mass index ≤45 kg/m2;

          -  Diagnosed with T2DM with HbA1c of ≥7.0% and ≤11.0% and treated with diet and exercise
             alone, or with stable doses of metformin alone, sulfonylurea alone or metformin and
             sulfonylurea.

             glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor analog/agonist;

          -  Unstable cardiovascular disease;

          -  History of weight loss surgery or other gastrointestinal surgical procedures that
             could possibly interfere with the mechanism of action of GLP-1 receptor agonists;

          -  Based on contraindications/warnings identified with other GLP-1 receptor agonists,
             subjects will be excluded if they have: History, symptoms, or signs of pancreatitis
             or severe gastrointestinal disease (ie, gastroparesis) or Personal or family history
             of medullary thyroid tumors or history of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Syndrome Type
             2;

          -  Clinically significant renal and/or hepatic dysfunction;

          -  Pregnant or lactating female subjects.
