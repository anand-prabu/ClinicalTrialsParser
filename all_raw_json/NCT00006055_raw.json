Determine whether there is prompt engraftment after autologous peripheral\n      blood stem cell transplantation using filgrastim (G-CSF) mobilization in patients with life\n      threatening autoimmune diseases.\n\n      II.  Determine the kinetics of T- and B-cell immune reconstitution after a combination of\n      timed plasmapheresis, high dose cyclophosphamide and total lymphoid irradiation, and\n      posttransplant immunosuppression with cyclosporine in these patients.\n\n      III.  Determine whether this treatment regimen beneficially influences the clinical course\n      of these patients."

Following PBSC\n      reinfusion, patients receive prophylaxis with oral prednisone or methylprednisolone IV on\n      days -1 to 28, antithymocyte globulin IV on days 1-3, and cyclosporine every 12 hours on\n      days 1-60.\n\n      Patients with autoimmune thrombocytopenia purpura, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or pure red\n      cell aplasia are followed on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 60, and 100, 6 months, and 1, 2, and 5\n      years.
