Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as nab-paclitaxel work by killing the\n      cells or by stopping them from dividing.

In\n             addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with\n             marrow-suppressive therapy.  Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients\n             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.\n\n        Inclusion of Women and Minorities\n\n        Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial."
