      &quot;The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of CAM treatments on lumbar and
      cervical spine pain patients due to spinal disease.

      After subjects selected by screening, who receive CAM treatments 1-2times a week for more
      than 2 months and F/U at 1st, 2nd, 3rd month by meeting and F/U at 6nd, 12nd month by
      calling.

      The CAM treatments used in this study consists of 120ml of Chuna herbal medicine(Ostericum
      koreanum, Eucommia ulmoides, Acanthopanax Sessiliflorus, Achyranthes bidentata, Psoralea
      corylifolia, Peucedanum japonicum, Cibotium barometz, Lycium chinense, Boschniakia rossica,
      and Cuscuta chinensis) and dried extracts in pill form(Cibotium barometz, Atractylodes
      japonica) taken twice a day 30 minutes after meals, Chuna manual therapy, intermuscular
      injections of bee-venom pharmacoacupuncture(Select 6 acupoints, concentration 10,000:1, 0.1
      cc per acupoint, total amount injected 1.0 cc/session), acupuncture and allow for NSAID
      intake during the investigational period. The subject is allowed a maximum of 3 pills/day,
      taken at a minimum of 8 hrs apart. The number of pills taken will be measured at 4 wks after
      conclusion of treatment.&quot;
