            "textblock": "Propofol is the preferred sedation for colonoscopy. There is debate on the safety of the\n      administration of propofol by non-anesthesiologists, despite moderate quality evidence that\n      support its' use.\n\n      There is only one small trial of a direct comparison of propofol sedation by\n      anesthesiologists versus non-anesthesiologists.\n\n      Our aim is to compare the incidence of sedation related adverse events, the procedural\n      quality indicators, times (onset, recovery, discharge) and patient satisfaction between\n      non-anesthesiologist administered propofol sedation (NAAP) sedation and anesthesiologist\n      propofol sedation.\n\n      A randomized clinical trial with the incidence of sedation related minor adverse events as\n      primary endpoint will be conducted. Secondary endpoints include procedure quality\n      indicators, propofol dosage and patient satisfaction.\n\n      A sample size of 330 subjects (2 arms of 165 patients) will be needed in order to obtain 90%\n      power and a 5% significance level to detect a 15% difference (15 - 30%) in adverse events\n      incidence, estimated from our pilot experience. The sample size was adjusted for a 2%\n      cross-over rate.\n\n      Informed and consenting patients undergoing colonoscopy examinations will be randomly\n      assigned to one of two arms. One group will be sedated by an anesthesiologist according to a\n      protocol of propofol mono-sedation. The other group will be sedated with propofol boluses,\n      according to the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) NAAP guideline, with\n      a 3-man team consisting of one endoscopist, one endoscopy nurse and a sedation nurse,\n      trained in NAAP and exclusively dedicated to sedation and patient monitoring."
