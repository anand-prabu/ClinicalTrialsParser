  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center clinical study to compare the performance of a collective panel of
      salivary biomarkers to discriminate SS from non-SS in sicca cohorts recruited from three
      clinical sites with the diagnostic outcomes based on the new classification criteria for
      Sjögren's syndrome by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) developed in 2012. This is
      not a treatment study, but a pilot study to confirm diagnostic ability of a panel of
      salivary biomarkers. All enrolled subjects must be classified as having both oral and ocular
      sicca symptoms without another autoimmune/connective tissue disease (Appendix 2). At the
      University of California in Los Angeles, using molecular techniques, we will quantify
      discriminatory biomarkers in saliva collected from enrolled subjects, who are also being
      evaluated as part of their clinical care using the standard diagnostic tests of the 2002
      AECG criteria. We also will test the performance of these biomarkers to predict the
      diagnosis of pSS according to the AECG criteria, as these are the most widely used tests to
      diagnose pSS and assess disease activity worldwide.

      Aim 1: Test the association using Odds Ratios between seven individual biomarkers (cathepsin
      D, α-enolase and β-2-microglobulin [B2M], anti-SSA, anti-SSB, anti-histone,
      anti-transglutaminase) with pSS and build an initial panel and evaluate its sensitivity and
      specificity for diagnosis of SS at the time of interim analysis using the first 210
      recruited subjects.

      Hypothesis 1: Individual biomarkers are significantly associated with SS. Hypothesis 2:  The
      panel has sufficient sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of SS.

      Aim 2: Test the panel on the second 210 recruited subjects, refine and evaluate the panel
      sensitivity and specificity on entire 420 subjects.

      Hypothesis 1: The panel built from Aim 1 has sufficient sensitivity and specificity for
      diagnosis of SS.

      Hypothesis 2: The refined panel has sufficient sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of
      SS.

        All enrolled subjects must be classified as having both oral and ocular sicca symptoms,
        without another autoimmune/connective tissue disease. All enrolled subjects, who are also
        being evaluated as part of their clinical care, using the standard diagnostic tests of the
        AECG criteria of 2002, will meet the ARC criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to give informed consent (Appendix 1).

          -  Male or female patients 18 years of age or older.

          -  Patients with sicca symptoms as defined in Appendix 2.

          -  Must be willing to have a standard physical exam as part of standard clinical care
             and a complete diagnostic work-up according to the new ACR criteria for ocular
             staining, labial salivary gland biopsy and serology.

          -  Must be willing to have a standard physical exam and complete AECG diagnostic tests
             as part of standard clinical care (including eye exam, oral exam, salivary gland exam
             and biopsy).
