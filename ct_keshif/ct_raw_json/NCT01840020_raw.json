Bariatric surgery, like the gastric bypass\n      procedure, involves significant changes to the size and function of the stomach and leads to\n      more rapid gastric emptying. Consequences will be faster absorption and higher peak\n      concentration of ethanol after surgery than before. There are growing concerns that surgery\n      for obesity in this way may cause alcohol abuse.\n\n      In this study the investigators compare changes in FPM of ethanol following two different\n      bariatric surgical procedures."
