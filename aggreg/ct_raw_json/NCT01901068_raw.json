Various Meta-Analyses and randomized controlled trials\n      have been performed, which compared non-absorbable or long-term absorbable versus rapid\n      absorbable suture materials or monofilament versus multifilament suture materials, or\n      continuous versus interrupted suture techniques respectively. This lack of evidence has the\n      following outcome: burst abdomen is observed in 1-3% of patients within the first days after\n      a laparotomy. The incidence of abdominal wall hernias 12 months postoperatively is estimated\n      to be up to 20% (range 9 to 20%) . Wound infections develop in 3 to 21% of patients\n      undergoing a median laparotomy within the first 30 days. At present most surgeons favour\n      monofilament long-absorbable continuous sutures as the most suitable material for closing\n      abdominal wounds after midline laparotomy."
