  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about the possible benefits of aerobic exercise in
      controlling or reducing the amount of amyloid present in the brain, reducing changes in
      brain structure that may lead to Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and increasing cognitive ability
      in individuals that have amyloid deposits and are at risk to develop AD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical Dementia Rating 0 (nondemented)

          -  Age 65 or older

          -  Florbetapir PET evidence of cerebral amyloidosis

          -  Sedentary or underactive by the Telephone Assessment of Physical Activity

          -  Stable doses of medications for 30 days.

          -  Clinician judgment regarding subject's health status and likelihood  to successfully
             complete the 1-year exercise intervention

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant major psychiatric disorder (e.g., Major Depressive Disorder)
             according to standard criteria or significant psychiatric symptoms that could impair
             the completion of the study

          -  Clinically-significant systemic illness that may affect safety or completion of the
             study

          -  History of clinically-evident stroke

          -  Clinically-significant infection within the last 30 days

          -  Active cardiac condition (e.g. angina, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation) or
             pulmonary condition in the past 2 years that, in the investigator's opinion, could
             pose a safety risk to the participantâ€”unless cleared for exercise by the
             participant's primary care physician or cardiologist.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension within the last 6 months

          -  History of cancer in the last 5 years (except non-metastatic basal or squamous cell
             carcinoma)

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse as defined by DSM-IV criteria within the last 2
             years

          -  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus

          -  Significant pain or musculoskeletal disorder prohibiting participation in an exercise
             program

          -  Unwillingness to undergo or contraindication to brain MRI scan.

          -  History within the last 5 years of primary or recurrent malignant disease with the
             exception of resected localized cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell
             carcinoma, cervical carcinoma, or prostate cancer.
