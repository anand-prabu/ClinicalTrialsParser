The determination of dermal sensitization potential will be based on specific scoring criteria derived from observations in the Challenge Phase of the study and confirmed in the Rechallenge Phase, if necessary.  The recurrence of a cutaneous response at Rechallenge equivalent to or more severe than that observed at challenge will be considered indicative of a sensitization reaction. The observation of such a response in even a single subject suggests that the test product may have the potential to cause hypersensitivity.",
