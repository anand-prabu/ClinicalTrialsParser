Interscalene block (ISB) of the brachial plexus has been demonstrated to be one of the most effective analgesic modality during arthroscopic shoulder surgery. However, despite its (ISB) time-tested record of relative safety, ISB is associated with some complications. These could be central nervous system, respiratory and cardiovascular complications. These side effects and complications are based upon the anatomy of the brachial plexus at this level.Recently, suprascapular and axillary nerve blocks have been used to control postoperative shoulder pain.  The study will try to find out whether combined supra scapular and axillary nerve blocks are as effective in pain control as compared to inter scalene block.",
