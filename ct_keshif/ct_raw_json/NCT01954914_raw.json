A generally accepted optimum CD34+ PBSC dose for\n      allogeneic transplantation is > 4.5 x 106/kg body weight of the recipient. The minimum total\n      CD34+ PBSC dose certainly amounts to 2 x 106/kg body weight of the recipient.The objective\n      of this trial is to assess the efficacy of a single dose of Plerixafor as salvage procedure\n      in allogeneic stem cell donors with a poor CD34+ cell yield after the first day of\n      peripheral blood stem cell collection."
