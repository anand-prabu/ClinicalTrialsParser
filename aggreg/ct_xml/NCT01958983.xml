  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the effects of music therapy alter emotion and
      cognition performances of individuals with mild to moderate dementia. The music therapy
      intervention protocol is structured by drum improvisation, rhythm imitation, music cognition
      and song discussion. Attentive listening and active participation of the music training
      activities allow participants to utilize their focus of attention and comprehension of
      informational texts. Music therapy intervention is proposed to provide positive stimulations
      on emotion and cognitive functions of individuals with dementia. The results of the present
      study will clarify relationship between the effect of music therapy and the neural substrate
      of music therapy in anatomical and functional brain data obtained from MRI (fMRI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with dementia often exhibit deterioration in cognitive functions and experience
      changes in emotions and personalities. Due to the changes in the frontal and temporal lobes
      of the brain, individuals with dementia often experience an impaired ability to judge
      situations. Empirical studies have indicated that cognitive stimulation is essential to
      facilitate individuals with dementia in thinking, concentration, and memory. Structured
      music activities provide cognitive stimulation to individuals with dementia through
      attentive listening and active participation. Additionally, drum improvisation not only
      reflects the current status of an individual, but also serves as an audio feedback through
      free play.

    <description>All participants will received two MRI scans at 0 and 2 months. Images will be acquired on a 3.0T Siemens MRI scanner  with 12-channels head coil. All the images are acquired parallel to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure line. To minimize motion artifact generated during the image acquisition, each participant's head will be immobilized with cushions inside the coil. Three kinds of MRI techniques will be performed in this study, including T1-weighted high-resolution anatomical image, resting-state function MRI, and half-sphere diffusion spectrum imaging. Therefore, T1VBM(voxel-based morphology), TBSS(tract-based spatial statistics), functional brain network analysis, and structural brain network analysis will be employed for evaluating the changes of brain functional and structural connectivity in individuals with dementia in experimental and control groups.</description>
