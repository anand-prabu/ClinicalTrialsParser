The objectives are to determine the validity and reliability of the\n      Spine Cancer Outcomes Questionnaire (SCOQ) for use in the assessment of spine tumor\n      outcomes, to determine if the Spine Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS) Classification is a\n      valid tool for predicting the stability of spine in metastatic spine disease, and to\n      determine the efficacy of surgery versus radiotherapy for the treatment of impending\n      instability secondary to metastatic disease of the spine."
