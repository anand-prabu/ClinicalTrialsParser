            "textblock": "While the cause of AD is still unknown, evidence suggests it develops because of a complex\n      series of events in the brain that occur over time.  Two pathways possibly involved in\n      development of AD are inflammation and oxidative stress.  Scientists have linked chronic\n      inflammatory events in the brain with the onset and progression of Alzheimer's Disease.\n      Oxidative stress has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of neurological\n      disorders including Alzheimer's Disease.\n\n      Etanercept (Enbrel\u00ae) is an approved drug for the treatment of several forms of arthritis\n      when administered by injection. Some research suggests that etanercept, when administered by\n      injection into the tissues close to the spinal column (perispinally), may modulate certain\n      aspects of the immune system and provide some beneficial effect for people with Alzheimer's\n      disease.   Studies suggest that supplementation with specific nutrients may also have a\n      positive effect in support of cognitive function.\n\n      This study will be conducted at one research office with volunteers who have been diagnosed\n      with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.  Each qualifying participant will be randomly\n      assigned to receive an etanercept injection plus nutritional supplements for 6 weeks\n      followed by a crossover and a washout period of 4 weeks to then receiving nutritional\n      supplements alone or vice versa for another 6 weeks.\n\n      Participants will undergo blood and urine safety assessments at the beginning and end of\n      each 6 week treatment period.  During 4 of the 6 weekly visits in the treatment period with\n      the injections, you will complete the cognitive tests twice; once before and once 2 hours\n      after the injection. During 4 of the 6 weekly visits in the treatment period without the\n      injections, you will also complete the cognitive tests twice; once before and once 2 hours\n      after being asked to lie down onto a table for 5 minutes.  You will be allowed to continue\n      your standard of care for Alzheimer's disease throughout your participation in the study."
