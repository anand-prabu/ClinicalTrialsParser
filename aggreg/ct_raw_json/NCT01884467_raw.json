However, as\n      previously shown, the evidence supporting this practice is mixed. Potential risks of this\n      practice include wasted costs, wasted materials, wasted time and growing antibiotic\n      resistance. Potential benefits include reduced use of systemic antibiotics, a reduction in\n      symptomatic UTIs and fewer hospitalizations for febrile UTIs. We seek to define the evidence\n      for or against this practice by completing a double-blind randomized controlled trial of GBI\n      vs. NS instillation. Such a trial would benefit our Gillette patients and the community of\n      patients on IC worldwide.\n\n      Recurrent UTIs are common among patients on IC.
