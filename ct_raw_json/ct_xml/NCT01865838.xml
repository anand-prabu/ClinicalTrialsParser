  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to determine the role of Seprafilm, a popular anti-adhesive agent
      in minimising internal adhesion formation in the neck after thyroid surgery and therefore
      reduce swallowing discomfort experienced by patients after surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid surgery not only constitutes one of the main pillars in the treatment of thyroid
      cancers, but is also employed in the management of symptomatic goitres. Occasionally, it is
      mandated in patients with thyrotoxicosis refractory to medical therapy. While thyroid
      surgery can be performed with low risks such that patients rarely have to stay beyond three
      days in hospital, the track record of thyroid surgery is somewhat blemished by the
      unfortunate side effects associated with the neck scarring after thyroid surgery. Not
      uncommonly, patients experience discomfort in the neck region after thyroid surgery; in the
      extreme of cases, patients may even complain of a lifelong pulling sensation in the neck
      area during eating.

      The anti-adhesive properties of Seprafilm are well established in animal studies and
      affirmed by clinical observations in abdominal surgeries that utilize this material. Thus,
      Seprafilm is routinely used in instances when a surgeon foresees a need to perform abdominal
      surgery on the same patient in future, or during the fashioning of a temporary stoma. The
      safety profile of Seprafilm in thyroidectomy has also been shown by a recent study conducted
      by a group of clinicians in Seoul.

      We postulate that the application of Seprafilm to the surgical wound towards the end of a
      thyroidectomy significantly reduces internal adhesion formation in the neck region. By
      achieving this objective, we hope to improve patients' satisfaction with thyroid surgery in
      terms of ease of swallowing after surgery.

    <description>Studies have unequivocally shown that Seprafilm is effective in reducing internal adhesion formation after abdominal surgery. In a large scaled randomized controlled trial involving about 1700 patients, Fazio et al. found that the use or Seprafilm reduces the risk of small bowel intestinal obstruction which required operative intervention. The safety profile of Seprafilm has also been nicely demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial by Beck et al. in this study, the authors concluded that within the context of abdomino-pelvic surgery, Seprafilm does not increase the incidence of abdominal/pelvic abscesses in patients after abdomino-pelvic surgery; if anything, the anti-adhesive properties of Seprafilm are such that the authors noted an increased risk of anastomotic complications in patients whose bowel anastomoses were in close contact with Seprafilm.</description>
