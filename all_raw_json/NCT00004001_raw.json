Combining more than one drug and giving\n      drugs in different ways may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether estramustine\n      plus docetaxel is more effective than mitoxantrone plus prednisone for prostate cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of estramustine plus\n      docetaxel with that of mitoxantrone plus prednisone in treating patients who have stage IV\n      prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy."

Patients are stratified according to\n      disease status (measurable or evaluable disease progression vs rising PSA only), NCI Common\n      Toxicity Criteria version 2.X pain scale (grade 2 or greater vs less than 2), and SWOG\n      performance status (0-1 vs 2-3). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral estramustine 3 times daily on days 1-5 and docetaxel IV\n           over 1 hour on day 2.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive mitoxantrone IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and oral prednisone\n           twice daily on days 1-21.\n\n      Treatment in both arms repeats every 3 weeks for a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of\n      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after courses 4 and 8, and then at 1 year after\n      randomization.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 620 patients (310 per arm) will be accrued for this study\n      within 3.5 years."
