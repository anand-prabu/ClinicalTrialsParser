             radiological test

          -  No matter how the patient has been treated before, his (her) tumor should be totally
             removed by curative resection (PEIT, RFA or operation) in 8 weeks.at least 4 weeks
             later ,The tumor's removal should be perfectly confirmed by radiological test; on
