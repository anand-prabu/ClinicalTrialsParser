Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells\n      from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining biological therapy with chemotherapy\n      may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of biological therapy combined with\n      temozolomide in treating patients who have metastatic melanoma."

The PBMC are treated in vitro over 2 weeks with monoclonal antibody\n      anti-CD3, interleukin-2, and interleukin-12 to form 12ATC.\n\n      Patients receive oral temozolomide on days 15-19 and 43-47 and 12ATC IV over 15-30 minutes\n      on days 22, 25, 29, 32, 36, 39, 50, 53, 57, 60, 64, and 67 in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 12ATC until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed weekly for 2 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months\n      for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-18 patients will be accrued for this study."
