  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to check the non-inferiority and lower morbidity of
      the use of bone marrow mononuclear cells seeded onto a porous matrix of calcium phosphate,
      for the consolidation of tibial bone defects (pseudoarthrosis), compared with autologous
      bone graft.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 10% of closed fractures and between 35-45% in cases of open fractures, are at
      risk of developing a delay in the process of consolidation or a complete failure of it
      (pseudoarthrosis) depending on location , severity of trauma on bone, soft tissue and
      vascular structures Some of these cases are refractory to all treatment methods available
      today, requiring numerous interventions with the potential risk for recurrent infections
      that they carry. For this reason, its treatment remains a challenge for the orthopedic
      surgeon.

      Recent advances in knowledge of cellular and molecular biology related to the mechanism of
      bone repair and biomaterials science have been joined in a new discipline called tissue
      engineering, its implementation in clinical practice is being done so progressive.

      Cell therapy based on the use of adult stem cells (MSCs) derived from autologous bone
      marrow, introduces new applications for the repair of fractures including pseudoarthrosis
      and avascular bone necrosis.

      Its mechanism of action does not focus only on their local action, but also in the release
      of signaling molecules with autocrine and paracrine action through recruitment and
      activation of endogenous MSCs to osteoblastic differentiation and bone tissue regeneration.

      On the other hand, the seeding of  MSCs on biomaterials (natural or synthetic) is more
      effective, to facilitate adherence, proliferation and extracellular matrix production in the
      area where implanted.

      Today, the investigators can say that there are experimental and clinical evidence
      supporting the effectiveness of the method.

      The investigators have designed a phase II clinical trial to check the feasibility of this
      approach.
