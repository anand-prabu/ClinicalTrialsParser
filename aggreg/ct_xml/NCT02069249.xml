  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study has the following aims: (a) to assess the concomitant and longitudinal
      links between sleep and cognitive, behavioral and emotional functioning in kindergarten
      children; (b) to assess the immediate and the long-term effects of an intervention to
      promote healthy sleep habits (HSI) on the child's evolving sleep patterns, as well as on
      related cognitive, behavioral and health domains; (c) to assess the immediate and the
      long-term effects of an intervention deigned to promote healthy nutrition (HNI) on the
      eating habits of children, their weight and BMI measures (the comparison/control group) and
      (d) to assess the links between eating habits and sleep in kindergarten children.

      The main hypotheses of the proposed study are: (a) Shorter and more disrupted sleep would be
      concomitantly and longitudinally associated with compromised cognitive, emotional and
      behavioral functioning in kindergarten children; (b) In comparison to the HNI group,
      children in the HSI group will extend their total sleep time, improve their sleep quality
      and their sleep schedule will be more stable following the intervention; (c) improvement in
      sleep habits will be associated with improvement in cognitive, emotional and behavioral
      functioning; (d) in comparison to the HIS group, children in the HNI group will improve
      their eating habits, engage in more physical activities and better manage to achieve and
      maintain an age-appropriate body weight.
