      This pilot trial studies propranolol hydrochloride in treating patients with locally
      recurrent or metastatic solid tumors that cannot be removed by surgery. Propranolol
      hydrochloride may slow the growth of tumor cells by blocking the use of hormones by the
      tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility and tolerability of beta-adrenergic blockade in patients
      with metastatic cancer.

      II. To determine the effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on the tumor microenvironment and
      host immune system via a series of correlative laboratory studies using cancer tumor tissue
      and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the study patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on progression-free survival and overall
      survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive propranolol hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 4 months in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 1
      year.

    <description>Patients receive propranolol hydrochloride PO BID for 4 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Propranolol will be administered on an out-patient basis.  Blood for correlative studies (30 ml - green top tube) will be drawn at baseline and at each clinic visit. Tumor tissue for analysis will be obtained via core needle biopsy (or other appropriate modality) pre-study and at approximately the two month time point.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically-proven locally-recurrent or metastatic solid tumor;
             the first 10 patients may have cancer of any histology; preference will be given to
             patients with metastatic ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and malignant melanoma, as
             these malignancies have been shown to be sensitive to manipulation of the
             beta-adrenergic receptor; the final twenty-five patients to be accrued must have
             locally-recurrent or metastatic malignant melanoma that is not surgically resectable

          -  Patients may have had any number of prior systemic therapies; patients need not have
             exhausted standard therapy for their disease, but must be stable and must not have
             actively progressing

             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and
             for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect
             she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating
             physician immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Patients with brain metastases may participate in this clinical study provided that
             symptoms have been controlled with standard therapies and/or appropriate medications;
             the principal investigator (P.I.) will carefully evaluate the suitability of patient
             participation when brain metastases are present

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to propranolol

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac

             resting heart rate less than 60/min will not be enrolled

             will be excluded from this study; patients with extremes of blood pressure (e.g.,
