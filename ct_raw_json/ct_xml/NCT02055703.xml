    <textblock>
      This study will be a single-center, open-label, drug-drug interaction study in healthy male
      and female subjects. The study will consist of 3 parts: A, B, and C.  In Part A, the effect
      of itraconazole or rifampin on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of E2609 and metabolites will be
      assessed. Approximately 32 subjects will be assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups
      (itraconazole or rifampin) in equal numbers, with approximately 16 subjects per group. In
      Part B, the effects of steady-state dosing of E2609 on the PK of digoxin will be assessed in
      approximately 18 subjects. In Part C, the effects of donepezil administered in combination
      with, or 2 hours after, E2609 dosing on the PK of E2609 and metabolites, will be assessed in
      approximately 24 subjects.

             consent

          2. A prolonged QT/QTc interval (QTc greater than 450 ms) as demonstrated by the mean of
             triplicate electrocardiograms (ECGs), recorded at least 1 min apart, at Screening or
             Baseline Periods

          3. Evidence of clinically significant disease (eg, psychiatric disorders and disorders
             of the gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, respiratory system, endocrine system,
             hematological system, neurological system, or cardiovascular system) that in the

             the study assessments or subjects who have a congenital abnormality in metabolism
             within 4 weeks before dosing.

          4. Any laboratory abnormalities considered clinically significant by the investigator,
             which may require further investigations or treatment

          5. Clinically significant illness which required medical treatment within 8 weeks or a
             clinically significant infection within 4 weeks of dosing
