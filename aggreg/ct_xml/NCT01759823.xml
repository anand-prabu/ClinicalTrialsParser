      We hypothesize that Autologous bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells which would be
      expanded into culture and their subsequent transplant into the pancreas of patients with
      T2DM, aged 30 - 70 years with triple oral hypoglycemic agent failure and on insulin(&gt;0.4 U/
      kg body weight/day) will lead to abolition or reduction of insulin requirement by more than
      or equal to 50% in these patients over a period of 6 months. It is assumed that cultured
      mesenchymal stem cell in these patients leads to increased angiogenesis, secretion of
      various cytokines and upregulation of pancreatic transcription factors and Vascular
      endothelial growth factor(VEGF) and creates a micro-environment which supports beta
      cell/resident stem cell activation and survival.

    <description>20 - 30 ml of bone marrow will be aspirated and layered on density gradient medium (Ficoll - hypaque ) and stem cells will be separated. Separated mono nucleated cells will be dissolved in minimum essential medium and inoculated in culturing flask and mesenchymal will be allowed to adhere to culturing flask and mesenchymal stem cell will be injected into superior pancreatic duodenal artery . Patients will be urged to monitor and document blood glucose readings for next 6 months. Glucagon stimulated C - peptide,hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp for assessment of insulin resistance, plasma Insulin, Homeostasis Model of Assessment - Insulin Resistance and Beta cell function ,HbA1c, lipid profile and biochemistry will be done at baseline and 6 months .</description>
