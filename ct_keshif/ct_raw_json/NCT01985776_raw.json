Spondylolytic spondylolisthesis is one of the most known types\n      of spine instabilities. To date, no studies examined the effects of exercise intervention on\n      patients with low back pain due to spondylolytic spondylolisthesis. Research will be carried\n      out as a cross-sectional study, where patients with spondylolytic spondylolisthesis will be\n      randomly arranged in one controlled and two experimental groups. For the forth group healthy\n      asymptomatic participants will be recruited.\n\n      Exercise intervention will last 12 weeks with a frequency of three times a week and duration\n      of 60 minutes per training unit. Exercise intervention will include congregated set of trunk\n      stabilisation exercises, starting with simple isometric tasks. Dynamic and more complex\n      movements will be added progressively to achieve whole body tasks involving fast and sudden\n      movements.\n\n      Neuromuscular functions of the trunk will be measured before and after the intervention."
