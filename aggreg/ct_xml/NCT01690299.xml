      This study will test the clinical effectiveness and safety of apremilast, etanercept
      compared with placebo in the same group of patients with moderate to severe plaque
      psoriasis.

      Apremilast (CC-10004) is a new oral agent that is under clinical development for the
      treatment of inflammatory autoimmune disorders, such as psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis,
      rheumatoid arthritis, and Behçet disease.

      Etanercept is approved for the treatment of psoriasis; it is the most widely prescribed
      anti-tumor  necrosis factor (TNF) for psoriasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3b, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy,
      study of the efficacy and safety of apremilast, etanercept, and placebo, in subjects with
      moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

      Approximately 240 subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to the three treatment groups.  All
      subjects will receive both tablets and injections through Week 16.

      The study will consist of four phases:

        -  Screening Phase - up to 35 days

        -  Double-blind Placebo-controlled Phase - Weeks 0-16

        -  Apremilast Extension Phase - Weeks 16-104

        -  Post-treatment Observational Follow-up Phase

      During the double-blind, placebo-controlled phase, subjects will receive treatment with one
      of the following:

        -  apremilast (APR) 30 mg tablets orally twice a day (BID) plus once weekly (QW)
           evaluator/subject-blinded subcutaneous (SC) saline (placebo) injections (1 mL x 2
           injections SC), or

        -  etanercept (ETN) 50 mg evaluator/subject-blinded subcutaneous (SC) once weekly (QW)
           injections (2 x 25 mg) plus placebo tablets orally twice a day (BID),  or

        -  placebo tablets and evaluator/subject-blinded subcutaneous (SC) saline (placebo)
           injections.

      All subjects will be asked to participate in a 4-week Post-treatment Observational Follow-up
      Phase either upon completion of the study or upon discontinuation of investigational product
      for those subjects who terminate the study early.
