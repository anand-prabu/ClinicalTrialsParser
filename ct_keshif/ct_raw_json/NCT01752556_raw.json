Design: prospective, randomized, controlled, open, parallel of\n           non-inferiority. 440 patients will be randomized to diagnose and follow treatment based\n           on the RP or the PSG. The follow-up will last 6 months with 4 assessments. Statistical\n           analysis: We will compare the change in the Epworth scale between both arms of\n           treatment through analysis of covariance. The premise of non-inferiority is -2 at the\n           lower limit of 95% IC. Secondary variables will be analyzed using differences in\n           independent means (or non-parametric equivalent) or Chi2 for dichotomous variables.\n           Cost-effectiveness: costs generated by one and another method will be evaluated against\n           the effectiveness of the primary variable using Bayesian techniques"
