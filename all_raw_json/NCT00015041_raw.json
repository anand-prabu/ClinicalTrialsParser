The\n      four treatments are sublingual administration of:\n\n        1. two 2-mg buprenorphine sublingual tablets,\n\n        2. one 8-mg buprenorphine sublingual tablet,\n\n        3. two 8-mg buprenorphine sublingual tablets; and\n\n        4. three 8-mg buprenorphine sublingual tablets.\n\n      The dose proportionality in plasma profiles of buprenorphine and dose response of the\n      buprenorphine sublingual tablets are evaluated at buprenorphine dose range of 4 to 24 mg."

Be experienced in illicit use of opiates but not be physically dependent on opiates\n             and other drugs (except nicotine or caffeine) at the time of the study.  A history of\n             other psychoactive drug use is acceptable but preference will be for subjects\n             reporting less frequent and more controlled illicit drug use.\n\n          6. For female subjects, test nonpregnant and use adequate birth control, and not be\n             lactating.\n\n          7. Be capable of providing written informed consent to participate in this study.\n\n          8. Be able to comply with protocol requirements and be likely to complete all four study\n             treatments.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Have a diagnosis of drug addiction (other than nicotine, caffeine, and opiate) as per\n             DSM-IV criteria.\n\n          2. Have any significant, active medical or psychiatric illnesses (other than drug\n             dependence) which might inhibit their ability to complete the study or might be\n             complicated by administration of study medications.\n\n          3. Have clinically significant abnormal laboratory measurements in liver function tests\n             (AST and ALT levels greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal), hematology (CBC,\n             differential, platelet count), serum chemistries (SMA-24) and urinalysis at\n             screening.\n\n          4. Test positive on the HIV blood screen.\n\n          5. Have a history of significant hepatic, renal, endocrine, cardiac, nervous,\n             psychiatric, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, hematologic or metabolic disorders.\n\n          6. Have known hypersensitivity to buprenorphine and its derivatives or opiates or\n             opiate-like analgesics.\n\n          7. Receive any medications for medical conditions.\n\n          8. Have any condition or history considered by the investigator(s) to place the subjects\n             at increased risk.\n\n          9.
