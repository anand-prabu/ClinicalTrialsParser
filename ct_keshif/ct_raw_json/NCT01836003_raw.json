            "textblock": "Perinatal antiretroviral therapy dramatically reduces the risk of transmission of HIV to the\n      1.4 million infants born annually to HIV-infected mothers. Single-dose and single-drug\n      strategies lead to important reductions in mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). However,\n      more intense strategies using maternal highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) to\n      suppress viral replication, lead to 10-fold greater reductions in the risk of MTCT. Wider\n      access to maternal HAART could nearly eliminate the estimated 430,000 annual HIV- infections\n      acquired by infants worldwide. Additionally, prompt initiation of HAART in pregnant women\n      with low CD4+ cell counts could improve maternal mortality and prevent the development of\n      resistant maternal and infant HIV infections.\n\n      However, studies from southern Africa, including Botswana, indicate that less than one-third\n      of treatment-eligible women are able to access antenatal HAART. Programmatic inefficiencies\n      in these settings lead to substantial delays in CD4 testing and subsequent treatment\n      initiation. Novel implementation strategies are urgently needed to improve access to the\n      established benefits of antenatal HAART. In collaboration with colleagues in the Botswana\n      Ministry of Health, we have completed an analysis of root causes of the failure to antenatal\n      HAART, identifying delayed CD4 testing and result reporting, and loss-to-follow-up as the\n      principal barriers.\n\n      To assess the hypothesis that a low-cost intervention can improve antenatal access to CD4\n      testing and HAART initiation, the Tokafatso project is a staged-wedge, cluster-randomized\n      study of a combination programmatic intervention.  The intervention includes\u2014 improved\n      access to CD4 phlebotomy, rapid CD4 result return via SMS messaging, and active follow-up of\n      treatment eligible women. All enrolled clinics will receive the intervention, but the order\n      of implementation will be randomized (10 stages of 2 clinics).  Endpoints will be assessed\n      between clinics receiving and not receiving the intervention while adjusting for temporal\n      factors. While clinics will be enrolled and receive the intervention, endpoints will be\n      assessed through anonymous maternity record abstraction of women who subsequently deliver at\n      the catchment inpatient maternity ward.\n\n      While tailored to the situation in Botswana, findings are expected to generalizable to\n      implementation of comprehensive prevention of MTCT services throughout the region."
