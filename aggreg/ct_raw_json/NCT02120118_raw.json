There are 3 reasons of\n      conducting this clinical trial. Firstly, it has been demonstrated that hyperthermia can\n      enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy, radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy in various cancers,\n      with acceptable safety profiles. Secondly, the salvage outcomes for treatment failure solid\n      tumors were frustrated. Thermal enhancement ratio (TER) was observed when using hyperthermia\n      combining radiotherapy or chemotherapy. This strategy should be investigated in its efficacy\n      in treating those failing from previous standard treatment and maybe several times of\n      salvage therapy. Thirdly, biologically reciprocal complementation between hyperthermia,\n      chemotherapy and radiotherapy was observed. The reason may be complicated, including\n      theories involving hypoxia, immunomodulation and reperfusion \u2026 etc. If the immunity\n      microenvironment could be improved by addition of hyperthermia, an unexpected survival\n      benefit as compared with the literature may be potentially demonstrated from this study."
