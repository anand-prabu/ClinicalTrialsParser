Endoscopic refers to the use of an instrument called\n      an endoscope - a thin, flexible tube with a tiny video camera and light on the end.\n      Ultrasound refers to an imaging technique that uses sound waves to produce pictures.  EUS in\n      this research study is a method of combining endoscopy and ultrasound imaging to obtain high\n      quality images of the pancreas."
