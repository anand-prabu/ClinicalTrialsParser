Group 2 will\n      receive landmark-guided injections into the tender area around the joint.  In order to\n      determine whether the injection in group 2 was intra-articular or extra-articular, an x-ray\n      will be done after the injection to ascertain the location of contrast spread.  The primary\n      outcome measure will be pain relief at 1-month.  Patients who obtain benefit at 1-month will\n      be followed at 3-months, while those who fail to obtain benefit will exit the study to\n      receive alternative care."
