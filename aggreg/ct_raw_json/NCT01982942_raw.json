Study drug will be administered as an adjunct to\n      glatiramer or beta interferon treatment. A total of 250 male and female subjects from 21 to\n      65 years old, inclusive, are planned to be enrolled into two treatment groups.\n      Randomization of subjects will be stratified by disease status (primary progressive multiple\n      sclerosis or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis) and immunomodulating therapy status:\n      current use of immunomodulating therapy or no current use of immunomodulating therapy.\n\n      The study will consist of a screening phase (up to 30 days) followed by a treatment phase\n      (96 weeks) and a follow-up visit (1 month post Week 96 visit).  Following the screening\n      phase, subjects who continue to meet entry criteria will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2\n      treatment groups:  ibudilast 100 mg/day or matching-placebo in a 1:1 ratio.  Study drug will\n      be administered twice daily (BID), i.e., ibudilast 50 mg or placebo taken in the morning and\n      evening)."
