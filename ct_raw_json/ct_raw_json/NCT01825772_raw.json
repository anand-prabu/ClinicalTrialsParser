Thus, signs of pathology in peri-implant tissues, probing pocket depth (PPD)\n      and bleeding/pus on probing (BoP) will be recorded. Marginal bone loss and other findings in\n      radiographs will also be evaluated.\n\n      The prevalence, extent and severity of peri-implantitis will hereby be determined.\n      Patient-centered outcomes will also be obtained."
