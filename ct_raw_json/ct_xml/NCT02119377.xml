  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an Internet-based survey of transgender and transsexual (trans) people aged 18 years
      and older living in Australia.  This population has received limited attention from public
      health researchers, planners, and practitioners.  However, a growing body of evidence
      suggests that trans people experience disparities in several important areas of health
      compared with the population generally.  In particular, trans people are more likely to
      experience mental health problems (notably depression and anxiety disorders), use alcohol,
      tobacco, and illicit drugs, and think about or attempt suicide.  Additionally, trans people
      commonly report that their physical and mental health needs are not met, and underutilise
      preventive health care.

      Participants were recruited using several non-probability sampling techniques, (including
      purposive sampling and snowball sampling), because random sampling is not possible with this
      population.  Medical, social, support, and advocacy networks used by trans people were used
      to promote the study.  A mixed quantitative and qualitative methodology was used.  Validated
      quantitative instruments were used to obtain measures of health and well-being, which will
      be compared against population norms.  Qualitative items complement these measures,
      providing rich experiential data.

      The investigators hypothesised that:

        -  the prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders will be higher than for the
           population generally, and that these conditions will commonly be undiagnosed and
           untreated;

        -  depressive and anxiety disorders will be associated with risky behaviours, such as
           tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use; and,

        -  trans people will report poor relationships with medical practitioners.

      The investigators hypothesised that poor mental health is a consequence of several
      interrelated factors: body dysphoria (as a consequence of experiencing difficulty accessing
      medical treatment to alter sexual characteristics); societal discrimination and stigma
      (including harassment and violence); institutionalised discrimination (including difficulty
      changing identifying documents, and exclusion of surgical procedures and related treatments
      from public and private health systems); social isolation; and the belief held by many
      clinicians that transsexualism is a mental disorder (which may be a barrier to trans people
      forming trusting relationships with medical practitioners).

        This is a study of trans people living in Australia aged 18 years or older. The
        investigators used the term trans in an inclusive way, and included people who use (or
        used) words like transsexual, transgender, sistergirl, brotherboy, androgynous, or
        genderqueer to describe themselves. All trans people, including those who just describe
        themselves as men or women were encouraged to participate.
