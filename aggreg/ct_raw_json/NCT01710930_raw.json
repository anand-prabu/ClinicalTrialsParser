To investigate if induced sputum eosinophils count (compared to baseline) is associated\n           with the occurrence of exacerbations.\n\n        2. To examine if the exhaled NO (compared to a baseline) is associated with the occurrence\n           of exacerbations.\n\n        3. To investigate if activation of circulating T cells (compared to a baseline) is\n           associated with the occurrence of exacerbations.\n\n        4. To examine if the rate of specific Asp f IgG measured by ELISA (compared to a baseline)\n           is associated with the occurrence of exacerbations.\n\n        5. To determine if the variation of one of the markers above, TARC or Asp f specific IgE\n           measured at baseline, may be associated with the radiological stage of the disease\n           (ABPA-S, ABPA-CB, ABPA-ORF).\n\n        6. To investigate if there is a link between fungal exposure at home (visually assessed by\n           the contamination level and the proportion of positive samples for Asp. f) and the\n           frequency of exacerbations.\n\n        7. To establish if some of the clinical, functional or biological data studied are\n           associated with the frequency of exacerbations."
