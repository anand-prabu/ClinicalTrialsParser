Recent studies indicate that among foods that contain polyphenols, juice extracted\n      from the pomegranate has the highest concentration of measurable polyphenols . Pomegranates\n      have shown inhibitory effect on NF-\u03baB and the MAP kinases JNK and ERK, which are critical\n      steps in the cascade of events leading to inflammatory response. The NF- \u03baB pathway is\n      activated in response to bacterial infection and initiates the inflammatory cascade, which\n      may explain the protective effect of Pomegranates on bacterial infections."
