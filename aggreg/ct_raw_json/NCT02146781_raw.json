This research study will determine how the vaccine is\n      tolerated and how research participants respond to the vaccine using a different route of\n      administration, the Intradermal (ID) route. CryJ2-DNA-LAMP Plasmid vaccine is\n      investigational, which means it is not approved for use by the United States Food and Drug\n      Administration (FDA) but is available in research studies like this one.\n\n      The study is a Phase IC study to assess and evaluate the safety and immunological responses\n      to therapeutic doses of a dosing regimen of 1.08 mg and 2.16 mg of CryJ2-DNA-LAMP plasmid\n      vaccine delivered intradermally (ID) using the Biojector 2000 device, to be administered\n      every 14 days in subjects with atopic sensitivity to Japanese Red Cedar pollen, identified\n      by skin test reactivity to this pollen. The protocol has three subject cohorts: a Cohort 1:\n      composed of atopic and non-atopic subjects (half atopic and half non-atopic), who will only\n      receive saline control administered using the Biojector 2000 device; a Cohort 2: atopic\n      subjects, who will receive 2.16 mg per dose in a four (4) dose regimen using a Biojector\n      2000 device; and a Cohort 3: atopic subjects, who will receive 1.08 mg per dose in a four\n      (4) dose regimen vaccinated using a Biojector 2000 device.The study will be conducted at 1\n      study center. Subjects are enrolled in the trial for a period of 132 days. The objectives of\n      the statistical analyses are to establish the safety and to explore the immunogenicity of\n      the LAMP-vax vaccine using a different route of administration, the Intradermal (ID) route.\n      All statistical analyses conducted on the data from this trial will be exploratory in\n      nature.\n\n      The primary objective of this Phase IC Study is to evaluate the safety and immunological\n      responses of therapeutic doses and the dosing regimen of CryJ2-DNA-LAMP plasmid vaccine\n      delivered intradermally (ID) using the Biojector 2000 device."
