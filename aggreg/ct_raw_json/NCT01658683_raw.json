The goal of the study is that those receiving the\n      intervention will engage in at least 30 minutes of physical activity at a moderate or\n      vigorous intensity 5 or more days per week, 26 and 52 weeks after CR compared to those in\n      the usual care group.  The new intervention will be delivered by trained exercise\n      facilitators (physiotherapists or exercise specialists) and will make use of: small group\n      counseling teleconferences (5 sessions); personal telephone contacts (3 sessions), and\n      community program demonstrations that would facilitate linkages between patients and\n      approved community programs known as Heart Wise Exercise programs available in Ottawa and\n      Toronto.   The trial will be conducted at the Minto Prevention and Rehabilitation Centre at\n      the University of Ottawa Heart Institute and the Cardiovascular Rehabilitation and\n      Prevention Centre at the University Health Network (Peter Munk Cardiac Centre [PMCC] and\n      Toronto Rehabilitation Institute [TRI]) sites.  The study has a target enrollment of 286\n      participants."
