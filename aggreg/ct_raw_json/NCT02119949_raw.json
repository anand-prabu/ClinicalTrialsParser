Promising\n      findings show training WM results in an improved working memory capacity (WMC) and a\n      decrease of clinical symptoms in a range of disorders, including alcohol addiction.\n\n      Aim: To test the effect of a WM training in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) on\n      substance use, craving, WMC, impulsivity, attention bias and psychopathology.\n\n      Design: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial with a parallel group design. The\n      WM training adapted to participants' WMC whereas the placebo training consisted of\n      non-adaptive easy versions of these tasks.\n\n      Setting: Two departments of an addiction treatment clinic in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.\n\n      Participants: 120 inpatients diagnosed with an alcohol, cannabis or cocaine dependency who\n      were in treatment as usual .\n\n      Measurements: Primary outcome measures: Substance use and craving. Secondary outcome\n      measures: WMC, impulsivity, attention bias and psychopathology. Participants were assessed\n      before and after 24 sessions of WM training as well as two months after the training."
