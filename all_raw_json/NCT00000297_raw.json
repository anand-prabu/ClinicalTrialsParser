            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether labetalol, an alpha and beta adrenergic\n      blocker, will block the subjective and physiological effects of intravenously administered\n      nicotine in humans. A total of 12 subjects will participate in the double blind placebo\n      controlled, outpatient study. Subjects will have 3 separate experimental sessions 3-9 days\n      apart. On each of the experimental sessions, a single oral dose of low (100mg) or high dose\n      of labetalol (200mg ), or placebo will be administered. Two hours after labetalol or placebo\n      treatment, subjects will receive 15 variance grams nicotine base/kg intravenously. Several\n      physiological endocrine and subjective measures will be obtained during the sessions. We\n      propose that blockage of adrenergic receptors by labetalol will significantly block the\n      physological and subjective effects of nicotine."
