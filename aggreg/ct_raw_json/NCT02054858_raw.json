            "textblock": "Intravenous contrast for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions is a leading cause of\n      hospital-acquired acute renal failure (1).  Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI)\n      occurs through a complex mechanism including toxic and hypoxic renal tubular injury,\n      diminished renal parenchymal circulation and renal endothelial dysfunction with the\n      production of oxygen free radicals due to post-ischaemia oxidative stress (2).  With\n      increasing numbers of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, the incidence of CI-AKI will\n      rise over the next few decades.  Already, 40% of general surgical in-patients undergo\n      cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography (CT), largely using contrast (3). Optimal\n      clinical care in many specialties such as oncology, emergency medicine and surgery relies\n      upon information derived from contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging.  In consequence,\n      large numbers of patients are exposed to the risk of CI-AKI.  Current CI-AKI preventive\n      measures comprise identification of at-risk patients, minimisation of contrast dose and the\n      use of intravenous volume expansion (4).  Simple, cost-effective methods to reduce CI-AKI\n      are required.\n\n      Risk factors for CI-AKI include advanced age, diabetes mellitus, pre-existing renal\n      insufficiency and congestive cardiac failure.  Dehydration also increases the risk (5).\n      While patients over the age of 65 years currently account for 11% of the Irish population,\n      they account for 30% of surgical admissions (6).  In a recent cohort study of 1800 surgical\n      in-patients in a major Irish teaching hospital, acute renal failure was a common major\n      complication, occurring in 2.4% of patients (6).  Multivariate analysis of this cohort\n      demonstrated that increasing age and emergency admission were both independent risk factors\n      for complications (6).  Emergency surgical patients constitute a high-risk group in whom\n      simple methods to minimise complications are required.\n\n      Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a simple technique whereby brief periods of\n      skeletal muscle ischaemia and reperfusion triggers a period of resistance to\n      ischaemia-reperfusion injury in distant tissues e.g. heart or kidney (7).  It reduces renal\n      damage following endovascular aneurysm repair, a procedure requiring considerable\n      contrast-volumes (8).  A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that RIPC significantly reduced\n      post-procedure creatinine levels following cardiovascular procedures, though there was\n      considerable clinical heterogeneity between the included trials (9).  We hypothesise that\n      RIPC induced using brief periods of upper limb ischaemia-reperfusion will reduce AKI in\n      patients undergoing contrast enhanced CT scans.\n\n      The hypothesis that RIPC will reduce CI-AKI was first explored by Whittaker and Pryzklenk\n      (10).  They utilised available data from a patient cohort undergoing emergency coronary\n      angioplasty.  Patients with 1 to 3 balloon inflations in the coronary artery served as the\n      control group whilst those with >3 balloon inflations served as the RIPC group.Both groups\n      displayed an immediate improvement in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).  However,\n      the control group then displayed a statistically significant decrease in eGFR by day 3\n      post-procedure (77 +14 ml/min/1.73m2 versus 70 +12 ml/min/1.73m2).  The RIPC group displayed\n      no such difference by day 3 (81 +21 ml/min/1.73m2 versus 80 +14 ml/min/1.73m2) despite\n      having received a larger contrast volume.  This observation implied a potential protective\n      effect for RIPC.\n\n      Greater availability of CT technology has led to a dramatic increase in the number of\n      patients undergoing ce-CTAP in recent years.  Between 1996 and 2010, the number of patients\n      undergoing CT scans in the United States tripled, increasing by 8% per annum (11).\n      Simultaneously, an increasingly elderly and sick population means that many patients now\n      have multiple co-morbidities, increasing their risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury.\n       Approximately 6.5% of patients undergoing ce-CT develop acute kidney injury defined as a\n      >25% increase in serum creatinine from baseline (12).  Simple methods to reduce CI-AKI are\n      required. We propose that the use of remote ischaemic preconditioning could be a simple,\n      cost-effective measure that could decrease the incidence of CI-AKI in high risk patients\n      undergoing contrast enhanced CT scans."
