Traditionally, in these populations, appearance of\n      wheezing on auscultation is used as the indicator for BHR. More recently, other measures\n      like 50% increase in respiratory rate or 5% decreases in oxygen saturation are mentioned as\n      possible options   to determine positive BHR. Nevertheless, as these measurements probably\n      measure different   parameters they could vary in time of appearance.\n\n      The investigators also noted that in older children who perform spirometry, the order of\n      appearance of these different physiologic measures is not constant.\n\n      Decrease in O2 saturation, appearance of wheezing and increase in respiratory rate (RR) do\n      not all appear at the same time and not in the same order of events.\n\n      Some children are noted to have a decrease in FEV1 without wheezing - those children can be\n      difficult to diagnose as asthmatics in the primary care setting where asthma is being\n      diagnosed on clinical grounds alone: wheezing and response to bronchodilators. Children who\n      do not wheeze are difficult to diagnose and therefore, are not getting the appropriate\n      treatment.\n\n      Nevertheless, the data in current literature is very scant or not existing regarding these\n      issues. Thus the investigators designed a study to prospectively try to answer the\n      questions: do clinically significant differences exist in the concentration of the\n      metacholine and / or adenosine at the time time of appearances of these parameters, what\n      comes first, and if so, how does it affect the diagnosis and the severity assessment of HRA\n      in different age groups?"
