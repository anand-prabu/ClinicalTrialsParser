  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective for this study is to determine the safety of intraosseous (IO) access for a
      period up to 48 hours evaluating health-compromised adult volunteers with diabetes or renal
      disease.  The hypothesis is that there will be no serious complications for the subjects
      during a 48 hours IO catheter dwell time.

    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the safety of intraosseous (IO) access for a
      period up to 48 hours, in adult volunteer subjects with a history of being
      health-compromised, including two subsets of subjects; those with mild to moderate renal
      disease (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Stage 1 to 3) and patients with
      controlled diabetes.  The hypothesis is that there will be no serious complications for the
      subjects during a 48 hour IO catheter dwell time in either place.
