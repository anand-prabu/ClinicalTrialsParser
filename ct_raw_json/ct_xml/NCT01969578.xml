  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Salivary Gland (SG) Cancers are a rare and heterogeneous group of tumors, usually approached
      by multidisciplinary teams in high specialized centers. Until today no standard of care
      exists to treat these cancers. The identification of a target, the androgen receptor, in SG
      tumors has allowed for new treatment strategies options for this rare group of diseases. As
      a matter of fact, strong positivity for androgen expression has been found in salivary duct
      carcinoma and adenocarcinomas. The purpose of this study is therefore to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of chemotherapy versus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in patients
      with recurrent and/or metastatic AR expressing SGCs.

      The study will include two cohorts of patients: Cohort A, which comprises chemo-naïve
      patients, and Cohort B, which comprises pretreated patients.

      Patients in Cohort A will be randomized 1:1 at the study entry to receive ADT (triptorelin +
      bicalutamide 50 mg) or standard chemotherapy. Patients of Cohort A randomized to the control
      arm (chemotherapy arm) will be given the option to enter Cohort B at the time of disease
      progression. As long as Cohort A is open to recruitment, patients who will be treated by
      chemotherapy will be simultaneously enrolled in Cohort B. Accrual in Cohort B will be
      stopped when recruitment of 76 eligible patients in Cohort A is reached.
