Combining SU5416 with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining SU5416 and doxorubicin in\n      treating patients who have stage IIIB or stage IV inflammatory breast cancer."

For all\n      subsequent courses, patients receive doxorubicin as in course 1 and SU5416 IV over 1 hour\n      twice weekly (on days 1 and 4) beginning on week 2 of course 2. Treatment repeats every 21\n      days for 5 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After\n      chemotherapy, all patients undergo a modified radical mastectomy and radiotherapy to the\n      chest wall and regional lymph nodes. Patients with estrogen or progesterone receptor\n      positive disease receive oral tamoxifen for 5 years after radiotherapy.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SU5416 and doxorubicin until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2\n      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an\n      additional 3 patients may be treated at that dose level.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-9\n      months."
