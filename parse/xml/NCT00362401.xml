      The purpose of this study is to compare the sound pressure levels (SPLs) from three of the
      most frequently implanted mechanical heart valve prostheses, in order to determine whether
      there was any significant difference between the intensities of the valve sounds

      Patient's perception of mechanical heart valve sounds: psychoacoustics and quality of life

      Background: Approximately 90.000 mechanical prosthetic heart valves are implanted every year
      all over the world. They generate a clicking sound at closure, which can be a major problem
      for some patients. About 12% of them all experience annoyance, concentration disturbance,
      sleeping disorders and social embarrassment. All those factors could affect patients'
      quality of life.

      Aim: to compare the sound pressure levels (SPLs) from three of the most frequently implanted
      mechanical heart valve prostheses, in order to determine whether there was any significant
      difference between the intensities of the valve sounds.

      Material and Methods: We intended to include 150 patients with an implanted mechanical heart
      valve (ATS Medical, Medtronic-Hall or St. Jude Medical) in the aortic position between 3
      months and 4 years before the analysis. For logistical reasons, the actual number of the
      patients included was 84. The total conducted valve sound was measured (by a method designed
      by the authors) for each patient. The measures took place in a bioacoustical laboratory
      built with a sound-insulated chamber with a very low background noise, designed for the
      purposes of the study. The measures were performed in German patients followed by &quot;The Heart
      Centre&quot; in Bad Oeynhausen (Herz- und Diabeteszentrum Nordrhein Westfalen, University of
      Bochum), where the mentioned laboratory is constructed. The sound analysis of the present
      study was conducted in a specially designed soundproof bioacoustic laboratory, which
      isolates the outside sound and vibration from the environment indoors. Inside the
      laboratory, heavy soundinsulated curtains were placed between the patient and the
      investigator chambers. The total background noise inside the patient chamber was 19 dB(A),
      and this was reduced further to 9 dB(A) by using a 250 Hz high-pass filter. The sounds were
      recorded with the patient in the supine position, and without clothes covering the chest.
      The valve closing sounds were recorded using a microphone (Brüel and Kjær 4179) placed 5 cm
      above the patient's chest. This sound was then preamplified (Brüel and Kjær 2660), amplified
      (Brüel and Kjær 2610) and 250 Hz high-pass filtered (Krohn-Hite 3944) (see Fig. 1). All
      valve sounds were recorded by the same experienced investigator and stored on an
      instrumentation recorder (TEAC 510) for later off-line analysis. The data acquisition time
      for each patient was approximately 10 min.

      The patients were asked to fuldill a quality of life questionnaire (SF-36), which will be
      assessed in a future study regarding psychoacoustics for mechanical heart valve sounds.

      Perspectives: The results obtained from this analysis will contribute to expand knowledge
      concerning the sound produced by these three different types of mechanical heart valve
      prosthesis. The study can add one important parameter in the choice of the implanted valve:
      patient's pleasantness. It will assess some of the most sold mechanical heart valve
      worldwide and the final results can contribute to elucidate which type, among those valves,
      that should be chosen to a specific patient.

        150 patients are expected to be included. They all must have a mechanical heart valve in
        the aortic position implanted between 3 months and 4,5 years prior to the investigation.
        The patients will be divided into tree main groups, which correspond to the type of valve
        they have acquired - ATS (ATS Medical Inc, Minneapolis, MN, USA), Medtronic-Hall™
        (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and St. Jude Medical Standard (St. Jude Medical Inc, St.
        Paul, MN, USA). With the purpose of recruiting a greater number of patients than those
        available in the geographic region of Denmark, we have established an agreement with The
        Heart Center in Bad Oeynhausen, Germany, who will contribute to the study with all 150
        patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients (18 years of age and older) with an aortic mechanical heart valve
             which belongs to one of the three investigated valve types and have been implanted
