    <textblock>
      The preferred method for early detection of prostate cancer (PCa) in older men with family
      history is the Prostate Specific Antigen test (PSA test), although the method is imprecise.
      It produces a high number of false-positive results and increases the risk of over-diagnosis
      and over-treatment. Yet, an increasing number of men get the PSA test as part of
      unsystematic screening. Genetic risk assessment may be a better way to identify men with low
      risk of PCa. The main study hypothesis is that genetic information about low risk of PCa can
      reduce the number of patients who get a PSA test as part of unsystematic screening.

    <description>At least 40 SNP (single nucleotide polymorphisms)increase the risk of PCa. The individual risk of PCa accumulates with the increasing number of these genetic variants. The risk is doubled if patient has familial disposition as well. In retrospective studies, non-genetic risk-prediction models were compared to risk-prediction models containing both non-genetic factors and SNPs analyses. The genetic models had a significantly higher specificity than the non-genetic models. It has been argued that genetic PCa risk assessment could reduce the inexpedient use of PSA tests, saving it for patients at high risk of PCa.</description>
