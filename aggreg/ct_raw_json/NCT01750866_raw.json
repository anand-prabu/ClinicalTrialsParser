All patients on this study will receive cabazitaxel by intravenous\n      (through a vein) infusion plus prednisone by mouth twice daily, and following the\n      chemotherapy infusions, an injection of a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF).\n      G-CSF will help the body produce more white blood cells, which should help decrease the risk\n      of getting an infection while being treated with cabazitaxel."
