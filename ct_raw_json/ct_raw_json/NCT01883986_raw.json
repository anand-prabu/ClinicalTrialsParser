Outcomes measures will be\n      collected at baseline, and 3 months.\n\n      The study will be performed at the VA Puget Sound Health Care System. The investigators will\n      recruit individuals (n=40) with lung cancer over 1 year. The primary objective is to test\n      the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, and recruitment of subjects. We will\n      estimate the effect of a nurse-led telephone based palliative care intervention to improve\n      quality-of-life, symptom burden and patient satisfaction. In addition, using validated\n      instruments, we will assess the potential effect size of the intervention on quality of\n      provider communication and on clinician knowledge of patient preferences for life sustaining\n      therapies. The results of this pilot study will inform a future randomized clinical trial to\n      test the efficacy of the intervention on a larger scale."
