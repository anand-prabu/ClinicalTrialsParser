            "textblock": "Ultrafiltration (UF) technology is unique for its ability to extract fluid as an isotonic\n      solution, therefore not causing  substantial changes in NaCl  concentrations, and the use of\n      peripheral veins makes it feasible to use in out of hospital medical centers, for non\n      compensated Heart Failure (HF) with a low response to diuretics. The use of UF in the United\n      States and Europe in out of hospital HF centers is accepted as daily practice. Therefore the\n      hypothesis of this study is that it is feasible for a professional team to effectively use\n      the UF for short courses on non compensated HF patients with low or no response to\n      Diuretics, in a dedicated out of hospital HF center."
