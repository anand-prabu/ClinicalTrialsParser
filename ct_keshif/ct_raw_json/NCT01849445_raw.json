This project will look to find out if the research\n      team can identify patients who will not recover well at an earlier stage, so that these\n      patients can be helped sooner.\n\n      The study will try to determine if doing intense physiotherapy with patients who are not\n      doing well at the first review (6 weeks after their operation) can improve how well they\n      have recovered at one year."

At this review the Oxford Knee Score will again be assessed. Those patients who\n      report a score of 26 or less (on the 0-48 OKS scoring system), which is defined as poor by\n      the Kalairajah classification (Kalairajah, 2005), will be approached to consent.  If consent\n      is given and the patient is eligible to enter the trial,  randomisation into one of the\n      following groups will occur:  to standard care (encompassing a one off physiotherapy review,\n      6 weeks of home exercise prescription and final review) or to an interventional arm, where\n      18 sessions of structured physiotherapy will be administered over a 6 week period, where 6\n      of these sessions will be 'contact sessions' performed under the supervision of the\n      physiotherapist.\n\n      All trial participants will be reviewed immediately post intervention (i.e. at 14 weeks post\n      operation) and then by postal questionnaire at 26 and 52 weeks post-operation."
