      The current protocol desires to implement a large-multicenter observational study of
      hospital acquired infection in ICU in China. The study will generate data on generate data
      about the epidemiology current management of nosocomial infection.

      The objectives are as followings:

        1. Obtain incidence of three major nosocomial infection in ICU, catheter related blood
           stream infection(CRBSI), catheter related urinary tract infection (CRUTI), and
           ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP).

        2. Determine the epidemic of etiology and condition of management of three major
           nosocomial infection in ICU in China.
