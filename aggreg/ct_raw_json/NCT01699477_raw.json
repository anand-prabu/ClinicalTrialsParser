The treatments to be conducted in this study are\n      non-invasive, i.e. without opening the skull, and will create micro-thalamotomies in\n      specific target areas such as thalamus, subthalamus and pallidum. The data obtained in this\n      study will be used to evaluate the basic safety aspects of this new treatment technology and\n      will serve as a basis for the clinical introduction of MR-guided ultrasound-neurosurgery."
