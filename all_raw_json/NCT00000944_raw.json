This study will also examine if\n      this combination is well tolerated by HIV-positive pregnant women and if a combination of\n      3TC plus ZDV is safe for newborns.\n\n      Previous studies in adults and children have shown that indinavir plus 3TC plus ZDV can\n      reduce the amount of HIV in the blood.  Most HIV-positive pregnant women usually take ZDV to\n      treat HIV and to reduce the chances of giving HIV to their babies. The combination of drugs\n      in this study may be more effective than ZDV alone."

            "textblock": "Despite the dramatic reduction of perinatal HIV transmission following the administration of\n      ZDV to mothers and infants, new, more effective strategies are needed. An increasing number\n      of women may require combination antiretroviral therapy for their own disease because they\n      may be resistant to ZDV, may have high viral loads, or may have previously transmitted HIV\n      to an infant while on ZDV monotherapy. The initiation of triple combination therapy,\n      including a protease inhibitor indinavir, during gestation may be the most effective in\n      reducing maternal virus load prior to delivery, thereby potentially benefitting both mother\n      and child.\n\n      Women:\n\n      Antepartum (until active labor): Indinavir plus 3TC plus ZDV. Intrapartum (active labor\n      until cord clamping): 3TC plus ZDV. Postpartum (after cord clamped to 12 weeks): Indinavir\n      plus 3TC plus ZDV.\n\n      Infants:\n\n      3TC plus ZDV as soon as oral intake is tolerated (preferably within 12 hours of birth) and\n      continuing for 6 weeks.\n\n      [AS PER AMENDMENT 1/27/99: For maternal dosing, one Combivir tablet bid can be substituted\n      for the individual formulation of 3TC and ZDV. For mothers who receive Combivir during the\n      antepartum period, Combivir is held during labor and delivery, and the separate formulations\n      of ZDV and 3TC are used.  Patients who prematurely discontinue study treatment should\n      continue to be followed on study for the duration of the study.]"
