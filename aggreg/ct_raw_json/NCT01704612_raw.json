The fear of nerve injury after regional anaesthesia in diabetic patients is a\n      concern that has neither been confirmed nor refuted by current literature. As a matter of\n      fact, diabetic patients with neuropathy may be considered at increased risk because of the\n      possibility for double crush syndrome when a chronic axon lesion related to diabetes is\n      associated with an unexpected distal nerve injury related to regional anaesthesia."
