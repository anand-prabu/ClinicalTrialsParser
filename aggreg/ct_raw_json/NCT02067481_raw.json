This intervention, designed to\n      promote weight loss, targeted overweight/obese women who had completed treatment less than\n      six months before recruitment. CRF and QoL were assessed before and after the intervention\n      and compared using paired t-tests. Linear regression models, including CRF variables, weight\n      change and participants' characteristics, were used to assess the independent association\n      between change in CRF and change in QoL."
