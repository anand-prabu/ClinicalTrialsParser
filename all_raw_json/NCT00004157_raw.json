Determine the tolerability of interleukin-11 (IL-11) with filgrastim (G-CSF)\n      in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, breast cancer, or other solid\n      tumors. II. Evaluate the ability to collect CD34 cells and the number of apheresis\n      collections required to reach the target number of CD34 cells in this patient population.\n      III. Evaluate the time to recovery of platelets and neutrophils and the number of platelet\n      and red blood cell transfusions required following IL-11 and G-CSF mobilized peripheral\n      blood stem cell infusion in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive interleukin-11 (IL-11) subcutaneously (SQ) on days 1-10 and\n      filgrastim (G-CSF) SQ on days 4-10. Patients undergo peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC)\n      collection on days 7-10 until the target number of cells is achieved or for a maximum of 4\n      collections. Patients are followed until transplantation.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
