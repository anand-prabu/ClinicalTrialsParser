Performance will be evaluated using a score based on how\n      closely they follow a protocol for critical event management; a 'team' score and a score\n      based on clinical recovery of the simulated patient. All teams will receive a debriefing\n      session after managing 4 scenarios. Teams will return and manage 4 further scenarios after a\n      period of 6-9 months.\n\n      The investigators will be testing the hypothesis that both clinical and behavioral team\n      performance will improve with the use of Critical Event Checklists. The investigators also\n      expect that health professional (participant) could attain knowledge related to the\n      importance of non-technical skills and the use of CECs in the management of critical events."
