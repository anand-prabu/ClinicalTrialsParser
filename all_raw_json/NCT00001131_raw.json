HIV\n      spreads throughout the body by invading CD4 cells, which are cells of the immune system that\n      fight infection. Doctors hope that adding IL-2 to a current anti-HIV drug combination can\n      help restore the CD4 cell count and the immune functions. This study will look at how the\n      HIV virus acts during the early stages of HIV infection, how the immune system responds to\n      HIV, and what impact early treatment with anti-HIV medications has on the course of HIV\n      infection."

Many of these infected cells\n      subsequently maintain the virus in a latent state. Immune reconstitution with daily low-dose\n      IL-2 therapy is intended to correct or improve the deficiency in CD4 cells, while\n      maintaining a high frequency of CD8+ HIV-specific CTL and increasing natural killer (NK)\n      cells. After a year of HAART plus IL-2, it may be possible to discontinue HAART while\n      maintaining IL-2 stimulatory therapy, and the immune reactivity repaired and stimulated by\n      IL-2 should be able to contain the virus and maintain latency.\n\n      Patients are randomized to add IL-2 to their current HAART regimen or simply to remain on\n      their current HAART regimen. IL-2 therapy is initiated at Month 3 of HAART. IL-2 is injected\n      subcutaneously daily for 9 months, in addition to HAART.  After completion of this 1-year\n      treatment period, patients are evaluated for discontinuation of HAART. Patients with a viral\n      load below 50 copies/ml throughout HAART plus IL-2, a CD4 count of at least 500 cells/mm3,\n      and no onset of opportunistic infections may have HAART discontinued and IL-2 continued as\n      monotherapy for an additional 6 months. After completing 6 months of IL-2 monotherapy,\n      eligible patients may have IL-2 therapy discontinued."
