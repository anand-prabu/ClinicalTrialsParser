The\n      uses of PLT are for treatment of rosacea, hair removal, pigmented lesions, and skin\n      telangiectasias. The risks include the potential for transient sunburn-like sensations (i.e.\n      redness, burning sensation) and particularly if not used properly, the potential to cause\n      burns, blistering, scarring, and pigmentary changes."

Primary outcomes will\n      be anatomical improvement of the meibomian glands and their secretions.\n\n      Subjects in Group 1 will continue their pre-existing dry eye treatment regimen and receive\n      sham light treatment, whereas subjects in Group 2 will continue their pre-existing dry eye\n      treatment regimen and receive PLT.
