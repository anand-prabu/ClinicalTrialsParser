  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a developmental disorder that presents
      during childhood, with at least some symptoms causing impairment before the age of seven. It
      is characterized by developmentally inappropriate levels of inattention and/or
      hyperactive-impulsive behavior, with significant impairment occurring in at least two
      settings. It affects approximately 5.2 million children in the United States. Homeopathic
      treatment has been shown to be a promising  intervention for ADHD, however the reasons for
      that effectiveness is unclear. Specifically, it is unclear whether improvement is due to the
      homeopathic medicine, the consultative process, or other non-specific effects.

      This study has 3 primary objectives: 1. to determine if there are any specific effects of
      homeopathic medicines in the treatment of ADHD, 2. to determine if there any specific
      effects the homeopathic consultation alone in the treatment of ADHD, and 3. to determine if
      there is an overall effect of homeopathic treatment (homeopathic medicines plus
      consultation) in the treatment of ADHD.

      This is a three arm study. Participants will be randomized to one of three arms:

      Arm 1 (Verum group):  a treatment arm where the participant will receive homeopathic
      consultation plus a homeopathic remedy Arm 2 (Placebo group): a treatment arm where the
      participant will receive homeopathic consultation plus a placebo remedy Arm 3 (No
      treatment/Usual care group): a wait list arm where the participant will not receive
      homeopathic treatment as part of the study.

      This study will also examine the impact that the homeopathic consultation, as well as the
      participants' sense of mastery may have on outcomes. This will help our understanding of the
      treatment process and whether different elements of the intervention have greater or lesser
      effects.

      This study is a follow-up to an open label pilot study of the homeopathic treatment of ADHD
      using the same study team. Sample size was calculated based on the results of that study.

    <description>The homeopathic remedy (study medication) for each patient will be chosen from among the homeopathic medicines manufactured by Boiron Canada and currently approved for sale in Canada by Health Canada.  As per classical homeopathy practice, once the most appropriate homeopathic remedy has been chosen, it will be prescribed by the homeopath according to her/his clinical judgment (maximum on a daily basis, 3 times per day, minimum 1 dose (or zero doses on the second consult or later)) with administration instructions given to the parent and patient as appropriate. Water dosing, in which a lactose/sucrose granule remedy is dissolved in 250 ml of water will be used based on the homeopath's clinical judgment.  Only one remedy will be administered at a time.</description>
