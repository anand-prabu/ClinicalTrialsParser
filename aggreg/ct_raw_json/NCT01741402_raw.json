Both\n      groups performed 14 training sessions, twice a week, for seven weeks. Each session is\n      composed of a 30 minute-global-exercise series including stretching, muscle strength and\n      axial mobility exercises. After this, both groups performed more 30 minutes of balance\n      training: the control group performed balance exercises without external cues, visual or\n      auditory feedbacks or cognitive stimulations; the experimental group performed the balance\n      training with 10 Wii Fit games which stimulated motor and cognitive functions. The main\n      outcome measures are: (1) Mini-BESTest of Dynamic Balance Evaluation; (2) Dynamic Gait Index\n      (DGI); (3) Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); and (4) Falls Efficacy Scale -\n      International (FES-I)."
