  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelets are the main type of blood cell involved in the formation of blood clots that
      cause heart attacks. The investigators give antiplatelet drugs (aspirin, for example) to
      reduce the risk of another clot forming in the future and causing another heart attack.
      Platelets are known to have a role in inflammation and infection as well as clotting. In a
      recent large clinical trial, known as the PLATO study, it was also shown that patients
      treated with a new antiplatelet medication (ticagrelor) developed fewer lung infections, as
      well as fewer heart attacks, compared to the current standard treatment (clopidogrel). The
      investigators would therefore like to investigate the reasons behind this and look at the
      effect of these medications on immune response. This may help us develop new drugs that have
      a better effect on immune response. The investigators are planning a clinical trial that
      investigates the effect of these medications on the immune response of healthy volunteers
      aged 18 to 65.

      Only volunteers with no significant past medical history and not taking any medications will
      be included.

      Thirty volunteers will receive either a normal dose of ticagrelor or clopidogrel or no
      antiplatelet medication for 1 week.

      They will then attend the Sheffield Clinical Research Facility where their immune response
      will be stimulated using a safe, well established method. The investigators will do this
      with an injection of a low dose of endotoxin, which is part of the surface coating of some
      bacteria and has been used extensively in similar studies, in over a thousand volunteers
      over the past 20 years to investigate immune response. It is known to cause temporary
      flu-like symptoms that last approximately 68 hours. The investigators will take measurements
      of inflammatory markers, white blood cell function and platelet function and compare the
      effect of ticagrelor and clopidogrel on this immune response.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects, or female subjects not of childbearing potential (either
             surgically sterile or post menopausal)

          -  Age between 18 and 65 years inclusive

          -  Non smokers

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 28 kg/m2 inclusive, with a body weight between
             60-100 kg

          -  Subjects are to be in good health as determined by a medical history, physical
             examination, vital signs and clinical laboratory test results including renal and
             liver function and full blood count

          -  Subjects have given their informed consent before any trial-related activity

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, subjects with, or a history of, cancer, diabetes
             or clinically significant cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic, renal, hepatic,
             gastrointestinal, haematological, dermatological, neurological, psychiatric, or other
             major disorders
