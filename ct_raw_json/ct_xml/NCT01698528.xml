  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if using a diabetes management technology system,
      including a tablet computer, to track diabetes care and communicate with a clinician coach
      (a doctor or nurse from the Joslin Clinic) makes starting and adjusting insulin easier and
      safer for people with type 2 diabetes. Hypothesis: The use of a diabetes management
      technology system with a clinician coach helps more individuals starting basal insulin
      achieve better glycemic control with less hypoglycemia compared with standard clinical
      practice at Joslin Diabetes Center.

    <description>The experimental arm will be provided with a tablet computer with a newly designed software to help manage his or her diabetes care. This arm will communicate with his or her provider through the tablet computer to initiate and titrate basal insulin dose based on the 303 protocol. The individuals in this arm will also track their glucose values and medication adherence using the tablet computer by documenting when medication was taken or insulin was injected.</description>

    <description>The individuals in the control group will receive usual care from the study Clinic as they always have. These individuals will be tracking their diabetes in the same way they have been by communicating with their health care provider and his or her office via fax/phone/e-mail. These individuals will not be provided with a tablet computer.</description>
