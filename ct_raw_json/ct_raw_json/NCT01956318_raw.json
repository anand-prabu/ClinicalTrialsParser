Walking pool is a 60 cm deep pool at 23\u00b0C with underwater shower where patients are walking without stopping during 10 minutes. Underwater massage is realized by a senior physiotherapist. It starts at the feet and gradually rises to the thighs during 10 minutes. Bath tub is underwater shower at 30\u00b0C. It also starts at the feet and gradually rises to the thighs during 20 minutes. The interventions are standardized by timers. Adherence to each technique is supervised before each session in the usual manner for each patient treated in the spa center.",
