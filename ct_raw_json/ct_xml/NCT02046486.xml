      This is a 3-center, prospective, randomized, single-blind, investigator initiated,
      pharmacodynamic study of parallel design.Patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction
      (symptom onset&lt;12 hours), undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention, who are
      P2Y12 inhibitor naïve, will be randomized after informed consent, immediately after
      diagnostic coronary angiography, in a 1:1 ratio to either:

        -  Ticagrelor 180mg loading dose, in the form of 2 whole tablets administered per os in
           the supine position (standard administration)

        -  Ticagrelor 180mg loading dose, in the form of 2 tablets crushed and dispersed in
           purified water and administered per os with 1-minute-stay in a 60-70 degrees
           semi-upright sitting position Platelet reactivity assessment will be performed at
           randomization (Hour 0) and at 1 and 2 hours after randomization, using the VerifyNow
           assay, in platelet reactivity units (PRU). The cutoff &gt;208 PRU will be used for
           definition of high platelet reactivity (HPR). All platelet reactivity assessments will
           be performed by a physician blind to the actual treatment given.

      Preparation of Ticagrelor liquid formulation:

      Crushed and dispersed Ticagrelor 180mg for oral administration will be prepared as follows:
      two ticagrelor 90mg tablets are placed in a mortar and crushed for 60 s using a pestle. 20
      mL of purified water will be added in the mortar and stirred for 60s. The liquid is
      transferred to a dosing cup and another 15 mL of purified water is added to the mortar and
      stirred, ensuring that all powder has been dispersed and none remained on the mortar and
      pestle. Again the liquid is transferred to the dosing cup. The same procedure is repeated
      with 15 ml of purified water.The total contents are stirred for another 30 s to ensure that
      all remaining tablet particles are dispersed.
