The Laminate product constraints and\n      directs the geometrical parameters of the fistula as well as the vascular diameter and\n      gradient in the vicinity of the AV shunt. These geometrical constraints direct flow and\n      influence hemodynamics, and hence minimize turbulence and promote laminar flow. The device\n      is designed to improve short term maturation and long term patency of the fistula. The\n      Laminate device is a permanent implant intended for use as a subcutaneous arteriovenous\n      conduit support for vascular access."
