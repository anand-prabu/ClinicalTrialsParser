The investigators have preliminary data indicating that, in blinded clinical trial\n      studies with neutral instructions regarding treatment, chronic back pain (CBP) patients can\n      be subdivided into placebo responders and non-responders, and these differences are\n      PREDICTABLE a priori, by brain activity. The results imply that CBP placebo may have\n      clinical utility and that its properties can be studied by human brain imaging techniques.\n      In Phase I of the study, the investigators seek to identify brain imaging parameters that\n      predict the propensity for the placebo response in an independent CBP cohort. In Phase II,\n      the investigators will evaluate the interaction between placebo response and medication\n      treatment in individuals stratified as placebo responders versus non-responders. This\n      research is designed to critically assess the neurobiology of placebo analgesia for chronic\n      pain in a double-blind clinical trial."
