  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EuRhythDia is a multicenter, controlled and randomized study. The aim of the study is to
      investigate the effects of 12 weeks of randomized timed light therapy or timed physical
      exercise as a chronotherapeutic lifestyle intervention on markers of central and peripheral
      circadian rhythms and cardiometabolic function in healthy night shift workers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lifestyle interventions have been recognized as important means to prevent and treat
      cardiometabolic disease. However, compliance of the European population to general
      recommendations of exercise and weight loss is unsatisfactory. There have been no studies
      that have attempted to convert the exciting new experimental data on the circadian clock,
      lifestyle, and cardiometabolic risk into diagnostic tools or novel therapeutic approaches
      via structured multidisciplinary efforts. One of the aims of the EuRhytDia study is to study
      novel applications of established lifestyle interventions by co-ordinating the timing of
      interventions with circadian rhythmicity.
