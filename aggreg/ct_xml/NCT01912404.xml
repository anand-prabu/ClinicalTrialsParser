  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to test if taking a study drug called emricasan (also known
      as IDN-6556 and PF-03491390) will affect overall patient survival after one month of
      treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will also see if overall patient survival is affected at 6 months, and if the
      study drug improves liver functioning.

          -  Patients with established contraindications to steroid use including but not limited
             to the following:

               1. GI bleed

               2. Active infection, including spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, based on positive
                  blood culture, urine culture, or chest x-ray (if positive, must have been on
                  antibiotics for at least 24 hours prior to study entry)

               3. Acute pancreatitis (increased lipase &gt; 3x ULN or radiologic evidence)

                  and not be on dialysis at time of entry into study)

        Exclusion Criteria:

             mL/min, or on dialysis at time of entry into study

          -  Diagnosed or suspected systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and/or rheumatoid arthritis
             (RA)

          -  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at entry into the study
