The ophthalmology template will include visual acuity, intraocular\n      pressure, treatments given (if any), and uploaded retinal images. The non-ophthalmology\n      physicians will post their office visit data in a free-form text box.  Data entry can be\n      performed by office staff and does not have to be done by a physician.  Physicians will have\n      access to view visual acuity records and physician postings from their own patients.\n\n      The research coordinator will collect health psychology data by administering validated\n      health psychology questionnaires to assess patient depression, knowledge regarding diabetes\n      and complications of diabetes, motivation to carry out diabetes care, reaction to increased\n      knowledge of specific tests for diabetes and diabetic complications, and quality of life at\n      4-month intervals throughout the Clinical Trial."
