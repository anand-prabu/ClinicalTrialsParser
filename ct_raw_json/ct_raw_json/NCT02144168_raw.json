Three  faecal\n      samples will be taken from the patient. First faecal sample is the first stool after\n      initiation of EN and second sample is taken seven days after the initial sample and the\n      third faecal sample is taken at day 14 after initial sample. Patient will be randomized to\n      receive either of described formula after baseline (first) stool sample is obtained. Patient\n      will be monitored up to 14 days after the initial stool sample is obtained."

            "textblock": "Written approval of the study has been obtained from  the University Malaya Medical Centre\n      (UMMC) Ethics Committee before commencement of this study\n\n      Patients will be screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study and consent will\n      be obtained from the patients or their legal representative in view of most critically ill\n      patients are unconscious. Patients or their legal representative will be briefed regarding\n      the objectives and the design of the study.\n\n      Critically ill patients recruited for this study will be exclusively on EN as clinically\n      indicated. The volume of formula prescribed is based on each patient's total energy\n      expenditure, which will be calculated by clinical dietitians. Formula will be delivered\n      through a Ryles tube according to dietitians' order.\n\n      A faecal sample from the recruited patients will be collected for analysis at baseline, the\n      first stool output after initiation of EN.  Once baseline sample is collected, patients will\n      be randomly assigned to receive enteral formula with or without prebiotics. Randomisation\n      will be generated by using the website Randomization.com (http://www.randomization.com).\n      Patients will be monitored for at least 14 days from passage of the first faecal sample\n      after initiation of EN.\n\n      A faecal sample will be collected for analysis on days 0, 7, and 14. If there is absence of\n      habitual or meal cues to stool output, samples will be collected and analyzed from each\n      patient during 3 days periods at Day 6-8 for second faecal sample and Day  12-14 for the\n      third faecal sample.\n\n      To guarantee accurate measurement of microbiota and shirt chain fatty acids (SCFA), only\n      fresh faecal samples will be analyzed.Faecal samples will be collected within 1 hour of\n      voiding and will immediately be transported to the laboratory for analysis of microbiota.\n      The faecal sample will be homogenized using a sterile stainless steel Waring blender and\n      aliquots of each specimen and will be frozen at -80\u00b0C until DNA is extracted.\n\n      Although the study is an open-label study, the researcher will be blinded for the analysis\n      of the faecal sample for the quantification of faecal microbiota and short SCFA. An external\n      Predominant component of the faecal microbiota; Bacteroides, Bifidobacteria, Clostridia and\n      Lactobacilli will be quantified using Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Faecal SCFA\n      will be analyzed using gas-liquid chromatography, and C.difficile-enterotoxins A and B will\n      be measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit.\n\n      Faecal output will be recorded by nursing staff using a stool chart validated for use in\n      this patient group. The chart will aid in the characterization of faecal frequency,\n      consistency, and weight, which are then summarized into a daily stool score. A score of 15\n      or more is used to indicate diarrhoea (Whelan, Judd, Preedy, & Taylor, 2008). Patients will\n      be visited once, daily during weekdays and contacted by telephone during weekends to monitor\n      data recording by the nursing staff.\n\n      Details of EN regimen; formula used, amount, frequency, route and mode of delivery will be\n      recorded progressively. Demographic data such as age sex, race and clinical details such as\n      antibiotic, medications prescription and patients' progression will be extracted from the\n      patients' medical notes daily."
