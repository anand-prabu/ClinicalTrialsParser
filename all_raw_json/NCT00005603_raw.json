Combining more than one chemotherapy drug may kill\n      more cancer cells. It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more\n      effective for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in\n      treating children who have newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia."

Patients also\n           receive methotrexate intrathecally (IT) on days 1 and 8. Patients with CNS 2 or 3\n           disease also receive methotrexate IT on days 15 and 22.\n\n      Patients with M1 bone marrow proceed to consolidation therapy. Patients achieving M2 bone\n      marrow on day 29 receive oral prednisone 3 times daily on days 29-42; vincristine IV and\n      daunorubicin IV over 15 minutes on days 29 and 36; and asparaginase IM on days 29, 32, 36,\n      and 39. If bone marrow is M3 on day 29 or M2 on day 43, then patient is off study.\n\n        -  Consolidation therapy (weeks 6-14): Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 30\n           minutes on days 1 and 29; cytarabine subcutaneously (SC) or IV on days 2-5, 9-12,\n           30-33, and 37-40; oral mercaptopurine daily on days 1-14 and 29-42; vincristine IV on\n           days 15, 22, 43, and 50; asparaginase IM on days 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26, 43, 45, 47,\n           50, 52, and 54; and methotrexate IT on days 1, 15, 29, and 43.\n\n      Patients then proceed to interim maintenance and delayed intensification on weeks 15-46.\n      Courses repeat every 16 weeks.\n\n        -  Maintenance I and II (weeks 15-22 and 31-38): Patients receive vincristine IV and\n           methotrexate IV on days 1, 11, 21, 31, and 41; asparaginase IM on days 2, 12, 22, 32,\n           and 42; and methotrexate IT on days 1 and 31.\n\n        -  Delayed Intensification (weeks 23-36 and 39-42): Patients receive vincristine IV on\n           days 57, 64, and 71; methotrexate IT on day 57; oral dexamethasone 2-3 times daily on\n           days 57-63 and 71-77; doxorubicin IV over 15 minutes 3 times weekly on days 57, 64, and\n           71; and asparaginase IM on days 60, 62, 64, 67, 69, and 71.\n\n        -  Delayed Intensification-Reconsolidation (weeks 27-30 and 43-46): Patients receive oral\n           thioguanine on days 85-98; methotrexate IT on day 85; cyclophosphamide IV over 30\n           minutes on day 85; cytarabine IV or SC on days 86-89 and 93-96; asparaginase IM on days\n           99, 101, 103, 106, 108, and 110; and vincristine IV on days 99 and 106.\n\n        -  Continuation therapy (weeks 47-130): Patients receive vincristine IV on days 1, 29, and\n           57; oral dexamethasone twice daily for 5 consecutive days on days 1-5, 29-33, and\n           57-61; oral mercaptopurine on days 1-84; oral methotrexate on days 8, 15, 22, 29, 36,\n           43, 50, 57, 64, 71, and 78; and methotrexate IT on day 1.\n\n      Patients with CNS 3 disease or who are within 24 months of diagnosis with an initial WBC \u2265\n      100,000/mm^3 undergo whole brain radiotherapy (omit or discontinue mercaptopurine and IT\n      methotrexate) on day 1. Testicular radiotherapy also begins on day 1.\n\n      Patients may receive oral methotrexate on day 1 of each course (if IT methotrexate is not\n      administered).\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months\n      for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 260 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.1 years."
