One to four visits to the study doctor will be\n      required.\n\n      This study will investigate the diagnostic results of gadobutrol-enhanced Cardiac Magnetic\n      Resonance Imaging (CMRI) images regarding the detection (sensitivity) and exclusion\n      (specificity ) of coronary artery disease utilizing a uniform image acquisition software.\n      The CMR images will be tested either against the results from routine clinical Coronary\n      Angiography (CA) or those from Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA), which is used as the\n      standard of reference. The CA/CTA may have been performed up to 4 weeks prior to enrollment\n      or be scheduled up to 4/6 weeks after the study.\n\n      CMRI and CA/CTA images will be collected for an independent image review (blinded read)."
