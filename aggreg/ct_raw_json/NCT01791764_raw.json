However, a significant portion of these patients\n      won't receive optimal treatment due to the small number of tertiary centers with\n      interventional laboratories available for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n      Specially in large urban centers and rural areas, where tertiary care hospitals are\n      restricted to a specific region, alternative approaches must be developed. The\n      pharmacoinvasive strategy has emerged as an alternative for patients admitted to primary\n      care centers. It is based in up-front intravenous thrombolytic therapy and transfer to a\n      tertiary center where early, systematic, coronary intervention will be performed between 3\n      to 24 hours after the administration of thrombolytic drugs, even in cases in which\n      successful reperfusion was obtained."
