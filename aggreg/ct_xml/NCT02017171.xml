  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite improvements during the past 20 years in blood glucose and blood pressure control,
      diabetic kidney disease remains one of the most important causes of health problems in
      patients with diabetes.  Novel treatments to complement blood glucose and blood pressure
      control are urgently needed. The goal of this study is to see whether a medication called
      allopurinol may help prevent loss of kidney function among people with type 1 diabetes.
      Allopurinol has been used for many years to decrease high blood uric acid and treat gout - a
      disease characterized by arthritis, especially of the foot joints.  There is evidence
      suggesting that allopurinol might also be useful in people with diabetes who have normal or
      moderately impaired kidney function to decrease the risk of developing advanced kidney
      disease in the future.  To prove this beneficial effect of allopurinol, we will be
      conducting an international clinical trial at eight diabetes centers, enrolling
      approximately 480 patients with type 1 diabetes who are at increased risk of developing
      kidney disease.  Participants will be randomly assigned to take allopurinol or placebo
      (inactive pill) for three years, during which they will be followed through periodical
      visits.  To prevent any possible bias, neither the participants nor the clinical staff knows
      who is taking allopurinol and who is taking the placebo.  Kidney function will be measured
      at the beginning and at the end of the treatment period to see whether patients taking
      allopurinol experience a slower loss of kidney function over time as compared to those
      taking the inactive pill. If this trial is successful, the reduction in health problems
      resulting from the prevention or delay of kidney function loss due to the use of allopurinol
      would have a major impact on the lives of type 1 diabetic patients as well as on society at
      large, significantly reducing the human and financial costs associated with diabetic kidney
      disease. Because of the emphasis on early intervention, the proposed trial, if successful,
      will establish a new paradigm in treatments to slow or prevent progression towards end stage
      kidney disease in type 1 diabetes far beyond anything achieved to date.

    <textblock>
      Despite improvements in the past 20 years in glycemic and blood pressure control and the
      introduction of 'renoprotective' drugs such as renin-angiotensin system blockers, the
      incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in type 1 diabetes (T1D) is not declining. Novel
      therapies to complement these interventions are urgently needed. Mounting evidence from
      prospective studies indicates that moderately elevated serum uric acid is a strong,
      independent predictor of an increased risk of chronic kidney disease and increased rates of
      loss of kidney function among T1D persons. To study whether uric acid lowering can reduce
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR) loss in T1D, we have established the PERL (Preventing Early
      Renal Function Loss in Diabetes) Consortium including investigators from Joslin Diabetes
      Center, the Universities of Minnesota, Colorado, Toronto, and Michigan, Northwestern
      University, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and the Steno Diabetes Center in Denmark.
      With the support of NIH grant R03 DK094484, the Consortium has designed a three-year,
      multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial with the specific
      aim of evaluating the efficacy of the urate-lowering drug allopurinol, as compared to
      placebo, in reducing kidney function loss among subjects with T1D. The trial is targeted to
      T1D patients with microalbuminuria or moderate macroalbuminuria and serum uric acid levels ≥
      4.5 mg/dl, since these are the patients who are at very high risk of having rapid GFR
      decline and might benefit most from reductions in uric acid levels. Study subjects will be
      required to have a GFR between 45 and 99 ml/min/1.73 m2, consistent with the goal of
      intervening relatively early in the course of clinical DN rather than at later stages when
      structural changes are far advanced and a very large proportion of kidney function has
      already been lost. The primary endpoint of the study will be the GFR (as measured by iohexol
      plasma disappearance) at the end of a 2-month wash-out period after the 3-year intervention.
      Sample size calculations under various dropout and non-adherence scenarios suggest that 240
      subjects in each treatment arm would provide at least 80% power to detect a clinically
      meaningful and achievable reduction in GFR decline in the allopurinol vs. the placebo
      group.If we demonstrate that allopurinol can halt or slow down GFR decline in T1D subjects,
      we will provide a safe and inexpensive intervention to prevent or delay kidney failure in
      T1D that can be applied at the earliest clinically detectable stages of renal injury. It is
      difficult to overstate how significant this finding would be, both from the perspective of
      public health and that of persons with diabetes.
