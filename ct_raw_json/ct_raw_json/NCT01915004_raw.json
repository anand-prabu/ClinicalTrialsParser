These children present with urinary tract infections (UTIs), abnormal voiding\n      habits and various other lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTs) such as incontinence, urinary\n      urgency and urinary frequency. Furthermore, the effects of NLUTD on a child's physcial\n      health, mental health and its potential negative clinical sequelae, which includes upper or\n      lower urinary tract damage, must be taken into account when treating these children. These\n      patients have complex needs requiring a significant amount of health teaching and it is\n      imperative to determine the effectiveness of the various modes of delivering urotherapy. To\n      determine the best modality to deliver urotherapy, this trial will compare the effectiveness\n      of a 15 minute  bladder training video to the effectiveness of standard urotherapy provided\n      at a pediatric urology clinic at improving NLUTD/DES symptoms and quality of life in\n      children between 6-10 years of age."
