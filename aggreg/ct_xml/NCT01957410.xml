    <textblock>
      To evaluate if somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs)
      obtained with electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) can be used to detect
      changes in cortical plasticity in responders to a single IV infusion of ketamine as compared
      to non-responders.

      This study will be conducted in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and divided
      into 2 sequential cohorts. Cohort 1 will be conducted in 12 patients at a single center. For
      each patient, there will be up to 4 sequential phases: a screening phase of up to 6 weeks,
      an open-label treatment phase of up to 4 weeks, an optional open-label treatment phase of up
      to 1 week, and a follow-up phase of up to 1 week (if applicable). Cohort 2 will be conducted
      in 20 patients and will be a multicenter, double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows
      the treatment that the patient receives), randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance),
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the
      drug has a real effect in a clinical trial) design. For each patient, there will be up to 4
      sequential phases: a screening phase of up to 6 weeks, a double-blind treatment phase of up
      to 4 weeks, an optional open-label treatment phase of up to 1 week, and a follow-up phase of
      up to 1 week (if applicable). The total study duration for each patient will be maximally
      about 12 weeks. Participant safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>SEPs are the electrical signals generated by the nervous system in response to somatosensory stimuli - typically through electrical stimulation of the median nerve. SEPs are read on the skull with electroencephalography (EEG). SEPs will be carried out as described by Cornwell and colleagues (Cornwell 2012) with the exception that instead of using magnetoencephalography SEPs will be recorded using a 64-channel EEG system. Identical procedures will be employed prior to and after study drug administration.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 hours post-dose on Day 1</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>MEPs are generated when stimulation of the brain on the motor cortex (with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation [TMS], for example) causes the spinal cord and peripheral muscles to produce neuroelectrical signals. MEPs are typically measured in the hand muscles. The Motor Evoked Response to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS MEPs) is being evaluated in this study at baseline and regularly after study drug administration. TMS MEPs will be assessed as described by Di Lazzaro and colleagues (Di Lazzaro 2003).  A figure-of-eight coil will be held over the right motor cortex at the optimum scalp position to elicit motor responses in the contralateral first dorsal interosseus (FDI).</description>

The predefined dose and infusion rate/duration should not be adjusted. If a patient is unable to tolerate the study medication, the infusion should be stopped. Within 1 week of completion of the open-label treatment phase, participants can receive a single dose of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg administered as an IV infusion over 40 minutes during an optional open-label treatment phase.</description>
