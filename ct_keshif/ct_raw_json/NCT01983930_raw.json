Subjects will either receive: (1) MET\n      class for 60 minutes per week; or (2) Kundalini yoga and Kirtan Kriya meditation class for\n      60 minutes per week. All assessments will be completed immediately after the interventions\n      for a total of 10 visits in 12 weeks and a follow-up visit at 6 months (24 weeks)to monitor\n      the overall benefit of the intervention."
