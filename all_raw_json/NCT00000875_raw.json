To compare the effects on plasma and cell-associated viral\n      load following combination drug therapy with and without antiviral CTL in early-stage\n      patients. To study in detail the immune effects of lowering viral burden with antiviral\n      combination drugs with and without T cell infusion on antiviral CTL activity, viral\n      suppression and proliferation, circulating T cell phenotype, T cell apoptosis, CD4 cell\n      numbers, DTH reaction, and inflammatory cytokine levels.\n\n      In an HIV-infected person, there is an ongoing struggle between HIV replication and host\n      immune control. In the past decade most therapeutic strategies have targeted the virus. This\n      approach has been frustrated by viral mutation to evade drug sensitivity. Promising drugs\n      have recently been approved and there are encouraging sustained results from combination\n      antiviral chemotherapy. However, even the most potent drug regimens do not seem to be\n      curative, may eventually lead to drug resistance and may not completely restore lost immune\n      function. The addition of immune-based therapy to antiviral drugs may lead to better viral\n      control."

All patients receive combination drug therapy with\n      AZT/3TC/indinavir for 9 months at which time patients have the option of continuing their\n      study regimen another year or changing therapy. Patients in the T cell treatment regimen\n      (regimen 2) receive 2 infusions of ex vivo expanded autologous anti-HIV CTL at 3 and 6\n      months after beginning AZT/3TC/indinavir therapy. The second infusion is administered with\n      low-dose sc IL-2 1 day before and 4 days following T cell infusion."
