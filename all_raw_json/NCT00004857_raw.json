Monoclonal antibodies such as alemtuzumab can locate cancer\n      cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming\n      normal cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of fludarabine followed by alemtuzumab in\n      treating patients who have chronic lymphocytic leukemia."

Determine the overall response rate of previously untreated patients with\n      stage I, II, III, or IV B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia when treated with fludarabine\n      induction followed by alemtuzumab consolidation. II. Determine the infectious toxic effects\n      and feasibility of this regimen in this patient population. III. Determine the\n      treatment-related toxic effects, including infection and injection site reactions, of\n      subcutaneous vs intravenous alemtuzumab in patients treated with this regimen. IV. Determine\n      the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. V.\n      Determine the immunologic effects of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes 5 days a week. Treatment repeats\n      every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression. Patients undergo clinical\n      staging after completion of course 4 of fludarabine followed by 2 months of observation.\n      Patients with stable or responding disease receive alemtuzumab subcutaneously 3 days a week\n      for 6 weeks. Patients undergo clinical staging again after completion of 6 weeks of\n      alemtuzumab followed by 2 more months of observation. Patients are followed every 3 months\n      for 1 year and then every 6 months for 8 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
