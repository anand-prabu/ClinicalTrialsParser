The purpose of the present study is to determine the antimicrobial resistance\n      profiles in patients who have received numerous (\u2265 20) courses of antibiotics for\n      intravitreal injection compared with untreated controls.\n\n      This study compares 20 control patients without prior intravitreal injection to 20 patients\n      who have undergone \u2265 20 prior intravitreal injections accompanied by a course of topical\n      antibiotics for two days before and/or after the injection procedure. The lower, inner\n      eyelid and nasal cavity were cultured and evaluated via disk diffusion method for\n      antimicrobial sensitivity."
