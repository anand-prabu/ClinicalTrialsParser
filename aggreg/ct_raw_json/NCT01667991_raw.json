The incidence rates of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, which are\n      different between countries, will affect the accuracy of etiological diagnoses according to\n      the American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines. Therefore the investigators determined the\n      accuracy of the ATS criteria in predicting infection or colonization related to MDR bacteria\n      in China."
