            "textblock": "ST1968 is a novel camptothecin derivative which interacts with topoisomerase I-DNA complex,\n      inducing S-Phase specific cytotoxicity. It is endowed with a potent antitumor activity and\n      an increased Therapeutic Index with respect to the clinically used analogues (i.e.irinotecan\n      and topotecan) in some xenograft models (ovary, colon, head & neck, cervix). Anti-tumor\n      activity has been also noted in platinum resistant ovarian cell xenografts and in\n      topoisomerase I mutant prostate cell lines. The acceptable toxicity profile in animals and\n      the activity in camptothecin-resistant cell lines make ST1968 a good candidate for clinical\n      trials."
