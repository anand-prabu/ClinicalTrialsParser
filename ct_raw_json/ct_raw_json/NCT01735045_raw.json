(Success means both subject and practitioner are\n             satisfied with visual acuity, comfort, and ocular physiology).\n\n          -  Have non-diseased eyes which are normal or which have no preexisting ocular condition\n             which would interfere with the patient's ability to adapt to the new pair of LSH\n             Silicone Hydrogel Soft (hydrophilic) Contact Lenses.  A normal eye is defined as one\n             having all the following characteristics:\n\n               1. No evidence of lid infection.\n\n               2. No structural lid abnormality.\n\n               3. No conjunctival abnormality or infection.\n\n               4. A cornea which is clear with no edema, staining, vascularization or abnormal\n                  opacities, all as observed by slit lamp examination.\n\n               5. No iritis.\n\n               6. No other active ocular disease that would contraindicate use of the\n                  investigational lens.\n\n               7. No GPC (giant papillary conjunctivitis, tarsal abnormality) Grade 2 or greater\n\n          -  Use no ocular medication.\n\n          -  Have no known sensitivity to solutions currently used for contact lens care.\n\n          -  Have binocular correction with contact lenses.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria\n\n          -  Astigmatism >1.50D\n\n          -  No monocular or monovision fits may be included.\n\n          -  Pregnant and lactating women are excluded from the study\n\n          -  Minors (under age 18) are excluded from the study"
