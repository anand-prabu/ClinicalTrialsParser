  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea is a serious medical condition affecting an estimated 1-5% of
      children. The disease is believed to have several overlapping causes including large tonsils
      and small or narrow jaws. This prospective, randomized cross-over study will evaluate the
      effectiveness of orthodontic treatment of narrow upper teeth and jaws compared to the
      current standard of care which is surgical removal of the adenoids and tonsils.

      Patients will be evaluated by both an orthodontist and ENT physician, complete a series of
      questionnaires and undergo an overnight sleep study, both initially and after undergoing the
      randomized treatment. Patients who on reassessment have residual symptoms of sleep apnea
      will then be crossed over and receive the other form of treatment. The levels of improvement
      to both subjective (questionnaire) and objective (overnight sleep study) measures of sleep
      apnea will then be compared.

      The null hypothesis is there is no significant difference in improvement between maxillary
      expansion and adenotonsillectomy in the objective and subjective outcome measures in
      children with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ages 6.0 to 10.0 years at the time of screening;

          -  Diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea defined as AHI&gt;2, confirmed on overnight,
             laboratory-based PSG;

          -  Parental report of witnessed apneas or habitual snoring (on average more than 3
             nights per week);

          -  Deemed to be a candidate for ME by orthodontic evaluation;

          -  Deemed to be a candidate for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy by otolaryngologic
             evaluation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe OSA or significant hypoxemia in the presence of tonsillar or adenoid
             hypertrophy requiring surgical intervention defined as AHI&gt;25 or SpO2 &lt;90% for &gt;2%
             sleep time.

          -  An associated craniofacial syndrome or anomaly, including cleft lip and/or palate, or
             any anatomic or systemic condition that would otherwise exclude the patient from
             orthodontic treatment.

          -  Recurrent tonsillitis that meets American Academy of Otolaryngology â€” Head and Neck
             Surgery clinical practice guidelines for surgery.

          -  Extremely overweight defined as a body mass index z-score &gt; 2.99 for age group and
             sex.

          -  Severe health problems that could be exacerbated by delayed treatment for OSA,
             including: severe cardiopulmonary disorders (e.g., cystic fibrosis, congenital heart
             disease); sickle cell disease; poorly controlled asthma (with &gt; 1 hospitalization in
             last year); epilepsy requiring medication; diabetes (type 1 or type 2) requiring
             medication; doctor-diagnosed heart disease; or a history of stage II hypertension
             (HTN) defined as &gt; 99% percentile and/or requiring medication.

          -  Psychiatric or behavioral disorders that would otherwise exclude the patient from
             receiving orthodontic treatment
