Determine the objective response rate, progression-free survival, overall\n      survival, and time to treatment failure in patients with unresectable locally advanced or\n      metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction treated with oral\n      nitrocamptothecin. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior therapy (yes vs no). Patients receive\n      oral nitrocamptothecin on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every week for 8 courses in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding\n      disease after week 8 may receive additional courses of therapy. Patients are followed every\n      3 months until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 21-55 patients will be accrued for this study."
