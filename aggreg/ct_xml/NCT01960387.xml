  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination of clofarabine and cytarabine is an effective and reasonably well-tolerated
      treatment regimen in patients with either relapsed/refractory or newly diagnosed AML. For
      this prospective study, we propose the use of clofarabine and cytarabine for second course
      induction therapy for patients with persistent AML after treatment with an anthracycline and
      cytarabine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this prospective study is to evaluate the efficacy (i.e., complete
      response rate) of clofarabine and cytarabine as second course therapy for the treatment of
      AML. The secondary objectives are to assess the treatment-related toxicities, to determine
      the overall and relapse-free survival for patients with AML who are treated with this
      regimen, and to evaluate potential factors that are predictive of response.

      The investigational nature and objective of this study, the procedures involved and their
      associated risks, potential benefits, and potential alternative therapies will be explained
      to the patient, and a signed informed consent document will be obtained. Once consented,
      eligible patients will be treated by the acute leukemia service on the University of
      Pittsburgh Cancer Institute inpatient unit.

      Prior to the start of chemotherapy, patients will receive dexamethasone and ondansetron as
      pre-medication. Clofarabine will then be administered as intravenous infusion on days 1
      through 5. Patients will be monitored closely with vital signs. Cytarabine will then be
      given as intravenous infusion, starting 3 (maximum of 4) hours after the completion of
      clofarabine administration on days 1 through 5.
