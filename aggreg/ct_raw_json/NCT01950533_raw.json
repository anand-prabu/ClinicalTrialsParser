Although making\n      the appropriate diagnosis of food allergy is very important, properly diagnosing food\n      allergy has been a challenge. Skin prick testing and food-specific IgE testing of the blood\n      can give positive results that are false. Currently, Oral Food Challenges are the best way\n      to diagnose a food allergy. Unfortunately, Oral Food Challenges are time consuming and may\n      not be readily available to suspected food allergy sufferers. This study is designed to\n      examine the effectiveness of an allergy-detecting blood test called IMMULITE 2000\n      manufactured by the study sponsor, Siemens."
