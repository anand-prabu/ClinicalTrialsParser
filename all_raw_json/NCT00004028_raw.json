At the time of surgery, groups of 6 patients\n      receive up to 8 polifeprosan 20 wafers containing increasing doses of carmustine implanted\n      into the resection cavity.\n\n      Patients with an intraoperative diagnosis other than glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic\n      astrocytoma do not receive wafer implantation, and are removed from study.\n\n      Patients are followed 3, 6, and 12 months after implantation.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 52 patients will be accrued for this study."
