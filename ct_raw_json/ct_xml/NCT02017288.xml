      Background:

      - Cancer of the mouth and throat is one of the most common cancers in Taiwan. This cancer
      develops over several years, beginning as white or red patches in the mouth or throat that
      become growths. It can also cause a condition that leads to rigidity of the cheeks. The
      growths can be identified when a doctor looks into a person   s mouth. It is currently not
      clear why some people with abnormal growths progress to cancer while others do not.
      Researchers want to better understand why some patients with early abnormal growths get late
      abnormal growths. They also want to understand why some people get abnormal growths again,
      even after they receive treatment.

      Objectives:

      - To understand why some people with precancerous lesions in their mouth develop cancer
      while others do not.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults 21 years and older, some with abnormal growths in the mouth, some without any, and
      some with head and neck cancer.

      Design:

        -  Participants will visit a hospital in Taiwan 2 times.

        -  At the first visit, participants will answer questions about their health, lifestyle,
           and family medical history. A doctor will examine the participant   s mouth and take a
           small piece of any growth they see. They will do this with a brush. They will also
           photograph the participant   s mouth. Participants will also give blood and saliva
           samples, plus a small sample of a mouth rinse.

        -  Participants who are diagnosed with a late abnormal growth that is not cancer will
           return for a second visit. They will answer the same questions and undergo the same
           procedures as at the first study.

    <textblock>
      Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs), which include cancers of the oral cavity,
      oropharynx, and larynx, are the sixth most common cancer worldwide with an estimated annual
      burden of 355,000 deaths and 633,000 incident cases. HNSCCs are ideal candidates for
      screening, early detection, and secondary prevention given the amenability for visual
      inspection and specimen collection, the availability of recognized premalignant lesions
      (clinically-defined as leukoplakia, erythroplakia, and submucous fibrosis and
      histologically-defined based on the grade of dysplasia), and evidence that screening and
      early detection can lead to significant reductions in mortality. Nonetheless, there are
      currently no guidelines for screening, treatment, or follow-up of patients with HNSCC
      precursors, in part, owing to the current gaps in knowledge regarding the early and
      long-term natural history of clinical/histologic precursor lesions, the lack of validated
      predictive biomarkers, and thus the inability to accurately identify those lesions that are
      most likely to progress to cancer.

      To address these gaps in knowledge, we plan to conduct a prospective cohort study to
      investigate the early natural history of HNSCC precursors, including: 1) the rates and time
      course of progression or regression of precursor lesions, 2) ability of epidemiologic
      variables and tissue-based biomarkers in predicting progression/regression, and 3)
      feasibility of identifying promising biomarkers in less invasively collected specimens.

      The current concept pertains to a pilot study in Taiwan to evaluate the feasibility of
      conducting a prospective cohort study. The goals of the pilot study are: 1) to pilot the
      study procedures, including recruitment and follow-up of participants, collection of
      questionnaire data, and collection, storage, and testing of biologic specimens and 2) to
      collect preliminary data, such as prevalence of risk factors and histologic precursors, to
      aid in the design of a cohort study. Furthermore, the pilot study will be adequately large
      to conduct case-control comparisons of risk factors and molecular markers across the control
        precursor   cancer continuum.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA

        We plan to recruit all patients (controls, precursors, and invasive cancers) at the
        aforementioned two hospitals. Doctors at these hospitals conduct routine visual and
        tactile examination as part of Taiwan   s national oral cancer screening program. For this
        screening program, all individuals aged 21 years or older who chew betel-quid or smoke are
        screened through visual inspection for the presence of precursor lesions or cancer.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        The following individuals will be excluded from the study: subjects younger than 21 years,
        individuals with a history of cancer, and mentally incompetent individuals.
