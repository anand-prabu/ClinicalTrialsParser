Subjects will\n      be selected, by way of clinical evaluation and response to medial branch blocks, to undergo\n      this procedure of radiofrequency ablation/neurotomies of the medial branches to the specific\n      painful facet joints of the low back in order to relieve pain.  This will be carried out\n      with an FDA-approved device using a standard technique that has been accepted throughout the\n      world.  The difference in this study is that we will make use of MRIs to image the lesion\n      that is produced and a special EMG study to look at the muscles in the back to document the\n      effectiveness of the device in creating the intended lesion.  No other study of this kind\n      has been produced to look at this or any other radiofrequency device in the treatment of low\n      back pain."

Presentation of study to patient and informed consent obtained\n\n        3. Baseline paraspinous muscle EMG performed\n\n        4. MB (medial branch)/DR (dorsal ramus) radiofrequency neurotomy with Nimbus MEE probe\n           (start date)\n\n        5. Post-operative soreness managed with oral and topical medications and possibly 1-4\n           physical therapy sessions, as needed\n\n        6. MD visit at intake evaluation and at 3 and 6 weeks following the procedure.\n\n        7. Paraspinal needle electromyography, using the mini-paraspinal mapping (\"miniPM\")\n           technique of Haig will be carried out at baseline (pre-procedure) and between 3 and 6\n           weeks post-procedure.\n\n        8. MRI, with sequencing which allows for volumetric calculations (see Appendix III), will\n           be obtained on all of the ten chosen subjects at 7 days post-procedure.  If there is\n           any evidence of edema or coagulation changes with volume of greater than 600 cubic mm,\n           or evidence of bony edema or other changes believed to be due to the procedure, then a\n           follow up MRI will be obtained at 14 days post-procedure. If bony edema changes are\n           present at 14 days, repeat MRI will be obtained at 6 weeks post-procedure.\n\n        9. Procedural details, including procedural and fluoroscopy times, will be collected for\n           each subject.  A matched cohort of patients who have undergone MB RFN (radiofrequency\n           neurotomy) using the previous/current method have had the same data obtained for group\n           comparisons.\n\n      Lumbar Paraspinal Mapping:\n\n      The adequate cauterization of the targeted medial branches will be confirmed using the\n      paraspinal mapping (PM) technique of Haig.  This testing will be carried out on all subjects\n      at 3-6 weeks post radiofrequency neurotomies, by electromyographers blinded to the side and\n      levels of the procedure.  Subjects found to have reliable evidence of spontaneous electrical\n      activity, as detailed in, will be deemed to have had a successful denervation of the medial\n      branch in question.\n\n      Baseline PM will also be carried out at enrollment to document a normal baseline and to rule\n      out the presence of spontaneous activity from other underlying pathology.  Those found to\n      have findings of spontaneous activity, upon baseline needle EMG of the lumbar paraspinals,\n      will be excluded from the study.\n\n      Lumbar MRI - Post-Procedure\n\n      The ten study participants in this study will undergo lumbar MRI, using sequencing that will\n      allow volume calculations of any soft tissue or bony findings of edema or coagulation.\n      Experience thus far would indicate that the zone of edema can be identified, but that the\n      zone of tissue coagulation (smaller than the zone of edema) cannot be reliably demarcated.\n      Bench research using the Nimbus MEE probe indicates a zone of coagulation of 550 cubic mm or\n      less, and the expected findings on MRI would consist of a zone of edema in this range,\n      although MRI evidence of edema may be found in a larger volume of soft tissue, given that\n      edema changes would be expected to be present in an area larger than the area of\n      coagulation. The intention is to provide evidence that the area treated includes the known\n      location of the targeted medial branch, but that bone edema or other unintended findings are\n      not encountered. These MRIs will be obtained at 7 days post-procedure. If there is evidence\n      for unintended bony edema, then these subjects will return for repeat MRI at 14 days\n      post-procedure.  If any of these unexpected findings are still present at 14 days\n      post-procedure, then these subjects will be asked to undergo a third MRI at 6 weeks\n      post-procedure.  Images will be interpreted by a radiologist who is board certified in\n      diagnostic radiology.  Post-procedure MRI scoring will include documentation of the presence\n      or absence of lesions, calculated volume of lesions, whether the lesion covers the\n      anatomical location of the medial branch, and whether there is any evidence of bone edema at\n      the lesion site(s)."
