      The purpose of this Phase 1 trial is to evaluate the PK, safety and tolerability of
      oritavancin in patients &lt;18 years old with a confirmed or suspected bacterial infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, PK, safety and tolerability study of oritavancin
      in pediatric patients (&lt;18 years of age) with suspected or confirmed Gram-positive bacterial
      infections. Approximately 48 patients will be enrolled at 10-15 US centers.  This study will
      include 5 age cohorts and patients will be entered in a stepwise approach starting with the
      older age cohort (12-&lt;18 years).  The starting dose will be IV oritavancin 15 mg/kg.    The
      safety, tolerability and PK data will be reviewed at the completion of each cohort to ensure
      safety and determine the appropriate dose for the next age cohort.  At least 8 patients will
      be enrolled in each cohort except for the birth to &lt;3 month age cohort which will have at
      least 16 patients enrolled. Seven PK samples will be collected over 14 days.  The safety
      follow-up will complete with a 60-day phone call to the caregiver.

             patient has given verbal assent where appropriate.

          -  Suspected or confirmed Gram positive bacterial infection receiving antibiotic therapy

          -  Intravenous access to administer study drug

          -  In the investigator's opinion, the patient will require hospitalization for at least
             24 hours after the study drug is administered.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Septic shock or acute haemodynamic instability.

          -  History of immune-related hypersensitivity reaction to glycopeptides (such as
             vancomycin, televancin, or teicoplanin) or any of their excipients.

          -  Currently using vancomycin or other glycopeptides

          -  Females who are of childbearing potential and unwilling to practice abstinence or use
             at least two methods of contraception or female patients of childbearing who are
             lactating or have a positive pregnancy test result at screening

             control during the entire study period

          -  Any surgical or medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would

             PK of the study drug.

          -  Patients whom the investigator considers unlikely to adhere to the protocol, comply
             with study drug administration, or complete the clinical study

          -  Treatment with investigational medicinal product or investigational device within 30
             days (or 5 times the half-life of the investigational medicine, whichever is longer)
             before enrollment and for the duration of the study.

          -  Any clinically significant disease or condition affecting a major organ system,
             including but not limited to gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, endocrinologic,
