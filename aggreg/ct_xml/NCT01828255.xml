    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate how the intraocular pressure (IOP) varies in
      time and if the IOP variations are associated with the worsening of glaucoma. IOP patterns
      will be recorded continuously over 24 hours with SENSIMED Triggerfish速, a portable
      investigational device using a contact lens sensor. After completing the Triggerfish lens
      placement and removal; the patient will complete a formal Polysomnography.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age between 40 and 89 years old

          -  Diagnosis of treated POAG (including NTG)

          -  All IOP measurements during the VF period (to be described further) equal or lower
             than 18 mmHg and/or on average equal or lower than 16 mmHg in the same period

          -  Documented glaucomatous VF damage at baseline, characterized by glaucoma hemifield
             test result outside normal limits on at least 2 consecutive VF tests or the presence
             of at least 3 contiguous test points within the same hemifield on the pattern
             deviation plot at p&lt;0.01, with at least 1 point at p &lt; 0.005

          -  At least 8 visual field tests carried out within at least 2 years, all with fixation
             losses and false positive/negative results equal or less than 33%

          -  For fast progressing eyes, 1) pointwise progression defined as two or more adjacent
             VF test locations in the same hemifield that show a threshold sensitivity rate of
             change more negative than -1.0 dB/year with p&lt;0.01 or 2) a global rate of VF change
             based on MD more negative than -1.0 dB/year

          -  For slowly or minimally progressing eyes a VF MD rate of change more positive than
             -0.5 dB/year with no significant pointwise progression as described above

          -  Not more than 6 diopters spherical equivalent on the study eye

          -  Have given written informed consent, prior to any investigational procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Baseline VF MD more negative than -15 dB. The rationale here is that in severely
             damaged visual fields, one may not be able to detect and measure rates of progression
             due to a 'floor effect'

          -  Corneal or conjunctival abnormality precluding contact lens adaptation

          -  Severe dry eye syndrome or other ocular disease

          -  Patients with angle closure glaucoma, traumatic glaucoma or uveitic glaucoma

          -  Patients with previous intraocular surgery in the enrolled eye, including cataract
             surgery

          -  Patients with allergy to corneal anesthetic

          -  Patients with contraindications for silicone contact lens wear

          -  Patients not able to understand the character and individual consequences of the
             investigation

          -  Participation in unrelated clinical research within the last 4 weeks
