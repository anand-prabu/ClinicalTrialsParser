The intervention will focus on nutritional education, healthy eating, increased physical activity levels (aiming initially at 10 minutes/day, then increasing to 30 minutes/day) and cognitive therapy."

Unfortunately there are very few studies in this area and little\n      is known about the causes for lack of success or the best approach to treat this group of\n      patients. The main aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of two different lifestyle\n      treatment programs in this group of patients: 1) Hospital-based outpatient program or 2) an\n      inpatient treatment program consisting of 3 - 3-week stays at a rehabilitation center over a\n      1-year period. Secondary aim is to determine potential reasons for suboptimal weight loss\n      after bariatric surgery."
