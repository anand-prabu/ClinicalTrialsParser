            "textblock": "While thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) has been a primary component in successful treatment\n      of a variety of childhood and adult cancers, the exposure to this treatment has been\n      associated with significant cardiovascular and pulmonary morbidity in long-term survivors.\n      Within non-cancer populations, cardiovascular and pulmonary morbidity is associated with\n      increased risk for cerebral vascular accidents (CVAs), accelerated brain atrophy and\n      neurocognitive impairment. Patients with chronic heart disease demonstrate problems with\n      attention, processing speed, memory, and executive functions. Chronic pulmonary disease also\n      increases the risk of stroke, leukoencephalopathy, and neurocognitive impairment in\n      non-cancer populations.  The investigators propose to examine indices of brain integrity,\n      including neurocognitive performance and brain MRI/MRA, in long-term adult survivors of\n      Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) treated with thoracic radiation and no direct central nervous system\n      therapy.\n\n      OBJECTIVES:\n\n        1. To evaluate brain integrity in adult survivors of childhood HL treated with thoracic\n           radiation therapy.\n\n        2. To identify therapeutic factors associated with brain integrity in adult survivors of\n           childhood HL who are at risk for cardiac and pulmonary morbidity.\n\n        3. To examine associations between cardiac, vascular and pulmonary health and brain\n           integrity in adult survivors of childhood HL treated with thoracic radiation."
