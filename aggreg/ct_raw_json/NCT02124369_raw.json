            "textblock": "Pancreatic cancer is difficult to treat, and even in a situation where an operation can be\n      performed to remove the cancer, the disease can unfortunately come back soon afterwards.\n      When pancreatic cancer is more advanced, the outcomes are even less positive. Recently, a\n      large international study showed that combining a chemotherapy drug that is standard for\n      treating pancreatic cancer, called gemcitabine with a new chemotherapy drug called Abraxane\n      was more effective than gemcitabine alone for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to determine whether this combination of gemcitabine and\n      Abraxane can shrink a pancreatic cancer that is not thought to be operable enough to enable\n      it to be removed by surgery. It is hoped that in this way, the treatment may improve the\n      outcome. In addition, in this study we would like to analyse the appearances of the tumour\n      using imaging, and collect blood and tumour samples to try to confirm laboratory research\n      that has been carried out with this treatment."

            "textblock": "This is a single-centre, non-randomised, phase 2a, single arm, Simon two-stage design trial\n      of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine (ABX/GEM) in patients with histological documentation of\n      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) who are determined by central radiological review to\n      have \"category 2\" borderline unresectable LAPC. We will investigate the feasibility of\n      administering ABX/GEM in terms of safety and efficacy, and will study activity both in terms\n      of radiological response and the feasibility of downstaging patients to \"category 1\" status,\n      in order to attempt resection after up to 6 cycles of combination treatment. In addition to\n      adding to data on the safety and tolerability of this combination, peri- and post-operative\n      morbidity following this treatment will be evaluated. As part of the trial, detailed\n      correlative studies will be undertaken to evaluate the mechanism of action of the\n      combination, at a tissue level, a circulating biomarker level and a radiological level.\n\n      We propose that the tumour shrinkage (response) seen in Stage IV pancreatic cancer patients\n      as a result of ABX/GEM may translate to a realistic prospect of downstaging borderline\n      unresectable LAPC tumours sufficiently to enable resection. Notionally, even in the absence\n      of a classical partial response by RECIST criteria (\u226530% reduction in sum of longest\n      diameters) a beneficial outcome may arise from any tumour shrinkage sufficient to permit the\n      tumour to be separated from major vessels thus rendering it resectable. Such an outcome may\n      significantly alter the poor survival outcomes in this group of patients. The PRICKLE\n      clinical study paradigm is useful for evaluating novel agents and combinations that show\n      impressive activity in the pre-clinical or advanced setting and offers an opportunity for\n      detailed correlative translational studies to evaluate activities of therapy."
