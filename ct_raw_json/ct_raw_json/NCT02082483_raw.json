Asymptomatic wait-listed patients will be randomized to routine\n      screening for coronary artery diesease (CAD) (i.e. Myocardial Perfusion Scintigraphy (MPS)\n      or Dobutamine Stress Echo (DSE)) as per the current standard of care versus selective\n      screening based on symptoms. Patients enrolled in the pilot will be included in the\n      definitive trial analysis. The pilot trial will include four Canadian centres. The\n      definitive trial will aim to determine if a strategy of selective use of screening tests\n      (i.e. Myocardial Perfusion Scintigraphy or Dobutamine Stress Echo) only in the presence of\n      symptoms (i.e. chest pain, dyspnea etc) is non-inferior with respect to the composite\n      endpoint of non-fatal MI and cardiac death compared to screening all asymptomatic\n      wait-listed patients at regular intervals as described in transplant specific guidelines\n      published by the National Kidney Foundation.\n\n      Currently there is no strong evidence for or against using routine cardiac screening of\n      asymptomatic transplant patients, more evidence based randomized clinical trials are needed.\n      This need is further highlighted by a number of factors such as: wait-listed patients are\n      increasing in number and medical complexity; longer wait times and changing donor\n      characteristics can increase CAD risk; wait-listed patients are at high risk for CAD but are\n      commonly asymptomatic; the standard of care is not evidence based and is expensive; the\n      current standard may be harmful. The study will determine feasibility of a definitive trial\n      through the measures outlined under 'Outcome Measures'.\n\n      End stage renal disease (ESRD) patients wait-listed for kidney transplantation will be\n      randomized to undergo selective screening for CAD, in which patients are only screened if\n      they develop symptoms suggestive of CAD or the current standard of care that involves\n      regular screening for CAD at fixed time intervals based on the presence of risk factors.\n      Patients will remain on the pilot trial protocol until death, non-fatal MI, transplantation,\n      permanent removal from the waiting list for any reason, or 24 months after enrolment in the\n      pilot trial. During wait-listing, follow-up telephone interviews and chart reviews will be\n      performed every six months. After transplantation, an in-person follow up visit and chart\n      review will occur at the time of discharge from hospital, and a telephone interview and\n      chart review will be performed 3 months after transplantation. Patients will be followed for\n      24 months from the date of enrolment. Patients who receive a kidney transplant during the\n      study will be followed for 27 months.\n\n      For the pilot trial, descriptive analyses are planned. Feasibility will be summarized with\n      proportions, rates, means, and medians as appropriate. Comparison of the definitive trial\n      outcomes between treatment groups, will not be done at the end of the internal pilot as\n      these patients will be included in the definitive trial. Analyses of enrolment rates and\n      consent rates will be done after the enrolment phase of the pilot trial in late 2014. An\n      interim analysis of protocol adherence is planned in mid 2016 in support of the definitive\n      trial funding application in September, 2016."
