The active ingredient in\n      both implants is levonorgestrel (LNG) which is a synthetic progestin that has been used in\n      combined oral contraceptives and in progestin-only pills for more than 30 years.\n\n      Population:  A total of 280 women between the ages of 18 to 44 years who are currently using\n      Sino-implant (II) or Jadelle contraceptive implants will be enrolled in one of six cohorts\n      of women:\n\n      Cohort 1: (n=20 Sino-implant (II), n=20 Jadelle) women enrolled 1-3 months before their\n      6-month insertion anniversary.\n\n      Cohort 2: (n=20 Sino-implant (II), n=20 Jadelle) women enrolled 1-3 months before their\n      12-month insertion anniversary.\n\n      Cohort 3: (n=20 Sino-implant (II), n=20 Jadelle) women enrolled 1-3 months before their\n      24-month insertion anniversary.\n\n      Cohort 4: (n=20 Sino-implant (II), n=20 Jadelle) women enrolled 1-3 months before their\n      36-month insertion anniversary.\n\n      Cohort 5: (n=40 Sino-implant (II), n=40 Jadelle) women enrolled 1-3 months before their\n      48-month insertion anniversary.\n\n      Cohort 6: (n=40 Jadelle) women enrolled 2-6 months before their 60-month insertion\n      anniversary.\n\n      Women in all cohorts will be followed for up to 6 months.\n\n      Study Duration:  Up to 6 months of participant recruitment and up to 6 months elapsed after\n      the baseline visit for the second study visits.  15 months total in the field including\n      training, study initiation, recruitment, follow-up, and close-out.\n\n      Two blood samples spaced 2 to 6 months apart will be drawn from each woman for hormone\n      measurements.\n\n      Primary Objective:  To compare total and free levonorgestrel (LNG) plasma concentrations at\n      four years of Sino-implant (II) use to total and free LNG plasma concentrations at five\n      years of Jadelle use in Kenyan women\n\n      Secondary Objectives:\n\n        1.
