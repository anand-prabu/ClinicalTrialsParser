The first arm will receive an intra-articular\n      injection of MTF into the knee joint under fluoroscopy.

The secondary objective of efficacy\n      will include evaluation at baseline and at months 3 and 12 of efficacy endpoints of joint\n      function improvement as assessed by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis\n      Index (WOMAC)."
