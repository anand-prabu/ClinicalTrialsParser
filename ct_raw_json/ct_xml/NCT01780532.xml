    <textblock>
      After locating the suspicious lesion/mass with standard of care mammography and/or
      ultrasound, a photoacoustic scan will be performed in the breast where the lesion is
      located. After the PA scan a biopsy will be performed, if clinically indicated (based on the
      mammogram and ultrasound only).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a breast lesion/mass found at physical examination, mammography or

          -  Patients may have any of the following characteristics:

               -  Taking hormones (e.g., contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, post-cancer

               -  Previous breast biopsy

               -  Previous breast surgery

               -  Previous breast cancer

               -  High risk of breast cancer (e.g., breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA)
                  mutations, other gynecologic cancer)

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:
