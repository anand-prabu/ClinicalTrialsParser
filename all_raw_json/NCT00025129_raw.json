Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for\n      up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of VNP40101M until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 of\n      6 patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
