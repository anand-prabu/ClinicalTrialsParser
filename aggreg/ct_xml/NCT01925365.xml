  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intake of whole grain cereals has been associated with reducing the risk of hyperlipidaemia
      and heart disease, however the mechanisms by which oats or oat fractions exert this effect
      is not totally clear. Furthermore, several large epidemiological studies and a number of
      recent meta-analyses of nutritional interventions have reported a positive association
      between increased whole grain intake and reduced risk of developing a range of chronic
      diseases.  Recognising the important role of the gut microbiota in metabolism and metabolic
      disease risk, we examined the impact of whole grain oats on the human gut microbiota and
      cardio-metabolic risk factors.

      The main aims of this human study is to determine the effectiveness of a low GI whole grain
      oats breakfast cereal compared to a high GI, refined breakfast cereal to beneficially
      modulate gut microbiota and its metabolic output, plasma lipids, gut satiety hormones and
      inflammation markers in an at risk of cardio-metabolic disease population
