  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to assess the ability of a modified version of Behavioral Activation
      for occupational and social improvement to produce change in: 1. social adjustment, 2. work
      functioning, 3. avoidance behavior and 4. behavioral activation.

    <textblock>
      Psychosocial functioning was assessed before and after BA treatment in medication responsive
      depressed individuals who continued to have impaired social functioning. The primary goal
      was to demonstrate feasibility of recruitment and retention, and obtain an open pilot sense
      as to whether there are benefits from this brief psychotherapy approach in this population.
      The investigators also planned to refine measures and estimate the effect size of any
      treatment response to estimate power and sample size with the goal of completing a future
      controlled study.

    <description>BA is a manualized psychotherapy which has demonstrated comparable efficacy to cognitive behavioral treatment and antidepressant medication for the acute treatment of depression.  BA has two primary foci: 1) functional analyses of cognitive and behavioral processes that involve avoidance and 2) using avoided activities to guide activity scheduling. In the current study, BA's focus but not its principles was shifted to target work dysfunction by activating the patient into employment-related goals.  BA-W consisted of 12 50-minute weekly sessions. Conceptualizing work dysfunction as a product of avoidance patterns and low levels of positive reinforcement, the treatment rationale viewed maladaptive coping strategies such as avoidance as maintaining work dysfunction beyond remission of symptoms. Rather than broadly activating patients, activity scheduling focused on tasks such as sending out resumes, calling for job interviews, and networking to meet potential employers.</description>
