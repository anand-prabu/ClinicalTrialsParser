  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the proposed study is to determine optimal parameter of focal muscle
      vibration for improving spasticity and identify neurophysiological mechanism in healthy
      subjects.

      In investigation I-1, subjects will undergo focal muscle vibration with 40, 80, 120 Hz
      frequency at the medial gastrocnemius muscles (mGCM). As a surrogate maker of spasticity,
      H-reflex and compound motor action potential (CMAP) of the tibial nerve at mGCM will be
      recorded pre, during, and post vibration.

      In investigation I-2, subjects will undergo focal muscle vibration with 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 mm
      amplitude at mGCM. H-reflex and CMAP of the tibial nerve at mGCM will be recorded pre,
      during, and post vibration.

      In investigation II, subjects will undergo focal muscle vibration with predetermined
      parameters by the investigation I at mGCM. H-reflex and CMAP of the tibial nerve and motor
      evoked potential at mGCM will be recorded pre, during, and post vibration.
