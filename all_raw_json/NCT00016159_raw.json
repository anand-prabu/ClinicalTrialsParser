Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill\n      them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining\n      monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy and\n      monoclonal antibody in treating patients who have acute promyelocytic leukemia."

Approximately 2-4 weeks after completion of MOAB HuM195, patients\n      receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours daily for a total of 25 days with no more than 5\n      days between doses.\n\n      Beginning approximately 4-6 weeks after completion of arsenic trioxide, patients receive\n      idarubicin IV daily on days 1-3 or 1-4 and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning\n      on day 5 or 6 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for\n      patients who remain RT-PCR positive or are newly converted to RT-PCR negative (molecular\n      complete remission) following a prior course of idarubicin for a maximum of 3 courses.\n      Patients who remain RT-PCR positive following course 3 of idarubicin receive no further\n      treatment on study.\n\n      Beginning 3 months after completion of idarubicin, patients in molecular complete remission\n      receive oral tretinoin daily for 14 days. Treatment repeats every 3 months for a total of 6\n      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 35 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-3\n      years."
