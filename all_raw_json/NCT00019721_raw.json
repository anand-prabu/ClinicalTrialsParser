Combining\n      vaccine therapy with interleukin-2 may be an effective treatment for metastatic melanoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of vaccine therapy with or without\n      interleukin-2 in treating patients who have metastatic melanoma that has not responded to\n      previous therapy."

(Arm I closed as of 10/30/02).\n\n             -  Arm II: Patients receive both peptides as in arm I on day 1 and high-dose IL-2 IV\n                over 15 minutes every 8 hours on days 2-5 (for up to 12 doses). (Arm II closed as\n                of 10/30/02).\n\n        -  Group B (ineligible to receive IL-2 due to other debilitating disease): Patients\n           receive treatment as in group A, arm I.\n\n        -  Group C (need immediate IL-2 therapy due to extensive and rapid progression of\n           disease): Patients receive treatment as in group A, arm II. (Group C closed as of\n           10/30/02).\n\n        -  Group D (prior immunization with gp100 antigen): Patients receive modified\n           MART-1:26-35(27L) peptide emulsified in ISA-51 SC on day 1.\n\n      Treatment in all groups repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses. Patients who achieve a minor,\n      mixed, or partial response may receive up to 12 additional courses. Patients who achieve\n      complete response receive 2 additional courses.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4-6 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 103 patients (15-25 for group A, arm I; 19-33 for group A, arm\n      II; and 15 each for groups B, C, and D) will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
