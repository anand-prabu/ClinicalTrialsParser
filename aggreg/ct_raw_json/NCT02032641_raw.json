The eyebrow hairs were covered with white tape to prevent inadvertent alopecia. The laser handpiece was oriented perpendicular to the skin at all times, at a distance of 1-2 cm. Patients were instructed throughout to give verbal feedback regarding if the area was \"too hot\" as an additional safeguard against epidermal damage. Each patient had one scar treated with Laser Genesis, and the other side was observed without treatment until 1 month after study completion. In patients who achieve a cosmetic improvement in the scar appearance from treatment, contralateral treatment will be offered post study completion."
