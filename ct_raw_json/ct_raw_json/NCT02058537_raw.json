When the tube is in the esophagus, the patient is asked to swallow several times while swallowing water, applesauce, crackers, and marshmallows. These swallows will be completed while laying down, sitting upright, and standing. The pressure of the muscle contractions will be measured along several sections of the tube. The tube is removed after the tests are completed. This test allows for a quantitative measure of the pressure in the esophagus that can be correlated to difficulty or ease of bolus swallowing.",
