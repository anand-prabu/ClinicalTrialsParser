Reference point\n             will be the refill volume and programming of the pump made at first visit with saline\n             refill in study sNN0031-002. Values within 25% of expected will be an indication that\n             the pump is functioning properly\n\n          -  Ophthalmologic examination with no clinically significant findings that imply safety\n             concerns for this study such as retinal haemorrhage, signs for papillary oedema\n\n          -  Females should either be post-menopausal (at least 12 months of spontaneous\n             amenorrhea or 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhoea with follicle stimulating hormone\n             levels >40 mIU/mL), be surgically sterilised (bilateral oophorectomy without\n             hysterectomy), or use adequate contraception (oral contraceptives, intrauterine\n             device or double barrier contraception, i.e., condom + diaphragm, condom or diaphragm\n             + spermicidal gel or foam) during the duration of the study\n\n          -  The patient, with or without the help of a caregiver, must be capable of maintaining\n             an accurate and complete symptom diary and to adhere to visit schedules\n\n          -  The patient has been given written and verbal information about the study, has had\n             the opportunity to ask questions about the study, and understands the time and\n             procedural commitments\n\n          -  The patient has provided written informed consent to participate in the study before\n             any study-specific procedures are conducted\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Participation in another clinical study that entails investigational drug or device\n             treatment after participation in study sNN0031-001 or study sNN0031-002\n\n          -  The patient has, since participation in study sNN0031-001, had functional\n             neurosurgical treatment for PD (e.g., deep brain stimulation)\n\n          -  Concurrent dementia with a score of 20 or lower on the MoCA-test\n\n          -  Concurrent clinically significant depression with a score of 16 or higher on the\n             MADRS rating scale, equivalent to moderate or severe depression.\n\n          -  Exposure to neuroleptic drugs blocking dopamine receptors within 6 months from the\n             baseline visit of this study\n\n          -  History of structural brain disease including tumours and hyperplasia\n\n          -  Ongoing or suspected primary or recurrent malignant disease\n\n          -  History of increased intracranial pressure\n\n          -  Uncontrolled hypertension with blood pressure >160 mmHg systolic or >90 mmHg\n             diastolic.\n\n          -  Completion of an MRI examination of the brain and cervical spinal cord within 3\n             months prior to study start with finding of tumours or potential sources of\n             pathological bleedings, or abnormality that may or would interfere with the\n             assessments of safety or efficacy, in the judgment of the Investigator\n\n          -  Presence of cardiac pacemakers, spinal cord stimulators, implantable programmable\n             intraspinal drug pumps, or any other device that may interfere or interact with the\n             programmer\n\n          -  Clinically significant abnormalities in haematology or clinical chemistry parameters\n             indicative of a medical condition requiring treatment which, in the opinion of the\n             Investigator, is not compatible with participation in the present study\n\n          -  Ongoing medical condition that according to the Investigator would interfere with the\n             conduct and assessments in the study. Examples are medical disability (e.g., severe\n             degenerative arthritis, compromised nutritional state, peripheral neuropathy) that\n             would interfere with the assessment of safety and efficacy of investigational product\n             or device performance, or would compromise the ability of the patient to undergo\n             study procedures (e.g., MRI), to maintain a patient diary or to give informed\n             consent.\n\n          -  Serological evidence of HBV, HCV or HIV.\n\n          -  Tuberculosis (TB) as detected by positive findings in chest X-ray and microscopy of\n             urine.\n\n          -  Increased susceptibility to infections (e.g. malignancies, neutropenia,\n             immunodeficient states, immunosuppressive therapy)."
