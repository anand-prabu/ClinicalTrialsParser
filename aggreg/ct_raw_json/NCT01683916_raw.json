Anesthetic\n      requirements and stress hormone response in SCI patients undergoing anesthesia with\n      sevoflurane supplemented with clinically equivalent doses of either N2O or remifentanil.\n      Forty-five SCI patients scheduled to undergo pressor sore surgery below the level of the\n      injury are randomly allocated to receive either sevoflurane alone (control, n=15), or\n      combined with 67% N2O (n=15) or target-controlled infusions of 1.37 ng/mL remifentanil\n      (n=15). Sevoflurane concentration is titrated to maintain a Bispectral Index (BIS) value of\n      40-50. Measurements include end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations, mean arterial blood\n      pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and plasma catecholamine and cortisol concentrations."
