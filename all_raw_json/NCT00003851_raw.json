It is not yet\n      known if gemcitabine is more effective than pancreatic enzyme therapy plus specialized diet\n      for pancreatic cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is comparing the effectiveness of gemcitabine with that of\n      pancreatic enzyme therapy plus specialized diet (Gonzalez regimen) in treating patients who\n      have stage II, stage III, or stage IV pancreatic cancer."

Patients are stratified according to stage (II or III\n      vs IV), performance status (0-1 vs 2) and nutritional status (well nourished or moderately\n      malnourished vs severely malnourished). Patients are entered into 1 of 2 treatment arms at\n      their choice:\n\n        -  Arm I (Nutritional Arm): Patients receive pancreatic enzymes orally every 4 hours and\n           at meals daily on days 1-16, followed by 5 days of rest. Patients receive magnesium\n           citrate and Papaya Plus with the pancreatic enzymes. Additionally, patients receive\n           nutritional supplementation with vitamins, minerals, trace elements, and animal\n           glandular products 4 times per day on days 1-16, followed by 5 days of rest. Courses\n           repeat every 21 days until death despite relapse. Patients consume a moderate\n           vegetarian metabolizer diet during the course of therapy, which excludes red meat,\n           poultry, and white sugar.

Patients also undergo a complete liver\n           flush and a clean sweep and purge on a rotating basis each month during the 5 days of\n           rest.\n\n        -  Arm II (Chemotherapy Arm): Patients receive gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. Quality of\n           life is assessed at 0, 2, 6, and 12 months and then yearly thereafter.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1, 3, 7, and 12 months and then yearly thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 72-90 patients will be accrued for this study within 3\n      years."
