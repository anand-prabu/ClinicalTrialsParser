All patients had moderate-to-severe (3+) or severe (4+) MR based on transthoracic\n      echocardiography (TTE). To be considered eligible for inclusion in the CC group, the patient\n      had to be classified as high surgical risk using the same criteria used for the HRR. Upon\n      follow-up with the clinical sites, it was determined that some of the initially identified\n      patients with moderate-to-severe (3+) or severe (4+) MR met the criteria for high surgical\n      risk. Of these patients, some were not included due to; lack of Institutional Review Board\n      (IRB) approval at the site, lack of informed consent and unable to be contacted. The\n      remaining patients make up the CC group."
