  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) has been largely demonstrated to be
      effective in multiple bilio-pancreatic indications. However, one of the feared complication
      of this technique is acute pancreatitis, which happens in 5 to 25% of cases. Some patient
      groups have been demonstrated to present a higher risk linked to individual factors or to
      the procedure. Some interventions (endoscopic or pharmacologic) have been evaluated to
      reduce the incidence of this complication but each has his own inconvenient. Recently, the
      activation of heme oxygenase (HO) by intraperitoneal administration of hemin has been
      demonstrated to be effective in prevention and treatment of acute pancreatitis mice models.
      This protective effect has been associated to intrapancreatic HO-1 positive macrophage
      recruitment activated by hemin. The investigators thus propose to conduct a prospective
      randomized double blind controlled trial to demonstrate a protective effect of hemin
      administration against post-ERCP acute pancreatitis in high risk patients.

      Patients for who a pancreatic stent placement is indicated will be excluded from the study.

      The aims of this study are: 1) to study in a pathophysiologic point of view the activation
      of HO-1 by hemin in human and its protective effect in post-ERCP acute pancreatitis
      incidence. 2) to use the human situation of post-ERCP acute pancreatitis as early
      pancreatitis model to study the administration of hemin as treatment of acute pancreatitis
      in general.
