  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is designed to test the hypothesis that high loading dose(360mg) ticagrelor versus
      conventional loading dose(180mg) will result in a higher inhibition of platelet
      aggregation(IPA) without increasing the bleeding events.

    <textblock>
      After providing written informed consent, all patients will be randomized to receive
      ticagrelor 360mg or 180mg loading dose(LD),then 90mg bid maintenance dose starting 12 hours
      after LD.PCI will performed in 2h-72h after they are given the loading dose.All patients
      should receive acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 75 to 100 mg daily unless intolerant.IPA at 0,
      0.5, 1, 2, 8, 24h after the loading dose of ticagrelor will be measured. CK-MB, troponin I,
      myoglobin, CRP will be detected at 0h, before PCI, 8h after PCI, 24h after PCI. ECG will be
      conducted at 0h and within 24h after PCI. Patients returned 28 days for follow-up visits
      after the loading dose of ticagrelor, documented any adverse events.
