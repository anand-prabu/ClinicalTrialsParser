            "textblock": "Alopecia areata (AA) is a common disease of the immune system, known as an \"autoimmune\"\n      disease. In the disease, the immune system mistakenly destroys the hair follicle, causing\n      hair to fall out. Despite many people having this disease, research into its cause and into\n      new, better ways to treat AA has lagged far behind other similar diseases of the immune\n      system. Currently, there are no Federal Drug Administration approved drugs for AA.\n\n      Ruxolitinib (made by Incyte) is an intervention known to effectively treat a disease of the\n      bone marrow, known as myelofibrosis. It is also being studied in the treatment of rheumatoid\n      arthritis, another \"autoimmune\" disease, by fighting inflammation. There are some genetic\n      and chemical similarities between those with myelofibrosis, active rheumatoid arthritis and\n      AA, suggesting that treatment with ruxolitinib may be effective in AA. In mice specially\n      designed for testing drugs for the treatment of human alopecia areata, this medication\n      worked to prevent the disease AA from starting in mice that would have otherwise developed\n      the disease. To test Ruxolitinib, we are going to treat 10 patients with moderate to severe\n      AA for 3 months. This is an \"open-label\" study, meaning that there will not be a placebo\n      group; all patients enrolled in the study will receive the active medication. The\n      effectiveness of the medication will be measured by changes in hair re-growth as determined\n      by physical exam and photography, as well as by patient and physician scoring. Patients will\n      be followed for another 3 months off of the drug to see if the effects of treatment last and\n      if there is delayed response. The safety of the medication, ruxolitinib, in patients with\n      alopecia areata will also be evaluated.\n\n      Blood work will be collected before medication is started, during the treatment period, and\n      after ruxolitinib is stopped, in order to monitor for adverse effects of the medication.\n      Small scalp biopsies and peripheral blood will be taken at the beginning of the study before\n      treatment and also after 12 and possibly 24 weeks. The chemical analysis of these skin\n      samples and blood will help us to understand how the disease happens, how the treatment\n      works, and may even guide us to better treatments in the future."

            "textblock": "Alopecia areata (AA) is a common autoimmune disease resulting from immune destruction of the\n      hair follicle and subsequent hair loss. Despite its high prevalence, research into the\n      pathogenesis and the development of innovative therapies in AA has lagged far behind other\n      autoimmune diseases. Currently, there are no FDA approved drugs for AA. Ruxolitinib (Incyte)\n      is an intervention known to effectively treat myelofibrosis and also rheumatoid arthritis by\n      modulating the inflammatory response of the interferon response pathway by inhibition of\n      Jak1/Jak2. Rheumatoid arthritis shares several susceptibility genes in common with AA. All\n      three diseases share the central role of the interferon-gamma response pathway, which is the\n      rationale for selecting Ruxolitinib for evaluation in this clinical trial. Both systemic and\n      topical Ruxolitinib have been shown to prevent the onset of AA in the C3H-HeJ animal model\n      of AA, demonstrating preclinical proof-of-concept data in AA. To test the safety and\n      efficacy of Ruxolitinib in patients with moderate to severe AA, we propose this open-label,\n      single arm pilot study with a total of 10 patients, treated for 3 months. Efficacy will be\n      measured by changes in hair re-growth as determined by physical exam and photography, as\n      well as by patient and physician global evaluation scores. Patients will be followed for\n      another 3 months to evaluate durability of response following the treatment phase. Punch\n      biopsies and peripheral blood will be obtained at baseline prior to treatment and then after\n      12 and possibly 24 weeks for immune monitoring and for molecular studies."
