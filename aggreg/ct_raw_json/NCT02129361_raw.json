It is hypothesized that an adapted Screening, Education\n      and Brief Intervention (adapted SBI) will reduce the number of alcoholic drinks consumed per\n      week over the year following discharge from inpatient rehabilitation, in comparison to a\n      Screening and Education Attention Control condition (SEA control)."
