Prior work in\n      the Partners in Care study has shown that evidence-based service delivery programs for\n      depression can improve health outcomes in depressed patients, and especially in minorities,\n      largely overcoming disparities in outcomes from care between whites and minorities.\n      Effective treatments exist, but they do not reach many depressed individuals, especially in\n      resource-poor communities--ethnic minorities, rural residents in the United States, and\n      individuals in most of the developing world.\n\n      Women, in particular, are at risk for depression and poverty. Integrating programs that\n      treat depression and address livelihood concerns may improve engagement in depression\n      treatment and improve mental health and functioning for patients in low-resource settings.\n      The proposed study would integrate depression care with existing \"microfinance\" programs,\n      which provide poverty-alleviation services including small loans, savings programs, and\n      vocational training to women.\n\n      This project will (1) conduct qualitative studies of barriers and facilitators of women's\n      successful use of existing depression care and microfinance programs; (2) adapt and\n      integrate the depression care and microfinance services; (3) train Women's Union\n      facilitators to deliver the integrated depression care and microfinance program; and conduct\n      evaluation of LIFE-DM program to assess acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary\n      effectiveness. The non-randomized control trial compares the integrated microfinance and\n      collaborative care intervention with enhanced treatment as usual (national guideline\n      antidepressant care and referral to microfinance resources) at the Women's Union in Danang\n      city in Vietnam."
