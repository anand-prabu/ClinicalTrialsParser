The cause of CPPS is unknown and there is a lack of convenient biomarkers for diagnosis\n      of this syndrome. This project will examine the expression of biomarkers in expressed\n      prostatic fluid from adult men with and without a diagnosis of CPPS. Thus our specific aim\n      is to validate the use of the chemokines MCP-1 and MIP-1alpha and mast cell tryptase as\n      biomarkers for CPPS in humans and correlate their levels with CPPS symptoms."
