  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During their lifetime, approximately 50% of Canadian women and 30% of Canadian men will
      experience at least one fracture due to bone fragility (FF). Evidence is growing regarding
      prevention programs' effectiveness to prevent falls, but prevention of fractures through
      fall prevention programs has enjoyed limited success. Falls prevention programs and
      post-fracture screening programs leading to pharmacological treatment are very different
      strategies, with a shared ultimate goal. Coordination between those who repair fractures and
      those who manage the patient to prevent the next fracture is critical. The overarching aim
      of this proposal is to generate evidence-based knowledge about the effectiveness and
      cost-effectiveness of an integrated FF prevention program, as well as a portrait of the
      barriers and facilitating factors for such programs. More specifically, the objectives are:
      1) to combine existing fall prevention and post-fracture management programs in the province
      of Quebec into integrated FF prevention programs; 2) to compare the performance of these
      integrated programs to control sites, using a pragmatic study design; 3) to identify
      barriers as well as factors that improve effectiveness across different implementation
      milieu; and 4) to develop and engage in active knowledge transfer activities in Quebec
      regions where integrated FF prevention programs are neither adequately nor successfully
      implemented. Drawing upon the literature on integrated healthcare, fall and fracture
      prevention, we hypothesize that an integrated FF program can reduce the risk of a subsequent
      fracture by at least 30% in the population of interest. The proposed team is poised to
      develop new interdisciplinary collaborations among healthcare practitioners and decision
      makers involved in the prevention of FFs. The program is built upon existing healthcare and
      structures and programs and in turn, will truly measure the effectiveness of an integrated
      FF prevention program. The results will ultimately lead to improvements in the existing
      knowledge base, address policy-relevant and health systems problems, and assist in the
      design and implementation of FFs prevention programs.
