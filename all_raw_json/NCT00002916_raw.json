Patients who\n      require radiotherapy following surgery receive their second vaccination 4-8 weeks after the\n      first vaccination.\n\n      Twenty-eight patients are entered initially; if at least 2 patients show an immunologic\n      response, 16 additional patients are entered.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years, then\n      annually.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 44 patients will be entered over 1 year."
