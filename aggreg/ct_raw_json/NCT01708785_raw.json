Through a series of experimental studies, the investigators will evaluate how many\n      weekly treatment visits there should be, whether children should be exposed to a single food\n      or multiple foods during treatment, whether to use partial reinforcement or not, whether\n      visits should be daily or weekly, and whether the exposures should be in single or multiple\n      contexts. The investigators will be recruiting parent-child dyads in the San Diego community\n      to participate in 8 to 16 weekly or daily treatment sessions either in their home, community\n      center, or our lab, depending on the treatment arm.  Parents and children will complete\n      baseline and post-treatment assessments consisting of collecting psychophysiological data,\n      completing laboratory tasks, and completing questionnaires.  The investigators will be\n      evaluating which treatment condition reduces overeating (as measured by our laboratory\n      tasks).\n\n      Following these experimental studies, the investigators will use the most promising\n      treatment and conduct a proof of concept study to look at the acceptability and feasibility\n      of this intervention with existing behavioral weight loss treatments."
