Male subjects agree to use appropriate contraception (i.e., double barrier\n             contraception such as a latex condom with spermicide with a female partner of\n             child-bearing potential (a non-menopausal female who has not had one of the\n             following: a) a hysterectomy (with or without oophorectomy), b) a bilateral\n             oophorectomy without hysterectomy, or c) a medically documented ovarian failure)\n             using a diaphragm or cervical cap or single barrier contraception if the female\n             partner is using an intrauterine device or hormonal contraceptives or is sterilized;\n             no barrier is required if the female partner has had a hysterectomy) when engaging in\n             sexual activity during the course of the study.
