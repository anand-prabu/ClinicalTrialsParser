      This is an open-label, randomized, multi-center, parallel-arm study to assess the safety and
      tolerability of a daily dose of Glatiramer Acetate (GA) 40 mg/mL three times a week (TIW)
      administered subcutaneously (SC) as compared to GA 20 mg/mL every day (QD) administered SC.

      The study will comprise of a Core study and an Extension phase. During the Core study,
      subjects will be evaluated at study sites for 5 scheduled visits at Months: -1 (Screening),
      0 (Baseline), 1, 2, and 4 (Termination/Early Termination). Subjects who complete all
      scheduled visits will have final procedures and assessments performed at the final visit
      (Month 4, Termination visit). Subjects who withdraw from the study before completing the 4
      months evaluation period will have Early Termination (ET) procedures and assessments
      performed at their final visit.

      During the Extension phase, all subjects will be offered to continue treatment with GA 40
      mg/mL TIW. Subjects will be evaluated every 4 months until this dose strength is
      commercially available for the treatment of Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS)
      patients or until the development of this GA dose regimen is stopped by the Sponsor, the
      last visit of this phase will be called Termination/ET-Extension visit.
