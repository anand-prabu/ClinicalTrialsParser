    <textblock>
      This study will determine if operating room teams manage a simulated event more effectively
      using a critical event checklist. Performance will be evaluated using a score based on how
      closely they follow a protocol for critical event management; a 'team' score and a score
      based on clinical recovery of the simulated patient. All teams will receive a debriefing
      session after managing 4 scenarios. Teams will return and manage 4 further scenarios after a
      period of 6-9 months.

      The investigators will be testing the hypothesis that both clinical and behavioral team
      performance will improve with the use of Critical Event Checklists. The investigators also
      expect that health professional (participant) could attain knowledge related to the
      importance of non-technical skills and the use of CECs in the management of critical events.
