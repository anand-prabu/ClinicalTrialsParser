Workplace walking programs have had mixed success and\n      typically show most improvement among participants that are already fairly active at a\n      baseline. The goal of this study is to determine whether a financial incentive program can\n      motivate sedentary employees to increase the number of steps they walk per day to meet a\n      minimum threshold.\n\n      The primary outcome measure is the proportion of days a minimum activity of 7000 steps or\n      more is achieved.  Outcomes will be assessed each week for 3 months using incentives\n      followed by 3 months of follow-up without incentives.  Secondary outcomes will include the\n      average steps walked per day."
