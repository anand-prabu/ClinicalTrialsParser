The rotator cuff is repaired by\n      sewing the tendon down to the bone in the shoulder. Trephination is a new technique that is\n      used in addition to the standard method of repairing the rotator cuff tendon. The control\n      group will undergo the standard repair for rotator cuff tears.\n\n      It is the investigators' hypothesis that healing rates in patients who undergo bone\n      trephination will be higher compared with surgery without trephination in arthroscopic\n      rotator cuff repair at 24 months post-operatively."

Partial thickness cuff tears.\n\n          3. Significant shoulder comorbidities e.g. Bankart lesion, osteoarthritis\n\n          4. Previous surgery on affected shoulder e.g. Previous rotator cuff repair.\n\n          5. Isolated subscapularis tendon tears\n\n          6. Active joint or systemic infection\n\n          7. Significant muscle paralysis\n\n          8. Rotator cuff tear arthropathy\n\n          9. Charcot's arthropathy\n\n         10. Significant medical comorbidity that could alter the effectiveness of the surgical\n             intervention (eg. Cervical radiculopathy, polymyalgia rheumatica)\n\n         11. Major medical illness (life expectancy less then 1 year or unacceptably high\n             operative risk)\n\n         12. Unable to speak or read English/French\n\n         13. Psychiatric illness that precludes informed consent\n\n         14. Unwilling to be followed for 24 months\n\n         15. Advanced physiologic age"
