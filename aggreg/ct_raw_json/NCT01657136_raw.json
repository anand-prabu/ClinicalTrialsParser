Conventional treatment of IST, targeted to\n      symptoms control, mainly consists on \u03b2-blockers. However, these drugs are often insufficient\n      or not well tolerated because of side effects (mostly hypotension) that usually limit the\n      administered dose. Ivabradine, a sinus rate lowering agent currently employed in Europe in\n      the treatment of stable angina and chronic heart failure, has recently been demonstrated to\n      be effective and safe in the treatment of IST by a few case reports and clinical trials. A\n      randomized clinical trial comparing ivabradine to \u03b2-blockers has not be performed yet."
