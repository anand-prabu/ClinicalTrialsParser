In this\n      form of therapy, the use of certain manual play activities are highlighted as a working\n      tool, with the aim of intervening in relation to the limitations and/or physical and\n      psychological diseases. Such interventions may transform some of these patients' interests\n      in life, facilitate the development of undiscovered talents and skills and allow them to\n      discover their artistic, artisanal or physical potentials.\n\n      The role and interventions of occupational therapy within palliative care are wide-ranging\n      and challenging, with a vocation to help individuals to value the remainder of their lives\n      and live for the present moment in the best way possible, through providing options for them\n      to keep themselves in a physical and emotional condition that allows them to carry out\n      activities that would be gratifying and stimulating. The effects from this will assist them\n      in preparing for the end of life with more dignity and respect.\n\n      The relevance of occupational therapy interventions in relation to oncology and, in\n      particular, palliative care has been little studied. However, it is known that this may\n      contribute towards improving the quality of life in interpersonal relationships and\n      diminishing pain and distress, through providing guidance regarding activities of daily\n      living and through the use of therapeutic activities, especially in relation to\n      hospitalization processes."
