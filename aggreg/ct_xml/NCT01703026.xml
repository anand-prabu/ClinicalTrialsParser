  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contrast enhanced EUS with the sonographic contrast agent DEFINITY™ has the potential to
      detect pancreatic cancer at an earlier stage, to improve current method of T staging and
      assessment of surgical resectability and also to distinguish between benign and malignant
      pancreatic masses. All these will translate into better clinical outcome, and also avoid
      unnecessary surgery in situations of unresectable cancers.

        A total of 50 subjects will be enrolled. The study population will be drawn from patients
        referred for EUS evaluation on basis of suspected pancreatic cancer. These patients could
        be either from clinics or from the hospital wards.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Consecutive patients over a 1-year period referred for EUS examination due to
             suspected pancreatic lesions will be enrolled.

          -  Age 21 years and above.

          -  Ability to provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with clinical conditions that preclude the use of DEFINITY™ will be excluded.
        These conditions are:

          -  Right-to-left, bi-directional, or transient right-to-left cardiac shunts;

          -  Worsening or clinically unstable congestive heart failure;

          -  Acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndromes;

          -  Serious ventricular arrhythmias or high risk for arrhythmias due to prolongation of
             the QT interval;

          -  Respiratory failure;

          -  Severe emphysema, pulmonary emboli or other conditions that cause pulmonary
             hypertension due to compromised pulmonary arterial vasculature;

          -  Hypersensitivity to DEFINITY™ or its components.
