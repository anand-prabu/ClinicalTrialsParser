  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will test a hypothesis that the AccuCath™ System will have a higher rate of
      successful first attempt peripheral IV placement, higher completion of therapy, fewer
      complications, longer dwell times and higher user satisfaction compared to Conventional IV
      Catheters.

      This study is designed to evaluate user/physician preference as it relates to use of a
      510(k) cleared vascular access and catheter device compared with conventional
      needle/catheter vascular access devices, in terms of first stick success rates, dwell time,
      device related vascular complications and adverse events and overall user and patient
      satisfaction.  As noted above, the study is designed to formally test the hypothesis that
      the AccuCath™ System will exhibit superiority in terms of the rate of successful first
      attempt peripheral IV placement, higher completion of therapy, fewer complications, longer
      dwell times and higher user satisfaction compared to Conventional IV Catheters.
