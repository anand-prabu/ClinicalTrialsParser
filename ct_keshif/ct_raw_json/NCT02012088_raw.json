            "textblock": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common histological subtype of\n      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). This is an aggressive lymphoma, with an incidence in Western\n      countries estimated at 5-6 cases/100,000 inhabitants/year that increases with age.\n\n      Treatment for patients with DLBCL is currently based on immunochemotherapy, of which the\n      R-CHOP regimen, which includes cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone\n      (CHOP) in combination with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab and is administered\n      every 21 days for a total of 6-8 cycles, is the most commonly used.\n\n      Cardiotoxicity is one of the undesirable effects that limit the use of anthracyclines, such\n      as doxorubicin, as part of the CHOP regimen, which is caused by the formation of complexes\n      between ferric ions and the anthracycline within the myocyte. Because of their oxidative\n      properties, these complexes are toxic and produce highly reactive free radicals that damage\n      the lipid membrane and lead to the cell death of myocytes. Several studies have linked the\n      onset of cardiotoxicity with old age, high cumulative doses of doxorubicin, cardiovascular\n      risk factors and previous heart disease, among others. Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity\n      is cumulative and irreversible. Moreover, left ventricular dysfunction is an important late\n      effect in patients with aggressive NHL who survive long term and, according to some studies,\n      have received doxorubicin at doses higher than 200 mg/m\u00b2. Cardiotoxicity may be silent or\n      subclinical, which is usually detected as a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction\n      (LVEF), or clinical, with varying degrees of congestive heart failure (CHF). Depending on\n      the symptoms, cardiotoxicity also differs between acute, subacute, late or chronic. The\n      first is manifested at an early stage, usually as arrhythmia, transient ECG changes or\n      pericarditis, among others, is usually reversible, is not detrimental to the continuation of\n      treatment and is not associated with subacute and late toxicity.\n\n      Chronic cardiotoxicity could be early or late. Early-onset cardiotoxicity occurs within 1\n      year after anthracycline treatment and late-onset cardiotoxicity occurs more than 1 year\n      after completion of anthracycline treatment. In the latter two, cardiotoxicity is associated\n      with the lesion of cardiomyocytes and is therefore considered irreversible. The incidence of\n      cardiotoxicity varies among different studies, depending on patient follow-up or the\n      definition of cardiotoxicity used (acute, subacute or late).\n\n      In addition to clinical findings, the determination of LVEF or, more recently, the use of\n      biomarkers, are the most commonly used methods to diagnose and assess cardiotoxicity.\n      Regarding the identification of biomarkers, troponin I and N-terminal fragment of pro-brain\n      natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) are the most commonly used and investigated in the context\n      of clinical studies. The advantages of using biomarkers include their minimally invasive\n      identification, which is less expensive than echocardiography, and, unlike radionuclide\n      ventriculography, they avoid irradiation of the patient. Furthermore, the interpretation of\n      their results does not depend on the observer's experience, thus avoiding interobserver\n      variability. Several studies have shown the role of troponins as indicators of early\n      anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity or other chemotherapeutic agents, which are able to\n      predict impaired ventricular function and higher incidence of cardiac events in patients\n      with elevated values of this marker compared with patients with normal troponin values.\n      Regarding the use of brain natriuretic peptides such as NT-proBNP, several studies have\n      shown a correlation between persistently high values of this biomarker and impaired heart\n      function parameters, in particular LVEF.\n\n      Myocet\u00ae (non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) is one of the several strategies developed to\n      reduce cardiotoxicity and maintain the therapeutic efficacy of the R-CHOP regimen.\n      Non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin has shown a similar efficacy and less cardiotoxicity\n      than conventional doxorubicin in the treatment of women with metastatic breast cancer. In\n      addition, several studies in patients with NHL have shown similar response rates with\n      regimens containing non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin to those obtained in historical\n      controls with conventional doxorubicin, with a low incidence of clinical and subclinical\n      cardiovascular events. The treatment is relatively well tolerated, while myelosuppression is\n      its most important toxicity.\n\n      Most of these phase I and II studies (with or without rituximab), which assessed Myocet\u00ae in\n      combination with cyclophosphamide; vincristine and prednisone, showed that it is an active\n      treatment in newly diagnosed patients with aggressive NHL.\n\n      100% of the data registered on CRFs will be source data verified. eCRDs will be used in\n      order to register the data. Nine monitoring visits per site will be performed.\n\n      First monitoring vistit will be performed when the first patient is included Second\n      monitoring visit willb be performed when the third patient is included Third monitoring\n      visit will be perforemd when the fifth patient is included Fourth monitoring visit will be\n      performed then the last patient finish study treatment One monitoring visit per year will be\n      performed during follow-up phase.\n\n      CRO (Dynamic) Standard Operating Procedures will be used to manage the clinical trial.\n\n      Sample size of the study is based on the hypothesis of a LEVF decrease <55% in the 15% of\n      patients assigned to R-CHOP treatment group and 5% of patients assigned to R-COMP treatment\n      group.\n\n      Categorical variables were show by  absolute and relative frequencies, including the\n      confidence interval of 95%.\n\n      For the description of the continuous variables will be use the mean, standard deviation,\n      median, mode, minimum and maximum, including the total number of valid values.\n\n      In the case of compare subgroups of patients, will be use for quantitative variables\n      parametric tests or nonparametric  as characteristics of the variables under study. For\n      qualitative variables will be use Chi-square test.\n\n      Statistical analysis was planned with the SAS statistical package version 9.1 or later.\n\n      Two interim analysis will be performed when the last patient peforms the end of treatment\n      visit and when the last patient performd the 24 months follow-up visit.\n\n      Final analysis will be performed at the end of the study."
