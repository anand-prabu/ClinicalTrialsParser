Among institutions involved in\n      this case study, the latest devices are readily available and fully support standard\n      treatment paradigms.\n\n      However, several cases, recently completed, using only large bore catheter and aspiration\n      have anecdotally demonstrated a superior ability to remove clot from vessels, restoring\n      blood flow to the affected vessel and brain tissue. In these limited number of cases, full\n      restoration of blood flow has been achieved. While this combination of approved devices is\n      minimalistic, the efficiency of the procedure, rapid technical success, and relative\n      simplicity of the approach is unique and should be thoroughly reviewed and possibly prepared\n      for publication."
