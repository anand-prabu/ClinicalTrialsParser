These Cancer Registries (CR) were established to unite participating\n      centers with expertise in cancer epidemiology, genetics, biology, early detection and\n      patient care to facilitate the rapid and uniform collection of critical information and\n      biological samples to be used in developing prevention, detection and treatment strategies\n      against cancer. Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center also adopted the caTISSUE Suite\n      (https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/tools/catissuesuite), a biorepository tool that has been\n      developed under the NCI's cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG\u00ae) umbrella. The Cancer\n      Registry (CR) database is coupled with the biospecimen annotation database (caTISSUE) to\n      manage activities associated with the biospecimen inventorying, tracking, and basic\n      annotation. It provides quality assurance for all these activities and permits the users to\n      track the collection, storage and distribution (derivation and aliquot) of specimens. This\n      consolidated tissue bank will continue to collect and store comprehensive data on cancer\n      patients, survivors and high-risk individuals. The tissue bank couples with the caTissue\n      Suite for annotation and management of the biospecimen data to be collected. Consolidating\n      all the registries into one tissue bank will foster and improve the efficiency of\n      cancer-related research and facilitates collaborations among centers. The Sub-PI from each\n      registry will remain the sole contact and will maintain responsibility of the conduct of\n      each registry. PCCR - Dr. Aaron Sasson, TCCR - Dr.Whitney Goldner, GUCaRe - Dr.Jue Wang and\n      TOCR - Dr.Karin Trujillo respectively."
