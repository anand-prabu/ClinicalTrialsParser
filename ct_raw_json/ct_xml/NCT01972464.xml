  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking is the main preventable cause of mortality in Western countries, contributing to
      over 430,000 deaths a year in the U.S. alone.  Clinical and epidemiological studies show
      that women often decrease smoking in pregnancy, when progesterone levels are high.  However,
      at least half resume pre-pregnancy smoking levels within weeks after delivery and when
      progesterone levels drop.

      Data from preclinical and clinical studies suggest that progesterone may be effective in
      preventing relapse to smoking in non-postpartum women. Prior work has shown that
      progesterone decreases both craving for cigarettes and the subjective rewarding effects of
      smoking among recently abstinent female smokers.  These findings led us to hypothesize that
      progesterone may have efficacy as a relapse prevention treatment for postpartum women.

      We propose an 8-week, randomized pilot study to evaluate the safety and initial efficacy of
      progesterone.  This will be a feasibility study that will compare progesterone to placebo
      for relapse prevention in 40 postpartum smokers.  We will assess the feasibility and safety,
      including the potential effects on breastfeeding and infants exposed via breast milk, in
      addition to 7-day point prevalence of smoking abstinence after 8 weeks of treatment and at
      follow-up, 3-months after the end of the protocol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Need to be within 3 weeks of delivery because relapse to smoking happens early after
             childbirth

          -  Aged 18 to 42 years

          -  History of smoking abstinence in the final two months of pregnancy and at delivery

          -  In good health as verified by medical history

          -  Using acceptable birth control methods other than hormonal contraceptives that
             contain progestins

          -  Have biologically confirmed abstinence from tobacco and other nicotine products at
             randomization

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A history of major medical illnesses including liver diseases, suspected or known
             malignancy, thrombophlebitis, liver failure, or other medical conditions that the
             physician investigator deems will make study participation unsafe for the subject

          -  Current or past history bipolar disorder or schizophrenia or current diagnosis of
             major depression, panic disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder - Dependence on
             and/or abuse of alcohol or other drugs of abuse in the month prior to randomization
             into the trial

          -  The presence of suicidal or homicidal ideation, or need for emergency psychiatric
             treatment

          -  Inability to understand study procedures or provide informed consent

          -  Currently undergoing treatment with another pharmacological agent for smoking
             cessation

          -  Pending case with child protective services that might lead removal of infant from
             mother's custody, as this would impede breastfeeding and infant follow-up

          -  Unwilling to accept randomization

          -  Subsequent pregnancy since that would be another source of progesterone

          -  An acute general medical condition that would require imminent re-hospitalization
             since this would enforce abstinence (women may be randomized if they are discharged
             and still within the recruitment window)

          -  Allergy to progesterone or peanuts (vehicle for micronized progesterone)
