To improve care of the frail elderly,  wards with a coordinated\n      multidisciplinary team and multidisciplinary mobile teams were established several years\n      ago. Treatment and follow up is planned in accordance to the patients' medical,\n      psychological and functional capabilities (Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment = CGA). There\n      are to our knowledge only few studies concerning CGA applicable to Swedish conditions. We\n      plan to conduct a Swedish study that evaluates if care and treatment with a modified\n      CGA-model in an outpatient setting can improve quality of life for frail older people."
