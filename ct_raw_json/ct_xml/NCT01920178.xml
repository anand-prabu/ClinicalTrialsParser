  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of the PinPointe
      Foot Laser device for the treatment of patients with onychomycosis who have been previously
      treated with oral Terbinafine and failed.

    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to demonstrate that the PinPointe FootLaser treatment is able to
      produce clinical improvement treating onychomycosis in patients who have previously taken
      Terbinafine and failed treatment.  The duration of enrollment for each subject will be 2
      years, with the expectation that this is the time period that will yield 100% reduction in
      the area of involved nail.  Enrollment is competitive and we expect to enroll 40 patients at
      CHA.

      The medical device that is the subject of this clinical trial is the PinPointe FootLaser,
      manufactured by NuvoLase, Inc. It is a pulsed Nd:Yag laser device that uses a proprietary
      pulse train, operating at 1064nm wavelength, with 100 μsec pulses. It received pre-market
      Section 510(k) clearance by the FDA and subsequent clearance for the treatment of
      onychomycosis in 2010.

      Onychomycosis (OM), a fungal infection of the toes, is a major health problem around the
      world. It is estimated that there are more than 40 million sufferers with this condition in
      the USA. A recent European study showed that the prevalence of onychomycosis may be as high
      as 26.9%.  Importantly, it is a particular problem that disproportionately affects
      diabetics. The main causative agent varies according to climate.  Dermatophyte infections
      are common worldwide.

      Preliminary in vitro and in vivo work has demonstrated the proof of principle that the
      PinPointe FootLaser device can kill microorganisms, including dermatophytes and other fungi,
      which infect the toenail.  Based on these preliminary results, this study has been designed
      to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the PinPointe FootLaser for clearing toenails,
      including those with onychomycosis.
