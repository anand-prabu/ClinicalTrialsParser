Stimulation is to be applied every 20 seconds over a period of 5 minutes.\nIntermittent pneumatic compression is to be applied using the Novamedix A-V Impulse System Model 6000 (Novamedix distribution Limited, England), programmed to deliver compression every 20 seconds at a pressure of 130 mmHg for a 1 second duration over a period of 5 minutes."

Three mechanisms underlie DVT, venous stasis (slowing or stopping of the blood),\n      hypercoagulability (increased clotting) and damage to blood vessel endothelium (damage to\n      blood vessel wall), collectively known as Virchow's triad.\n\n      Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)\n      have been shown to improve lower limb blood flow. However, few studies have directly\n      compared the two methods and those that have, have used dated NMES techniques.\n\n      The objective of this study is to compare the two methods in terms of blood flow."
