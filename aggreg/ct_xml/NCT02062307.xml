    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the markers of bone mineral metabolism in an
      unconfounded group of patients with hypogonadism and to search for a relationship between
      endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance.

      Cardiometabolic disorders are prevalent in patients with hypogonadism. Endothelial
      dysfunction and insulin resistance are used in determining cardiovascular risk. The role of
      markers of bone mineral metabolism in hypogonadism is not clearly presented.

      49 male patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) and 43 BMI and age matched healthy
      male subjects were enrolled. Osteoprotegerin (OPG), fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23),
      vitamin D and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels were measured. The insulin
      sensitivity was estimated by homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)
      formula.

        The study group was selected from the male subjects with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism who
        were not previously given testosterone or human chorionic gonadotropin therapy. The
        patients did not have any chronic metabolic disorders or organ dysfunction. Forty three
        age and BMI matched male volunteers were enrolled as control subjects.
