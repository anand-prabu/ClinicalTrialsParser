Secondary\n      objective is to measure the impact of the three drugs on secondary outcomes:  time to\n      termination of clinical seizures, intubation or admission to ICU within 24 hrs. of\n      enrollment, and mortality. Final objective is to determine the effectiveness, rate of\n      adverse reactions of these drugs in children with established status epilepticus.\n\n      The primary hypothesis is that the most effective ( or least effective) treatment can be\n      identified."

The seizure and its initial treatment may have occurred prior\n             to arrival in the ED.\n\n        4.1.2 Adequate doses of benzodiazepines for this study are determined to be: diazepam 10\n        mg IV, lorazepam 4 mg IV or midazolam 10mg IV or IM for those above 40 Kg. For children\n        between 10-40 Kg adequate doses are: diazepam 0.3 mg/kg IV, lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV and\n        midazolam 0.3 mg/kg IV or IM.  These drugs may have been administered in two or more\n        divided doses. A benzodiazepine given at home(such as rectal diazepam, buccal midazolam)\n        will be included in defining \"adequate doses\" but it is recommended that another round of\n        benzodiazepine be administered to the patient to qualify for the study unless this\n        administration is considered unsafe. Although these doses are considered minimum adequate\n        dose based on common clinical practice, it is recommended that the best practice is to\n        administer 20 mg of diazepam or 8 mg lorazepam or 20 mg of midazolam in adults.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Table 2 Criterion Measure  Rationale\n\n             1) Known pregnancy  based 2)Prisoner Look for prison guards 3) Treatment with\n             propofol, etomidate, ketamine or another sedative with anticonvulsant properties\n             (except benzodiazepines) after initial seizure 4) Intubation 5) Acute post traumatic\n             seizures . 6) Known Metabolic disorder 7Liver Disease 8) Contraindication to\n             phenytoin, leveitieracetam or valproic acid, Includes allergy to any study drug and\n             sustained  hypotension.\n\n             9) Hypoglycemia < 50 mg/dL 10) Hyperglycemia > 400  mg/dL 11) Cardiac arrest and\n             post-anoxic seizures"
