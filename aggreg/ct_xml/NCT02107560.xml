  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cholangitis is a complication of biliary statsis. Bile juice is sterile when there is no
      obstruction, however, it can be infected with bacteria when there is a stasis or
      obstruction. After infection, cholangitis can be developed because of systematic endotoxemia
      or bacteremia. Though identification of bacteria is very important for selection of adequate
      antibiotics, treatment with empirical antibiotics is commonly performed when identification
      of bacteria is not possible.

      Identification of bacteria is usually done with blood or bile culture. In the previous
      studies, the same results from blood and bile were common in patients with cholangitis.
      However, the data of these studies were based on the bile juice which was aspirated by
      surgery. Considering that bile duct obstruction is usually treated with endoscopy or
      radiological intervention without surgery, it is necessary to collect data with endoscopic
      or radiologic intervention. In addition, the concordant rate of these two tests has not been
      reported according to severity of cholangitis. As a result, the necessities of bile and
      blood culture are not agreed among experts in this fields.

      Our hypothesis is that concordant rates of bile and blood culture are same in patients with
      each moderate or severe cholangitis. However, the concordant rates of bile and blood culture
      are different between patients with moderate and severe cholangitis. This study will assess
      the positive rates of blood and bile culture in patients with moderate or severe
      cholangitis, respectively and compare the results according to the different severity.
