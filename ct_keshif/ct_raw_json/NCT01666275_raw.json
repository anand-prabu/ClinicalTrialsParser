            "textblock": "Metabolomics is the study of metabolic pathways and the unique biochemical molecules which\n      result from the regulatory response to physiological stressors, disease processes, or drug\n      therapy. By measuring changes in metabolite concentrations, the range of biochemical effects\n      and therapeutic intervention can be determined.\n\n      Aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a chronic inflammatory disease\n      characterized by chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal polyposis, asthma, and airway reactivity to\n      aspirin and/or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This reaction to aspirin\n      during challenge/desensitization is equivalent to an allergic drug reaction however we are\n      able to evaluate these specific reactions in a controlled, clinical environment. This\n      population of patients undergoing aspirin desensitization is ideal for studying metabolomics\n      as serial blood sampling can be performed in patients before, during a reaction, and after\n      aspirin desensitization, thereby allowing each patient to serve as his or her own biological\n      control. The investigator hopes that this study of metabolomics will allow for better\n      methods of identifying anaphylaxis in the future."
