      This is a non interventional study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chlorambucil plus
      Rituximab as firstline therapy in elderly and/or unfit patients affected by B-cell Chronic
      Lymphocytic Leukemia (B-CLL).

    <textblock>
      Illness: treatment overview Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is the most prevalent adult
      leukemia among western countries (6.7% Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas- NHL).  The incidence rate is
      2-6 cases per 100.000 person per year increasing with age and reaching an incidence rate of
      about 13/100.000 at 65 years, median age of onset of the disease. There are two clinical
      staging systems currently in use for CLL (Rai and Binet staging systems) allowing a rough
      division of patients into three prognostic groups: good, intermediate and poor prognosis.
      The clinical course ranges from an indolent behaviour (Rai 0, Binet A) with a long term
      survival to an aggressive disease with a median survival of 2 years (Rai III and IV, Binet
      C).  There is non survival benefit associated with an early therapy (Binet stage A and B).
      Treatment usually is initiated when patient progress to the advanced stage (Binet stage C)
      and/or become symptomatic (fever, night sweats, weight loss). Purine-analogues based
      chemo-immunotherapy regimens are now considered the standard of care for fit patient with
      B-CLL (Fludarabine-Cyclophosphamyde-Rituximab, FCR regimen). But aging of the host and
      biological features of the disease are critical issues in the choice of therapy. The FCR
      regimen can result in significant myelosuppression and a high rate of early and late
      infections, especially in elderly patients with B-CLL, suggesting that it may be too toxic
      and therefore unsuitable for the large subpopulation of elderly and comorbid patients
      affected by B-CLL/SLL.

      Rationale Chlorambucil, an alkylating agent, was the standard first line treatment for
      B-CLL/SLL before the development of the purine analogues and monoclonal antibodies. Later,
      phase III trials showed an improved ORR and a prolongation of PFS with fludarabine alone. A
      further improvement was obtained with the addition of Cyclophosphamide to Fludarabine.
      Eventually, Fludarabine in combination with Cyclophosphamide and the monoclonal anti-CD20
      antibody Rituximab became the standard first line therapy for CLL patients 18 to 65 years
      old. At the same time, the FCR regimen showed a significant rate of early toxicity
      consisting of myelosuppression and infection and also a high rate of late infection. Data
      showed by Hallek et al reported a rate of grade 3-4 hematological toxicity and total
      infections of 56% and 25%, respectively. They reported 8 treatment-related deaths (2%), five
      of these due to infections and 4 deaths occurring before the 3th cycle. Also has been
      reported by Tam et al a risk of 10% of late infection for the first year of remission after
      FCR treatment. Low-dose FCR was evaluated as an alternative option showing a lower rate of
      neutropenia, without reduction of response rate. Nevertheless, it was demonstrated to reduce
      the PFS and it has not been evaluated in the elderly or medically unfit  population.
      Alternative treatments (i.e., low-dose fludarabine, low-dose fludarabine plus
      cyclophosphamide, rituximab alone) have been explored in phase II trials in elderly and/or
      medically unfit patients with CLL. Since the cohort sizes were small, however, no definitive
      recommendations could be made for clinical practice. About three-quarters of CLL patients
      are more than 65 years old. Data from the CLL 5 phase III trial of  GCLLSG (German CLL study
      group) comparing fludarabine vs Chlorambucil in this setting of patients (median age 70
      years, range 65-80 years) displayed no differences in OS and PFR between Fludarabine and
      Chl, despite a greater percentage of CR and ORR with Fludarabine. This suggests that in
      elderly B-CLL patients, Fludarabine alone does not represent a major benefit in respect of
      Chl as front-line therapy. However, rates of complete response (CR) with front-line
      Chlorambucil single agent are relatively low (up to 7%) as are overall responses
      (approximately 65%). Phase II trials are ongoing to investigate the efficacy and safety of
      Rituximab in combination with Chl in previously untreated patients affected by B-CLL.
