            "textblock": "In the ovaries, eggs rest in fluid filled sacs called follicles. When follicles grow they\n      form small fluid-filled cysts that can be easily seen when we use ultrasound to view the\n      ovaries. In women with regular menstrual cycles, groups of follicles grow and regress 2 to 3\n      times during their cycle (usually over a 28- day period). Several of these follicles grow to\n      a stage where they begin to develop the potential to ovulate - but in general only one\n      follicle is chosen to ovulate. Thus, at any given time during the menstrual cycle, numerous\n      fluid-filled follicles can be visualized in a woman's ovaries at various stages of\n      development using transvaginal ultrasonography.  In women with absent or infrequent\n      menstrual cycles, very little is known about the growth patterns of their follicles and how\n      factors such as metabolic hormones, might play a role in the failure to ovulate. Being\n      underweight or overweight increases your chances of having irregular or absent menstrual\n      cycles and a history of abnormal reproductive function compounds your risks for chronic\n      diseases such as infertility, diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis and certain cancers.\n      This is particularly the case for women with PCOS that have menstrual cycles that appear to\n      worsen or improve depending on their body weight and metabolic status. Polycystic ovary\n      syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder that affects 6-12% of reproductive-aged women\n      within the general population. The hallmark features of PCOS are menstrual irregularity,\n      increased levels of androgens, and polycystic ovaries. The current diagnostic criteria\n      require 2 out of 3 of these features to be present for the diagnosis, therefore a number of\n      phenotypes of PCOS exist. However, the metabolic and reproductive differences across the\n      phenotypic spectrum of PCOS are not well understood. Women with PCOS characteristically have\n      polycystic ovaries, where up to 10 times more follicles are present in the ovary at any\n      given time. Further, the follicle-size populations and overall distribution throughout the\n      ovary varies in women - follicles may be situated around the periphery of the ovary or may\n      be distributed throughout the ovary. Presumably these small follicles are arrested in\n      development - but emerging data from the Lujan laboratory suggest that this is not the case.\n      Rather, follicles continue to grow in a dynamic pattern during these prolonged periods of\n      anovulation. By comparing follicle populations, reproductive hormones and markers of\n      metabolism in women with regular cycles, women with irregular cycles, and women with a\n      history of PCOS, the researchers plan to identify what factors might explain why fertility\n      potential and long-term health are compromised in some women but not in others. By including\n      women at both early and late stages of their reproductive potential, the researchers will\n      also be able to assess what influence age has on these factors. The ultimate goal of this\n      research is to understand how nutrition and metabolism regulate follicle development in\n      women so we can better develop lifestyle and drug therapies to help women preserve their\n      fertility and long-term health. Since obesity has recently become the leading cause of\n      infertility in North America, these studies are especially important.\n\n      To accomplish these objectives, the investigators plan to recruit 150 women with regular\n      menstrual cycles and 150 women with irregular menstrual cycles, with or without PCOS\n      (sub-grouped into 75 women with irregular menstrual cycles and 75 women with a history of\n      PCOS). Their goal is to recruit an equal number of women in each group such that they are\n      matched for age (18 - 48 years old) and body mass index (BMI; Normal weight = 18 - 24 kg/m2;\n      Overweight = 25 - 29 kg/m2; Obese = 30kg/m2). Women will be included in the PCOS sub-group\n      if they have a confirmed PCOS diagnosis from their primary care provider. Ultrasound scans\n      of the ovaries will be assessed for the total number, size, and distribution of follicles\n      using both two- and three-dimensional imaging techniques. Participants will have blood\n      samples collected determine serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle\n      stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol, progesterone, anti-m\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH), and\n      inhibin B. The following metabolic parameters will be assessed: (1) 75-gram oral glucose\n      tolerance test to characterize glucose and insulin dynamics at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120\n      minutes post-glucose ingestion; (2) dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan to quantify body\n      fat and lean muscle distribution; (3) vitals and anthropometry assessment to measure waist\n      and hip circumference, height, weight, blood pressure, and heart rate, and (4) fasting blood\n      tests to detect serum concentrations of androgens (i.e., total testosterone,\n      androstenedione, free androgen index) and serum markers of metabolic syndrome (i.e., lipids\n      and hemoglobin A1C)."
