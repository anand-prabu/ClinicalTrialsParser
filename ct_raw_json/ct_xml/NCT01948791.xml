  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) was used to measure change in cognitive function. The ADAS-cog score ranges from 0-70, with higher total scores indicating more impairment. A negative change score indicates improvement from baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The ADCS-ADL scale is composed of 23 items developed to assess a patient's performance of both basic and instrumental activities of daily living such as those necessary for personal care, communicating and interacting with other people, maintaining a household, conducting hobbies and interests, as well as making judgments and decisions. Responses for each item will be obtained from the caregiver through an interview. The range for the total ADCS-ADL score is 0 to 78; a higher score indicates a more self-sufficient individual. A positive change score indicates improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline/Screening, 12 weeks and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The MMSE is a screening test for cognitive dysfunction. The test consists of five sections (orientation, registration, attention-calculation, recall, and language); the total score can range from 0 to 30, with a higher score indicating better function. A positive change score indicates improvement from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The NPI assesses a wide range of behavior problems encountered in dementia patients. The scale includes both frequency and severity ratings of each domain as well as a composite domain score (frequency x severity). The sum of the composite scores yields the NPI total score, which ranges from 0 to 120, the lower the score the less severe the symptoms. A negative change score from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The CBI scale is composed of 24-item multi-dimensional questionnaire measuring caregiver burden with 5 subscales: (a) Time Dependence; (b) Developmental; (c) Behaviour; (d) Physical Burden; (e) Social Burden; (f) Emotional Burden. Scores for each item are evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all disruptive) to 4 (very disruptive). It is a self-assessment scale. The range for the total CBI score is 0 to 96. A positive change indicates higher burden for caregiver.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline through the end of study (16 weeks)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>A secondary assessment of the safety and tolerability was the number of participants who discontinued from the study due to an AE during the study.</description>

    <intervention_name>Rivastigmine</intervention_name>
    <description>As a open-label, one-arm, self-control trial, rivastigmine will be administered from 3mg/d at baseline. Then dose escalation will be made in 3mg/d increments, at a minimun of 4 weeks between dose increases (according to investigator's assessment of individual patient tolerability), to a maximum dose of 12mg/d or the individual's best tolerated dose.</description>
