Determine the 6-month progression-free survival of patients with persistent or recurrent\n      endometrial carcinoma after receiving gefitinib.\n\n      II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients. III.\n      Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.\n\n      IV. Determine the effects of this drug on the levels of epidermal growth factor receptors\n      (EGFR), c-ErbB2  (HER-2/neu) receptors, estrogen receptors (ER), and progesterone receptors\n      (PR) (both PR and PRB) in tumor specimens of these patients.\n\n      V. Determine if an association exists between the levels of EGFR, ER, PR, PRB, and HER-2/neu\n      serum concentrations of gefitinib, gefitinib activity, and soluble EGFR and clinical outcome\n      in patients treated with this drug.\n\n      VI. Determine the frequency of clinical response (partial and complete response) in patients\n      treated with this drug.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.\n\n      Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5-6\n      years."
