  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current treatment of individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) who develop
      lung disease (COPD) is the administration of intravenous purified alpha-1 antitrypsin
      (augmentation therapy) at a fixed dose of 60 mg/kg per week. This dose aims at increasing
      the deficient AAT serum levels just above a predetermined &quot;safety threshold&quot; of 11 uM.
      However, normal levels of AAT are between 25-50 uM.

      AAT has shown not only to inhibit lung proteases such as neutrophil elastase, but also to
      modulate inflammation. Given that many subjects with AATD who receive augmentation therapy
      still have significant lung disease and inflammation, this study will evaluate whether
      doubling the dose to 120 mg/kg/week has an effect in decreasing lung inflammation.

      Only the dosing of 60 mg/kg /week has received FDA approval. FDA has granted an IND number
      to this study to test the higher dose of 120 mg/kg/week.

      The study will evaluate systemic (serum) and pulmonary (bronchoscopy samples)markers of
      inflammation in 3 phases: standard dose (4 weeks), double dose (4 weeks) and standard dose
      (4 weeks).

    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to test the effect of double dose augmentation therapy with Zemaira
      (CSL Behring) on lung inflammation, compared with standard doses of 60 mg/kg/week.

      Our hypothesis is that some patients with AATD receiving augmentation therapy at the
      standard dose of 60 mg/kg/week continue to have a significant lung inflammation that may
      lead to detrimental clinical consequences. This inflammation can be further reduced with
      higher AAT dosing.

      The study will enroll 20 subjects with AATD and COPD already receiving augmentation therapy
      with any brand at standard doses for at least a month. For inclusion and exclusion criteria
      see below.

      Protocol:

      The study will take place over approximately 12 weeks: a month receiving Zemaira at standard
      dose (60 mg/kg/week), a month at double dose (120 mg/kg/week) and a month at standard dose
      (60 mg/kg/week). The infusions at standard doses will be done at home and infusions with
      higher doses will be provided at the study site.

      the study involves scheduled blood draws for clinical labs and serum for research samples.
      At the end of each phase a bronchoscopy will be performed (3 in total) to obtain research
      samples (lung lavage, brushings and endobronchial biopsies).

      The first bronchoscopy after receiving 4 weeks of standard augmentation therapy will assess
      the &quot;residual&quot; inflammation that may be present despite augmentation therapy. The second
      bronchoscopy after double dose augmentation therapy phase will be to assess changes
      (decreases) in inflammatory markers. The third bronchoscopy after resuming standard dosing
      is to assess if inflammation returned to baseline levels (required for proof of concept).

      There will be approximately 9 visits to the study clinic. This study does not include
      placebo (no active drug) treatment. Besides blood draws and bronchoscopy, the study will
      include questionnaires, lung function testing and urine sample testings.

          -  Should be on standard COPD treatment as specified below

        Medications: Subjects will be receiving standard COPD medications during the trial. These
        medications will include at least one long-acting bronchodilator and an inhaled steroid.
        Subjects that are not using these medications will be started on them at least 1 month
        before starting the study.

        Subjects will be recruited from the investigator own pool of patients, and by invitation
        through patient support groups and Alpha-1 Foundation's Research Registry. We anticipate
        enrollment of 20 subjects.

        Subjects not receiving Zemaira: Subjects with AATD and COPD receiving augmentation therapy
        with a brand other than Zemaira® (Glassia®, Prolastin®, Aralast®) who are interested in
        participating in this study, will have to be switched to Zemaira®.

        Subjects of childbearing potential: Zemaira has no pregnancy safety recommendations. In
        general It is unknown if Zemaira can cause harm to the fetus. Because this study uses an
        IND label, we will not enroll pregnant women or women with childbearing potential not
        using acceptable birth control methods. Acceptable methods of birth control include:

          -  birth control pills taken for at least one month before study enrolment.

          -  Implanted birth control devices such as Implanon®, if received at least one month
             before

          -  Intra-uterine devices

          -  Hysterectomy or surgical sterilization

          -  Abstinence (no sexual intercourse)

          -  Double-barrier method including a diaphragm with spermicidal gel or a condom with
             contraceptive foam We will monitor urine pregnancy tests, at study entry, before and
             after receiving double dose of augmentation therapy and at the last study visit.
