  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to demonstrate the sensitivity and specificity of detecting
      circulating micro RNA (miRNA) biomarkers in pediatric septic patients. It will also follow
      expression and modulation of levels in response to therapy in comparison to current
      biomarkers.

      This study will aid in the evaluation of determining the accuracy of these miRNAs in
      pediatric patients and help in establishing pilot data for additional studies in the future.
      The testing will include blood samples, urine samples and buccal swabs from patients who
      meet eligibility at 5 time points to analyze biomarkers. Study participants will receive
      standard of care with antimicrobials and any additional appropriate cardiovascular or
      respiratory support per the clinical team. The samples will collected and stored at -80
      until analysis can be performed. In addition to, during the course of the hospitalization,
      the enrolled patient will have data collected to calculate severity scores, including
      updated Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM III) scores and simplified Therapeutic
      Intervention Scoring System(TISS-28) scores. All patient information will be de-identified.
      A standard procedure manual will be developed detailing the methods for data collection and
      entry. Data will be recorded in a de-identified manner on a Microsoft Excel database on a
      secure institutional server by the institutional staff. Data will then be analyzed to
      determine correlation of biomarkers to morbidity and mortality for these patients.
