            "textblock": "The participant will receive weekly intramuscular treatment with AVONEX\u00ae (interferon beta\n      1-a) and bi-monthly high dose intravenous methotrexate with Leucovorin rescue. Entrance into\n      the study will be based on Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite Score (MSFC) evaluations\n      at -4 months, and - 1 month prior to study, where a decrease in score is noted. The\n      composite score consists of the Timed 25-Foot Walk, Nine-Hole Peg Test (9HPT), and Paced\n      Auditory Serial Addition Test 3 (PASAT 3). The patient must have been on AVONEX\u00ae for at\n      least 6 months.\n\n      At study entrance, baseline lab work (complete blood count, platelet count, routine\n      electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, liver function tests, 24 hour urine\n      collection for creatinine clearance, and urine pH), an electrocardiogram (measurement of\n      heart activity) and serum pregnancy test will be done.  A complete physical examination will\n      be performed, including measurements of vital signs (heart rate and blood pressure), as well\n      as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to document status of disease. A self-administered\n      questionnaire, the MSQLI (Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Instrument), will be completed\n      at baseline and at the end of the study.  MSFC and safety evaluations (previously mentioned\n      blood and urine tests and electrocardiograms (EKG), will be conducted throughout the study\n      at months 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12.  Blood tests of immune cells will also be drawn at these\n      visits. The patient can continue this regimen of treatment at their own discretion and cost,\n      and outside the parameters of this study, if there is apparent efficacy without serious\n      adverse events.  This treatment would be under the supervision of Dr. Rowe.\n\n      The patients will continue their AVONEX\u00ae intramuscular injections of 30 micrograms\n      (administered by patient or caregiver) on a weekly basis with scheduled intravenous high\n      dose methotrexate at 2 Gm/m2 followed by intravenous and oral leucovorin rescue once every 2\n      months. The methotrexate infusions will be performed in our outpatient infusion center.  The\n      patient will be required to complete a patient diary during the course of the trial,\n      participate in and keep all scheduled appointments, and to inform the research staff and\n      physician of any change in concomitant medications or adverse events that they may\n      experience."
