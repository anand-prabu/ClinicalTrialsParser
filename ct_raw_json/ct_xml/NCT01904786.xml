  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the birth process certain conditions can cause oxygen delivery and/or blood flow to
      the baby's brain to become interrupted. This can cause permanent brain damage. Brain damage
      occurs in two phases. The first occurs at the time of injury when brain cells in the
      affected area 'die'. There is nothing that can be done about this. The second phase of
      injury occurs over the next few days. This second phase is caused by inflammation and
      release of toxic chemicals from the injured site. Cooling the baby to a temperature of 92.5°
      F, for 3 days has been shown to reduce the second phase of injury and bran death. All babies
      will receive the benefit of cooling. Although cooling helps it does not completely stop the
      second phase of injury.

      Melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone that is produced by the brain, and helps regulate
      the sleep-wake cycle. It has the potential to stop the second phase of brain injury by
      inhibiting inflammation and release of toxic chemicals. The reason for this research is to
      find out if melatonin can or cannot improve the outcome of babies with this kind of brain
      damage. Every baby enrolled in the study has a 50:50 chance of getting melatonin. A total of
      six doses of medicine will be given. The baby's brain function will be assessed by an EEG,
      brain oxygen monitoring, and a neurologic examination at 18 months of life. All of these are
      routinely used as part of standard care for patients with this kind of problem. The only
      difference is that half the babies enrolled in the study will get the drug called melatonin
      and the other half will receive placebo. The dose of melatonin being used in the study is
      higher than the amount normally produced by the body. No side-effects of this dose have been
      reported in other research studies using melatonin in newborn and premature babies.
