Subjects in treatment for\n      substance use disorders will be followed by automated mobile telephone contact with\n      questions about psychiatric symptoms and substance use, and the investigators hypothesize\n      that this technique, including a personal feedback reporting back to the client whether his\n      or her status is changing in one way or another, may increase the treatment retention,\n      possibly by means of an intensified treatment contact."
