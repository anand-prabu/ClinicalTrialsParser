            "textblock": "Background: The end of treatment is for cancer patients the beginning of a critical\n      rehabilitation period including numerous physical, emotional, professional and cognitive\n      challenges. Specific interventions adapted to this post-treatment period need thus to be\n      designed. Interventions such as group cognitive-behavioral therapy and hypnosis have been\n      shown to be effective. However, moderate effect sizes, no comprehensive description of the\n      treatment interventions and assessments relying only on self-report measures warrant further\n      investigation. This study aims to assess, in breast cancer patients at the end of treatment,\n      the impact of a group intervention combining cognitive-behavioral therapy and hypnosis\n      versus a group intervention on patient's adjustment and emotion self-regulation.\n\n      Design: This is a two-armed, longitudinal, randomized controlled trial. Breast cancer\n      patients finishing their radiation therapy treatment will be randomized to either an\n      immediate group intervention combining cognitive-behavioral therapy and hypnosis or a group\n      intervention. Patients will be assessed at three time points during the first year following\n      the end of treatment: at 1 (T1), 6 (T2) and 12 (T3) months after the end of treatment.\n      Patients' adjustment will be assessed through questionnaires. Patient emotion\n      self-regulation ability will be assessed through their ability to respond both subjectively\n      (self-reported emotional state) and objectively (heart rate) to two emotion self-regulation\n      tasks.\n\n      Discussion: It is hypothesized that a group intervention combining cognitive-behavioral\n      therapy and hypnosis will be more effective than a group intervention. Results of this study\n      will contribute to improving post-treatment care for breast cancer patients."
