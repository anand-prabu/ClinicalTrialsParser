    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether online tracking tools and weight maintenance
      coaching visits for patients and real-time electronic progress reports for primary care
      providers (PCPs) [Continued Coaching (CC)] will support more successful weight maintenance
      than online tracking tools alone [Tracking Only (TO)] in a group of primary care patients
      who have lost â‰¥ 5% of their body weight.
