In addition, previous reports showed that trimetazidine was effective in\n      reducing intracoronary platelet aggregation and preventing platelet thrombogenesis.\n      Therefore, for the evaluation of these combination effects of statin and trimetazidine on\n      patients with aspirin monotherapy who had previously received CABG and were free of the\n      major adverse cardiac events such as death, MI, TLR, or TVR for 12 months, the investigators\n      hypothesize that atorvastatin 40mg/day would be more effective in the prevention of the\n      further late adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events than other statin. To test this\n      hypothesis, the investigators will perform a multi-center, randomized, prospective trial\n      aimed at demonstrating the superiority of combination of high dose atorvastatin therapy and\n      trimetazidine to pravastatin in patients with aspirin monotherapy 12 months after CABG\n      surgery in real world practice."
