We hypothesize that girls who play the dance exergames, versus those in the control\n      group, will lose weight, decrease body fat and visceral fat, improve cardiovascular health,\n      increase physical activity, and improve psychosocial health including self-confidence and\n      quality of life."

The Dance Central suite of games (Dance Central 1, 2, and 3) and Just Dance will be played on the Xbox 360+ Kinect gaming console, which employs whole body movement using an infrared sensor that tracks body movements such that an external controller device is not required. The player performs dance moves demonstrated by on-screen characters and set to popular music, with a choice of over 650 dance moves, 90 dance routines, and over 300 songs.\nThe exergaming condition will wear a pedometer to record total steps during game play, and they will participate in private weigh-ins at each session to track body weight over the 12-week intervention.",
