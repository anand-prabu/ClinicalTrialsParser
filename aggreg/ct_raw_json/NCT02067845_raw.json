            "textblock": "The limited research that exists suggests that lesbian, bisexual and queer (LBQ) women are\n      at similar risk for sexually transmitted infections (STI) as heterosexual women. This is a\n      particularly important area to address, as literature highlights the convergence of sexual\n      stigma and gender-based sexual violence as elevating LBQ women's risk for HIV and STI\n      infection. However, recent Statistics Canada data indicated that: lesbians reported\n      significantly lower rates of Pap testing than heterosexual or bisexual women; lesbians and\n      bisexual women had higher odds of not having a regular doctor than heterosexual women; and\n      bisexual women had higher reported unmet health care needs than lesbian and heterosexual\n      women. These differences highlight the importance of implementing and evaluating\n      interventions to address STI risk among LBQ women; however, no published study exists of\n      this nature. A STI prevention intervention will be implemented with groups of LBQ women and\n      WSW in Toronto and Calgary. The study has 5 distinct components: 1) key informant interviews\n      to inform the development of the intervention training manual and survey questionnaire, 2)\n      pre-test; 3) intervention (6 group sessions during a weekend retreat); 4) post-test directly\n      following intervention,  and 5) follow-up post-tests at 6 and 12 weeks. The study hypothesis\n      is that, compared to pre-intervention, participants who receive the group-based intervention\n      will report an increase in sexually transmitted infections (STI) knowledge\n      post-intervention. The secondary hypotheses are that, compared with pre-intervention,\n      participants will demonstrate higher mean scores of (a) safer sex self-efficacy; (b) STI\n      testing; (c) safer sex practices; (d) resilient coping, (e) self-esteem, (f) social\n      provisions, (g) community connectedness and (h) access to health care. We anticipated that\n      compared to pre-intervention, participants post-intervention would report lower mean scores\n      of (a) depression and (b) internalized stigma."

A survey will be conducted at pre and post-intervention to evaluate the\n      impact of the intervention.  Paired-sample t-tests will be used to assess pre- and post-\n      intervention differences in sexual risk behaviour outcomes (safer sex practices, safer sex\n      self-efficacy), protective factors (resilient coping, HIV/STI knowledge and testing) and\n      social-structural determinants (social support, access to health care, internalized sexual\n      stigma) directly following the intervention and 3 months post-intervention. Logistic and\n      linear generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression models will be used to assess\n      intervention effects for the follow-up period of 3 months to control for repeated\n      within-subject measurements."
