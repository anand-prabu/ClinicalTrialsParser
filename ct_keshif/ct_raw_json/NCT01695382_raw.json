Despite the evidence-based benefits of palliative\n      care, access remains limited, especially in poor urban and rural settings. Cultural and\n      linguistic barriers may also increase disparities in palliative care for Latinos. Due to a\n      nationwide shortage of palliative care providers and the unique cultural preferences and\n      values of patients, we are testing a patient navigator intervention to improve palliative\n      care outcomes for Latinos with advanced cancer."

            "textblock": "Our project uses a patient navigator to deliver a culturally tailored intervention to\n      improve palliative care for Latinos with advanced cancer in urban and rural communities. The\n      proposed research aims to improve palliative care with the goal of preventing and relieving\n      suffering for people facing serious, complex illness. Palliative care, according to the\n      National Quality Forum and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, provides patient and\n      family-centered care offered in conjunction with curative and all other appropriate forms of\n      medical treatment. It addresses physical, intellectual, emotional, social, spiritual needs,\n      and facilitates patients' understanding of illness and choice. There is emerging evidence\n      that palliative care may also improve survival for cancer patients. The proposed research\n      also focuses on reducing health disparities. Studies have shown that Latinos are more likely\n      to die in a hospital, less likely to use hospice services, and more likely to have unmanaged\n      pain. Our study will recruit 240 Latino patients with advanced cancer from an urban safety\n      net hospital, a National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, and\n      several rural communities (including some of the poorest, most underserved counties in\n      Colorado). Patients will be randomized to either a control or intervention group. The\n      control group will receive written materials covering three important palliative care\n      domains -advance care planning, pain management, and hospice care. The materials, in English\n      and Spanish, are appropriate for patients with low health literacy. Patients in the\n      intervention group will receive the same written materials but will also have a patient\n      navigator who will make 5 home visits to review materials, help patients and families talk\n      about goals/values, and complete an advance directive, all in a culturally and\n      linguistically appropriate manner. The navigator may also help with: accessing community\n      resources, participating in family meetings with health care providers, and offering support\n      to patients and families. We hypothesize that our intervention will increase advance care\n      planning, improve pain management, increase hospice referrals, and patients will have\n      improved palliative care overall at the end of life. The patient navigator model has\n      demonstrated an ability to improve cancer screening, early diagnosis, treatment, and\n      survivorship. Once we demonstrate the efficacy of a patient navigator intervention to\n      improve palliative care for advanced cancer patients, we can disseminate the training and\n      intervention to all patient navigators working with Latino cancer patients."
