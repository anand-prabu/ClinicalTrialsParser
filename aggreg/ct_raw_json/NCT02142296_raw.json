To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated intravitreal administration of Eylea\n           in subjects with the PED subtype of neovascular AMD for a period of 1 year\n\n        2. To assess the effect of repeated intravitreal administration of Eylea on Central\n           Subfield Thickness (CSFT), Central Subfield Volume (CSFV), and PED height and volume.\n\n        3. To assess the effect of repeated intravitreal administration of Eylea on vision related\n           quality of life in subjects with PED study type of neovascular AMD  assessed using the\n           NEI/VFQ-25 questionnaire"
