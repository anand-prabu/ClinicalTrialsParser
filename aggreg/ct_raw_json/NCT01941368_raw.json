Subject will be randomized to one of three groups: a control\n      group (CTL), an HIIT only group (HIIT) or a group which will take the amino acid metabolite\n      HMB and perform HIIT (HMB-HIIT).   Individuals assigned to CTL will undergo baseline\n      testing.  They will then be asked to continue their normal exercise routine for 4 weeks and\n      will undergo post-testing after this time period.\n\n      Study Protocol: Two testing sessions, on nonconsecutive days, will occur at least 72 hours\n      prior to the start of the training period. The same testing protocols will be repeated at\n      the end of the 4-week training period.   Testing protocols include performance testing\n      (VO2peak, lactate threshold, critical power, anaerobic working capacity and neuromuscular\n      economy) and anthropometric measures (physiological cross-sectional area and muscle\n      quality).   The training protocol for individuals in the experimental groups will consist of\n      4-weeks of high intensity interval training with three sessions per week on an\n      electronically braked cycle ergometer.  Individual work -loads will be calculated based on\n      the outcomes from each participant's preliminary testing."
