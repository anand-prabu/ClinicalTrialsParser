Alternate dosing days,\n      such as Tuesday and Thursday, will be allowed provided that all protocol mandated\n      assessments can be performed.\n\n      The study is a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design with the dose escalated in successive\n      cohorts of 3 to 6 patients each.Toxicity at each dose level will be graded according to\n      National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE\n      v4.02).Safety oversight will be provided by the Cohort Review Committee (CRC).The CRC will\n      review and confirm all DLTs and will continue to monitor safety throughout the study\n      (including Arm 2).\n\n      Assessments of the antitum or activity of BPM31510 will be performed at the end of Cycle 2\n      and every 2 cycles thereafter using standard techniques such as computerized tomography (CT)\n      or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for patients with measurable disease.Response will be\n      evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 .Patients who\n      experience no unacceptable toxicity or disease progression, may receive additional 28-day\n      cycles for up to 1 year on Arm 1 or 2.Patients on Arm 1 who progress may elect to continue\n      BPM31510 treatment in combination with gemcitabine, 5-FU, or docetaxel at the treating\n      physician's discretion. Once a dose level of BPM31510 monotherapy is evaluated and the CRC\n      determines it safe to escalate to the next dose level, Cohort 1 of Treatment Arm 2 of\n      BPM31510 in combination with chemotherapy will open to accrual. Cohort 1 of Arm 2 patients\n      will be enrolled onto one of 3 chemotherapies, gemcitabine, 5-FU, or docetaxel. Cycle 1 of\n      combination therapy (Arm 2) is 6 weeks in duration for patients with BPM31510 administered\n      twice weekly on Mondays and Wednesday or Tuesday and Thursday for 6 weeks and chemotherapy\n      administered on Fridays, Days 19, 26 and 33. Cycles 2-12 are 4 weeks in duration with\n      BPM31510 administered twice weekly on Mondays and Wednesdays or Tuesday and Thursday for 4\n      weeks and chemotherapy administered on Fridays, Days 5, 12 and 19. Dose limiting toxicities\n      will be assessed during Cycle 1.Response will be assessed after Cycle 2 (10 weeks) and\n      responders who continue onto Cycles 2-12 will be assessed every 2 cycles (8 weeks). Patients\n      who progress and crossover to Arm 2 will be reconsented and must meet eligibility before\n      restarting BPM31510. Crossover patients are not evaluated for DLTs on Arm 2 and all cycles\n      of combination therapy are 4 weeks in duration (Cycles 1-12).BPM31510 is administered twice\n      weekly on Mondays and Wednesday or Tuesday and Thursday for 4 weeks and chemotherapy\n      administered on Fridays, Days 5, 12 and 19 for all crossover patients on Arm 2.Patients will\n      continue BPM31510 in combination with chemotherapy for a maximum of 12 cycles in the absence\n      of intolerable toxicity and progression.Patients on Arm 2 who progress on one type of\n      chemotherapy may not switch to one of the other chemotherapy agents in combination with\n      BPM31510.However, if the chemotherapy component (ie, 5-FU, gemcitabine, or docetaxel) of\n      combination therapy is discontinued due to chemotherapy-related toxicity, patients may\n      continue to receive BPM31510 as monotherapy.\n\n      Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BPM31510 as monotherapy and in combination with\n      chemotherapy are established, an expansion cohort will be enrolled (a total of 12-15\n      patients for monotherapy and a total of 10 patients for each combination therapy)."
