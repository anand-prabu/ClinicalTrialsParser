            "textblock": "IVAC MUTANOME is a poly-neo-epitopic coding RNA vaccine targeting the unique mutation\n      signature of an individual patient. It is engineered on demand, provided as two\n      patient-specific RNA drug products and administered as an individual treatment.\n\n      RBL001/RBL002 and IVAC MUTANOME are naked ribonucleic acid (RNA) based recombinant vaccines\n      optimized to induce antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses against melanoma\n      associated target antigens.\n\n      The two antigens are well characterized antigens in melanoma that have been previously\n      utilized with excellent safety and proven immunogenicity as vaccine targets in a number of\n      independent clinical trials.\n\n      The overall rationale of the study is to determine safety of the novel RNA-based vaccine\n      strategy and determine the number and function of vaccine-induced antigen-specific\n      immune-responses as early biomarkers for the clinical mode of action.\n\n      The IVAC MUTANOME vaccine approach is based on targeting multiple immunogenic tumour\n      mutations unique to a given patient's tumour using a poly-epitopic RNA-based vaccine\n      manufactured for use in a single patient only. Parallel to the target discovery process and\n      on demand manufacturing of IVAC MUTANOME vaccine patients with RBL001 and/ or RBL002\n      positive-tumours will receive the RBL001/RBL002 vaccine. Patients which tumours that are\n      RBL001 and RBL002 negative can also be included into the clinical study but will not receive\n      RBL001/RBL002 prior to IVAC MUTANOME. Applying this approach the RBL001/RBL002 vaccine and\n      the IVAC MUTANOME vaccine administration is expected to lead to several effects contributing\n      to their immunological (therapeutic) effects."
