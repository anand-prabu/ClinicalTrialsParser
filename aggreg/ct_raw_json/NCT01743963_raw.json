Approximately 20 providers (caring for\n      100 veterans) who did not receive decisional support will serve as the control population.\n      We will measure the time from randomization until the provider signs an order for hemoglobin\n      A1C for both groups. The trial will be conducted at the VA's Eastern Colorado Health Care\n      System (ECHCS) and will last approximately 6 months. After the completion of the trial for\n      each provider, we will conduct a brief interview and survey of the participating providers\n      to assess the acceptability of decisional support interventions to manage GID [protocol,\n      page 1-2].

These providers will be compared with 20\n      providers (caring for 100 veterans not screened for diabetes in the last year) who are\n      randomly assigned to not receive decisional support for management of GID (i.e. the control\n      group). The trial will be conducted at the VA's Eastern Colorado Health Care System (ECHCS)\n      and will last approximately 6 months. Study administration will be coordinated through the\n      Colorado Research Award Enhancement Program (Colorado REAP).\n\n      Aim 1a) Procedural Endpoints: As a feasibility trial, this study includes multiple\n      procedural endpoints, such as provider participation rates, to assess the viability of the\n      intervention, rather than a single primary efficacy outcome measure (for details, pages\n      6-7).\n\n      Aim 1b) Preliminary Estimates of Efficacy: We will determine the Delay Interval\u2014the number\n      of days from when a provider is randomized until the provider orders the GID prevention\n      measure.  Use of this continuous measure will maximize the power of this feasibility study,\n      though we will also determine proportions of patients for whom these measures were ordered\n      at six months, so that we may estimate the sample size for a subsequent multi-center\n      randomized control trial.\n\n      Aim 1c) Post-trial de-briefing: Using structured interviews, we will examine the opinions of\n      providers after they have participated in the GID feasibility trial, in order to gather\n      additional qualitative data regarding the ADRLL framework and refine the intervention for a\n      subsequent randomized controlled trial.  Providers will also complete a brief survey\n      assessing their preference for the intervention."

For every\n             patient, only one provider will be randomized (to avoid multiple exposure to the\n             intervention for some patients). The consent procedure is described below.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Veterans who have had a hgbA1C test within the previous 12 months will be excluded.\n\n          -  Providers without eligible patients (described above), will be excluded.\n\n          -  Providers declining to give consent will be excluded."
