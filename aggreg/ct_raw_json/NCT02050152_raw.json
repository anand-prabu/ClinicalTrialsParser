Each group will be divided into 2 subgroups randomly with either a flavored or\n      unflavored   mask for induction.\n\n      All children will be told a joke before the mask is applied, with the answer provided after\n      the end-tidal nitrous oxide concentration reaches the randomized concentration (0, 30 or\n      60%) for at least one minute. At that point, the child will randomized to be either shown a\n      picture of one of four animals (predetermined randomly) or a food will be stated aloud. For\n      the animal, the child will be asked to name the animal aloud. The child's response (yes or\n      no to a response and whether the item is correctly named) will be recorded. If the child\n      does not respond, the name of the animal will be stated out loud.  For the food, one of four\n      foods will be named aloud and child will be asked to repeat the name. The child's response\n      (named or not) will be recorded. Anesthesia will continue with the designated nitrous oxide\n      concentration combined with 8% Sevoflurane.\n\n      When the child is ready for discharge from the recovery room and recovered from anesthesia,\n      a nurse or doctor who is blinded to the treatment group assignment will ask the child to\n      recall the joke and answer. The child will then be asked if they were shown any animals and\n      if so, which animal? If the child cannot recall an animal, the child will be asked to name\n      the first animal that comes to mind.  The child will then be shown pictures of four animals\n      and asked to identify one. The child will be asked if they heard any foods when they went to\n      sleep?  If the child cannot recall hearing any foods recited, the first letter of the food\n      will be shown: B _ _ _ _ _ . If the child does not recall any foods, then the child will be\n      given the names of four foods that begin with the letter B and asked to pick one. Finally,\n      the child will be asked about any odors in the mask during anesthesia. If he/she does not\n      recall, then four odors will be read out and the child asked to identify any one.\n      Additionally, the children will be asked whether they recall any odors on the mask as they\n      were anesthetized. The order of items questioned in the recovery period will follow the same\n      order as in the OR."
