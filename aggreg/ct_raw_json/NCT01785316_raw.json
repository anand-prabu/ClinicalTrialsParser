            "textblock": "Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults. Despite\n      successful control of the primary tumor, metastatic disease will ultimately develop in\n      approximately 50% of the patients. The liver is the most common site for metastases, and\n      about 50% of the patients will have isolated liver metastases. These metastases are\n      generally refractory to systemic chemotherapy and the median survival for patients with\n      liver metastases is about 6 months. Regardless of treatment, the mortality rate is\n      approximately 90% at 2 years with only about 1% of the patients surviving more than 5 years.\n\n      Isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP) is a regional treatment that was first performed more than\n      40 years ago (Aust and Ausman 1960). During IHP, the liver is completely isolated from the\n      systemic circulation, allowing a high concentration of chemotherapy to be perfused through\n      the liver with minimal systemic exposure. In a previous study from our institution, IHP was\n      analysed based on improvements in the procedure and the results showed an improved outcome\n      together with minimized morbidity and mortality over time.\n\n      A phase II follow-up study confirms that IHP is a promising technique with tolerable\n      morbidity. There are yet no randomized trials comparing overall survival in IHP, but in an\n      attempt to answer this question the investigators did a register study showing a 14 months\n      increased survival when comparing the patients treated with IHP with the longest surviving\n      patients in Sweden during the same time period."
