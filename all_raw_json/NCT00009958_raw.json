To determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicity profile of the novel CEA-based\n      vaccine, rF-CEA(6D)-TRICOM (recombinant fowlpox-CEA(6D)-B7.1/ICAM-1/LFA-3), either alone or\n      in combination with a second vaccine, rV-CEA(6D)-TRICOM (recombinant\n      vaccinia-CEA(6D)-B7.1/ICAM-1/LFA-3) in patients with advanced CEA-bearing cancers.\n\n      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicity profile of the novel CEA-based\n      vaccine rV-CEA(6D)-TRICOM when given in combination with the maximum tolerated dose of\n      rF-CEA(6D)-TRICOM, in patients with advanced CEA-bearing cancers.\n\n      III. To determine the safety and impact of colony stimulating factors (GM-CSF) on the\n      immunologic response, when given in conjunction with the combination of rV-CEA(6D)-TRICOM\n      (MTD) and rF-CEA(6D)-TRICOM (MTD) vaccines, in patients with advanced CEA-bearing cancers.\n\n      IV. To determine the change in CAP-1 directed T cells in patients treated with these\n      vaccines using ELISPOT assay analysis.\n\n      V. To perform a pilot analysis of the impact of vaccine therapy on the quantity of\n      circulating CEA-positive cells in the patients treated on this study in order to develop and\n      eventually validate a practical, intermediate bio-marker for the immunologic response to the\n      vaccines.\n\n      VI. To document any objective anti-tumor responses that occur.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of fowlpox-CEA-TRICOM (fCEA-TRI) vaccine and\n      vaccinia-CEA-TRICOM (vCEA-TRI) vaccine.\n\n      STAGE I: Patients receive fCEA-TRI vaccine subcutaneously (SC) once daily on days 1, 29, 57,\n      and 85.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-10 patients receive escalating doses of the fCEA-TRI vaccine until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).\n\n      STAGE II: Patients receive vCEA-TRI vaccine intradermally once on day 1 and fCEA-TRI vaccine\n      SC at the MTD determined in stage I once daily on days 29, 57, and 85.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-10 patients receive escalating doses of the vCEA-TRI vaccine until the MTD is\n      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients\n      experience DLT.\n\n      STAGE III: A single cohort of 6-10 patients receive both vaccines as in stage II, at the\n      MTDs determined in stages I and II, and sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC once daily on days 1-4,\n      29-32, 57-60, and 85-88.\n\n      Patients in any stage of the study with responding disease may receive additional doses of\n      the fCEA-TRI vaccine monthly for 2 months and then every 3 months thereafter. Patients who\n      have objective evidence of response (including mixed response) and/or a fall in an elevated\n      serum CEA level after the sixth vaccine and who subsequently develop disease progression\n      while on the extended every 3-month treatment schedule and have no other potentially better\n      treatment alternatives available may continue treatment as per the monthly vaccination\n      schedule for 2 additional months. Patients with stable or responding disease after those two\n      monthly vaccines may continue monthly vaccines at the discretion of the principal\n      investigator.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then monthly for 3 months."

however, patients with metastatic\n             disease who have progressed (as defined by objective response criteria for solid\n             measurable tumor; tumor marker elevation alone is not sufficient) on a CEA-containing\n             vaccine, may be enrolled to this study as they arise if they meet the patient\n             eligibility criteria, but will be added-in outside of the eight established cohorts,\n             at the currently established safe dose level; additionally, these patients will\n             receive only the rF-CEA(6D)-TRICOM vaccine (possibly along with GM-CSF if cohort 7 is\n             the currently established safe dose level), but otherwise will be treated according\n             to the protocol as any other patient on study;
