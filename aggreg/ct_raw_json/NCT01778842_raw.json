These patients bear a\n      higher risk of both ischemic events and bleeding complications than younger patients, with a\n      subsequently higher rate of mortality.Recentprogress in antithrombotic treatment\n      demonstrated the efficacy of adding a P2Y12 receptor antagonist to low-dose aspirin. Whether\n      this benefit is also present in the elderly remains a debated issue due to the lack of\n      specific data in this sub-population. The present study was realized to provide specific\n      data on platelet response to clopidogrel, standard dose (75 mg) or prasugrel 5 mg in elderly\n      patients (\u226575 years old) whereas the superiority in PR response of the latter should allows\n      the Prasugrel therapy in elderly patients with the better clinical efficacy and\n      therapeutical safety already showed compared with Clopidogrel."
