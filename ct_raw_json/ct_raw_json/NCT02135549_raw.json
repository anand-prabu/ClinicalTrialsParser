There will be five visits, a screening visit, baseline visit, and 3\n      treatment visits. The study duration will be five weeks. Subjects will all receive placebo\n      tablets at the baseline visit, eat a standard rice meal, and then serum glucose levels will\n      be measured in frequent intervals over four hours immediately following the meal. Subjects\n      will be randomized to one of the six treatment sequences. Patients will take in an unknown\n      order one week of placebo, one week of 4 g dose and one week of 8 g dose of SugarDown\n      immediately before breakfast, lunch and dinner meals. Patients will continue their usual\n      metformin regimen during the trial period."
