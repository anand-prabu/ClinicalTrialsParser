      The purpose of this study is to determine whether DRM02 is safe and effective in the
      treatment of rosacea when applied twice daily for 6 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, vehicle controlled, study enrolling 30 subjects with
      rosacea and designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of DRM02.

      Safety will be assessed during the study, through adverse events, local skin responses,
      urinalysis, serum chemistry and hematology laboratory testing, physical examination and
      vital signs.

      Preliminary efficacy will be assessed through inflammatory lesion counts, the Investigator's
      Global Evaluation (IGE) and the Rosacea Signs and Symptoms (RSS) scale.
