Ethiology of AAA is\n      known to be common with atherosclerotic arterial diseases (coronary artery disease,\n      peripheral artery disease and carotid artery disease), so the hypothesis is that AAA should\n      be more common among these TIA patients, thus making screening of these patients (for AAA)\n      more cost-efficient.\n\n      Study will be carried out as a prospective screening study. Data will be collected in North\n      Karelia Central Hospital within one year. All male patients with TIA symptoms will be\n      recruited for the study and screened for AAA with ultrasound."
