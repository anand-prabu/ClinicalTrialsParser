Your MRI scan will then be\n      completed as is routine.  Researchers will then compare the images.\n\n      Adding the injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine will add about 5 minutes to the routine\n      MRI.  The MRI scan will take 30-45 minutes total.\n\n      Information from your medical records will also be collected as part of this study.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      Your active study participation will be over when the MRI is complete.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  The MRI scan in this study is performed using an\n      FDA-approved and commercially available method.  Adding gadopentetate dimeglumine as a\n      second contrast agent to try to learn which liver lesions may be cancerous is\n      investigational.\n\n      Up to 100 participants will be enrolled in this study.  All will take part at MD Anderson."
