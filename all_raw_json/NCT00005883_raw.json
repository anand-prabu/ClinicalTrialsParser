            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oral phenethyl isothiocyanate in\n      smokers. II. Measure the steady state pharmacokinetics of phenethyl isothiocyanate required\n      to maintain a steady state of this substance during the hours of\n      4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) exposure in these patients. III. Obtain\n      preliminary data on the perturbation of NNK metabolism by phenethyl isothiocyanate in these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients complete a questionnaire containing a smoking and dietary log to assess\n      cigarette and cruciferous vegetable consumption. Patients receive phenethyl isothiocyanate\n      orally 4 times a day for 30 days. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of\n      phenethyl isothiocyanate until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is\n      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting\n      toxicities. Patients are followed on days 35, 36, and 43.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-27 patients will be accrued for this study over 4-6 months."
