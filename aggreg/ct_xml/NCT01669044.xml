  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine is a new sedative agent combined with the analgesic
      qualities and lack of respiratory depression. Patients sedated with dexmedetomidine could be
      easily roused, these advances shows dexmedetomidine may be a effective and safe sedative
      agent. But some studies showed some adversely effects of dexmedetomidine on haemodynamics
      (such as bradycardia, hypotension), the investigators want to further research the effects
      of dexmedetomidine on haemodynamics, such as Cardiac Output (CO), Systemic Venous Resistance
      Index(SVRI), and so on. Propofol is widely used sedative agent in ICU, it also has adversely
      effects like bradycardia and hypotension, so the investigators want to compare the effect of
      dexmedetomidine with propofol on haemodynamics after major abdominal surgery. Expect to
      further research the mechanism of haemodynamics of dexmedetomidine.

      When the patients can be roused, they will first receive analgesia with bolus of fentanyl
      0.03mg, followed by a continuous infusion at a ﬁxed dose of 0.3μg/kg/h during study period.
      Then patients will be randomly divided into two groups (Dexmedetomidine and Propofol). All
      of them will receive hemodynamic monitoring  through &quot;Vigileo&quot;(Edwards Lifesciences) and
      cardiogram monitor. The study will continue for 6-24 hours.
