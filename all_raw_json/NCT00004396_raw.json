Patients receive heme arginate\n      alone or in combination with tin mesoporphyrin.\n\n      Patients receive tin mesoporphyrin IV as a single dose.  Heme arginate is administered as a\n      single intravenous infusion.\n\n      Patients are entered in cohorts of 4.  Subsequent cohorts of 4 patients each receive\n      escalating doses of tin mesoporphyrin in combination with 1 of 2 different dosages of heme\n      arginate.  Subjects must maintain a constant diet.\n\n      Patients experiencing adverse reactions are followed as clinically indicated."
