At weeks 2 and 6\n      subjects will return for additional safety (e.g., vitals, side effects, akathisia) and\n      medication adherence assessments. Improvement on the primary outcome measure (MATRICS\n      Consensus Cognitive Battery), as well as secondary outcome measures, will be compared\n      between participants randomized to placebo versus curcumin.
