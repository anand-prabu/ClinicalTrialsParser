  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to develop and validate new endothelial function markers
      discriminating and reproducible by assessing the ability to reveal changes in endothelial
      function in response to positive and negative nutritional stimuli.

      The study will be randomized (on the order of taking the products: a single dose of lipids
      or a single dose of flavonoids), single-blinded, cross-over for each population (healthy and
      metabolic syndrome).
