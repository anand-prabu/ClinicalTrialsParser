            "textblock": "ASA is the most commonly drug used worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases.\n      However, ASA is increasingly recognized as a culprit for small bowel bleeding. The latter\n      condition manifests as overt bleeding (i.e., passing black or bright red stool) or occult\n      blood loss (i.e., normal stool but progressive decrease in hemoglobin level), with normal\n      findings in the stomach and colon. Small bowel bleeding is notoriously difficult to diagnose\n      because it is beyond the reach of conventional endoscopy. The advent of wireless, video\n      capsule endoscopy has revolutionized the visualization of small bowel. Capsule endoscopy is\n      a pill that contains a tiny camera for capturing pictures of the small bowel after being\n      swallowed. Currently, capsule endoscopy is a recommended noninvasive approach of identifying\n      the source of small bowel bleeding.\n\n      The problem of small bowel bleeding is increasingly recognized, partly because the use of\n      ASA is rising. In a regional hospital in Hong Kong, we diagnose about 100 cases of\n      ASA-associated small bowel overt bleeding/occult blood loss each year. In a prospective\n      cohort study we found that among ASA users with a history of small bowel bleeding, the risk\n      of recurrent small bowel bleeding is 4 times higher in patients who continued to use ASA\n      than in those who discontinued ASA.\n\n      Management of ASA-associated small bowel bleeding is a major clinical challenge for two\n      reasons. First, there is not a single effective treatment for small bowel ulcer. Unlike\n      peptic ulcers, injury to the small bowel is acid-independent. Thus, conventional stomach\n      protective drugs cannot heal or prevent small bowel ulcers in ASA users. Neither can\n      switching to other non-ASA anti-platelet drugs reduce the risk of bleeding. Second, we have\n      shown that continuation of ASA increases the risk of recurrent small bowel bleeding.\n      However, discontinuation of ASA exposes patients to thrombotic complications. Currently,\n      there is no local or international guideline on the management of ASA-associated small bowel\n      bleeding.\n\n      Suppression of prostaglandin synthesis is an important mechanism of ASA-induced small\n      injury. Consistent with this theory, preliminary data from a case series showed that\n      misoprostol, a prostaglandin analog, healed small bowel ulcers in ASA users. However, the\n      efficacy of misoprostol in healing ASA-associated small bowel ulcers has not yet been\n      confirmed by prospective randomized trials."
