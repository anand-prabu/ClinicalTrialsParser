As the golden standard, aspirin effect modestly on acute ischemic stroke, and\n      slightly increase the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. Recently, rivaroxaban, a new oral\n      anticoagulant, is proved to be as effective as traditional anticoagulants, while carrying\n      significantly less risk of intracranial hemorrhage.\n\n      The TRACE trial is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, controlled clinical trial in\n      China. The investigators will assess the hypothesis that a 30-days rivaroxaban regimen is\n      superior to aspirin alone for the treatment of high-risk patients with acute nondisabling\n      cerebrovascular event."
