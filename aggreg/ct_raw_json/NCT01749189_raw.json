In sports nutrition and in aging it is important to have healthy muscles.  This\n      can be achieved with exercise and nutrition.  Consumption of protein following resistance\n      exercise can promote healthy muscle growth and help improve strength.  Young healthy men\n      will be studied during a 12 week resistance exercise training program and be given protein\n      supplements every day during the study.  The hypothesis is that a blend of soy, whey and\n      casein will induce a greater muscle gain and strength increase than the control."
