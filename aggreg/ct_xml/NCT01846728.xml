  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Menopause is associated with weight gain, but the reasons why are not clear.  In this study,
      the investigators will determine if reducing estrogen levels causes a decrease in the
      ability of the body to produce heat.  If so, this would suggest this is one way that
      menopause may cause weight gain.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of the female sex hormone estrogen, on
      metabolism, thermoregulation and energy expenditure.  Weight and fat gain increase after the
      menopause, but reasons for this are not clear.  Loss of estrogen may cause changes in how
      women regulate metabolism and thermoregulation, possibly leading to weight gain.
      Specifically, this study will determine how loss of estrogen affects facultative
      thermogenesis.  Loosely defined, facultative thermogenesis represents heat production that
      is turned on when needed.  For example, when body core temperature falls below a certain
      threshold, a shivering response is invoked in skeletal muscle to increase heat production
      and, thus, energy expenditure.  However, exposure over several hours to mild cold
      temperatures that do not trigger shivering (16-20‚Å∞ C) also induces an increase in energy
      expenditure (cold-induced non-shivering thermogenesis).  Although several different tissues
      may contribute to this response, the recent identification of functional brown adipose
      tissue (BAT) in humans has promoted an interest in how BAT is activated in humans and its
      potential role in regulating energy balance and body weight.  The investigators will measure
      BAT activity using PET/CT scans pre and post three months of estrogen suppression.
