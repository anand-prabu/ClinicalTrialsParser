The precise stimulation location will be located\n                by the pressures centre deviation on a medio-lateral axis on a strength platform\n                (this area can vary for a few centimetres from patient to patient),\n\n             -  In order to assess the secondary outcome aiming at defining the best stimulation\n                location, a vibration stimulation of the gluteus medius on the hemiplegic side,\n                with a new gait analysis with Gait Rite and Optitrack during the stimulation, then\n                2 and 10 minutes after it stopped. In the same way than for the neck muscles, the\n                scouting of the precise location will be assessed facing the greater trochanter by\n                the pressures centre deviation on a medio-lateral axis on a strength platform.\n\n      The realisation of the entire protocol will last approximately 90 minutes.\n\n      At the end of the test, an optoelectronic recording by Optitrack will be realised on a\n      treadmill in order to highlight potential differences between the gait on the ground and\n      trained gait at comfortable speed for 2 minutes maximum."
