The IRB is a committee of doctors,\n      researchers, and community members.  The IRB is responsible for protecting study\n      participants and making sure all research is safe and ethical.\n\n      Your samples will be given a code number.  No identifying information will be directly\n      linked to your samples.  Only the researcher in charge of the bank will have access to the\n      code numbers and be able to link the samples to you.  This is to allow medical data related\n      to the samples to be updated as needed.\n\n      If you are found eligible to take part in this study, you will have a PET/CT scan before\n      your surgery and sentinel lymph node mapping procedure during the surgery.\n\n      For the sentinel lymph node mapping procedure, a blue dye, a radioactive colloid, and/or an\n      indocyanine green (IC-Green) dye will be injected into your cervix during your surgery.  The\n      study staff will then use a device that detects radioactivity and that looks for lymph nodes\n      stained with the dye(s). When the study staff locates the sentinel lymph nodes, they will\n      remove them.  The sentinel lymph nodes will then be sent to a lab where a pathologist will\n      check them to see if they contain cancer cells. Other lymph nodes may be removed as part of\n      your standard of care surgery if your surgeon thinks it is in your best interest.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      Your participation in this study will be over after your surgery.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  The 2 procedures being compared in this study are\n      standard of care.\n\n      Up to 100 participants will be enrolled in this study.  Up to 10 will be enrolled at the\n      Harris Health System and up to 90 will be enrolled at MD Anderson."
