Most\n      clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of omalizumab treatment after a 16 week\n      treatment period and lack the impact of long-term omalizumab therapy.\n\n      Investigators propose multiple approach modules to better assess and identify 'response' and\n      to define 'responders' to omalizumab and evaluate the long-term impact in a real-world\n      clinical practice. Besides evaluating individual outcome variables, it is important to\n      attempt the 'clustering of variables' to further investigate if any baseline clinical\n      phenotypes are predictive of better response enabling us to refine the patient population\n      who will gain most benefit from therapy."
