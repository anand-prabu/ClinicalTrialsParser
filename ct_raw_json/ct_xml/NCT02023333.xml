    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the good and bad effects when regorafenib is used
      instead of standard combination chemotherapy. It is not known if taking regorafenib versus
      standard chemotherapy will have better, worse or the same results.

             x ULN for subjects with liver involvement of their cancer)

             involvement of their cancer)
