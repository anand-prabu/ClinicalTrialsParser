    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the full dose of eribulin mesylate can be
      safely given with the full dose of cetuximab. The activity of the combination of eribulin
      mesylate and cetuximab on recurrent head and neck cancer and colon cancer will also be
      assessed.

      To determine if eribulin mesylate, up to a maximum dose of 1.4 mg/m2 day 1 and 8 of a 21 day
      cycle, can be safely combined with full dose cetuximab for patients with advanced head and
      neck cancer and colon cancer

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced squamous cell cancer of the head
             and neck with progression after at least one prior therapy. (Chemoradiation is
             considered one line of therapy)

          -  In the dose escalation cohorts, patients with advanced colon adenocarcinoma with
             wild-type kras who have previously received at least two lines of therapy for
             advanced disease are eligible.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months

          -  Patients must be aged 18 years or older

          -  Patients with measurable tumors according to RECIST .

          -  Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status
             0-1

          -  No severe concurrent illness that would interfere with protocol therapy.

          -  Patients must have adequate renal function as evidenced by  ≤1.5 mg/dL or creatinine
             clearance &gt; 40 mL/minute (min).

          -  Patients must have adequate bone marrow function as evidenced by absolute neutrophil
             count (ANC) &gt; 1.5 x 109/L and platelet count &gt; 100 x 109/L.

          -  Patients must have adequate hepatic function as evidenced by bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times
             the upper limit of normal (ULN) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3 x ULN (in the case of liver metastases ALT and AST ≤ 5 x
             ULN).

          -  Resolution of all chemotherapy or radiation-related toxicities to Grade 1 severity or
             below, except for alopecia.

          -  Patients must be willing and able to comply with the study protocol for the duration

             derivative.

          -  Patients who participated in a prior eribulin mesylate clinical trial, whether or not
             they received eribulin mesylate.

          -  Patients with other significant disease or disorders that, in the investigator's
             opinion, would exclude the patient from the study.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding; women of childbearing potential with either
             a positive pregnancy test at screening or no pregnancy test; women of childbearing
             potential unless (1) surgically sterile or (2) using adequate measures of
             contraception in the opinion of the Investigator. Peri-menopausal women must be

             completed local therapy and have discontinued the use of corticosteroids for this
             indication for at least 4 weeks before starting treatment in this study. Any signs
             (e.g., radiologic) and/or symptoms of brain metastases must be stable for at least 4
             weeks.

          -  Grade 2 or worse neuropathy.

          -  Significant cardiovascular impairment (history of congestive heart failure &gt; NYHA G
             II, unstable angina or myocardial infarction within the past six months, or serious
