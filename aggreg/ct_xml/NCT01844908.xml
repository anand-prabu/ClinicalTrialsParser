  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative ileus remains a significant medical problem after colorectal surgery that
      adversely influences patients' recovery. The investigators previous study demonstrated that
      electroacupuncture (EA) at Zusanli, Sanyinjiao, Hegu, and Zhigou reduces the duration of
      postoperative ileus and hospital stay after laparoscopic resection of colonic and upper
      rectal cancer. Patients with mid/low rectal cancer undergoing laparoscopic total mesorectal
      excision (TME) or abdominoperineal resection (APR) were excluded. However, these complex
      cases are more likely to develop prolonged ileus and morbidity after surgery, and it is
      uncertain whether EA will be beneficial to them. The investigators therefore propose to
      conduct a prospective cohort study to evaluate the efficacy of EA in preventing prolonged
      ileus after laparoscopic surgery for mid/low rectal cancer. Fifty consecutive patients with
      mid/low rectal cancer undergoing laparoscopic TME or APR without the need of conversion will
      be recruited. All patients will undergo 1 session (20 minutes) of EA daily from
      postoperative day 1 till day 4. These patients will be compared with a matched historical
      control group (1:2) who underwent laparoscopic TME or APR without EA. The primary outcome is
      the incidence of prolonged ileus, which is defined as the inability to tolerate fluid diet
      by 4 days after surgery, associated with the need for nasogastric decompression and/or
      parenteral nutrition support. Secondary outcomes include time to defecation and duration of
      hospital stay. Results of this study will help clarify the efficacy of EA in preventing
      prolonged ileus after laparoscopic rectal surgery, and may provide the basis for planning a
      larger randomized controlled trial.
