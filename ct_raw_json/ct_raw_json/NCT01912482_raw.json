Participants will use a nose clip.\nThe evaluator will manually compress the face of the participant not allowing the contraction of the buccinator muscles increase intraoral pressure and interfere with the measurement result.\nIn the measurement of MIP participants should hold a maximum inspiration from residual volume (RV) and MEP maximum exhalation from total lung capacity (TLC).",
