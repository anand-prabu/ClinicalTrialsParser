      Bladder cancer is the 4th most common cancer amongst men.  If bladder cancer invades the
      muscle of the bladder or fails local treatments, surgical removal of the bladder
      (cystectomy) with creation of a new bladder from intestine is required.  However, standard
      cystectomy affects urinary function and sexual function.  The investigators are evaluating
      two modifications to cystectomy to determine to what extent they preserve urinary and sexual
      function.

    <textblock>
      Radical cystoprostatectomy (RCP) is the standard treatment of muscle invasive, and
      refractory high grade, superficial bladder cancer. RCP involves the removal of the bladder
      and prostate. While this is an effective treatment for patients with organ confined disease
      almost all men following RCP are impotent due to resection of the neurovascular bundles that
      control erectile dysfunction. While neobladders (new bladders formed out of detubularized
      bowel connected to the native urethra) allow patients to void normally, many of these
      patients have difficulty with urinary incontinence. Two modifications have been developed to
      improve the functional outcomes of this surgery. Nerve sparing cystectomy (NSC) attempts to
      spare the cavernosal nerves that travel immediately adjacent to the lateral prostate and are
      routinely divided during a standard RCP. Published series of NSC have shown improved
      preservation of sexual function and less urinary incontinence without compromising cancer
      control. Another alternative, prostate capsule sparing cystectomy (PCSC), removes the
      adenoma and prostatic urethra along with the urinary bladder, but leaves in situ the
      prostatic capsule and subsequently the surrounding neurovascular bundle. Several
      retrospective series have demonstrated preservation of sexual function and improved urinary
      continence compared to standard RCP and neobladder. A concern with PCSC is that prostate or
      urothelial cancer invading the prostate could be left behind with preservation of the
      prostate capsule. Most reported series in which patients were screened with digital rectal
      exam, prostate and prostatic urethral biopsy, and PSA blood testing could identify patients
      at risk for having prostate or urothelial cancer in the prostate capsule preoperatively to
      recommend an alternative approach. Therefore, both NSC and PCSC appear to offer better
      urinary and sexual function in properly selected patients over conventional RCP in
      retrospective series. However, these procedures have not been evaluated prospectively in a
      randomized fashion. Our intent is to evaluate the functional outcomes of PCSC and NSC with
      orthotopic neobladder in terms of urinary and sexual function using the bladder cancer
      index, a validated quality of life instrument, and determine the surgical margin status, and
      complications of the two surgical techniques.

    <description>Prostate capsule sparing cystectomy involves removing the entire bladder.  The bladder and prostate are connected to one another. The prostate can be thought of like an orange with a peel (capsule) and fruit (adenoma).  In a prostate capsule sparing cystectomy, the adenoma is removed with the bladder but the capsule is left behind.  By leaving the capsule, the nerves that control erections and the external urinary sphincter that helps with urinary continence are not manipulated. This may help to preserve sexual and urinary functions.</description>
