The association of Asunaprevir and Daclatasvir in combination\n      with the standard-of-care bitherapy has been shown to increase the efficacy of the treatment\n      in non-responders genotype 1-infected patients.\n\n      Given the absence of current solutions and urgent therapeutic needs for HCV genotype\n      4-infected patients previously treated with pegylated Interferon/Ribavirin, this pilot study\n      aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a quadritherapy associating Asunaprevir,\n      Daclatasvir, pegylated Interferon alpha-2a and Ribavirin, in this very difficult to treat\n      population.\n\n      60 subjects will be enrolled.\n\n      The primary endpoint will be the rate of sustained virological response (SVR), defined by an\n      undetectable HCV RNA, at Week 36 (12 weeks after the end of a 24 weeks quadritherapy)."
