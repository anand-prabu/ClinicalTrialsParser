      This pilot clinical trial studies 6, 8-bis (benzylthio) octanoic acid (CPI-613) in treating
      patients with myelodysplastic syndromes who failed previous therapy. Sometimes when
      chemotherapy or biological therapy is given, it does not stop the growth of tumor cells. The
      tumor is said to be resistant to treatment. 6, 8-bis (benzylthio) octanoic acid may
      interfere with the growth of tumor cells and may be an effective treatment for
      myelodysplastic syndromes that did not respond to previous therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and anti-cancer activities of CPI-613 in myelodysplastic syndrome
      (MDS) patients who have failed previous agents (such as decitabine [Dacogen], azacitidine
      [Vidaza], growth factors or lenalidomide).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 6, 8-bis (benzylthio) octanoic acid intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days
      1 and 4 of weeks 1-3. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically documented MDS of any risk group that has failed
             previous therapy (therapy failure is defined as patients who have been sufficiently
             treated with previous agents without response in the opinion of the treating
             physician, or whose disease has progressed or relapsed while on a hypomethylating
             agent)

          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 mg/dL or 133 umol/L

          -  Have access via central line (e.g., portacath)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Serious medical illness, such as significant cardiac disease (e.g. symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, coronary artery disease,
             myocardial infarction within the past 3 months, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia,
             pericardial disease or New York Heart Association class III or IV), or severe
             debilitating pulmonary disease, that would potentially increase patients' risk for
             toxicity

          -  Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) or epidural tumor

          -  Any active uncontrolled bleeding or bleeding diathesis (e.g., active peptic ulcer
             disease)

          -  Requirement for immediate palliative treatment of any kind including surgery

          -  Prior illicit drug addiction

          -  Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; (Note: patients
             with known HIV infection are excluded because patients with an immune deficiency are
             at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy,
             and because there may be unknown or dangerous drug interactions between CPI-613 and
             anti-retroviral agents used to treat HIV infections)

          -  Patients who have received radiotherapy, surgery, treatment with cytotoxic agents
             (except CPI-613), treatment with biologic agents, immunotherapy, or any other

             past 2 weeks prior to initiation of CPI-613 treatment

          -  Patients that have received a chemotherapy regimen with stem cell support in the
             previous 6 months
