  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed Phase I/II clinical trial will be used to determine the safety and toxicity of
      direct administration of the vector AdVEGF-All6A+ to the ischemic myocardium and to generate
      preliminary evidence regarding whether direct administration of AdVEGF-All6A+ to the
      ischemic myocardium will induce growth of collateral blood vessels and improve cardiac
      function. This is a three-part, multinational/multi-center, placebo controlled study.
