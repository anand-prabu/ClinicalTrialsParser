Plasma cells produce\n      antibodies.  Plasmapheresis is a procedure that removes antibodies from the  blood. Plasma\n      cells and the antibodies they produce can be involved in rejection after organ\n      transplantation.    This trial is trying to see if decreasing plasma cells and antibodies\n      with Bortezomib and plasmapheresis can reduce complications while participants are waiting\n      for their transplant and improve heart transplantation outcomes."
