Patients\n      are stratified according to participating center, prior neutropenia (yes vs no), and\n      presence of refractory graft-versus-host disease requiring secondary therapy (yes vs no).\n      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral valganciclovir daily.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo daily. Treatment begins around day 80-120\n           post-transplantation and continues until day 270 post-transplantation in the absence of\n           active infection or unacceptable toxicity. Patients developing active cytomegalovirus\n           (CMV) infection receive induction doses of ganciclovir IV or open-label oral\n           valganciclovir for 1 week followed by open-label oral valganciclovir maintenance dosing\n           until CMV can no longer be detected.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and days 180 and 270 post-transplantation.\n\n      Patients are followed at days 400, 520, and 640 post-transplantation.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 184 patients (92 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
