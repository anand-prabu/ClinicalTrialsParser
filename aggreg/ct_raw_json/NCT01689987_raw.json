            "textblock": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of cancer with an average survival of 3 to 5 years. The\n      disease remains incurable and patients become unresponsive to treatments. Patients also\n      develop organ problems and can have severe side effects from therapy. All of these factors\n      limit treatment options. This protocol will enroll subjects who have MM that has returned\n      after treatment or has stopped responding to treatment. The purpose of this study is to test\n      the safety of rapamycin and hydroxychloroquine (study drugs) at different dose levels. The\n      investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, it has on MM. The study drugs\n      have not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or any other\n      regulatory agency for general use in this type of cancer and their benefits and side effects\n      are not fully known. These study drugs will be given with standard chemotherapy,\n      cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone, which have both been approved by the FDA for use in this\n      disease. The investigators believe that the combination of standard chemotherapy, with\n      rapamycin and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), may improve the response outcome compared to\n      standard chemotherapy alone. The investigators think that both study drugs will improve the\n      sensitivity of the myeloma cells in the body to standard chemotherapy, making it easier for\n      the chemotherapy to kill or damage the myeloma cells. However, this combination has never\n      been tried in patients before. In future research studies, the investigators hope to\n      determine how well this drug combination will work in fighting and killing myeloma cells."
