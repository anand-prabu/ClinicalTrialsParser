The aims of this work were to measure the number of patients developing\n      malignant transformationof OLP to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) comparing patients\n      undergoing traditional symptomatic treatments with those patients that were treated by CO2\n      laser from 2004 - 2011. Outcome measures were rated by incisional biopsy (histology Report)."
