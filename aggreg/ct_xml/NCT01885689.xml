    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well clofarabine and melphalan before a donor stem cell
      transplant works in treating patients with myelodysplasia or acute leukemia in remission.
      Giving chemotherapy, such as clofarabine and melphalan, before a donor stem cell transplant
      helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from
      rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into
      a patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white
      blood cells, and platelets.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Following a patient safety lead-in, determine the anti-tumor activity of clofarabine
      given in combination with high-dose melphalan as assessed by 2-year progression-free
      survival (PFS).

      II. Estimate overall survival (OS), cumulative incidence (CI) of relapse/progression and
      non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days, 1 year and 2 years.

      III. Summarize toxicities/complications by organ and severity, including acute and chronic
      graft-vs-host disease (GVHD), and infection.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive clofarabine intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days
      -9 to -5 and melphalan IV over 20 minutes on day -4.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Beginning on day -3, patients receive tacrolimus IV or orally (PO) and
      sirolimus PO once daily with taper beginning on day 100 or 180.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on 30, 100, and 180 days, and
      then yearly for 5 years.
