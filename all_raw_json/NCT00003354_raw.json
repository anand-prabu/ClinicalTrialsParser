It is not yet known if\n      undergoing conventional surgery is more effective than laparoscopic-assisted surgery for\n      colorectal cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying conventional surgery to see how well it\n      works compared to laparoscopic-assisted surgery in treating patients with colorectal cancer."
