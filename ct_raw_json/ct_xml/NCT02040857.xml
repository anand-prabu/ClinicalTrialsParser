      This research study is evaluating a drug called Palbociclib in combination with endocrine
      therapy as a possible treatment for hormone receptor positive breast cancer.

        -  Palbociclib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing. Palbociclib blocks
           activity of two closely related enzymes (proteins that help chemical reactions in the
           body occur), called Cyclin D Kinases 4 and 6 (CDK 4/6). These proteins are part of a
           pathway, or a sequence of steps which is known to regulate cell growth. Laboratory
           testing has suggested palbociclib may stop the growth of hormone receptor positive
           breast cancer.

        -  Endocrine therapy prevents breast cancer cell growth by blocking estrogen stimulation.
           During this study endocrine therapy will either be tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor.
           It is standard of care for premenopausal women to take tamoxifen and for postmenopausal
           women to take either an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen after a diagnosis of hormone
           receptor positive breast cancer.

      After the screening procedures confirms that the participant is able to participate in the
      study.  The participant will be given a dosing diary for each treatment cycle. Each
      treatment cycle lasts 28 days, during which time the participant will take Palbociclib once
      a day on days 1-21 of each 28 day cycle and the aromatase inhibitor that the participant  is
      already taking once a day every day. The diary will also include special instructions for
      taking the study drug(s).

      All participants participating in the research study will receive the same dose of
      Palbociclib.

      While participating in the research study the participant will have the following tests and
      procedures:

        -  Clinical Exams:  The participant will have a physical exam on the first day of the
           month for first three months of therapy. After that, the participant will have a
           physical exam every other month until the end of the first year of therapy. After the
           first year, the participant will have a physical exam every 3 months during the second
           year of therapy.  During the physical exam, the participant will be asked questions
           about their general health, questions about any problems that they may be experiencing,
           and any medications they are taking.

        -  Blood tests: The participant will have blood drawn on the first and fifteenth days of
           the first three months of therapy. After that, the participant will have blood drawn
           every month until the end of therapy. These tests will be used to determine if the
           participant is having any side effects related to the study drug.

        -  Electrocardiograms (EKG): The participant will have an EKG performed on the first day
           of the first three months of therapy. After that, the participant will have an EKG
           every other month until the end of the first year of therapy. After the first year of
           therapy, the participant will have an EKG every 3 months during the second year of
           therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have histologically confirmed hormone receptor positive (HR+) HER2
             negative stage II (except T2N0) or stage III invasive breast cancer. Evaluation for
             metastatic disease is not required in the absence of symptoms.

          -  Both pre- and postmenopausal women are eligible.

          -  Prior Treatment:

               -  Participants may have received (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy, but must be at least
                  30 days after last dose, with no more than grade 1 residual toxicity at time of
                  screening.

               -  Participants may have received adjuvant radiotherapy, but must be at least 30
                  days after last dose , with no more than grade 1 residual toxicity at the time
                  of screening.

               -  If most recent therapy was surgery, participants must be at least 30 days out
                  from definitive surgery with no active wound healing complications.
