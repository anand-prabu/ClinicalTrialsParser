Determine the efficacy of amifostine in reducing significant peripheral\n      neuropathy in women with ovarian, peritoneal, cervical, fallopian tube, uterine, or\n      endometrial cancer treated with cisplatin and paclitaxel. II. Determine the proportion of\n      patients on this regimen who experience significant peripheral neuropathy 3 months after\n      completing chemotherapy. III. Assess the overall toxicity of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours, amifostine IV over 10 minutes, and\n      cisplatin IV over 90 minutes. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence\n      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Neurotoxicity is assessed and vibration\n      perception threshold testing is performed prior to each course of chemotherapy and at 3\n      months following the last treatment. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then\n      every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 29-59 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-36\n      months."
