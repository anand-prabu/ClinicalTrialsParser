  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium (&quot;acute confusional state&quot;)is characterized by an acute decline in attention and
      cognition, and is a common clinical syndrome in elderly patients.

      The purpose of this randomised, controlled, parallel group pilot trial is to explore
      superiority of clonidine vs placebo in decreasing delirium in patients diagnosed delirium at
      the acute geriatric ward.

      We will also study the feasibility of oral clonidine in a geriatric ward and effects of
      clonidine upon a variety of outcomes as a means to design a more definite study later.
