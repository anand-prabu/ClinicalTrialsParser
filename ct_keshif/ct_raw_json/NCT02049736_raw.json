Treatment of chronic HBV infection in CKD patients,\n      however, is not well defined because of insufficient data from clinical trials. Telbivudine\n      is a new antiviral that provides effective and sustained viral suppression in patients with\n      compensated chronic hepatitis B infection. Unlike other nucleotide and nucleoside analogues,\n      renal toxicity is uncommon in telbivudine, and dosage adjustment is not required in patients\n      with mild renal impairment. We propose to conduct an open-label single-arm study to evaluate\n      the effect of telbivudine on renal function and proteinuria in patients with chronic HBV\n      infection and mild-to-moderate renal impairment. Twenty patients with chronic HBV infection\n      and chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate 15 to 60 ml/min) will be\n      recruited. They will be treated with telbivudine, with the dosage adjusted according to thei\n      renal function, for 5 years. Serum HBV DNA, proteinuria, renal function, and urinary\n      inflammatory markers will be monitored."

            "textblock": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health problem worldwide over the past few\n      decades, partly because of the increasing prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and\n      elderly individuals in most countries. In southeast Asia, chronic viral hepatitis due to\n      hepatitis B virus (HBV) also poses significant morbidity and mortality [2]. Chronic HBV\n      infection can cause chronic glomerulonephritis and CKD. More importantly, patients with CKD,\n      irrespective to the underlying renal diagnosis, who acquire HBV infection have higher\n      morbidity and mortality rates, and the management of chronic HBV infections among CKD\n      patients with antiviral agents is associated with a high risk of adverse effects. The\n      optimal management of CKD associated with chronic HBV infection is not well defined because\n      of insufficient data from clinical trials.\n\n      Telbivudine (Sebivo\u00ae; Tyzeka\u00ae) is a synthetic nucleoside analogue that inhibits replication\n      of HBV. Telbivudine is a potent antiviral that provides effective and sustained viral\n      suppression in patients with compensated chronic hepatitis B infection, and is used in the\n      treatment of adults with chronic hepatitis B with evidence of viral replication and\n      persistently elevated serum transaminase levels, or histological evidence of active disease.\n      Unlike most of the other nucleoside and nucleotide analogues, renal toxicity of telbivudine\n      is uncommon, and dose adjustment is only necessary for patients with moderate to severe\n      renal impairment. Recent data further suggest that telbivudine treatment may have a\n      beneficial effect on renal function."
