Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy, such\n      as abiraterone acetate, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Dasatinib may\n      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

To describe the toxicity profile of the combination, as well as the rate of\n      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, objective responses, and changes in circulating\n      tumor cell (CTC) numbers.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM A: Patients receive\n      abiraterone acetate 1000 mg orally (PO) once daily (QD) and prednisone 5 mg PO twice daily\n      (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      ARM B: Patients receive abiraterone acetate and prednisone as patients in arm A. Patients\n      also receive dasatinib 100 mg PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically."
