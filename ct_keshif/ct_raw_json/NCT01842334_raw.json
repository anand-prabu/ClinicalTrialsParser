The investigators also aim to determine the\n      effects of DCS on performance on neuropsychological tests.  A 10-week treatment period will\n      be followed by follow-up assessments including neuropsychological tests at 1 and 3 months\n      post-treatment.  Primary outcomes will include smoking as measured by carbon monoxide levels\n      and self-report measurements."
