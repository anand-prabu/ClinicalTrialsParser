Up to 6 subjects will be enrolled at one dose level dependent upon the number of\n      subjects at the current dose level, the number of subjects who have experienced a dose\n      limiting toxicity (DLT) at the current dose level, and the number of subjects enrolled but\n      with data pending at the current dose level. Escalation may proceed until either a maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is established, or until the dose in which the median pharmacokinetic\n      parameters consistent with exposure in adults are achieved. Cohorts may be added in order to\n      evaluate additional dose levels.\n\n      Part 2 consists of four disease-specific cohorts of subjects with tumors known to have BRAF\n      V600 activation (pediatric low-grade gliomas, pediatric high-grade gliomas, Langerhans cell\n      histiocytosis [LCH], and other tumors such as melanoma and papillary thyroid carcinoma\n      [PTC]). Each cohort will enroll at least 10 subjects with a pre-dose and at least 1\n      post-dose disease assessment.\n\n      In both the parts of the study, on Day 1, a single first dose will be administered, and\n      repeat dosing will begin on Day 2. PK sampling will be performed on Day 1 and Day 15 for\n      subjects >=25 kg in weight. For subjects <25 kg in weight, blood samples for PK analysis\n      will be collected after repeated administration on Day 15 only.\n\n      Safety and tolerability will be assessed throughout the study. Treatment with dabrafenib\n      will be continued until disease progression or until no clinical benefit or development of\n      an unacceptable toxicity, or until they withdraw consent or begin a new therapy. At the end\n      of treatment, a final study visit will occur."
