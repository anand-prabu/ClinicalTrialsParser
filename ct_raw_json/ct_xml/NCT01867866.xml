  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics of trifluorothymidine (FTD) as
      a component of TAS-102 with FTD alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, parallel, 2-group study evaluating the PK of FTD
      as a TAS-102 component compared with FTD alone in patients with advanced solid tumors
      (excluding breast cancer). Patients will be randomized to receive a single dose of TAS-102
      or FTD during the PK contribution phase and will receive continuing cycles of TAS-102 during
      the extension phase.
