The\n      therapy will be provided by the NeuroPoint device using the same protocol as that used in\n      active treatment arms of NPT-201. The study's primary outcome measure will be the patient's\n      change from baseline in self-reported 24-hour average pain intensity. The study will provide\n      active treatment to those participants who received sham therapy in NPT-201, and will test\n      whether or not additional therapy applications might further improve pain in those\n      participants who previously received active therapy, but did not achieve adequate pain\n      relief."

Acceptable birth\n             control includes a vasectomized partner, contraceptives (oral, parenteral, or\n             transdermal), intrauterine device, or double barrier method including condoms,\n             sponge, diaphragm, or vaginal ring with spermicidal jellies or cream. Patients\n             considered not of childbearing potential must be surgically sterile (total\n             hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, or tubal ligation) or greater than one\n             year post-menopausal, defined as a complete cessation of menstruation for at least\n             one year.\n\n          -  Patients must be willing to refrain from all excluded therapies for the duration of\n             the study.\n\n          -  In the opinion of the Investigator, the patient is willing and able to comply with\n             all protocol-specified requirements.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Patient has a current significant psychological or psychiatric disorder (e.g.,\n             severe, unstable or poorly controlled depression, severe anxiety or\n             obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\n          -  Patient has a score of 2 or 3 on item 9 of the BDI, or, based on the investigator's\n             judgment, the patient is at risk of suicidal ideation or behavior.\n\n          -  Patient has resumed treatment with duloxetine, milnacipran, pregabalin, gabapentin,\n             sodium oxybate or prohibited narcotics.\n\n          -  Female patient who is pregnant, planning a pregnancy, or breastfeeding.\n\n          -  Any anticipated need for surgery that might confound results or interfere with\n             patient's ability to comply with the protocol.\n\n          -  The occurrence of a major protocol violation during the lead-in study indicating a\n             lack of compliance or other significant concern that precludes the patient's ongoing\n             participation."
