  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children who have parents with bipolar disorder are at risk for developing anxiety
      disorders. Typical treatments for anxiety in children are SSRI antidepressants.  However,
      these medications may accelerate the onset of mania or hypomania in children with a family
      history of bipolar disorder or cause suicidal thinking in children. Studies trying
      alternative treatments to anxiety and possible bipolar disorder in children are needed, to
      establish other methods for treating childhood mental health. These studies can also help
      with early intervention and possible future prevention strategies for bipolar disorder. This
      study involves treating anxious children with Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy. They will
      have 12 weeks of mindfulness therapy in a group with other children where they will be led
      by a trained group leader, how to pay attention to anxiety cues and react differently.

    <description>A 12 week group therapy program for children with anxiety disorders. This involves teaching the children the pay attention to anxiety related cues with openness and non-judgment. Group leaders begin each session with: sitting meditation, review of the previous session and home practices, teaching a new mindfulness exercise, reading a group poem or story, distributing handouts, etc. There will be a new theme each week.</description>

At each visit during the waitlist control period, participants and their families will receive materials about mood and anxiety disorders in youth, bipolar disorders, familial risk for bipolar disorder and treatment strategies for anxiety and depression in youth.</description>
