            "textblock": "This study will examine whether taking the vitamin lutein changes lutein blood levels.\n      Lutein, vitamin C, vitamin E and beta-carotene may be useful in treating the eye disease\n      age-related macular degeneration, but more information is needed to support this.\n      Age-related macular degeneration can significantly impair the ability to read, drive, and\n      carry out daily activities.  It is the most common cause of vision loss in people over age\n      60.  Lutein a carotenoid that occurs naturally in the retina (the back part of the eye),\n      especially the macula-the part of the retina that is important for fine, detailed vision.\n\n      Men and women 60 years of age and older, with or without age-related macular degeneration,\n      may be eligible for this study.  Candidates will undergo the following tests:\n\n        1. Medical history and physical examination.\n\n        2. Eye examination-Includes evaluation of visual acuity, measurement of eye pressure,\n           examination of the lens, retina, pupils and eye movements, and photographs of the eye.\n\n        3. Visual field study-Examines the ability to see objects in the periphery. The subject\n           looks at a target on a screen and indicates when lights that appear in other places on\n           the screen are visible.\n\n        4. Flicker photometry-The subject looks at a flashing light and turns a knob until the\n           light stops flashing.\n\n        5. Blood tests-To measure blood levels of lutein and other carotenoids, liver function,\n           cholesterol and triglycerides.\n\n      Participants will be randomly assigned to take one of three dosages of lutein (2.5\n      milligrams, 5 milligrams or 10 milligrams) for 6 months and will be examined at follow-up\n      visits scheduled 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after starting lutein.  During these visits, many\n      of the exams described above will be repeated to evaluate the effects of lutein treatment on\n      the eye."

            "textblock": "The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the association of varying doses of oral\n      supplementation of lutein with the resulting serum levels of lutein in people over age 60\n      who may or may not have AMD.  Secondary objectives are to investigate the relationship\n      between level of disease and lutein absorption and to assess change in macular pigment.\n      Assessment of macular pigment is not routinely performed in this patient population.\n      Including this assessment in the current study will further attempts to standardize its\n      implementation.  If results appear to warrant further study, a placebo-controlled study may\n      be appropriate.  Patients will range from those with no AMD and little or no drusen in\n      either eye through end stage AMD (geographic atrophic, retinal pigment epithelial\n      detachment, or other signs of neovascular/exudative disease) in the eye with worst disease.\n      AMD severity will be classified using Age-Related Eye Disease Study criteria for the\n      definition of advanced AMD (Appendix 2).  Development of a safety profile is not a specific\n      objective of this study.  To this point in time, the available published data have not\n      indicated any safety concerns.  However, due to the lack of complete knowledge of potential\n      toxicities, safety assessments will be performed at all scheduled study visits.  These\n      safety assessments include: visual acuity, complete ophthalmic examination, fundus photos,\n      liver function tests, visual field tests, and a side-effect questionnaire from the AREDS.\n      Should safety concerns arise, adverse event rates can be compared to the AREDS, which is\n      based on the same study population."
