CMV is a herpes virus that can infect most organs of the body,\n      resulting in death in 10-30% of babies with symptoms of CMV. It can cause severe brain\n      damage in a large percentage of surviving babies. Children in this study have a CMV\n      infection of the central nervous system (CNS)."

All babies in the study will receive standard of care treatment and\n      clinical, diagnostic, laboratory, safety, and follow-up evaluations.  Follow-up evaluations,\n      including hearing and eye exams and developmental assessments, will be done periodically\n      until the child reaches 5 years of age.  The degree of improved hearing among surviving\n      patients will be a primary measure of drug effectiveness."
