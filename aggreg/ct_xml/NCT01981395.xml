  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our goal is to demonstrate that healthy volunteers treated with fenobam will develop a
      significantly reduced area of cutaneous hyperalgesia compared to volunteers treated with
      placebo, after exposure to the heat/capsaicin model of cutaneous sensitization. Additionally
      we are going to assess changes in mood/affect and cognitive function of subjects following
      administration of fenobam and after cutaneous sensitization compared to baseline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will receive a topical dose of capsaicin cream 0.1%(Capzasin-HP) to the forearm
      at the start of the study visit. The order of the 2 treatment regimens indicated below will
      be randomized and blinded to subjects and researchers.

      Treatment Regimen 1:  Fenobam  [1-(3-chlorophenyl)-3-(1-methyl-4-oxo-2-imidazolidinylidine)
      urea hydrate]: administration of one 150 mg gelatin capsule.

      Treatment Regimen 2: Placebo (lactose monohydrate): administration of one 150 mg gelatin
      capsule.
