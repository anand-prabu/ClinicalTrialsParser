In this randomized study we intend to compare\n      postoperative complications within 30 days after these two procedures and also late\n      complications and quality of life after one year postoperatively."

Colon is anastomosed to the ano-rectum.The\n      potential risks are bad bowel function with fecal incontinence or a lifethreatening\n      anastomotic dehiscence, especially in patients with severe co-morbidity or reduced general\n      condition.Tumours in the low rectum are usually treated with an abdominoperineal resection\n      where the whole anus is radically excised and a permanent colostomy is created.\n\n      For patients with incontinence and/or severe comorbidity, Hartmann\u00b4s procedure has often\n      been performed. The rectum is resected, the lower part is transected with a stapler and a\n      colostomy is created. During recent years there has been reports on high rates of pelvic\n      abscesses after Hartmann\u00b4s. An alternative has been proposed, namely the abdominoperineal\n      excision (APE) with intersphincteric dissection leaving the outer sphincter and levator\n      muscles in place, thus creating a much lesser perineal wound that also tend to heal better\n      when the ano-pelvic muscles are left in place.\n\n      There have been some small retrospective studies comparing postoperative complications after\n      Hartmann\u00b4s with anterior resections or the classic abdominoperineal excision. These studies\n      are heterogenous and not balanced and no conclusions can be drawn. There are no data on APE\n      with intersphincteric dissection in rectal cancer patients.\n\n      There is a need to clarify what procedure is most suited for patients with rectal cancer and\n      fecal incontinence and / or severe comorbidity.\n\n      For this patient group we intend to randomize between Hartmann\u00b4s procedure and APE with\n      intersphincteric dissection."
