            "textblock": "Currently in the United States about 97 million adults are considered obese, accounting for\n      about 33% of the American adult population (compared to 22.9% in 1988).  Obesity, defined as\n      a body mass index of 30.0 or higher,  is accountable for 44% of the diabetes, 23% of the\n      ischemic heart disease and between 7% and 41% of certain cancers.  The Erchonia\u00ae Zerona\u2122 2.0\n      Laser (which will be used in this study) has been approved by the FDA (K123237) as a\n      non-invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment which can be used by individuals intending\n      to reduce circumference of hips, waist, and thighs.  Lorcaserin is a selective serotonin 2C\n      (5-HT(2C)) receptor agonist. The exact mechanism of action is not known, but lorcaserin is\n      believed to promote satiety and decrease food intake by activating 5-HT(2C) receptors on\n      anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin neurons in the hypothalamus.  Lorcaserin was approved by\n      the FDA on June 2012 for weight management in people with a BMI of > 27 kg/m2 (overweight)\n      when accompanied by a weigh-related condition such as type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure\n      or in people with a BMI > 30 kg/m2 (obese). The purpose of this pilot study is to obtain\n      preliminary data on: 1) effectiveness of the combination of LLLT and lorcaserin for reducing\n      abdominal subcutaneous fat in overweight/obese individuals; 2) impact of LLLT on\n      inflammatory biomarkers, blood sugar, and cholesterol."

Subjects will undergo 2\n      screening visits in which the investigators will take their medical and weight concern\n      histories; and if found eligible, they will be randomized to one of three groups: 1) 12\n      weeks of LLLT, 2) 12 weeks of Lorcaserin, and 3) 12 weeks of a combination of both\n      Lorcaserin and LLLT.  Full study participation will last approximately 6 months and consists\n      of 10 visits- 9 clinical and 1 phone call.  During this study subjects will be provided with\n      weight prevention counseling and be asked to complete 3 additional fasting blood draws.\n      There will be one urine pregnancy test (for females only) at the beginning of the study."
