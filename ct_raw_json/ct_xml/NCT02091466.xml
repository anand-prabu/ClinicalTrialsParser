      Background: Hypothermia is common during general and regional anesthesia even when active
      warming measures are taken. The existing literature shows that, in pregnant patients,  the
      use of forced air-warming during cesarean section under spinal anesthesia does not prevent
      maternal hypothermia. Therefore, this study aimed to establish the efficacy of a pre-warming
      system, initiated 30 minutes before the onset of spinal anesthesia and during surgery, in
      pregnant women subjected to elective cesarean delivery.

      Methods: Forty healthy pregnant patients undergoing elective cesarean section with spinal
      anesthesia were allocated to the control group (Gcont, n = 20), without the use of a thermal
      gown, and to the gown group (Ggown, n = 20), with the use of a thermal gown in the
      preoperative care unit, 30 minutes before spinal anesthesia installation and during surgery.
      After the anesthesia, the thermal gown was moved from the regular position and placed over
      the chest and upper limbs, as an upper body blanket, and maintained throughout the study.
      The following variables were analyzed: preoperative and operative room temperature,
      hemoglobin saturation, heart rate, arterial pressure, core and peripheral body temperatures
      in the preoperative care unit room (30 minutes) and at 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after
      spinal anesthesia. The ANOVA test compared core and peripheral temperatures of each group
      according to the intervals between time-points.

      Introduction Body temperature decreasing following the onset of general or regional
      anesthesia is caused by a core-to-peripheral redistribution of heat, as demonstrated by
      several previous studies. Perioperative hypothermia and its complications have been widely
      studied in patients subjected to non-obstetric surgery; however, literature on the obstetric
      population is rare, although the incidence of intraoperative shivering can be as high as 60%
      in these patients. A previous study based on the use of forced air-warming unit during the
      preoperative and intraoperative periods in patients subjected to cesarean delivery observed
      a lower incidence of hypothermia and shivering in patients given epidural anesthesia when
      compared to those given spinal anesthesia.

      The forced air system is by far the most commonly used intraoperative warming approach and
      has an admirable safety record. However, the problem with blanket-forced air warming,
      circulating-water garments, or water mattresses is that it is impossible to change their
      position on the bed, which can be uncomfortable, especially if the patient is waiting in a
      sitting position.

      The Bair Paws Gown® presents an air warming system that provides patient-controlled comfort
      warming in the pre and postoperative setting. The same gown offers effective clinical
      warming during surgery involving the head, neck, knees or extremities. The air-warming flows
      through the gown, from knees to head or from head to knees, and allows the patient to be
      seated with gown covering the area between knees and neck.

      Therefore, we designed a study to establish the efficacy of a pre-warming system initiated
      30 minutes before the onset of spinal anesthesia and continuing during the surgery for
      pregnant women subjected to elective cesarean delivery. The primary goal of this study was
      to test the hypothesis that the use of a thermal gown 30 minutes before spinal anesthesia
      and during surgery prevents maternal hypothermia. The secondary goals of this study were to
      assess the effects of this warming method on hemodynamic variables and to evaluate thermal
      comfort, incidence of shivering, and degree of satisfaction with the anesthetic procedure.

      Methods After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval (record 388/08) and written
      informed consent, 40 healthy ASA physical status I or II pregnant women presenting for
      scheduled cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia were enrolled in this prospective,
      randomized study.

      Randomization (1:1) was based on a random computer generated code that was maintained in
      sequentially numbered opaque envelopes.

      Eligible participants were pregnant women between 18 and 40 years of age, with singleton
      pregnancy and gestation longer than 37 weeks, scheduled for elective cesarean section.
      Patients with fever and/or infectious conditions, a familial history of potential malignant
      hyperthermia, body mass index (BMI) values below 18.5 kg.cm-2 or above 36 kg.cm-2, thyroid
      disorders, dysautonomia, Raynaud's syndrome, and those in labor were excluded.

      Participants remained seated in the preoperative care unit until they were allocated to one
      of the following groups: control group (Gcont n = 20), in which surgery was performed
      without the use of a thermal gown, or gown group (Ggown n = 20), in which surgery was
      performed while the patients were covered with a thermal gown (Bair Paws Standard Warming
      Gown 810 model with a Bair Hugger, model 850 warming unit) with forced-air flow at 40ºC in
      the preoperative care unit 30 minutes before the spinal anesthesia. When the patients were
      transferred to the operative room, the warming gown was switched off for the gown group;
      however, the gown was maintained in place and, when the pregnant women arrived in operative
      room, the system was switched back on and the gown was moved to the anterior part of the
      body, covering chest and upper limbs as an upper body blanket, which was maintained until
      the end of surgery.

      In the operative room, a venous cannula was inserted into the forearm, and an infusion of
      Ringer's lactate solution fluids at 37ºC was initiated. Spinal anesthesia was administered
      using 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine, combined with 10 µg of fentanyl and 80 µg of
      morphine. Puncture was performed at level L1-L2 or L2-L3 of the lumbar vertebra, and surgery
      began when the sensory blockage reached a level between the T4 and T6 thoracic vertebra, as
      established by the loss of sensitivity to needle pricks. Intraoperative hydration used 500
      ml of 40ºC Ringer's lactate solution before fetal extraction and 800 µg metaraminol was
      provided via slow infusion or 400 µg was delivered as an IV bolus whenever the arterial
      pressure decreased by more than 25% of the baseline value. Following fetal extraction but
      before the end of surgery, 1,000 ml of Ringer's lactate solution with 20 IU of oxytocin was
      infused.

      The following variables were collected for all patients: age, weight, height, BMI,
      hemoglobin peripheral saturation (SpO2), heart rate (HR), systolic arterial pressure (SAP),
      diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), core temperature (tympanic membrane) determined by means
      of a digital thermometer (Techline Model TS 201) and peripheral temperature with a skin
      temperature probe, placed on the forearm contralateral to the arm where the warmed
      crystalloid solution was infused. Ambient temperature was maintained near 22ºC.

      Maternal data, including SpO2, HR, SAP, DAP (25% above baseline), and core and peripheral
      temperature, were assessed at the following time-points: T30min (30 minutes before spinal
      anesthesia); T0min (immediately after the spinal anesthesia); and T15min, T30min, T45min,
      and T60min (15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes following the onset of spinal anesthesia,
      respectively).

      In addition, the following postoperative data were assessed in the postanesthesia care unit
      (PACU): thermal comfort or discomfort when wearing a thermal gown (questionnaire with items
      ranging from very uncomfortable, uncomfortable, neither comfortable nor uncomfortable,
      comfortable, to very comfortable); shivering according to Wrench's scale (0 - no shivering;
      1 - one or more symptoms of piloerection, peripheral vasoconstriction, and peripheral
      cyanosis without any other cause and without visible muscular activity; 2 - visible muscular
      activity confined to one muscle group; 3 - visible muscular activity in more than one muscle
      group; and 4 - gross muscular activity involving the entire body); thermal discomfort
      according to Horn's verbal numerical scale (0 - worst imaginable cold, 100 - insufferably
      hot); degree of satisfaction with the anesthetic procedure according to a verbal numeric
      scale (0 - extremely unsatisfied, 100 - extremely satisfied); and adverse effects during the
      immediate postoperative period. Moreover, patients were given 12.5 - 25 mg meperidine
      whenever their shivering scores were equal to or greater than three.

      In this study, hypothermia was defined as &lt; 36.0ºC. For ethical reasons, active warming was
      instituted when core temperature was 35.9 ºC or less in the PACU.

      Sample size was calculated to be 20 participants to ensure that a difference of 0.5ºC could
      be detected at significance level of 5%, with a statistical power of 80%, assuming the
      standard deviation of differences to be 0.5ºC.

      Statistical significance was established at p &lt; 0.05, and the statistical analysis was
      performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) software version 15.
