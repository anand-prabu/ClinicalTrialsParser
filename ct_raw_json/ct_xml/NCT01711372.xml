  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current diagnostic aids used in treating ADHD are currently expensive, time intensive, and
      provide little information about accessory movements in response to a stimulus. One in ten
      children, ages 5 to 17, has been diagnosed with ADHD.

      Tests such as the Conners' Rating Scale require subjective responses from parents and
      teachers, making coordination difficult. The computerized Conners' Continuous Performance
      Test (CPT) provides objective data in regards to inattention and impulsive patterns of
      response. However, it does not provide data regarding accessory movements such as
      restlessness, hyperactivity, and other inappropriate movements. If the subject taking the
      exam has a reading disorder, it will impair his or her ability to respond accurately and it
      will increase response time. The T.O.V.A. is another computer based test used as a
      diagnostic aid for ADHD, which uses a microswitch to record responses. It does utilize
      auditory and visual stimuli, which removes the reading level limitation. However, it is
      unable to measure to measure accessory movements that may be contributing to reaction time
      and errors of omission and commission.

      Because of these limitations, a new company called CogCubed has created a new game based on
      the Sifteo Cube (http://www.sifteo.com) platform. These new hands-on digitized cubes are
      unique, motion-sensitive wireless blocks that contain multiple sensors that can interact
      with one another. CogCubed is providing the data for this study. The game will be played in
      a 30 minute sessions by subjects ages 6-17. Subjects recruited to play the game will be
      those with ADHD and those without, matched by gender and age. Those with comorbidities of
      developmental delay, mental retardation, psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and
      substance use disorders will be excluded, as well as any physiological disability that
      affects upper limb movement and/or coordination. Informed consent will be obtained from
      parents and patient prior to administering the game.  Parents will fill out a Conner's Brief
      Rating Scale and a Conner's Brief Rating Scale, Teacher's version will also be supplied to
      be filled out at school.

      The hypothesis is that by analyzing data generated from this new gaming platform named
      Sifteo for which a game was created, which uses auditory and visual stimuli and distracters,
      the investigators expect that they will be able to provide a more accurate profile of
      impulsivity and inattention. The investigators expect that inattention will have more errors
      of omission and less tilt movements than control and impulsivity will be represented as more
      commission and greater tilting movements than control.  This trial builds on the previous
      results of our phase 1 trials used to create the predictive algorithms to analyze the data
      and predict the likelihood of ADHD diagnosis based on patterns of game play behavior.
