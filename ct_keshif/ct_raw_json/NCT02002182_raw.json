            "textblock": "Squamous cell carcinoma is the most frequently occurring malignant tumor of the head and\n      neck and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.  More than 90% of HNSCCs\n      originate from the mucosal linings of the oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx.\n\n      Currently 60-80% of oropharyngeal cancer is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV),\n      particularly the so-called \"high-risk\" oncogenic HPV16 and HPV18 genotypes. While patients\n      with HPV+ tumors typically have an excellent response to surgical or radiation-based\n      therapy6,7, treatment can be associated with significant short- and long-term toxicity, and\n      it is not yet known whether patients with HPV+ OPSCCA have better long-term control. Thus,\n      approaches which target the unique biology of HPV-infected cancer cells, such as therapeutic\n      vaccination, are attractive strategies for potentially de-escalating XRT and chemo/XRT\n      regimens (and thus decreasing toxicity) and enhancing long-term disease control.\n\n      Preventive and therapeutic vaccines targeting HPV have been developed in an effort to tip\n      the immunologic balance towards beneficial immune activation.  This is an\n      investigator-initiated prospective clinical study of patients with stage II-IV squamous cell\n      carcinoma of the oropharynx (OPSCC) who are to undergo ablative transoral robotic surgery\n      (TORS). We propose to test the hypothesis that the listeria-based HPV vaccine ADX11-001\n      induces circulating and tumor-infiltrating antigen-specific T cells in HPV16+ oropharyngeal\n      cancer patients undergoing TORS resection. The results of this trial will assess the ability\n      of ADX11-001 vaccination to induce a robust HPV-specific cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) response\n      in the blood and tumor."

            "textblock": "This is an investigator-initiated prospective clinical study of patients with stage I-IV\n      squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (OPSCC) who are to undergo ablative transoral\n      robotic surgery (TORS). The investigators propose to test the hypothesis that the\n      listeria-based HPV vaccine ADX11-001 induces circulating and tumor-infiltrating\n      antigen-specific T cells in HPV16+ oropharyngeal cancer patients undergoing TORS resection.\n      The results of this trial will assess the ability of ADX11-001 vaccination to induce a\n      robust HPV-specific cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) response in the blood and tumor.\n\n      ADXS11-001 (ADXS-HPV) is a live attenuated Listeria monocytogenes (Lm)-LLO immunotherapy\n      developed for the treatment of HPV-associated dysplasia and malignancy. ADXS11-001 is\n      bioengineered to secrete an antigen-adjuvant fusion (tLLO-E7) protein consisting of a\n      truncated fragment of the listeriolysin (tLLO) fused to HPV16 E7. The proposed mechanism of\n      action for ADXS11-001 is stimulation of the immune system to specifically target tumors or\n      dysplastic cells that express the tumor associated antigen (HPV 16-E7) or homologous\n      antigens (such as HPV18 E7).\n\n      The use of live attenuated, bioengineered, bacteria is a different way to approach cancer\n      immunotherapy than those based upon synthetic chemistry, cellular therapy, or antibody based\n      agents. Using this novel platform technology, the activation of an immune response to live\n      bacteria appears to be more complex and comprehensive. Lm-LLO immunotherapies generate a\n      strong innate and adaptive cellular immune response and invoke pathogen associated immune\n      mechanisms [7-10]. Advaxis Lm-LLO immunotherapies are comprised of highly attenuated strains\n      of Lm bioengineered to secrete tumor associated antigen(s) of interest fused to a truncated\n      and inactive fragment of the Lm protein listeriolysin O (tLLO). ADXS11-001 exhibits an\n      estimated 4 log reduction in virulence when compared to wt-Lm.\n\n      The mechanism of attenuation for ADXS-HPV is partly due to incorporation of a defective prfA\n      virulence gene transcription activator, with allogeneic complementation and potential\n      metabolic burden due to the expression of fusion protein tLLO-E7. LLO appears to have\n      evolved as an innate target of the immune system, stimulates many potentially therapeutic\n      immune responses by itself and can act as an adjuvant independent of the microbe. By using\n      truncated LLO as part of the fusion protein along with an antigen, the bioengineered Lm\n      construct secretes combined antigen-adjuvant directly within the phagolysosome and cytoplasm\n      of APC.\n\n      Lm is actively phagocytosed by APCs, and unlike other intracellular bacteria, can escape\n      into the cytoplasm of the host cell by disrupting the phagosomal membrane via LLO (Figure\n      1). Since Lm is a Gram-positive organism it does not contain/express LPS endotoxin. Humoral\n      immunity does not play a major role in combating Lm infections as Lm quickly leaves the\n      circulation and becomes an intracellular infection. Consequently, Lm predominantly\n      stimulates a cellular immune response, and does not stimulate much antibody formation.\n      Peptides derived from Lm in the phagolysosome and the cytosol can be presented by both the\n      MHC Class I and Class II pathways, inducing both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. Further\n      details about the design and production of ADXS11-001 are found in the Investigator's\n      Brochure.\n\n      ADXS11-001 is currently being evaluated in a number of HPV-induced cancers and precancers,\n      including: cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/3, recurrent/refractory cervical\n      cancer, anal cancer, and HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer. In nonclinical studies,\n      ADXS11-001 was found to cause the therapeutic regression of tumors that express the HPV16-E7\n      antigen. The reduction in tumor growth with ADXS11-001 treatment was directly associated\n      with the induction of E7 specific immune responses. Both CD4 and CD8 T cell responses\n      elicited by ADXS11-001 treatment were found to be essential for tumor regression. Additional\n      mechanistic studies show that treatment with Lm-LLO immunotherapies cause both an\n      infiltration of T cells and a reduction in suppressive cells such as regulatory T cells\n      (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in the tumor microenvironment. These\n      effects are localized to the tumor as there is no effect on immune suppressive cells in the\n      peripheral organs such as spleen or lymph nodes.\n\n      TRANSORAL ROBOTIC SURGERY (TORS) - A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO PROFILE THE TUMOR IMMUNE\n      MICROENVIRONMENT (TIME) Increasing evidence suggests that the tumor immune microenvironment\n      (TIME) of head and neck cancer is immunosuppressive, and that tumor-mediated\n      immunosuppression may play a unique role in HPV-associated head and neck cancer. The TIME\n      includes both anti-tumor effector cells (CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, CD4+ helper T cells,\n      natural killer [NK] cells) and regulatory/suppressive immunocytes such as regulatory T cells\n      (Treg) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). Other factors, such as local\n      concentrations of cytokines and chemokines also play a role in determining the TIME. The\n      balance of effector and regulatory cells determines whether an individual TIME is associated\n      with productive anti-tumor immunity or localized immunosuppression and unrestrained tumor\n      growth. While the majority of tumor vaccine studies examine circulating antigen-specific T\n      cell responses, these responses do not always correlate with infiltration of\n      antigen-specific T cells into the tumor and objective tumor responses,\n\n      Robotic resection of oropharyngeal cancer is a treatment modality, pioneered at the Mount\n      Sinai School of Medicine and other institutions. Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) is\n      intended to minimize or avoid morbidity of radiation therapy or chemo-radiation by\n      completely removing the tumor in three dimensions with negative histological margins, thus\n      allowing de-escalation of adjuvant therapy in some patients and sparing adjuvant therapy\n      altogether in others. When clinically indicated, a neck dissection is performed\n      simultaneously. TORS is FDA approved for head and neck cancer, and considered standard of\n      care therapy of OPSCC in appropriate patients.\n\n      An important distinction between TORS and definitive chemoradiation as treatment for\n      oropharyngeal tumors is that only TORS yields a pathological specimen which can be used to\n      provide postoperative risk-stratification and guide the use of adjuvant therapy. The\n      pathological specimen also permits evaluation of the response of tumor biomarkers and the\n      TIME following a course of preoperative (also described as \"neoadjuvant\") treatment. TORS\n      resection of oropharyngeal cancer provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the ability of\n      vaccination to induce an immune response in the tumor and draining lymph nodes."
