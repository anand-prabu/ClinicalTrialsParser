      In this pilot study the investigators shall prospectively in a blinded fashion evaluate with
      Aβ PET and CSF Aβ42 and tTau or pTau in patients committed to shunt surgery and then
      investigate the relationship of these biomarkers with outcome on gait, cognition and urinary
      control improvement in the short term (3 months) and long term (1 year). The imaging agent
      will be provided by AVID.

      Furthermore the study will standardize imaging studies using florbetapir F 18 PET to provide
      information on amyloid burden.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 60.

          2. Visual and auditory acuity adequate for neuropsychological testing.

          3. Completed six grades of education or has a good work history (sufficient to exclude
             mental retardation).

          4. Must speak English fluently.

          5. Willing to undergo one Amyloid imaging PET scan.

          6. Agrees to at least one lumbar puncture for the collection of CSF.

          7. Must agree to return for a Month 3 and Month 12 visit.

          8. Participant, who in the opinion of the investigator, can tolerate the PET scan
             procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of schizophrenia (DSM IV criteria).

          2. History of alcohol or substance abuse or dependence within the past 2 years (DSM IV
             criteria).

          3. Participation in clinical studies involving neuropsychological measures being
             collected more than one time per year.

          4. Exclusion for amyloid imaging with 18F -AV-45: Current or recent participation in any
             procedures involving radioactive agents such that the total radiation dose exposure
             to the participant in any given year would exceed the limits of annual and total dose
             commitment set forth in the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21 Section
             361.1.

          5. Clinically significant hepatic, renal, pulmonary, metabolic, or endocrine
             disturbances as indicated by history, which in the opinion of the investigator might
             pose a potential safety risk to the participant?

          6. Current clinically significant cardiovascular disease, including one or more of:

               -  cardiac surgery or myocardial infarction within the last 4 weeks;

               -  unstable angina;

               -  acute decompensated congestive heart failure or class IV heart failure
