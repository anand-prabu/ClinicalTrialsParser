To assess the pharmacokinetic profiles of HMS5552 after single dosing\n\n        2. To assess the preliminary pharmacodynamic profiles of HMS5552\n\n      Each study subject will receive a single oral dose of HMS5552. During each dosing, eight\n      subjects will be allocated to receive HMS5552 and two subjects will be allocated to receive\n      placebo treatment.\n\n      Several doses of HMS5552 will be tested. Dose titration or reduction is determined for each\n      cohort based on the safety and pharmacokinetic data obtained from the lower dose cohorts."
