  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, control pilot study is to measure the effects of a gentle,
      12 week hatha yoga program on post-menopausal, obese, sedentary South Asian women at risk
      for cardiovascular disease. Hatha yoga is a form of structured physical exercises known as
      asanas, combined with breathing exercises called pranayama, and relaxation techniques.   The
      yoga intervention consists of 9 different yoga poses (asanas) and 3 different breathing
      exercises (pranayama) that can be easily replicated and readily performed by individuals who
      are middle-aged and older, overweight, unfit, or who suffer from a chronic illness.
