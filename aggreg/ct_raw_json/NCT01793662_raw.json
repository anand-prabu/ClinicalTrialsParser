Since 1993, the vary operation has\n      also been performed laparoscopically. The laparoscopic ABFB operation claims to be minimally\n      invasive as compared to the open ABFB. The cohort studies published so far have shown that\n      although a longer operation time with the laparoscopic procedure as compared to the open\n      surgery, the patients have a shorter hospital stay, lesser perioperative bleeding, fewer\n      systemic complications and earlier reconvalescence.\n\n      However, no randomized control trial has yet been published to compare the two procedures.\n\n      In the NLAST-study, which is a multicenter randomized control trial, the patients with TASC\n      type D atherosclerotic lesion shall be randomized to either totally laparoscopic\n      aortobifemoral bypass operation (LABFB)or an open ABFB operation."
