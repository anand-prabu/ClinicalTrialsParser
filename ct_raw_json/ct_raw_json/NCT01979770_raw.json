Since numerous\n      variables were collected, additional research questions can be possibly studied or other\n      interested variables can be included in the future."

Biochemical, anthropometric, socio-demographic, feeding\n      practices, and maternal characteristics data were collected. Children were followed up at 9\n      years of age to assess the long-term consequences of supplementation and early life\n      nutrition on cognitive functioning and growth. There is a need to continue the follow-up of\n      this study in order to address the association between early nutritional exposures and risks\n      of cardio-metabolic dysfunction and cognitive and behavioral development later in childhood,\n      adolescence and adulthood. Thus, we propose to follow-up these children during adolescence\n      to assess the relationship of early life nutrition and exposures during infancy and\n      childhood and outcomes including nutritional status, cognitive functioning, and risk for\n      non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Findings from this study could provide awareness and\n      information in developing policies and timely interventions to maintain optimal nutritional\n      status throughout vulnerable life stages and reduce risks of NCDs and disabilities later in\n      life."
