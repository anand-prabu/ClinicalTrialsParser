The first will receive standard post ED care. The second will receive an\n      appointment to our Geriatric Clinic within 2-3 days for stabilization, further treatment and\n      contact with the patient's primary physician to communicate the course of the patient's\n      illness and to schedule subsequent follow-up with the patients regular medical provider.\n\n      There will be two primary outcomes: The first will be a composite of morality and/or return\n      to the ED at 30 days, and the secondary primary outcome will be mortality. Economic data\n      regarding resource utilization by patients will also be analyzed."
