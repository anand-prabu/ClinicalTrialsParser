It is expected that results from this study can\n      guide how to incorporate mental health care into routine diabetes clinics in low-resource\n      settings."

            "textblock": "It has been shown that targeting both depression and diabetes control has important\n      synergistic benefits. Since diabetes patients in India tend to access specialists\n      (government or private) for their diabetes and other health care needs, they at least have a\n      point of contact with the health system which can be leveraged to also reduce depressive\n      symptoms. The investigators aim to assess if interventions for depression can be integrated\n      into routine diabetes care delivery with only modest modifications. The integrated\n      multi-condition (depression and diabetes) intervention model merges experiences from\n      TEAMCare and an ongoing trial of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction in India (CARRS\n      Trial) and involves: 1. enhancing the role of care coordinators and training them in disease\n      management; 2. integrating 'intelligent' technology; and 3. weekly physician oversight to\n      review poorly-controlled cases and make responsive treatment adjustments. The investigators\n      propose to take this model from research to practice using an implementation sciences\n      approach. The investigators will first gather formative qualitative data and endeavor to\n      make the intervention more patient-centered, develop locally-understandable educational\n      materials, and identify ways to overcome stigma of mental health disorders and facilitate\n      trustful therapeutic relationships between care coordinators and patients and their\n      families. The investigators will then evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of\n      the intervention model in a randomized controlled trial."
