Patients will be randomized to two\n      different treatment arms (low dose versus high dose).  An important aspect of this study is\n      to characterize the pharmacokinetics of thalidomide, as well as make correlations between\n      the degree of angiogenesis occurring in a patient and the activity of thalidomide.  Each\n      patient that has biopsiable lesions will undergo a pretreatment biopsy of their prostate (or\n      other site of soft tissue disease) and repeat after 2 to 6 months of treatment.  Additional\n      information will be obtained on the changes in the circulating levels of the following\n      growth factors:  bFGF, TNF, VEGF, and TGFB.  Neurological complications are the primary\n      dose-limiting toxicity anticipated with chronic thalidomide administration."
