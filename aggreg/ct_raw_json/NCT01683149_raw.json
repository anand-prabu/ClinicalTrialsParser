This will be called the maximum tolerated dose. The\n      chemotherapy in this study is a combination of Topotecan and Sorafenib. The investigators\n      are trying to find the highest dose of Topotecan and Sorafenib that can be given safely to\n      children with Refractory or Recurrent Pediatric Solid Malignancies. The investigators will\n      do this by testing different doses of these drugs in different groups of children. The\n      investigators will also study how the body processes these drugs."
