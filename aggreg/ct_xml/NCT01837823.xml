  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a leading cause of death in most countries. It is well
      known that the reduction of cholesterol levels by statin therapy is associated with
      significant decreases in plaque burden. REVERSAL, ASTEROID, and more recently the SATURN II
      trial showed that in patients with CAD, lipid lowering with atorvastatin or rosuvastatin
      respectively reduced progression of coronary atherosclerosis, even causing plaque regression
      of some lesions. CAD clinical events are related to plaque instability due to lipid content
      and activity within the atherosclerotic plaque. The investigators recently completed the
      YELLOW I study, and identified that intensive statin therapy (rosuvastatin 40mg) was
      associated with a reduction in the amount of lipid in obstructive coronary plaques, as
      measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The YELLOW II study is designed to expand and
      build upon these results, and to provide mechanistic insights into the potential benefits of
      intensive statin therapy on atherosclerotic plaques.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      YELLOW II is a single site study and will assess the regression of plaque lipid content and
      changes in plaque morphology from atherosclerotic lesions after high-dose statin therapy by
      utilizing NIRS, IVUS and optical coherency tomography (OCT) imaging modalities in the
      coronary arteries. We propose to image non-culprit coronary lesions using these modalities
      in patients with two or three diseased coronary vessels deemed to warrant intervention on
      clinical grounds. Thus, at the time of enrolment patients will undergo Percutaneous Coronary
      Intervention (PCI) of a non-study culprit lesion, and triple-modality imaging of the
      potential non-culprit ('YELLOW') lesion. If there is high baseline lipid content in the
      non-culprit YELLOW lesion (max 4mm LCBI &gt; 150), patients will be formally entered into this
      study. Following this, all enrolled subjects will receive high-dose lipid lowering therapy
      (rosuvastatin 40mg daily). The non-culprit YELLOW lesion will undergo staged intervention
      8-12 weeks following study enrolment and baseline imaging. At this time the YELLOW lesion
      will be reimaged to determine whether high-dose statin therapy caused a reduction in lipid
      content as assessed by NIRS, and other altered plaque morphology as assessed by OCT and
      IVUS. In addition, both at baseline and at the time of final non-culprit YELLOW lesion PCI,
      blood samples will be drawn for the assessment of haptoglobin genotype, LDL, HDL, macrophage
      profiling in response to certain changes in these lipid moieties and other parameters that
      may be related to changes in the YELLOW lesion as a result of intensive statin therapy.
