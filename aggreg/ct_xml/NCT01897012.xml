    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of alisertib and romidepsin in
      treating patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell or T-cell lymphomas. Alisertib may stop
      the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as romidepsin, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving
      alisertib and romidepsin may be an effective treatment for relapsed or refractory B-cell or
      T-cell lymphomas.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety profile of MLN8237 (alisertib) plus romidepsin. II. To determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD), if reached, of MLN8237 administered in combination with
      romidepsin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate objective response rate (ORR) and complete response (CR) of the combined
      regimen.

      II. To assess whether higher levels of expression of aurora kinase A correlate with
      outcomes.

      III. To determine if this combination results in downregulation of targets of v-myc
      myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (avian) (C-Myc) in C-Myc positive patients, induces
      mitotic catastrophe, changes immune system or other host responses, or upregulates markers
      for apoptosis.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive alisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7 and romidepsin
      intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
