  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between anti-drug antibodies, serum
      drug concentrations, and clinical response for rheumatoid arthritis patients being treated
      with etanercept, adalimumab or infliximab.

      cross-sectional Population will be selected through convenience sampling.  Patients
      sequentially visiting the rheumatology clinic for routine care who are receiving etanercept,
      adalimumab, or infliximab for between 6 and 24 months will be evaluated for eligibility and
      interest in participation.  A maximum of 200 patients per treatment will be enrolled.

    <description>LDA is defined as a Disease Activity Score using 28 joint count (DAS28) of â‰¤ 3.2.  Patient DAS28 (ESR) score is calculated from the number of tender and swollen joints, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and Subject General Health VAS assessment. Lower scores indicate better disease status.</description>

    <description>HAQ-DI is a questionnaire that assesses the degree of difficulty a patient has experienced during the past week in dressing, grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities.  Each question is answered with a level of difficulty score ranging from 0-3 with 0 representing &quot;no difficulty&quot; and 3 representing &quot;unable to do&quot;.</description>
