Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based solutions are\n      the most popular and safest bowel preparation regimens, however the 4-Liter volume is often\n      poorly tolerated. More recently, it has been shown that the use of a low volume preparation\n      (2-Liter PEG solution with the adjunct of a laxative, bisacodyl) achieves comparable bowel\n      cleanliness rates to 4-Liter PEG in general population.The primary aim will be to compare\n      the efficacy of 2-L mixed preparation (bisacodyl plus PEG) to 4-L PEG preparation."
