The decision on the\n             inclusion of these patients should be discussed with the CML. Patients with a liver\n             biopsy performed 3 or more years (or fibroscan performed 6 months or more) prior to\n             randomisation, demonstrating cirrhosis do not need to repeat a liver biopsy or\n             fibroscan.\n\n          5.

Female partners of childbearing potential must perform monthly pregnancy\n                  tests from the date of screening until 7 months after the last dose of ribavirin\n                  (tests will be provided by the Sponsor).\n\n          7.
