This study will be performed on either 1.5T or 3T MR scanners.\n\n      For this study, a total of 70 patients meeting the approved commercial guidelines will be\n      enrolled and treated with the ExAblate system at from 7 to 10 sites.  The proportion of\n      responders is expected to be at least 30% greater than the proportion of subjects\n      experiencing pain progression (i.e., 60% vs. 30%).  Additionally, at the 3 month visit, an\n      analysis of both the safety and efficacy profiles will be compared to the original PMA\n      pivotal study group."
