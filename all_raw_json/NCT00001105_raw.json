To\n      determine specific dose concentrations sufficient to achieve efficacy and avoid toxicity. To\n      determine the effect of F105 on virologic, immunologic, and serologic parameters.\n\n      Early in the course of HIV infection, the primary humoral immune response appears to be\n      highly strain specific and to be directed at a hypervariable portion of the viral gp120. The\n      F105 human monoclonal antibody reacts with the CD4 binding region of gp120 and has been\n      shown to neutralize the IIIB, SF2, and MN strains of HIV at concentrations readily\n      achievable in humans."

The IV catheter will remain in the\n      patient's arm for 12 hours after injection for subsequent drawing of blood samples. The\n      third group (highest dose) will be studied only after the first two groups are analyzed for\n      pharmacokinetics. No more than two patients are enrolled per week. Patients on Part A\n      undergo follow-up three to four times within the first week after injection and weekly\n      thereafter for 7 weeks. Pharmacokinetic and toxicity data generated from Part A will be used\n      to select two dose levels for intermittent administration in Part B. In this part, cohorts\n      of four to six patients receive one of two doses of F105 for 8-12 weeks.\n\n      Per 9/30/94 amendment, eight patients receive one dose of F105 every 21 days for four doses\n      (dose determined from analysis of Part A data)."
