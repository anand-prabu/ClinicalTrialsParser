This is a study in which deep versus\n      superficial electrode contact positions and two different amplitudes of stimulation are\n      compared under scientific conditions. The hypothesis is that one contact\n      position/stimulation amplitude combination will provide a better outcome than the others.\n      Each study participant receives each of four different anatomical position/stimulation\n      amplitude setting combinations over a 12 month period in randomized order followed by a\n      6-month period of trial-and-error device programming to optimize control of motor tics.\n      Motor tics, potential side effects, daily functioning and quality of life are assessed at\n      the end of each trial stimulation period. At the end of the study, the study participant\n      continues to have long-term deep brain stimulation treatment with whatever settings provide\n      the most relief."
