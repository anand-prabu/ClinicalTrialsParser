Escalating doses of M-T412\n      are administered to cohorts of 5 patients each receiving a single dose intravenously over 2\n      hours.\n\n      Patients who complete the single dose assessment of M-T412 may receive up to 3 additional\n      single doses of M-T412 IV over 2 hours, with each repeated dose given at least 1 month\n      apart.\n\n      Then, patients receive one dose level of M-T412 IV over 2 hours at 3 month intervals over a\n      period of 12 months for a total of 5 doses.  Once recovery of CD4 cells is obtained, the\n      next scheduled infusion of M-T412 begins.  Patients are omitted from study if CD4 cells\n      remain attenuated following 2 scheduled infusion sessions.\n\n      Patients are followed at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after the first infusion."
