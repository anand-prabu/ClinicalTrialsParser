Chronic constipation is a\n      condition in which bowel movements are infrequent or incomplete for a prolonged time. The\n      use of prucalopride should be used in accordance with the approved product label and will\n      follow the normal medical practice of the investigators. Patients should take 2 mg\n      prucalopride tablet orally once daily. For elderly patients (>65 years old), patients with\n      renal impairment not requiring dialysis or patients with severe hepatic impairment, 1mg\n      prucalopride once daily should be given. Patients will be asked to fill-up a patient diary\n      daily for 12-weeks to monitor the bowel movement during the study period. All adverse events\n      and concomitant medications taken by the patients during the study will be documented\n      accordingly. Patients will be monitored during the 12-week period of observation while the\n      patients are in prucalopride treatment."
