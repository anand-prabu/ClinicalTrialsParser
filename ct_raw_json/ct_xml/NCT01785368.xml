  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the implementation of referral
      guidelines for imaging exams requested by the emergency department on exam relevance. The
      latter is assessed via the rate of suspected diagnoses that are confirmed by the requested
      exam.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to assess the impact of the implementation of
      referral guidelines for imaging exams requested by the emergency department on  the
      following:

      A. How exam results are classified in relation to the initial, suspected diagnosis.

      B. Further aspects of exam relevance.

      C. Delays associated with exams

      D. Changes in practice in terms of type of examination, clinical situations, the number of
      tests ordered per patient, and emergency situations

      E. Radiation and contrast agent exposures
