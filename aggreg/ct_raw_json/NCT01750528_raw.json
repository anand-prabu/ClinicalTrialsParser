Our hypotheses on the relationship between periodontitis and AS are as follows;\n\n             -  The prevalence of periodontitis is higher in AS patients group than that of non-AS\n                control group\n\n             -  Anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy would favorably affect the disease course of periodontitis.\n\n        2. Based on our hypotheses, the specific objectives of the present proposal are as\n           follows;\n\n             -  The primary objective is to compare the prevalence rate of periodontitis between\n                AS patient group and non-AS group.\n\n             -  The secondary objectives will be:\n\n                  -  To observe the carriage rate of P. gingivalis in AS and non-AS groups\n\n                  -  To identify clinical parameters associated with the severity of periodontitis\n                     in AS group.\n\n                  -  To compare the progression of periodontitis at weeks 12 and 24 between AS and\n                     non-AS groups or between AS patients with and without anti-TNF-\u03b1 treatment"
