We investigate whether assessment of PM can\n      distinguish depressed patients who benefit from CBT. Moreover, there may be a relationship\n      between PM and measures of brain function that also correlate with success in CBT.\n      Therefore, we measure PM, neurophysiological measures (EEG and ERP's), and cognitive tests\n      before and after CBT treatment of 70 adults with depression."

            "textblock": "Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) was found to be the most effective psychotherapy for\n      depression. Yet, it is effective only for 40% of the depressed people who receive this\n      treatment. Until this day there is no method of predicting whom can be helped among\n      depressed patients by CBT. In this study we examine whether level of psychological\n      mindedness and other neurophysiological and cognitive variables can predict who may benefit\n      from CBT among depressed patients. Subjects who are found to be clinically depressed are\n      given 14 sessions of CBT.\n\n      The screening procedure for this study includes a 20-30 minute telephone or in-person\n      interview. Clinical staff members trained in diagnostic interviewing will conduct an initial\n      phone interview to determine likely diagnostic suitability. If the subject is deemed\n      preliminarily eligible for participation, meaning he or she is clinically depressed, they\n      will then be invited for an in-person psychiatric evaluation conducted at the Depression\n      Evaluation Services at New York State Psychiatric Institute.\n\n      Upon arrival the subject will read the Depression Evaluation Services consent form for\n      evaluation.Questions will be answered and the consent will be offered to read and sign,if\n      agreeable. The evaluation will include a clinical interview, a structured clinical interview\n      (the SCID-IV), collection of blood samples for routine medical tests, including thyroid\n      function tests, and a urine sample [for urine analysis and toxicology screen].\n\n      Important to note: subjects who enroll in the study need to not take any psychiatric\n      medications or they must be on the same medications for 3 months and the same dose for 4\n      weeks. During the psychotherapy, the patients will continue to see their own physician for\n      medications. Medication management will NOT be within the province of this protocol. During\n      the study there will be an ongoing consultation with the outside physician, particularly\n      with regard to changes in medication and/or dosage. Should the MD or patient decide to make\n      alternations in use of medication, this will not affect the patient's participation in\n      psychotherapy or in this study.\n\n      Subjects who were found to be eligible for the study will return within two weeks after the\n      evaluation visit. An evaluator will rate the HRSD-17 and CGI-Severity.If they are still\n      eligible, they will be asked to sign the study consent form, have the study explained,\n      including its risks and possible benefits, as well as alternatives and its voluntary nature.\n      Once they sign the consent form, patients will complete a battery of self-report instrument.\n      Patients will be tested on EEG, ERP and cognitive tests the same day or another day based on\n      their convenience. After that they will schedule their weekly CBT sessions with the study\n      therapist. During 14 weeks they will be clinically monitored by Beck Depression Inventory at\n      the beginning of every session and HRSD-17 every four weeks. They will complete study\n      measures at week 8 and after the the 14 weeks sessions. They will be tested on EEG, ERP and\n      cognitive tests after the 14 weeks of therapy.\n\n      Study participants who do not remit (end treatment HDRS-17 > 7) at the end of CBT trial will\n      be offered medication for three months or will receive referral for alternative\n      psychotherapy, per patient's preference."
