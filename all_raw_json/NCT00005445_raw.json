The results from these\n      studies will have direct relevance to the clinical care and development of public policy for\n      children with asthma.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      Specific hypotheses regarding these factors which influence pediatric asthma hospitalization\n      were tested in two different data sets:  ecologic studies of trends and area variations of\n      the children residing in the contiguous states of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont for 1980\n      - 1994; retrospective cohort analyses of children enrolled at a staff model HMO, Group\n      Health Cooperative of Puget Sound for 1977 - 1994. These studies utilized detailed\n      information regarding area and individual 'exposure' to differing systems of health care and\n      asthma medications, controlling for socioeconomic status."
