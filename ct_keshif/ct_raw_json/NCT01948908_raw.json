            "textblock": "The intranasal route is an effective means of administering sedative medications for\n      children. However, sometimes the child has to receive a certain dose that requires a very\n      large volume to be administered into the nose, because of the types of concentrations of\n      drugs that are available. Most drugs are not concentrated enough so that small volumes can\n      be consistently given, so as a result, sometimes a very large amount of medication is\n      administered intranasally. When the amount is too large, most of the medication either runs\n      back out the nose, or down the back of the nose and throat and is swallowed, instead of\n      being absorbed in the nasal cavity, where it can be quickly absorbed and produce optimal\n      effectiveness. The purpose of this study is to determine exactly how much volume should be\n      administered into each nare, so that the absorption can be maximized and the amount that\n      runs out of the nose, or is swallowed, is minimized, thereby optimizing the effectiveness of\n      any drug given intranasally. The investigators will determine this ideal \"volume of\n      administration\" by studying intranasal midazolam in children who require sedation to\n      facilitate laceration repairs. The investigators will evaluate both clinical outcomes as\n      well as pharmacokinetic outcomes associated with each volume of administration."
