            "textblock": "Based on 1. the established efficacy of both, galantamine and memantine in subjects with\n      Alzheimer's disease, 2. galantamine's dual mode of action being a cholinesterase inhibitor\n      and an allosteric modulator of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) an effect which\n      might lead to enhanced neurotransmission in other neuronal populations, i.e., glutamatergic\n      and GABAergic, 3. memantine's neuroprotective properties, which have been demonstrated in\n      several experimental system, but not yet in a clinical setting the primary hypothesis is\n      formulated that treatment with a combination of galantamine plus memantine, which may exert\n      additional effects on the level of neurotransmitter modulation, will reduce the\n      memory/cognitive problems in AD patients. The effects of the combination therapy will be\n      compared to galantamine effects alone.\n\n      As a secondary hypothesis, it is proposed that a combination treatment with galantamine plus\n      memantine could conceivably slow disease progression and/or delay the progression of\n      dementia in probable AD. It is reasonable to assume that the effect will be clearer with a\n      combination therapy (galantamine, memantine) than with cholinesterase inhibitors alone which\n      have been evaluated in long-term clinical trials (rivastigmine, donepezil, galantamine). To\n      corroborate a potential disease modifying effect and to more reliably separate it from a\n      purely symptomatic effect, the disease progress will not only be tracked by clinical\n      measures (CDR rating), but also by using volumetric MRI techniques. Fox et al. have\n      developed a sensitive method to follow changes in overall brain volume over time. In\n      'normal' ageing about 0.2%/year (SD 0.3%) change in brain volume is documented, whereas in\n      AD, changes of 2.8%/year (SD 1%) are measured. People 'at risk' for developing AD show\n      changes of about 1.5%/year. Recently it was established that rates of hippocampal atrophy\n      correlate with change in clinical status in ageing ('conversion') and AD. Overall, brain\n      atrophy or MRI delineated hippocampal volumes and memory decline seem to be clearly linked.\n      The project will prospectively investigate the validity of investigations of hippocampal\n      volume in assessing therapeutic effects in AD. MR-proton-spectroscopy provides consistent\n      evidence that the neuronal marker Nacetylaspartat (NAA) is reduced in AD, whereas the role\n      of myo-inositol, choline and creatine is less clear. NAA is thought to be present\n      exclusively in neurons in gray matter and in their axonal processes in white matter and not\n      in glial cells. NAA signal loss suggests neuronal loss when it is observed in gray matter\n      and loss of or damage to axonal structures when it is observed in white matter. A\n      correlation of NAA decrease in tissue samples of patients with AD with the number of senile\n      plaques and neurofibrillary tangles was reported. Recent results indicate that the severity\n      of dementia in patients with AD is positively correlated with the decrease in NAA/Cr only in\n      the parietal cortex and in the temporal lobe. These data are consistent with the observation\n      that the amount of synaptic loss is the dominant indicator of dementia in AD. The cognitive\n      decline in patients with AD may be linked with a neuronal loss or dysfunction preferentially\n      in the temporoparietal association cortex. This project will prospectively investigate the\n      validity of spectroscopic abnormalities in assessing therapeutic effects in AD.\n\n      The primary objective of this trial is to establish the hypothesis that a combination of\n      galantamine plus memantine improves memory/cognitive performance to a larger extent than\n      galantamine monotherapy in AD subjects after one year of double-blind treatment.\n\n      Memory/cognitive performance will be assessed with the ADAS-cog/11. The confirmatory\n      statistical assessment of this hypothesis will be based on the change of the ADAS-cog/11\n      from baseline to the end of the treatment period.\n\n      Additional endpoint variables to be assessed in an exploratory manner in parallel to the\n      ADAS-cog are:\n\n        -  Preservation of functionality as assessed using the ADCS-ADL/AD scale.\n\n        -  Global rating of dementia as assessed using the CDR rating instrument.\n\n        -  Neuropsychiatric symptoms as assessed using the NPI rating instrument.\n\n        -  Resource utilization as assessed using the RUD rating instrument.\n\n        -  Caregiver burden as assessed using the burden interview (BI).\n\n        -  Safety with adverse event reports, laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical\n           examination and ECG\n\n      The secondary hypothesis states that the combination therapy with galantamine plus memantine\n      is more effective than galantamine alone in delaying clinical progression of dementia in\n      this population over an observation period of one year. Global severity of dementia will be\n      assessed with the CDR scale.\n\n      Supplementary endpoint criteria for this hypothesis are:\n\n        -  Reduction in the rate of serial MRI determined brain (hippocampal) atrophy and of\n           MRS-based parameters.\n\n        -  Safety with adverse event reports, laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical\n           examination and ECG.\n\n      Further analyses of sub-groups (e.g., determined by biological variables) or biological\n      outcome measures investigated by the diagnostic module with respect to the above measures\n      are planned."
