(Stratum of patients currently taking\n           EIAEDs closed to accrual as of 05/15/2003 for phase I and phase II)\n\n        -  Determine angiogenic activity in vivo using functional neuro-imaging studies and in\n           vitro with assays of serum angiogenic peptides.\n\n        -  Determine the efficacy of this drug, in terms of 6-month progression-free survival and\n           objective tumor response, in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to\n      concurrent enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drug use (yes [stratum closed to accrual as of\n      05/15/2003 for phase I and phase II] vs no).\n\n        -  Phase I (patients with glioma or meningioma) Patients in cohorts 1 and 2 receive oral\n           imatinib mesylate (STI571) once daily on days 1-28. Patients in cohorts 3-5 receive\n           oral STI571 twice daily on days 1 and 3-28 of the first course and on days 1-28 of\n           subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression\n           or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of STI571 until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n        -  Phase II (patients with glioma) (glioblastoma multiforme patients excluded as of\n           05/15/2003) Patients receive oral STI571 at the MTD determined in phase I, 1-2 times\n           daily for 4 weeks. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression\n           or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for phase I of the study within 6\n      months and a total of 39 patients will be accrued for phase II of the study within 6-8\n      months. (Glioblastoma multiforme patients excluded from phase II as of 05/13/2003)."
