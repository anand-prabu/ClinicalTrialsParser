Cytarabine is to be administered approximately 30 minutes before PD-616. In Phase 1 part, the starting dose of PD-616 is 0.0875 mg/m2, with sequential increments of 0.0375 mg/m2, to 0.125, and 0.1625 mg/m2. The dose of PD-616 to be administered in Phase 2 part will be the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)determined from Phase 1 part of the study."

The safety and PK profiles as well as the preliminary efficacy of PD-616 in\n      combination with cytarabine also will be examined (secondary objectives). Approximately 21\n      patients are planned to be enrolled in Part 1.\n\n      After provision of written informed consent, patients are to be evaluated for study\n      eligibility during the Screening period which should be within 14 days before the first day\n      of study drug administration (Cycle 1, Day 1 [C1D1]; Baseline). Patients who are determined\n      to be eligible, based on Screening assessments, will be enrolled in the study on C1D1, which\n      is the first day of study drug administration.\n\n      Part 2 of this study (Phase 2 portion) will commence with approval of the Safety Review\n      Committee (SRC) after identification of the MTD, or if the MTD is not established, the\n      maximum feasible dose has been evaluated in Part 1.  Twelve additional patients will be\n      enrolled and treated with PD-616 at the MTD (or other biologically relevant dose) in\n      combination with low-dose cytarabine according to the same schedule as in Part 1. The safety\n      profile, PK, and efficacy of the study drug combination will be further investigated in Part\n      2 of this study.\n\n      Each cycle of treatment consists of a treatment period (D1 through D12) and a rest period\n      (D13 through D28). During the treatment period, patients are required to return to the study\n      center on D1 through D5 and D8 through D12 for study drug to be administered and evaluations\n      to be performed. During the rest period, patients are required to return to the study center\n      at least once a week for study evaluations. In addition, patients are required to be\n      evaluated for peripheral blasts by flow cytometry in the last week of each cycle (D22 to\n      D28) and to receive bone marrow examination in the last week (D22 to D28) of C1.  Patients\n      with evidence of complete response (CR) in peripheral blood by flow cytometry are to have a\n      repeat bone marrow examination performed to confirm CR.\n\n      All patients are to attend the Study Drug Discontinuation Visit within 3 days after\n      discontinuing study drug. Thereafter, patients will enter the post-study period and be\n      followed monthly (\u00b13 days), starting 30\u00b13 days after last study drug administration, through\n      1 year post-C1D1. During the post-study period, patients who discontinue for reasons other\n      than progressive disease (PD) also will have follow-up blood samples collected for\n      evaluation of changes in the percentage of blasts every month until PD or receipt of\n      alternative therapy, whichever occurs first, up to 1 year post-C1D1. During the post-study\n      period, patients with evidence of CR in peripheral blood by flow cytometry are to have a\n      repeat bone marrow examination performed to confirm CR."
