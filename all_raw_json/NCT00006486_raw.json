Determine the objective response rate in patients treated with this drug.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified\n      according to time from diagnosis of metastatic disease to study entry (fewer than 24 months\n      vs 24 months or more).\n\n      Patients receive oral carboxyamidotriazole (CAI) daily for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats for 4\n      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 4 courses,\n      patients experiencing complete or partial response continue treatment until disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients with stable disease are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n      Arm I: Patients receive oral CAI as above.\n\n      Arm II: Patients receive a placebo.\n\n      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for at least 4 courses in the absence of disease progression\n      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients experiencing disease progression are unblinded and those\n      on placebo begin oral CAI as above.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 335 patients will be accrued for this study within 15-25\n      months."
