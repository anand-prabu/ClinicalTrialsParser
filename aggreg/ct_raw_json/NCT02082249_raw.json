Alternatively, subjects who (i) participated in\n             the Phase 2 Study M12-925 (ii) would, in the opinion of the Investigator, benefit\n             from ABT-SLV187 treatment in the Study M12-923, (iii) did not discontinue the M12-925\n             Study due to safety reason, and (iv) meet all entry requirements.\n\n          2. The subject must be able to understand the nature of the study and must provide\n             written informed consent prior to the conduct of any study procedures (including any\n             changes occurring in the subject's current therapeutic regimen).\n\n          3. The subject must be willing to continue on treatment.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Subject is enrolled in another clinical trial.\n\n          2. Psychiatric, neurological or behavioral disorders that may interfere with the ability\n             of subjects to give informed consent, or interfere with the conduct of the study.\n\n          3. Medical, laboratory, or surgical issues deemed by the Investigator to be clinically\n             significant and in the opinion of the PI, would be a contraindication to continued\n             levodopa therapy.\n\n          4. Uncooperative attitude or reasonable likelihood for non-compliance with the protocol.\n\n          5. Subject has current significant suicidal ideation as evidenced by answering \"yes\" to\n             questions 4 or 5 on the suicidal ideation portion of the Columbia-Suicide Severity\n             Rating Scale completed at the Week 12 Visit of Study M12-921 or at the Baseline Visit\n             of the current study for M12-925 study subjects.\n\n          6.
