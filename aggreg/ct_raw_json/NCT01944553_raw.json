            "textblock": "The medical device subject of this research is the surgical robot ROSA\u2122 designed for cranial\n      surgery, and used here in another application, spinal surgery - more specifically for the\n      placement of pedicle screws.\n\n      It is intended for spine surgeons to treat diseases requiring the placement of pedicle\n      screws through posterior open surgery approach or minimally invasive surgery.\n\n      The system allows the precise guidance of instruments as defined by the surgeon on patient\n      radiological images. The expected performance is a good rate of pedicle screws placement,\n      increasing the performance observed with the conventional method. This system can be\n      transported from one operating room to another, and stored in a storage room.\n\n      It interfaces with the most common intra -operative surgical imaging systems (mobile C-arms\n      available at Montpellier University Hospital). Further versions of the device will enable\n      the use of 3D intra-operative imaging systems such as the O-arm from Medtronic.\n\n      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of using the robot ROSA\u2122 for\n      pedicle screws placement. In this study, the robot will be used with an open surgery\n      approach, which is a first step in demonstrating the potential of the robot."
