  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Capsaicin is a TRPV1 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1) agonist, causing pain upon
      application.  The investigators wish to determine whether mannitol blocks the effect of
      capsaicin application.  As both cream bases are identical and mannitol addition is the only
      difference between the creams, if the mannitol cream is more effective in blocking the
      effect of capsaicin on the TRPV1 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1) receptor, the
      investigators will have established that mannitol down-regulates or blocks the TRPV1
      (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1)  receptor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Capsaicin cream, which  stimulates the TRPV1 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1)
      receptor,  causing a burning sensation,  will be applied to both halves of the upper lip
      until a burning sensation with 8/10 intensity  on an NRS (Visual Analog Scale) scale is
      experienced  or five minutes have elapsed.   Following this,   the capsaicin cream will be
      wiped off  and 30% mannitol in vehicle cream ( isopropyl palmitate, caprylic capric
      triglyceride, propylene glycol, ceteareth 20, cetearyl alcohol, glyceryl stearate,
      polyethylene glycol 100 stearate, dimethicone, octyldodecanol, lecithin, ethylhexyl
      glycerin and phenoxy ethanol)  will be applied to one half of the upper lip, and vehicle
      cream  alone will be applied to the other half.   Cream assignment will be randomized and
      neither the subject nor the person applying the cream will know which half upper lip has
      which cream.  Every minute for 10 minutes,  the heat sensation  felt in each half upper lip
      will be measured,  using a  visual scale from 0 to 10.  A repeated measures analysis of
      variance will compare the NRS (Visual Analog Scale) scores from the 30% mannitol cream, to
      the NRS (Visual Analog Scale)scores from the vehicle cream. Significance will be accepted if
      P less than .05.

    <description>Every minute after capsaicin cream application,  subject will indicate NRS (numerical rating scale)heat score.   When the score has reached 8/10 or after five minutes,  the cream will be removed.  The time needed to reach 8/10 heat score and the heat score achieved, or the  score at five minutes will be recorded.  Following application of the test creams, NRS (Visual Analog Scale) heat scores will be recorded once per minute  for each side  for 10 minutes.</description>
