To determine the incidence of complete and partial responses to arsenic trioxide in\n      patients with previously treated low-grade lymphomas.\n\n      III. To evaluate basic science correlates of arsenic trioxide activity in order to improve\n      our understanding of the mechanism of action for arsenic trioxide in patients with low-grade\n      lymphomas.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label study.\n\n      Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21\n      days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease\n      progression. Patients with responding or stable disease may receive 6 additional courses.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years."
