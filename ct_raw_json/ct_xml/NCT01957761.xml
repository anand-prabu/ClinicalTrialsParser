      Objectives:

        1. Describe the molecular epidemiology of Clostridium Difficile infection in children in
           the Chicago area.

        2. Determine the clinical spectrum and risk factors for Clostridium Difficile infection
           secondary to particular endemic strains in children.

        3. Define the risk factors for recurrent and community-associated Clostridium Difficile
           infection in children.

    <description>Stool samples taken from patients with Clostridium Difficile Infections infection at the time of diagnosis will be assessed by restriction endonuclease analysis to determine strain type.  In order to study the relationship between strain type and outcome of their infection (e.g, treatment failure, recurrence, complication of illness), patients will be followed throughout their illness and for 8 weeks after developing their infection.</description>
