However, the study investigated the effect of various\n      cleaning strategies on symptoms of gingival inflammation, not specifically focusing on the\n      comparison of the efficiency of removal of biofilm from the manual toothbrush and electric\n      toothbrush. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the\n      electric brush on and off the removal of dental plaque in subjects with cerebral palsy\n      compared to manual toothbrush. The secondary objective was to characterize the study as\n      socioeconomic population."
