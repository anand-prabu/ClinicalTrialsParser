Computer systems\n      that allow doctors to create a 3-dimensional picture of the tumor in order to plan treatment\n      may result in more effective radiation therapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well radiation therapy that has been planned\n      with a computer works in treating patients with prostate cancer."

Thereafter, patients are followed every 6 months for a total of 3\n      years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study."
