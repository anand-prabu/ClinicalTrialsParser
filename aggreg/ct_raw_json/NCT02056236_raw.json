            "textblock": "Rationale: Electroencephalographic status epilepticus is described in 9-35% of patients with\n      postanoxic encephalopathy after cardiac arrest and is associated with case fatality rates of\n      90-100%. It is unclear whether (some) electroencephalographic seizure patterns in these\n      patients represent a condition which can be treated with antiepileptic drugs to improve\n      outcome, or have to be regarded as an expression of severe ischemic damage, in which\n      treatment with antiepileptic would be futile. Therefore, both treatment with and treatment\n      without antiepileptic drugs are considered standard modalities in these patients. We aim to\n      compare these standard strategies and hypothesize that aggressive and early treatment of\n      electro-encephalographic status epilepticus with antiepileptic drugs improves outcome as\n      compared to treatment without these drugs.\n\n      Objective: To estimate the effect of medical treatment of electro-encephalographic status\n      epilepticus on neurological outcome of patients with postanoxic encephalopathy after cardiac\n      arrest\n\n      Study design: We will perfrom a multicenter clinical trial with randomized treatment\n      allocation, open label treatment and blinded endpoint evaluation (PROBE design). The\n      intervention contrast will be aggressive medical treatment vs. no treatment of\n      electroencephalographic status epilepticus, in addition to standard best medical management\n      of comatose patients after cardiac arrest, including mild therapeutic hypothermia.\n\n      Study population: The study population will consist of adult patients with postanoxic\n      encephalopathy after cardiac arrest, admitted to the intensive care unit, with\n      electroencephalographic status epilepticus on continuous EEG, who are eligile for inclusion\n      in this trial.\n\n      Intervention: Treatment of electroencephalographic status epilepticus will be based on the\n      recommendations for the treatment of status epilepticus by the \"Nederlandse Vereninging voor\n      Neurologie\". The objective of the treatment will be to suppress all epileptiform activity in\n      the EEG. If the electroencephalographic status epilepticus will return after tapering\n      sedative treatment at 24 hours, the procedure will be repeated. If the status will return\n      after 2 x 24 hours, it will be considered refractory.\n\n      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome measure will be neurological outcome\n      defined as the score on the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) at 3 months dichotomized as\n      good (CPC 1-2 = no or moderate neurological disability) and poor (CPC 3-5 = severe\n      disability, coma, or death).\n\n      Sample size: With a presumed reduction of poor outcome of 7%, from 99% - 92%, alpha of 5%,\n      power of 80%, one tailed testing, and one interim analysis by an independent data safety and\n      monitoring board, the objected number of inclusions is 172. With an estimation of an\n      incidence of electroencephalographic status epilepticus of 20% in patients with postanoxic\n      coma, the total number of patients to be monitored will be 860.\n\n      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation: Medical treatment\n      of electroencephalographic status epilepticus may modify the high risk of death. Otherwise,\n      this treatment of electroencephalographic status epilepticus may lead to prolonged\n      hospitalization of several days of comatose patients that otherwise would have died. The\n      risk of an increase of morbidity or mortality on the longer term is considered negligible."
