Fifty non-treatment\n      seeking heavy drinkers (NTSHDs, N=50), will undergo three test days each: once after\n      receiving a placebo medication, once after receiving moderate dose perampanel, and once\n      after receiving a higher dose of perampanel. This experiment is the first step in a series\n      of expedient studies that will rapidly determine perampanel's potential as a treatment for\n      alcohol dependence. If findings show perampanel reduces the rewarding and reinforcing\n      properties of alcohol in the laboratory setting (in humans), it would provide a strong\n      rationale for clinical treatment trials with this medication. This approach is innovative\n      because it tests a highly novel AMPA-R antagonist for the treatment of alcoholism, and uses\n      a state-of-the-art computer assisted IV alcohol pump infusion system (called CAIS) to reduce\n      variability in blood alcohol concentrations, thus improving the data quality."
