Compare parental ratings of children's behavior to DXA-measured changes in body\n           composition;\n\n        3. Compare measurements of scale weight, height, waist/hip ratios and BMI with\n           DXA-measured changes in body composition;\n\n        4. Develop a logarithm formula with the use of anthropometric measurements and parental\n           ratings to predict body composition changes"
