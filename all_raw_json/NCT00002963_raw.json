Photodynamic therapy using aminolevulinic acid cream may be\n      effective in treating patients with skin cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well photodynamic therapy works in\n      treating patients with skin cancer."

Patients are stratified according to lesion type\n      (superficial basal cell carcinoma (BCC) vs nodular BCC vs squamous cell carcinoma). Patients\n      within each group are randomized to receive one of two application times: 4-5 or 20-24 hours\n      in duration.\n\n      Aminolevulinic acid is topically applied either in a cream mixture or an alcohol base and an\n      occlusive dressing placed over the lesion. After the randomized treatment duration has\n      expired, the dressing is removed and quantitative protoporphyrin IX fluorescence\n      measurements from the tumor and surrounding skin are mapped using a fluorometer. Routine\n      surgical excision is then performed on the carcinoma.\n\n      Patients return after one to two weeks for a follow-up examination and suture removal.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 54 patients will be accrued within 10 years."
