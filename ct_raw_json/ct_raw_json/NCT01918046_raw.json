Blood and urine\n      samples will be obtained from all patients in the study for future measurement of both MIOX\n      and creatinine concentrations in the same sample at each of the following time points:\n\n        -  Baseline (within 24 hours prior to the start of surgery)\n\n        -  Immediately following cardiopulmonary bypass (time 0), 3 (\u00b1 1), 6 (\u00b1 2), 12 (+/-2) 18\n           (\u00b1 2), and 24 (\u00b1 2) hours following cardiopulmonary bypass.\n\n      Urine and lithium heparin anti-coagulated blood will be collected at each time point.  Blood\n      and urine samples will be immediately centrifuged, aliquoted, and frozen at -80oC prior to\n      analysis.  Samples will be stored and analyzed at Washington University School of Medicine.\n\n      The results of these assessments will be blinded to the medical team during the study and\n      will not impact the medical management of the patient.\n\n      Serum creatinine measurements obtained by the medical team as part of routine care both\n      pre-operatively and post-operatively as well as any additional post-operative renal insults,\n      the development of oliguria, need for a nephrology consultation, length of intensive care\n      unit (ICU) stay, initiation of dialysis and mortality will be recorded through Day 10.\n      Patients will be followed throughout their hospital stay, which on average is expected to be\n      about 10 days.\n\n      The statistical analysis will evaluate the correlation of plasma and urine MIOX (absolute\n      and change from baseline) with parameters indicative of renal injury (e.g., increases in\n      plasma creatinine through Day 5 and development of oliguria, need for a nephrology consult\n      or initiation of dialysis through Day 10). These results will assist in establishing the\n      sensitivity and specificity of plasma and urine MIOX for the detection of meaningful kidney\n      injury following cardiopulmonary bypass surgery."
