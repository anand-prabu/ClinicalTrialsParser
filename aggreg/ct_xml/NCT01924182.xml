  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares two different ways to treat pain. The two ways are:

        1. continuing to take current pain medication(s) or

        2. receiving morphine, a pain medication from a drug pump (a system to deliver drug to
           your body) that is implanted.

      None of the procedures or products used in this study are experimental. The length the study
      will be about 25 weeks (between 5½ to 6½ months). The purpose of this study is to compare
      pain and opioid side effects between people who get a drug pump and people who do not get a
      drug pump that will stay on their current pain medication treatment.

    <description>Subjects randomized to the IT group (Intrathecal morphine sulfate/SynchroMed Infusion System) will have a test injection or infusion of intrathecal morphine to check for pain control and make sure there are no negative reactions. If the test is successful, subjects in the IT group will have a pump and spinal catheter implanted. These subjects will stop using all other pain medications and start using only intrathecal morphine for pain control.</description>
