To this end, we will implement an innovative model of enhanced\n      early integrative palliative care services (EPC) for persons newly diagnosed with AIDS.\n      Patients will be recruited from either the inpatient service or outpatient infectious\n      disease program (IDP) at the Grady Health System (GHS) in Atlanta, Georgia. The AIDS EPC\n      Package includes use of motivational interviewing (MI) to facilitate adjustment to disease\n      and advance care planning decision making. The project has three specific aims:\n\n      AIM 1. Conduct a research clinical trial (RCT) to examine the efficacy of the AIDS EPC\n      Package intervention vs. standard HIV care (SOC) and compare outcomes at 12 months post\n      baseline. Our hypothesis is that those in the AIDS EPC group will have:\n\n      i. Better clinical outcomes: a lower one year mortality, higher proportion who initiate\n      antiretroviral therapy (ART), higher proportion with virologic suppression, higher CD4 gain,\n      fewer opportunistic infections (OI), fewer hospitalizations, lower depression scores, and\n      better symptom management (including cognitive dysfunction).\n\n      ii. Better psychosocial outcomes:  Better coping skills, higher perceived social support,\n      higher spirituality, higher levels of self-advocacy, lower proportion who report substance\n      use.\n\n      iii. Better Quality of Life (QOL) and a higher proportion who report advance care planning\n      activities: named a surrogate; set personal goals regarding life saving measures; and\n      discussed these goals with a surrogate.\n\n      SECONDARY OUTCOMES:\n\n      AIM 2. Evaluate the cost effectiveness and cost utility of the AIDS EPC Package compared to\n      SOC where the   outcomes are valued as survival and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)\n      respectively.\n\n      AIM 3.  Promote engagement and retention in HIV care as evidenced by attending a greater\n      proportion of scheduled appointments and reporting higher satisfaction with care compared to\n      SOC."
