  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this exploratory study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of
      nicotine for the candidate modified risk tobacco product THS 2.1 and for conventional
      cigarettes (CC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This 2-period 2-sequence cross-over clinical study intends to explore the profile of
      nicotine uptake (rate and extent of nicotine absorbed and associated variability) in healthy
      smokers switching from (CC) to THS 2.1 (single or ad libitum use) compared to smokers
      continuing to use CC, as a comparator. This study will serve to optimize blood sampling
      schedules and sample size estimation for further studies. This study will also provide
      preliminary information on the relationship between nicotine absorption and urge to
      smoke/withdrawal symptoms when using THS 2.1 as compared to CC, as well as the safety
      profile, which is related to the use of THS 2.1.

      After screening, enrolled subjects will be admitted to the clinic for 8 days. This study
      duration includes 2 consecutive periods. Each period consists of 1 day for single use of the
      product preceded by a 24-hour nicotine deprivation, and 1 day for ad libitum product use.
      After leaving the clinic, the subjects will be followed up for safety over a period of 7
      days.

      This clinical study will be conducted in compliance with International Conference on
      Harmonisation of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use
      (ICH Good Clinical Practice), the Declaration of Helsinki as amended in 2008, and the
      applicable regulatory requirements.
