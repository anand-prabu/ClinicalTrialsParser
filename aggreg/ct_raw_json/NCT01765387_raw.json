Participants\n      are allocated to the control or intervention group following an order of arrival to the\n      study.\n\n      The spinning session is performed using the same protocol for all participants after 24h\n      physical rest.  They were asked to perform this session as a regular spinning class. The\n      session is carried out in the afternoon (room temperature 22\u00b13.5\u00b0C) on a modified spinning\n      bike (Keiser\u00ae, M3). They are allowed to drink water during the session and performed the\n      test, while they listen a compilation of music that lasted 50min composed of 9 tracks.\n\n      Each track corresponds to a specific phase of the spinning session. The phases being labeled\n      as warm-up, sitting, seated climbing, jumping, and running, based on the official spinning\n      program manual.  Some phases are repeated during the session, the compilation being\n      purposely designed for beginner practitioners of a spinning class. In addition to the music\n      protocol, the participants are asked to maintain a pedal stroke cadence that had previously\n      been established for each track. For the resistance applied to the flywheel, the\n      participants are free to adjust it according to their sensation and interpretation of the\n      spinning session.\n\n      Recovery Procedures\n\n      A cycle of 3 Vichy shower and whirlpool baths are applied during 30-minutes period.
