    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate residual limb circulation and skin health associated
      with the use of a prosthetic vacuum socket. A conventional non-vacuum prosthetic socket will
      be compared to a vacuum prosthetic socket.

      The prosthetic suspension plays a pivotal role in an amputee's comfort. It can also
      significantly impact an amputee's limb health. If the prosthesis is not held securely to the
      amputee's limb, relative movement between the limb and prosthetic interface can cause
      bruising, skin irritation and skin breakdown. These poor outcomes are uncomfortable and can
      lead to much more serious health conditions. A positive solution to creating secure and
      comfortable suspension is the use of a vacuum suspension socket. The vacuum pressure assists
      in preventing movement in the socket. The clinical benefits associated with vacuum
      suspension include volume retention, increased proprioception, secure suspension, and
      frequently reported observations of wound healing. However, the long term effects of vacuum
      suspension on circulation remain undetermined or undocumented.

      This study examines a vacuum suspension system on the health of the residual limb (amputated
      limb). A vacuum socket creates a vacuum between the rigid prosthetic socket and prosthetic
      liner which is sealed to the socket. Therefore, vacuum is not directly applied to the skin
      of the residual limb.
