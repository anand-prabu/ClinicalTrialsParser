  <study_design>Allocation: Randomized, Endpoint Classification: Safety/Efficacy Study, Intervention Model: Single Group Assignment, Masking: Double Blind (Subject, Outcomes Assessor), Primary Purpose: Treatment</study_design>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The detection of new morphological brain injury with new hyper-intense DW-MRI cerebral lesions on the post-treatment compared to the pretreatment MRI imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative day 1-3</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>MRI of the brain is obtained at the same time as clinical exams. Scans are performed on a 1.5-T MR unit and a circular polarized head coil. The imaging protocol includes a transversal DW, single shot echo-planar sequence of the whole brain. Diffusion images are processed to generate isotopic apparent diffusion coefficient maps using dedicated software allowing for proper classification of the lesions. Transversal fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and transversal T2-weighted turbo spin-echo sequences are also performed. Slice thickness is 5mm for all sequences. Scans are read by an experienced neuroradiologist blinded to the clinical data. The presence, number, volume and location of all new focal diffusion abnormalities were recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ipsilateral stroke (ischaemic stroke, intracerebral bleeding or both, with symptoms lasting more than 24 h) or death between treatment and 30 days after treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Stroke and transient ischaemic attack is defined according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC) recommendation. In case of stroke, the modified Rankin scale (mRS) is assessed to categorize the patient's level of functional independence during daily activities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Neurocognitive function postoperatively compared to preoperative status</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline before treatment and at 1-3 days after treatment, at discharge and at 3 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Examinations were performed at baseline, pre-discharge and 3 months thereafter. Neurological status is assessed by a detailed clinical examination protocol. Cognitive function is evaluated using three different standardized neuropsychological tests and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).</description>

    <description>The Embol-X system is positioned within the aorta  to capture emboli, such as blood clots or tissue fragments, to prevent them from traveling through a patient's bloodstream during TAVI. The EMBOL-X system features a small, expandable, polyester-mesh filtration system that is placed inside the aorta above the aortic clamp during open-heart surgery or transaortic TAVI procedures, where it captures particles in the bloodstream that otherwise might have remained in the patient's circulatory system. A recent presentation characterized the removal of aortic cross-clamps as creating in some patients &quot;embolic showers&quot; which have the potential to cause neurocognitive complications, stroke and other organ damage. In documented procedures, 97% of EMBOL-X system filters showed detectable captured embolic matter, visible proof that the system is removing potentially dangerous emboli from the bloodstream.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area &lt;0.8 cm2) are
        considered candidates for TAVI (TAVR) if they have a logistic European System for Cardiac
        Operative Risk Evaluation score (EuroSCORE) ≥15% or surgery is deemed to be at excessive
        risk because of comorbidities and other risk factors not being captured by these scoring
        systems. Indication for TAVI in the individual patient is discussed in a consensus
        conference of cardiologists and cardiac surgeons, and patient's or physician's preference
        alone is not considered adequate for decision making. The performance of TAVI in these
        patients is approved by the local authorities. All patients have to agree to participate
        in the study, and written informed consent is obtained.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients are excluded from TAVI (TAVR) in the presence of any of the following conditions:

          -  bicuspid aortic valve

          -  aortic annulus diameter ≤18 or ≥27 mm

          -  procelain aorta

          -  unprotected left main disease

          -  recent myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular event

          -  sepsis or active endocarditis

          -  severe aortic atheroma

          -  left ventricular or atrial thrombus

          -  active peptic ulcer

          -  bleeding diathesis

          -  hypersensitivity to antiplatelet therapy
