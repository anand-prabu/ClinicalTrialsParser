Drugs such as\n      carbogen and niacinamide may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. It is not\n      yet known whether radiation therapy is more effective with or without carbogen and\n      niacinamide in treating patients who have bladder cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy with\n      or without carbogen and niacinamide in treating patients who have locally advanced bladder\n      cancer."

Patients are randomized to 1 of 2\n      treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive radical radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 4-6.4\n           weeks. Patients also receive oral niacinamide once daily 1.5-2 hours before initiation\n           of each radiotherapy dose and carbogen through a closed breathing system (face mask\n           with a tight air seal or a mouthpiece with nasal clip) once daily beginning 5 minutes\n           before initiation and continuing until completion of each radiotherapy dose.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive radiotherapy as in arm I. Quality of life is assessed at\n           baseline; at 4 weeks; at 3, 6, and 12 months; and then annually for 4 years.\n\n      Patients are followed at 8 and 12 weeks; at 6, 9, and 12 months; and then every 6 months for\n      4 years.\n\n      Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 330 patients (165 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
