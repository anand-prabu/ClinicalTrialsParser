    <textblock>
      This study is a regulatory post-marketing surveillance in Japan, and it is a local
      prospective and observational study of patients who have received Fosrenol.

      The objective of this research is to collect information on the safety of Fosrenol  after
      its launching, which means collecting information on adverse events, especially adverse
      events in the digestive system including constipation and serious adverse events, and
      adverse drug reactions when the drug is administered to the below-mentioned target patients
      for six months.

      The secondary objective is to collect information on the safety of the drug when
      administered for more than six months, which means collecting information on the safety of
      the drug when administered for up to 12 months to the target patients who have already been
      treated with the drug for six months. And also if at the time of 12 months after
      administration of Lanthanum carbonate the dialysis is not conducted, extending its'
      administration will be continued until conduction of dialysis, or until Sept. 30, 2015. The
      efficacy of fosrenol is evaluated by observing the serum P(phosphorus) level and serum PTH
      (parathyroid hormone) level change.
