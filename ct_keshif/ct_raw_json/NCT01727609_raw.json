            "textblock": "Survival of preterm infants has increased greatly over the years, so a major aim now is to\n      improve the long term outlook for these babies and to avoid serious complications. The way\n      babies are fed in early life affects short and long-term health and survival.\n\n      Because the bowels of preterm infants have not matured, they cannot digest large volumes of\n      milk feeds straight away. Until the gut matures, nutrition is provided by intravenous drip\n      while the amount of milk given is gradually increased over time. Increasing the amount of\n      milk rapidly may increase the risk of gut complications. Increasing the amount of milk given\n      more slowly means that intravenous nutrition is needed for longer; there is an associated\n      risk of infection proportional to the time the intravenous line is present in the\n      bloodstream of these infants. Despite the importance of milk feeding preterm infants, there\n      have been few studies to inform how best to balance these risks, and what the best way to\n      increase feeds in these infants is - this study sets out to address this missing\n      information.\n\n      This study will compare two different rates of increase of milk feeds, one 'fast' and one\n      'slow', both within rates currently used in UK neonatal units with the aim to find out if\n      either rate gives better outcomes for the infants. Investigators will measure a variety of\n      outcomes, such as survival without disability, infection, bowel problems, growth and\n      long-term physical and mental development, as well as the impact on families and the NHS,\n      including costs.\n\n      The study will be led by an established team of researchers who have run similar studies\n      before, and will use an established network of neonatal units that have taken part in\n      previous studies. Investigators are confident that there will be enough families wishing to\n      take part in this study."
