            "textblock": "The chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the\n      airways characterized by fixed airflow obstruction, with important systemic co-morbidities.\n      The obstruction is usually progressive and irreversible despite chronic therapy. Cigarette\n      smoking is the major cause of this disease. COPD is an important cause of morbidity and\n      mortality worldwide. Numerous studies have shown that oxidative stress plays a key role in\n      the pathogenesis of COPD. In particular, the active metabolites of oxygen such as superoxide\n      anion and the hydroxyl radical are unstable molecules that can trigger significant oxidative\n      processes at the cellular level. These molecules can alter the extracellular matrix\n      remodeling, cell respiration, cell proliferation, cellular repair and the immune response in\n      the lung. All these events are key elements in the pathogenesis of COPD.\n\n      Currently available treatments for COPD (i.e. long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled\n      corticosteroids) have not demonstrated a significant in vivo antioxidant effect. The thermal\n      inhalation treatments are a therapeutic strategy used since many years in an empirical way\n      in patients with COPD. Indeed, the evidence of effectiveness of spa treatment in patients\n      with COPD are very limited.\n\n      The aim of this in vivo study is to evaluate the modulatory effects of sulfur thermal water\n      inhalation on oxidant stress in the airways of stable COPD patients."
