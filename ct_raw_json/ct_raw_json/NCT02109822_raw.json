These pulmonary\n      exacerbations (PEs) are treated with varying antibiotics for varying time periods based on\n      needs determined by individual patients, their families, and the health care providers.\n      Cystic fibrosis pulmonary guidelines for the treatment of PE published by the Cystic\n      Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) in 2009 provided recommendations for treatment and also identified\n      key questions for which additional studies were needed.\n\n      Standard treatment for PE involves many facets including selection of antibiotics, duration\n      of use, and outcomes that define treatment success.  Understanding current treatment\n      practices and measures of treatment success are needed before a study can be designed to\n      define optimal treatment strategies.\n\n      This is a multi-center, prospective, observational study designed to prospectively follow\n      patients with CF that are initially admitted to the hospital for treatment of a pulmonary\n      exacerbation."
