Patients enrolled in the study\n      will be chronically infected with HCV of GT1a (n=10) or GT1b (n=20), either treatment-naive\n      patients (ie, patients never having received PegIFN [Pegylated interferon alpha-2a at 180\n      mcg subcutaneous once a week], RBV, or any other approved or investigational treatment for\n      chronic HCV infection) or patients who are relapsers to prior treatment with PegIFN /RBV\n      (ie, \"relapsers\" are patients with HCV ribonucleic acid [RNA] undetectable at the last on\n      treatment measurement of a prior PegIFN based regimen of at least 24 weeks, but HCV RNA\n      detectable within 1 year after the last medication intake). Patients in this first part of\n      the study will be divided over 4 panels: Panel 1 will consist of 10 chronic HCV GT1a\n      infected treatment-naive patients/prior relapsers who will receive 12 weeks of treatment\n      with TMC435 + TMC647055 + low-dose ritonavir and ribavirin. Panel 2 will consist of 20\n      chronic HCV GT1b infected treatment-naive patients/ prior relapsers who will be randomly\n      allocated to 2 arms in a 1:1 ratio. Arm 1 (N=10) will receive TMC435 + TMC647055 + low-dose\n      ritonavir and ribavirin. Arm 2 (N=10) will receive TMC435 + TMC647055 + low-dose ritonavir.\n      Panel 3 will consist of 16 chronic HCV GT1a or GT1b infected treatment-na\u00efve patients/prior\n      relapsers who will be allocated to 2 arms: 8 HCV GT1a patients in arm 1 and 8 HCV GT1b\n      patients in arm 2. Patients in Arm 1 will receive 12 weeks of treatment with TMC435 +\n      TMC647055 + low-dose RTV and RBV and patients in Arm 2 will receive 12 weeks of treatment\n      with TMC435 + TMC647055 + low-dose RTV. Panel 4 will consist of 40 chronic HCV GT1a or GT1b\n      infected treatment-na\u00efve patients/prior relapsers who will be allocated to 2 arms: each arm\n      will consist of 20 patients of which at most 8 patients will be infected with HCV GT1b.\n      Patients will be randomized in 1:1 ratio between the 2 arms whereby randomization will be\n      stratified by genotype. Patients in Arm 1 will receive 12 weeks of treatment with TMC435 +\n      TMC647055 + low-dose RTV + GSK2336805.  Patients in Arm 2 will receive 12 weeks of treatment\n      with TMC435 + TMC647055 + low-dose RTV + GSK2336805. The planned duration of the\n      investigational treatment is 12 weeks. Patients in Panels 1, 2, and 3 may receive follow-up\n      treatment with 12 weeks or 36 weeks of PegIFN\u03b1  + RBV; follow-up treatment principles will\n      not apply to Panel 4 as based on available proof of concept data for such combinations, the\n      need for an additional 12 or 36-week PegIFN/RBV follow-up therapy is expected to be very low\n      when evaluating a 12-week regimen of 3 direct acting antiviral agents for treatment of HCV\n      genotype 1 infections. Safety will be monitored throughout the study"
