  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a four-arm randomized trial to compare the effects of supervised aerobic
      training (AT) performed during, after, or during and after (i.e., continuous AT) standard
      primary adjuvant therapy, relative to control in early-stage breast cancer (BC) patients.
      The study team will recruit a total of 160 sedentary women with histologically confirmed
      early-stage BC scheduled to initiate standard adjuvant primary therapy.

    <description>Aerobic Training (AT) will be prescribed based on the guiding American College of Sports Medicine principles with the aim of improving VO2peak. The AT intervention will work toward the target of 3 treadmill walking sessions/week at 60%-85% of baseline VO2peak for 150 mins.wk-1 Walking was chosen because it is the preferred mode of exercise training for BC patients.</description>

    <description>Aerobic Training will be prescribed based on the guiding ASCM principles with the aim of improving VO2peak after the completion of chemotherapy.

    <description>This group will follow the identical aerobic training during and after therapy prescription as described for Groups 1 and 2 for the first 24 weeks (i.e., during therapy). After primary therapy (i.e., at ~24 weeks, T1), the AT prescription will be re-prescribed based on the end of therapy VO2peak assessment (at T1) with the goal of 3 exercise sessions per week, for 30-45 mins/session at 60% to 85% of VO2peak.</description>

          1. sedentary (i.e., &lt;150 min.wk-1 of moderate intensity over the past month, as per ASCM
             guidelines8),

          2. willingness to travel to Duke University Medical Center  as necessitated by
             facility-based intervention sessions, and

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of metastatic disease, and

             patients as recommended by our group (e.g., acute myocardial infarction, room air
             desaturation at rest ≤85%).The investigators have specifically selected subgroup of
             patients who will all receive chemotherapy and radiation therapy to directly address
             the question of safety and impact during therapy. Subjects must not have any of
             following absolute contraindications to maximal exercise testing as recommended by
             the American Thoracic Society and exercise testing guidelines for cancer patients:

               1. acute myocardial infarction (3-5 days),

               2. unstable angina,

               3. uncontrolled arrhythmias causing symptoms or hemodynamic compromise,

               4. syncope,

               6. acute myocarditis or pericarditis,

               7. uncontrolled heart failure,

               8. acute pulmonary embolus or pulmonary infarction,

               9. thrombosis of lower extremities,

              10. suspected dissecting aneurysm,

              11. uncontrolled asthma,

              12. pulmonary edema,

              13. room air desaturation at rest ≤85%,

              14. respiratory failure,

              15. acute noncardiopulmonary disorder that may affect exercise performance or be
                  aggravated by exercise,

              16. mental impairment leading to inability to cooperate, and

              17. extensive bone metastases.

          3. pregnancy
