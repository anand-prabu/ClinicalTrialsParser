The study will also look at how CPI-1189 affects the\n      levels of HIV, T cells (cells in the body that help fight infection), and three anti-HIV\n      drugs (zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir) in the blood.\n\n      Advanced HIV infection can cause AIDS dementia (brain damage due to HIV leading to losses of\n      memory and muscle control). CPI-1189 may be able to postpone AIDS dementia or slow it down."
