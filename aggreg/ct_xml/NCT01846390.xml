  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done because it is not yet known what dose of romidepsin in
      combination with gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin (GDP) can be given safely to
      patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, nor what type and severity of side effects will
      result from the combination of these treatments. This research is also being done because it
      is not clear if the addition of the new drug romidepsin to treatment with GDP can offer
      better results and longer survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose of romidepsin that can safely be given
      in combination with gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin (GDP) without causing very
      severe side effects that are not tolerable. This is done by starting at a dose lower than
      the one that does not cause side effects in animals. Patients are given romidepsin and GDP
      and watched very closely to see what side effects they have and to make sure the side
      effects are not severe. If the side effects are not severe, then more patients are asked to
      join the study and are given a higher dose of romidepsin (with GDP). Patients joining the
      study later on will get higher doses of romidepsin (with GDP) than patients who join
      earlier. This will continue until a dose is found that causes severe but temporary side
      effects. Doses higher than that will not be given.

    <description>Combination of GDP with romidepsin at the maximum tolerated doses of these agents will identify the combination regimen for comparison in the subsequent randomized phase II trial; if romidepsin appears to improve the activity of GDP, then this will move forward to a formal phase III comparison to CHOP.
Primary end points are toxicity, the maximum administered dose and the recommended phase II dose.</description>

             eradicated the virus are eligible.)

          -  Any serious active disease or co-morbid medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or
             psychiatric illness that would prevent the patient from participating (according to
             investigator's decision).
