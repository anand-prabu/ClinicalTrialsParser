Patients receive rituximab IV weekly for 4 weeks.\n      Treatment may be repeated 2 months later in patients with stable disease, partial response,\n      or complete response. Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-25 patients will be accrued for this study."
