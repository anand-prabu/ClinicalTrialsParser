  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the efficacy of 3 fixed doses of brexpiprazole with placebo in subjects with
      agitation associated with dementia of the Alzheimer's type.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral symptoms, such as agitation, are core features in subjects with Alzheimer's
      disease and related dementias and develop in the majority of dementia subjects. The presence
      of agitation in subjects with Alzheimer's disease places a significant burden not only on
      subjects and their caregivers but also on the healthcare system.

      This is a trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of brexpiprazole in the treatment
      of subjects with agitation associated with dementia of the Alzheimer's Type. The trial
      consists of a continuous 12-week double-blind treatment period with a 30-day follow-up. The
      trial population will include male and female subjects between 55 and 90 years of age
      (inclusive), who are residing in a dementia unit, nursing home, assisted living facility, or
      other residential care facility, with a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease.
