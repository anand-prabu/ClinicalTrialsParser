  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tropical fevers have been a diagnostic challenge from the antiquity. Nowadays, despite the
      availability of good diagnostic capacities, undifferentiated febrile illnesses continue to
      be a thorny problem for travel physicians. In developing countries, the scarcity of skilled
      personnel and adequate laboratory facilities makes the differential diagnosis of fevers even
      more complex. Health care workers must often rely on syndrome-oriented empirical approaches
      to treatment and might overestimate or underestimate the likelihood of certain diseases. For
      instance Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) contribute substantially to the burden of
      persistent (more than 1 week) fevers in the Tropics, causing considerable mortality and
      major disability. These diseases are however rarely diagnosed at primary health care (PHC)
      level. The difficulty in establishing the cause of febrile illnesses has resulted in
      omission or delays in treatment, irrational prescriptions with polytherapy, increasing cost
      and development of drug resistance.

      In resource-limited settings, clinical algorithms constitute a valuable aid to health
      workers, as they facilitate the therapeutic decision in the absence of good laboratory
      capacities. There is a critical lack of appropriate diagnostic tools to guide treatment of
      NTDs. While clinical algorithms have been developed for some NTDs, in most cases they remain
      empirical. Besides, they rarely take into account local prevalence data, do not adequately
      represent the spectrum of patients and differential diagnosis at the primary care level and
      often have not been properly validated. The purpose of the study is to develop
      evidence-based Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT)-supported diagnostic guidelines for patients with
      persistent fever (≥ 1 week) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Sudan, Cambodia
      and Nepal.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is part of a large European Union (EU)-funded research project called NIDIAG that
      aims at developing integrated, evidence-based syndromic approach to improve management of
      NTD-related clinical syndromes. NIDIAG targets three non-specific clinical syndromes: the
      persistent fever, neurological, and intestinal syndrome. The objective of the project is to
      establish diagnostic guidelines for each of this syndrome, with a particular focus on severe
      and treatable neglected infectious diseases. The developed guidelines should integrate
      relevant Point-of-Care (POC)tests.

      The persistent fever syndrome targeted by NIDIAG is defined as presence of fever for at
      least one week. The list of diseases - both NTD and other Infectious Diseases (ID) - that
      frequently cause persistent (≥1 week) fever in the study countries includes: Visceral
      Leishmaniasis (VL), Human Africa Trypanosomiasis (HAT), Enteric (typhoid, paratyphoid)
      fever, Malaria, Brucellosis, Melioidosis, Tuberculosis, Amoebic liver abscess, Relapsing
      fever, HIV, Rickettsial diseases, and Leptospirosis. The study will try to identify clinical
      and laboratory predictors of these diseases as well as validate existing RDTs.

    <description>The Card Agglutination Trypanosoma test (CATT) has been used for many years at large scale for mass screening of mostly asymptomatic individuals (CATT-R250).  Unfortunately, its operating characteristics have only been evaluated in the context of patients with persistent fever. Although it is not strictly an RDT, the CATT is rather easily performed in remote settings, in particular since a new and more robust format (CATT-D10) allows to test a lower number of patients in peripheral health facilities. It is manufactured by the Institute of Tropical Medicine of Antwerp, Belgium.</description>
