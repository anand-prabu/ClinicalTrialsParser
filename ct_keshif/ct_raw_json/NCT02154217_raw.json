Those patients who were controlled (IOP< 21 mmHg) on the nonfixed combination of\n             latanoprost and timolol (twice daily or once daily morning administration) for at\n             least 3 months prior to the baseline visit.\n\n          2. Patients on monotherapy either with latanoprost or timolol who were eligible for dual\n             therapy being not satisfactorily controlled (IOP < 21 mmHg, or, as judged by the\n             physician, target IOP was not reached).\n\n        Pseudoexfoliation glaucomas and patients with diabetes were not excluded.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        All patients in whom beta-blockers were contraindicated were excluded. Ocular Condition.\n\n          1. Closed/barely open anterior chamber angles (ACAs) or history of acute angle closure.\n             The ACA was viewed by means of the Goldmann 1-mirror lens. Shaffer grading was used,\n             and grades II, III, and IV were included. Grades 0 and I were excluded.\n\n          2. Ocular surgery or argon laser trabeculoplasty within the last 3 months.\n\n          3. Ocular inflammation/infection occurring within 3 months before the pretrial visit.\n\n          4. Neovascular glaucomas.\n\n          5. Hypersensitivity to benzalkonium chloride or to any other component of the trial drug\n             solutions.\n\n          6. Other abnormal ocular condition or symptom preventing the patient from entering the\n             trial, according to the investigator's judgement.\n\n          7. Patients on either bimatoprost or the LTFC.\n\n          8. Patients who had undergone refractive surgery. General\n\n          9. Inability to adhere to treatment/visit plan.\n\n         10. Participation in any other clinical trial (i.e., requiring in- formed consent) within\n             1 month before the prestudy visit. 11. Pregnancy, nursing, or, if applicable, nonuse\n             of adequate contraception.\n\n        12. Any drug known to affect IOP."
