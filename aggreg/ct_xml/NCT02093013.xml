  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to implement and evaluate an integrated care program for enhancing
      the care of patients with asthma in a region of Quebec province, Canada. The investigators
      will implement our intervention in a family medicine group practice setting and plan to
      deliver it to 150 experimental group subjects. The investigators will simultaneously study
      300 control subjects who are receiving usual care in other regions of the province of
      Quebec. Our hypothesis is that the program will improve the quality of life of patients with
      asthma exposed to the program, asthma control, inhaled corticosteroid adherence, knowledge
      of asthma, and a number of variables that relate to the conceptual model selected as a
      framework for this study (the PRECEDE-PROCEED model of Green and Kreuter).

    <description>Integrated care program meant in effect, calling on the family medicine group (FMG) nurses to evaluate and support asthmatic patients. The FMG and asthma education centre (AEC) nurses received special training and followed a protocol based on the theoretical model and the Canadian asthma management recommendations then in force. The protocol had five main aspects: 1) asthma assessment, 2) self-management, 3) environment and lifestyle, 4) collaborative care plan, and 5) information sharing and follow-up.</description>
