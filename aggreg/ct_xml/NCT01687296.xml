      This is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled,
      parallel-group study to determine the efficacy and safety of nebulized fluticasone
      propionate (FP) 1mg twice daily compared with oral prednisone administered for 7 days to
      Chinese pediatric and adolescent subjects (aged 4 to 16 years) with an acute exacerbation of
      asthma. This study is for supporting registration of FP Nebules treating Chinese pediatric
      and adolescent subjects (aged 4 to 16 years) with an acute exacerbation of asthma in China.

      At least 250 subjects, aged 4-16 years old, diagnosed an acute exacerbation of asthma at
      presentation, are eligible to take part in the study if they meet the inclusion criteria.
      They are randomly assigned at the ratio 1:1 to one of the following treatment groups for 7
      days:  FP Nebules 2×0.5mg/2ml twice daily/Placebo tablets once daily; Or, Oral prednisone
      tablets once daily (2mg/kg.day, up to 40mg/day for 4 days, then 1mg/kg.day or half of the
      original dose, up to 20mg/day for 3 days) / Placebo Nebules 2×2ml 0.9% saline twice daily.
      While all subjects are given Salbutamol Nebules / MDI for relief of symptoms. After
      randomization (visit 1), the following visits are on Day5 (visit 2) and Day8 (visit 3), and
      a follow-up phone call (visit4) will happen two weeks post treatment on Day 21 for
      collection of  adverse events.

      The primary endpoint is  mean morning PEF on diary card over the treatment assessment
      period. The secondary endpoints include subject derived data (symptom scores ), evening PEF
      on diary card, use of rescue medications, clinic assessments of pulmonary function ( FEV1,
      and FVC) , clinical scoring index , patient/parent and investigator global evaluation, and
      use of rescue medications during the trial. Safety endpoints include AEs, vital signs, and
      oropharyngeal examinations, and laboratory tests (haematology, urinalysis, chemistry). The
      subjects are assessed for compliance on completion of diary card.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chinese male and female pediatric or adolescent subjects aged 4 to 16 years,
             inclusive

          -  Subjects have an established diagnosis of asthma

          -  The definition of asthma. According to Chinese Guideline for the diagnosis and
             optimal management of asthma in children [Respiratory branch of pediatric
             society,Chinese Medical. Association. 2008, revised version], the subjects can be
             diagnosed when meeting the criteria. The diagnosis criteria is listed in the
             protocol.

          -  The severity of an acute exacerbation of asthma is defined as PEF of 50% to 75%
             predicted via a peak flow meter, with a clinical scoring index of ≥2. The clinical
             scoring index represents the sum of the score for each of four signs: respiratory
             rate (0=low to 3=high, dependent on age), wheezing (0=none to 3=severe),
             inspiration/expiration ratio (0=2:1 to 3=1:3), and accessory muscle (0=none to
             3=marked use).

          -  Subjects can properly use a mini-wright peak flow meter, nebulizer and MDI
             with/without a spacer, and accurately complete a diary card with parental assistance,
             if required.

          -  Subjects' parents/guardians are willing to give written informed consent.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Severe respiratory dysfunction.

          -  History of mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

          -  Admission to hospital due to respiratory disease within the previous 2 weeks,
             including asthmatic exacerbations.

          -  Clinical or lab evidence of a serious, uncontrolled systemic disease or presence of
             any disease likely to interfere with the objectives of this study, such as pulmonary
             cystic fibrosis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to glucocorticosteroids or β2 agonists.

          -  Clinical visual evidence of oral candidiasis at Visit1.

          -  Use of the medications below in Table 1 according to the following defined time
             intervals prior to presentation. The list is provided in the protocol.
