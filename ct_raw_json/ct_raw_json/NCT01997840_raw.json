Patients must have received at least 2 lines of prior therapies.  Patients\n             must have relapsed after having achieved at least stable disease (SD) for at least\n             one cycle of treatment to at least one prior regimen and then developed progressive\n             disease (PD).  Patients must also have documented evidence of PD during or within 60\n             days (measured from the end of the last cycle) of completing treatment with the last\n             anti-myeloma drug regimen used just prior to study entry (refractory disease).\n\n          -  Must have undergone prior treatment with at least 2 cycles of lenalidomide and at\n             least 2 cycles of a proteasome inhibitor (either in separate regimens or within the\n             same regimen).\n\n          -  Must not be a candidate for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), has declined the\n             option of ASCT, or has relapsed after prior ASCT.\n\n          -  Must have measurable levels of myeloma paraprotein in serum (\u2265 0.5 g/dL) or urine (\u2265\n             0.2 g/24 hours).\n\n          -  Must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0, 1,\n             or 2.\n\n          -  Females of child bearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine\n             pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL within 10 - 14 days prior to,\n             and again within 24 hours of starting pomalidomide and must either commit to\n             continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of\n             birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE\n             SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking pomalidomide.  FCBP must also\n             agree to ongoing pregnancy testing.  Men must agree to use a latex condom during\n             sexual contact with a FCBP even if they have had a vasectomy.
