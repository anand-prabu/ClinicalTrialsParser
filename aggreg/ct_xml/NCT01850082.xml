  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is the most common major surgical procedure in the
      United States with over 300,000 cases performed each year. To restore blood flow to the
      heart, vascular conduits from another part of the body are procured to create a bypass
      around critically blocked coronary arteries. The left internal thoracic artery is the
      conduit of choice for CABG due to its superior long-term patency. However, almost all
      patients referred for CABG require additional grafts to provide complete revascularization.
      This necessitates the harvest of other vessels, most commonly the saphenous vein which is
      used almost ubiquitously in contemporary CABG with an average of two vein grafts per CABG
      procedure. In the last 10 years, Endoscopic Vein Harvesting (EVH) has been recommended as
      the preferred method over the traditional open harvesting technique (OVH) because it
      provides a minimally invasive approach. However, more recent investigations indicate
      potential for reduced long-term bypass graft patency and worse clinical outcomes with EVH.
      The long term impact of EVH on clinical outcomes has never been investigated on a large
      scale using a definitive, adequately powered, prospective Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)
      with long-term follow-up.

      CSP #588 - REGROUP is a randomized, intent-to-treat, two-arm, parallel design, multicenter
      study. Cardiac Surgery Programs at Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMC) with expertise in
      performing both EVH and OVH will be invited to participate in the study. Subjects requiring
      elective or urgent CABG using cardiopulmonary bypass with use of at least one SVG will be
      screened for enrollment using established inclusion/exclusion criteria. Enrolled Subjects
      will be randomized to one of the two arms (EVH or OVH) after an experienced vein harvester
      is identified and assigned. Intraoperative assessments will be collected and post-operative
      assessments will be completed 24 hours post-surgery. Additional assessments will be
      completed at the time of discharge or at the 30-day post-surgery date if the subject is
      still in the hospital. Assessment of leg wound complications will be completed at the time
      of discharge and at six-week post-surgery. Telephone follow-ups will occur at three-month
      interval post-surgery until the participating sites are decommissioned at the end of the
      trial period (which would be approximately 4.5 years after the site initiations). For
      long-term MACE outcomes, passive follow up for MACE events using VA databases (CPRS, VASQIP)
      will be performed centrally by the Study Chair's office for another 2 years.

    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>The primary efficacy end point is the composite rate of death from any cause, myocardial infarction or repeat revascularization (Major Adverse Cardiac Events - MACE) throughout the multi-year Study period.  Each randomized subject (either in the Endoscopic or in the Open vein harvesting group) will be followed after the index CABG to capture the time-to-MACE event, where an 'EVENT' will be defined as either death (all cause) or a myocardial infarction or a revascularization procedure during the follow-up period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigate the impact of SVG harvesting techniques - OVH vs. EVH on MACE, a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction and repeat revascularization, at one and three-year postoperatively.</measure>
    <time_frame>6.5 years</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The secondary efficacy end point is the MACE rate at one and three-years post-CABG. We believe that the proposed CSP# 588 REGROUP Trial will be uniquely positioned to fill a significant gap in existing knowledge regarding the long term MACE rates of EVH in CABG and improve the quality of the care we provide to our Veterans and more broadly to all patients undergoing coronary revascularization. In addition, we believe that CSP# 588 findings will significantly impact the VA and national cardiac surgery coronary revascularization guidelines.</description>

    <description>Open Vein Harvesting is the traditional method of saphenectomy for CABG. It is performed under direct vision using a single long incision or, more commonly, multiple smaller incisions (referred to as &quot;bridging&quot; technique) along the course of the vein. This approach minimizes manipulation and direct trauma to the conduit but is associated with potential for discomfort and leg wound healing complications. Endoscopic Vein Harvesting is a minimally invasive procedure that was developed to eliminate the need for long incisions associated with OVH. EVH reduces the risk of wound infections and other leg wound complications but may be more traumatic to the conduit than OVH.</description>
