Have cognitive decline verified by a study partner or cognitive impairment verified\n             by the study physician.\n\n          3. Have a study partner who provides separate consent and is willing to accompany the\n             patient on all of the study visits.\n\n          4.

The patient has a known brain lesion, pathology or alternative diagnosis that\n             strongly explains the patient's clinical presentation;\n\n          4. Are receiving any investigational medications, or have participated in a trial with\n             investigational medications within the last 30 days;\n\n          5. Have ever participated in an experimental study with an amyloid targeting agent (e.g.\n             anti-amyloid immunotherapy, \u03b3 -secretase or \u03b2 -secretase inhibitor) unless it can be\n             documented that the patient received only placebo during the course of the trial;\n\n          6. Have had a radiopharmaceutical imaging or treatment procedure within 7 days prior to\n             the study imaging session; or\n\n          7. Are females of childbearing potential who are not surgically sterile, not refraining\n             from sexual activity or not using reliable methods of contraception.\n\n        Patients will also be excluded from enrollment if their enrolling physician:\n\n          1. Does not consider Alzheimer's disease as a potential cause of the patient's cognitive\n             decline.\n\n          2. Is not the primary physician taking care of the patient with respect to the\n             management of their cognitive impairment.\n\n          3. Cannot categorize the patient as either: a) having a documented and completed\n             evaluation for cognitive decline within the past 18 months old; or b) currently\n             undergoing evaluation for cognitive decline.\n\n          4. Is unwilling to suspend all testing and other evaluation procedures between the time\n             of the baseline evaluation of the enrolling physician's diagnosis and management plan\n             and the time the completion of the PET scan."
