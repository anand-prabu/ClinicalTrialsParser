The aim of the study was to evaluate the\n      effects of fluid replacement solutions used intraoperatively on renal functions in elective\n      living-donor liver transplantation.This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of\n      Hospital and all patients were informed and gave written consent. Participants were patients\n      scheduled for elective living-donor liver transplantation. Patients with normal renal\n      function were randomly allocated to infusion with 6% HES 130/0.4 (HES Group) and 4%\n      Gelofusine (GEL Group). Blood samples were obtained before induction of anesthesia\n      (baseline), at the end of the operation, and postoperative days 1 and 4. Different eGFR\n      formulas using creatinine (MDRD, CKD-EPI, and Cockraud Gault) were used to calculate\n      estimated glomerular filtration rates."
