  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy can be performed by a one-operator technique with endoscopist personally
      advancing and withdrawing the scope or by a two-operators technique, with the GI-assistant
      doing the physical insertion and withdrawal of the scope directed by the endoscopist.
      Uncontrolled data report that 1 operator technique is associated with a higher adenoma
      detection rate, although it is also characterized by a lowwer cecal intubation rate and
      longer intubation time. The aim of present randomized controlled study was to assess whether
      one technique is better than the  other one in terms of colonoscopy quality performances.
