        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must have relapsed or refractory disease.

          2. Subject must have histologically documented diagnosis of non-hodgkin's lymphoma as
             defined by a B-cell neo-plasm in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification
             scheme except as noted in exclusion criteria.

          3. Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 0-2.

          4. Subject has adequate bone marrow (independent of growth factor support per local
             laboratory reference range).

          5. Subject has adequate coagulation, renal and hepatic function.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has been diagnosed with Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disease (PTLD),
             Burkitt's lymphoma, Burkitt-like lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia, chronic
             lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell leukemia (MCL), or small lymphocytic lymphoma
             (SLL).

          2. Subject has undergone an allogeneic stem cell transplant.

          3. Subject is receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy for human immunodeficiency
             virus (HIV) (due to potential drug-drug interactions, as well as the potential for
             increased risk of opportunistic infections).

          4. Subject has a significant history of renal, neurologic, psychiatric, endocrinologic,
             metabolic, immunologic, cardiovascular, or hepatic disease within 6 months that in
             the opinion of the Investigator would adversely affect his/her participation in this
             study.

          5. Subject has active peptic ulcer disease or other hemorrhagic esophagitis/gastritis.
