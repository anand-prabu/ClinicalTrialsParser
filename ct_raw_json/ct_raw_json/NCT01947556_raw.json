The faster insulin action of insulin administration by jet injection may be\n      especially advantageous for correction of hyperglycemia.\n\n      To investigate this, a open-label randomised controlled cross-over study will be performed\n      in 20 adult patients (18-75 years) with T1DM or T2DM on basal-bolus insulin treatment.\n\n      The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of insulin aspart will be derived from the\n      time-action profiles of insulin and glucose, respectively, in response to insulin (in a dose\n      of 1.5 times the amount of insulin needed to reduce blood glucose to 6 mmol/l calculated by\n      the insulin-sensitivity factor) after reaching hyperglycemia (18-23 mmol/l). All patients\n      will be investigated twice, where on one occasion the jet-injector device will be used to\n      inject insulin, and on the other occasion insulin will be injected with a conventional\n      insulin pen. The order of these occasions will be randomised. Both devices will be operated\n      by the patient after sufficient training. Ease of use will be evaluated."
