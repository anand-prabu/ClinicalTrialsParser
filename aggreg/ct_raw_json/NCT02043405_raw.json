Individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG),\n             impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and a combination of the two (IFG/IGT) will\n             recruited and verified using oral glucose tolerance testing at initial screening.\n             All subjects will be obese (BMI 30-40 kg/m2) and sedentary (<2 hours/week of planned\n             physical activity).  Impaired fasting glucose is defined as fasting glucose between\n             100-125mg/dl, with post-prandial glucose (<140 mg/dl 2 hrs after 75g OGTT). Impaired\n             glucose tolerance is defined as normal fasting glucose <100mg/dl, with post-prandial\n             glucose (>140 mg/dl 2 hrs after 75g OGTT). Subjects with IFG/IGT will have both\n             impaired fasting glucose (100-125mg/dl), and impaired glucose tolerance (>140 mg/dl 2\n             hrs after 75g OGTT) (49).   To increase generalizability, and because each subject\n             serves as their own control, women will be enrolled regardless of menopausal status,\n             use of hormone replacement therapy and oral contraceptives.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        Regular exercise more than 2 hours/week, medications that could affect glucose, lipid\n        metabolism, thyroid disease, a history of lung disease, pregnancy, active cigarette\n        smoking or exposure to second hand smoke and severe plasma lipid disorders."
