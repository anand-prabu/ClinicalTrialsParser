Other alternative available include\n      surgery, drugs and acupuncture. There are various therapeutic approaches and different\n      points can be used in acupuncture treatment for myopia, such as auricular acupuncture,\n      acupressure body acupuncture. However, the mechanism of acupuncture therapy for myopia is\n      largely unknown.  Furthermore, little information exists regarding the effects and safety of\n      acupuncture for degenerative myopia in children.\n\n      The investigators aimed to assess the overall effectiveness, safety of periocular\n      acupressure for children with myopia\n\n      The hypotheses of this study are as follows:\n\n      Periocular acupressure is effective for myopia progression delay.\n\n      The study aims to include 56 participants."
