  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current state of knowledge on the concentration of drugs and their metabolites in the
      individual human body is not satisfying concerning the question about behavior of drugs in
      the human body, taking into account individual patient factors such as age, weight and organ
      dysfunctions.

      This projects deals with the question of drug levels in the blood of hospitalized patients.

      The aim of this study is to extend the knowledge about the behavior of drugs in the human
      body significantly, for the safety and benefit of future patients. This also includes to
      establish a relationship between drug levels in patients and the desired and undesired
      effects of a drug.

      As a result, the future perspective is to find the optimal dose for the individual patient
      by measuring the blood concentration of a drug.

      The primary goal of the study is to gain an overview of the plasma concentrations of
      relevant drugs which occur in different patient populations and to what extent they are
      consistent with those concentrations described in the literature.

      If the expectation is confirmed, that a significant heterogeneity in the plasma
      concentrations of these patients exists, the investigators will try to find influencing
      factors for this circumstance on the basis of routine clinical parameters (height, weight,
      renal function, concomitant medications, etc.).

      Ultimately, this project will identify substances with a high interindividual variability in
      plasma levels, where drug monitoring might be suggested.
