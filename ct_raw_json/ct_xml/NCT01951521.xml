      Investigators study whether addition of a preoperative radiation boost increases
      pathological complete response rates in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated
      with pre-operative chemoradiation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The current treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer consists of
      pre-operative chemoradiation treatment (CRT) (50 Gray (Gy) in 25 fractions) followed by
      surgical resection, according to T-/N-stage, circumferential resection margin (CRM) and
      tumor localization (see table 1). After this neo-adjuvant treatment approximately 15% of
      patients show pathological complete response (pCR), i.e. no residual tumor in the resected
      specimen on pathologic examination. Patients with pCR have a lower risk of local and distant
      recurrences and significantly longer disease-free and overall survival.

      Response to pre-operative chemoradiation occurs in a dose dependent fashion. Therefore,
      recent trials aimed to improve prognosis by radiation dose-escalation that resulted in
      improved pCR rates. Toxicity rates associated with radiation doses above 60 Gy are
      manageable and differ between studies; from increased to comparable or even lower toxicity.

      Objective: Investigators study whether addition of a preoperative radiation boost increases
      pathological complete response rates in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated
      with pre-operative chemoradiation. Secondary objectives are adverse events due to
      preoperative chemoradiation (toxicity) and per- &amp; postoperative treatment. And the impact of
      the boost on local and distant recurrence and survival as well as patient-reported quality
      of life and workability. The need for this comprehensive study is emphasized by the
      sub-optimal (radiation-) methods, heterogeneity between and poor reporting in the few
      previous trials in this field.

      Study design: Randomized controlled trial, nested within a prospective cohort according to
      the 'cohort multiple randomized controlled trial' (cmRCT) design.

      Study population: Rectal cancer patients participating in a prospective cohort (the PICNIC
      project) and diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the rectum whom will undergo chemoradiation
      based on clinical criteria.

      Intervention: A pre-operative irradiation boost of 15 Gy delivered to the gross tumor volume
      (GTV) in 5 fractions in addition to the standard chemoradiation treatment of 50 Gy. Thereby
      increasing the total GTV dose to 65 Gy.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is pathologic complete response (pCR)
      assessed by standardized pathologic examination of the surgical specimen. Secondary outcomes
      are treatment toxicity and (surgical) complications. Furthermore, the prospective cohort
      design enables long-term follow up on patient-reported quality of life and workability,
      local recurrence and (disease-specific) survival.
