  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite broad awareness of the role that diet plays in increasing obesity risk, adherence to
      public health recommendations for maintaining healthy eating is low. Insights gained from
      weight loss intervention trials find that trial participants report difficulty in
      restricting calories, dissatisfaction with the pace of weight loss, inability to control
      eating, low palatability of recommended foods and strong food cravings. Indeed, recent
      systematic reviews provide empirical support that these subjective experiences that trial
      participants describe likely represent eating-related traits or    phenotypes   . While
      amassing evidence supports individual variation in these eating-related traits, to date
      there has been no systematic effort to characterize robust eating-related phenotypes.
      Proposed is a Sub-study to be piggy-backed on a planned Study being conducted by
      investigators at the University of North Carolina (UNC-- Linnan, Dilworth-Anderson &amp;
      Evans). The UNC Parent Study is a feasibility study using community-based participatory
      research (CBPR) approaches to explore possible intervention strategies aimed to reduce the
      burden of chronic disease and cancer among African American families. The NHGRI-led
      Sub-study    proposes a collaboration with UNC in which aims for the eating behavior
      Sub-study will be integrated with the UNC Parent Study (hereafter referred to as Phase 1).
      The additional aims of the Sub-study (hereafter referred to as Phase 2) are to gain
      understanding of whether we can characterize clusters of eating-related behaviors that may
      be associated with adherence to weight management and weight outcomes. This current protocol
      lays out the specific qualitative activities planned for Phase 1 which include conducting
      structured interviews with Black Family Reunion organizers (N=8) and a sample of reunion
      participants (N=40). We describe in broad-brush the larger quantitative study proposed for
      Phase 2. We will collect information on eating-related behaviors in African American
      kindreds (N=300). We are also considering Phase 3 activities if we identify clusters of
      eating-related phenotypes within families. Amended IRB applications will be submitted prior
      to launching Phases 2 &amp;  3.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Participants will be drawn from African American families who are attending Black family
        reunion events in North Carolina in the summer of 2014.

        In order to participate, individuals must be age 18 or older, be a blood relative, spouse
        of a blood relative or deemed an honorary family member.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Pregnant women will be excluded from participation in the study due to the focus on eating
        behaviors and weight.
