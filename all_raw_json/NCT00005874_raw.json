Assess the efficacy and toxicity of nitrocamptothecin in patients with\n      locally advanced or metastatic gastrointestinal leiomyosarcomas or other soft tissue\n      sarcomas.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by disease (gastrointestinal leiomyosarcomas vs other soft\n      tissue sarcomas). Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin daily on days 1-5. Treatment\n      continues weekly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Responding\n      patients who undergo surgery then receive an additional 4-6 courses (4 weeks/course).\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 34-78 patients (17-39 per stratum) will be accrued for this\n      study."
