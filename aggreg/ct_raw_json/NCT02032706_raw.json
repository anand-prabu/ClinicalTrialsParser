In study 2, patients who had completed\n      a baseline PSG with a minimum of four hours of sleep time were to wear the Night Shift for\n      two nights without feedback to confirm their willingness to continue with the study,\n      followed by 28 nights of vibro-tactile position therapy.  A follow-up PSG was to be\n      conducted as soon as possible to the completion of the 28-nights of treatment.  During\n      enrollment subjects were to complete pre-treatment questionnaires designed to measure\n      daytime sleepiness, insomnia severity, depression, anxiety, and quality of life.  The same\n      instruments were completed post-treatment on the morning after the 28th night of treatment.\n      Subjects completed daily logs to confirm device utilization and identify potential\n      non-device related factors that could influence study completion."
