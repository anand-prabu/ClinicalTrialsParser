This study consists of 3 phases: a screening phase\n      (within 3 weeks prior to the start of study medication), a treatment phase (12 weeks), and a\n      follow-up phase (12 weeks after the last administration of study medication). Approximately\n      170 participants will be enrolled in this study to receive CNTO6785 or placebo in 1:1 ratio.\n      Safety will be evaluated by the assessment of adverse events, vital signs, 12-lead\n      electrocardiogram, physical examination, early detection of active tuberculosis, and\n      clinical laboratory tests which will be monitored throughout the study.
