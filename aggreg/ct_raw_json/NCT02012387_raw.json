            "textblock": "Physical urticarias, such as delayed pressure, cholinergic, dermatographism and cold\n      urticaria, are highly disabling conditions[1]. Cholinergic urticaria occurs due to an active\n      (e.g. exercise) or passive (e.g. hot bath) increase in core body temperature, causing\n      itching and small hives with flare reaction on the trunk and limps that fade away upon\n      cooling of the body[2].\n\n      As it is the case of chronic urticaria, physical urticarias have a great impact on patients'\n      quality of life[3, 4]. However, these types of urticarias cause even more alteration on\n      quality of life because of the limitations they cause in daily life activities, sports\n      practicing[5] or work performance.\n\n      In spite of the high morbidity of this disease and the impact on quality of life, there is\n      no available treatment. Antihistamines that usually control other types of urticaria could\n      only partially alleviate cholinergic urticaria. There is only one paper[6] that shows\n      efficacy doubling the dose of cetirizine above the recommended dosage on the Summary of\n      Product Characteristics (off-label dosage). The poor response to antihistamine is justified\n      by the minimal role of histamine in its physiopathology and only after employing very high\n      doses[7].\n\n      The etiology and pathogenesis of hive formation remains unknown, though it is recognized\n      that mast cells are clearly involved[8]. On the other hand, it seems that desensitization or\n      tolerance could be induced in cholinergic urticaria[9]. Thus as it is the case of drug\n      desensitization, IgE receptor must also play a role in the development of this physical\n      urticaria[10].\n\n      In the past years, the monoclonal humanized anti-IgE antibody (Omalizumab) was shown to be\n      effective in control cholinergic urticaria[11] not respondent to conventional therapies at\n      maximum or off-label doses. A negative response was also reported for cholinergic\n      urticaria[12].\n\n      Our rationale for this approach in this type of urticaria is that Omalizumab exerts an\n      inhibitory action on mast cell activation, as is the case of desensitization.\n\n      For that purpose, we will perform a multicenter, randomized, double-blind,\n      placebo-controlled parallel clinical trial. We will include 24 patients including both\n      female and male patients (age 14 years or older), non-respondent to antihistamines.\n\n      Efficacy will be evaluated through the negativization of the EAACI, EDF and UNEV\n      standardized exercise challenge test, Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Chronic Urticaria Quality\n      of Life validated questionnaire[13], patients' card of symptoms and use of rescue\n      medication. Additional measures of efficacy will also be: the number of dropouts in each\n      treatment group; the leave days due of urticaria and Emergency Department visits. Finally,\n      safety will be assessed by means of recording and evaluation of adverse reactions during\n      treatment.\n\n      As we previously stated, Omalizumab is not indicated for physical or other types of\n      urticaria. The only indication is for treatment of moderate-to-severe allergic asthma. The\n      hypothesis we are working on is that the monoclonal anti-IgE antibody Omalizumab could be as\n      well effective in controlling physical urticaria symptoms in patients non-respondent to\n      conventional therapy. We hypothesize that Omalizumab is able to revert the basophil or mast\n      cell activation present in those urticaria types."
