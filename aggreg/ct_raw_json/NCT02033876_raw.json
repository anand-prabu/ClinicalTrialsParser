Participants\n      will be receiving monotherapy with metformin. Blood samples will be collected at defined\n      times to measure glycemia and the incretin (GLP-1, OXM, PYY3-36) fasting levels and\n      responses to the meal.\n\n      Anticipated Results: In comparison with placebo, UDCA will increase insulin sensitivity,\n      enhance glycemic control, increase postprandial incretins, and delay GE of liquids.\n\n      Significance: This study will prove that ileocolonic-release UDCA enhances glycemic control\n      in T2DM patients."
