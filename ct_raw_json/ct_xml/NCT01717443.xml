    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the prevalence, incidence and genotype of anogenital
      HPV infections in women before and after renal transplantation. With this information the
      investigators can determine the value of vaccination in patients waiting for renal
      transplantation in the future.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each year about 800 renal transplantations are performed in the Netherlands. The current
      immunosuppressive strategies have led to a 1-year patient and graft survival of more than
      90%. This high survival rate urges medical specialists to pay increasing attention to the
      long‐term side effects of immunosuppressive medication, such as virus‐associated cancers. An
      example of an oncogenic virus is the high risk Human Papillomavirus (hrHPV) which is related
      to (pre)malignancies of the anogenital tract e.g. cervix, vulva and anus. These malignancies
      are among the most common malignancies in renal transplant recipients (RTRs). The incidence
      of hrHPV‐related cervical and vulvar malignancies is increased up to a 100‐fold in RTRs
      compared to the general population. There is limited literature on the exact behaviour of
      HPV infection related anogenital (pre)malignancies in RTRs. A part of these
      (pre)malignancies are probably already present at the time of transplantation while others
      develop in the years after transplantation.  With gynaecological examination the
      investigators can diagnose anogenital (pre)malignancies before transplantation so treatment,
      if necessary, can commence before transplantation. Knowledge about HPV status before and
      after transplantation gives insight in the natural course of the HPV infection in this group
      of patients and with this information the investigators can determine the value of
      vaccination in patients waiting for renal transplantation in the future.
