Unfortunately, joint pain/stiffness/achiness\n      (arthralgia) is a common side-effect of AIs.  This \"proof-of-concept\" study explores how an\n      evidence-based physical activity (PA) program- the Arthritis Foundation's Walk with Ease\n      (WWE) program- can be adapted for breast cancer survivors on AI therapy to: 1) Help them\n      maintain or achieve recommended levels of PA, 2) reduce their joint pain/stiffness/achiness,\n      and 3) thereby enable them to remain on AI therapy as prescribed."
