Assess the efficacy of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating\n      factor (G-CSF) in raising the absolute neutrophil count, platelet count, and hemoglobin\n      level in patients with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes.\n\n      II.  Assess the efficacy of a reduced maintenance dose in patients who respond to daily\n      G-CSF.\n\n      III.  Assess the toxic effects of G-CSF in these patients. IV.  Measure bone marrow\n      progenitor colonies before and after G-CSF. V.  Measure CD34-positive cells in marrow and\n      blood before and after G-CSF using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry."

Patients who respond at week 8 or 16 are then tapered to a lower\n      maintenance dose of G-CSF administered every other day through week 40.  The dose is\n      adjusted to maintain an absolute neutrophil count above 1500.\n\n      Patients are removed from study for failure to achieve a complete response by week 16,\n      unacceptable nonhematologic toxicity, the identification of a clonal karyotype in marrow, or\n      the onset of leukemia."
