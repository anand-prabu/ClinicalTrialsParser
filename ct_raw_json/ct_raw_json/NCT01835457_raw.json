            "textblock": "Auto-immune diseases are characterized by an inappropriate inflammatory response against\n      tissues in the body and represent a major health care burden. Pro-inflammatory cytokines\n      such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 play a central role in the pathophysiology of many auto-immune\n      diseases. Innovative therapies aimed at limiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production in a\n      more physiological manner are warranted. In previous research conducted in an individual\n      known as \"the iceman\", the investigators found that, through a autodidact\n      concentration/meditation technique, he appears to mount a controlled stress response,\n      characterized by activation of the sympathetic nervous system and enhanced production of\n      cortisol, both of which are known to result in immunosuppression. In accordance, while\n      practicing this concentration/meditation technique, the inflammatory response during human\n      endotoxemia (lipopolysaccharide [LPS] administration) was remarkably low in this individual.\n      Therefore, this technique could provide a novel means of controlling the inflammatory\n      response. However, the aforementioned results were obtained in just one subject, and hence\n      can not serve as scientific evidence for the effectiveness of the concentration/meditation\n      technique. The iceman claims that he can teach this technique to other subjects within a\n      relatively short time frame. Therefore, in the present study the investigators wish to\n      investigate the effect of concentration/meditation on autonomic nervous system activity and\n      the inflammatory response during experimental human endotoxemia in a controlled manner, by\n      comparing a group of subjects that are trained by \"the iceman\" and practice the\n      concentration/meditation technique with a group of subjects which do not."
