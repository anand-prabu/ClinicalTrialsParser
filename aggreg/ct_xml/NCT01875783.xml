  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to determine whether point of care optical coherence
      tomography (OCT) imaging combined with an OCT-guided retinal referral algorithm at primary
      diabetes care visits increases rates of retina specialist eye care for patients with
      diabetic macular edema.  The hypothesis is that OCT imaging with an automated OCT-guided
      referral algorithm will enable identification of patients at risk for vision loss from
      diabetic macular edema and facilitate direct referral to retina specialists for more timely
      evaluation and treatment.
