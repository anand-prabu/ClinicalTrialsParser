All patients are given a single dose of oral\n      troglitazone daily. Patients continue to receive troglitazone as long as their disease\n      responds to treatment or remains stable.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Initially, 14 patients of each of the 5 subtypes of liposarcoma will be\n      accrued. If 1 or more patients show evidence of biological response, an additional 16\n      patients of each subtype will be accrued for a total of 30 per subtype."
