Mother must be 18 years or older.\n\n          5. Infant must be consuming a standard cow's milk protein infant formula and have been\n             receiving a standard cow's milk protein infant formula for at least the past 2 days\n             prior to enrollment.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria\n\n          1. Mother had gestational diabetes during pregnancy\n\n          2. Infant has condition requiring infant feedings other than feeding cow milk formula\n             from a bottle.\n\n          3.
