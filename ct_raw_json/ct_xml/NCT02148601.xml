  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the recent past, a deep change in the epidemiology of C. difficile infection has
      occurred, with a rise in its frequency, severity, and mortality. Both the refractoriness of
      the infection to standard therapy and its probability of recurrence have also increased,
      representing a main clinical issue. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)  refers to the
      introduction of a liquid filtrate of stools from a healthy donor into the gastrointestinal
      tract of a patient for the treatment of specific diseases. FMT has shown outstanding results
      in the treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection. It can be performed through various
      routes: nasogastric or nasojejunal tube, upper endoscopy, retention enema, colonoscopy. In a
      recent systematic review of studies using FMT for the treatment of recurrent C. difficile
      infection, Cammarota et al. observed that lower gastrointestinal route (colonoscopy, enema)
      led to the achievement of higher eradication rates than upper delivery (gastroscopy,
      naso-gastric or naso-jejunal tube) (81-86% vs 84-93%, respectively). In a randomized
      clinical trial, Van Nood et al. showed the efficacy of FMT by nasojejunal tube in recurrent
      C. difficile infection. Up to now, data on FMT by lower route come out only by case series
      and case reports.

      The investigators' aim is to compare the efficacy of colonoscopic FMT and  standard
      antibiotic therapy for the treatment of C. difficile infection in a randomized clinical
      trial

      C. difficile infection. Up to now, data on FMT by lower route come out only by case series
      and case reports.

      The investigators' aim is to compare the efficacy of colonoscopic FMT and  standard
      antibiotic therapy for the treatment of C. difficile infection in an open-label randomized
      clinical trial The investigators' trial should confirm the clinical results obtained by Van
      Nood et al. by using a colonoscopy approach.

      The investigators' study is an open-label randomized controlled trial, enrolling patients
      with recurrent C. difficile infection, who are candidates for further antibiotic treatment
      in accordance with guidelines. Recurrent C. difficile infection is meant as the reappearance
      of clinical symptoms and positivity of C. difficile toxin test within 8 weeks after the end
      of the previous therapy. Patients' stool will be screened for detection of parasites and
      enteric bacterial pathogens to exclude other infective pathogens. Patients with severe
      clinical features (sepsis, severe dehydration, major co-morbidities), former colectomy,
      high-risk of endoscopic complications, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS), viral hepatitis, AIDS or syphilis will be excluded.

      Patients will be instructed and invited to signal recurrent symptoms and diarrhea after
      treatment. Monthly clinical and lab checks will be performed for a period of six months
      after the treatment.

      Treatment procedures:

      All patients will start therapy with vancomycin for four days before of stratification, with
      random allocation (1 to 1) to one of the two treatment schemes: 1) FMT, with the infusion in
      the cecum - through the biopsy channel - of 60-120 gr (depending on production) of donated
      feces, obtained from the donor within 6 hours from transplantation, and manually homogenized
      in 100/200 ml of physiological solution; or 2) standard vancomycin-based therapy according
      to the international recommendations. Colonoscopy will be performed by an expert
      endoscopist, with mucosal biopsy (when possible) for histology examination. Patients
      allocated to FMT arm will undergo preparation for colonoscopy  (four liters of a solution
      with saline laxatives). All patient will be instructed on hygiene rules to be followed at
      the patient's domicile to avoid re-infections at home. Stool donors should preferably be
      patient's relatives or intimates, must not have taken antibiotics in the last 6 months,
      should not present significant intestinal symptoms of other intestinal diseases and must
      result negative at the serum screening for viral hepatitis, AIDS or syphilis. Their stool
      will be tested for C. difficile, enteric bacteria, intestinal protozoa and helminthes
      pathogens.
