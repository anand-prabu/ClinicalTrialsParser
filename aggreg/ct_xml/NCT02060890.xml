  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This current study will use a new treatment approach based on each patient's tumor genomic
      profiling consisting of whole genome sequencing, exome analysis, and RNA sequencing as well
      as predictive modeling. This new treatment strategy has shown promising results in adult
      patients with other solid tumors.

      The current study will test the feasibility of a specialized Tumor Board assigning a
      treatment plan within 35 calendar days of obtaining tumor tissue. The treatment plan will
      take into consideration each patient's tumor molecular profile and predictive modeling as
      well as prior history and treatment(s), and other medical conditions of the patient.

      Surgery is done and a &quot;core&quot; specimen (from the enhancing component of tumor) and one or
      more tissue biopsies of the surrounding &quot;rim&quot; are obtained and processed for shipment to
      TGen for NGS and transcriptome profiling.

      Blood is obtained prior to and 24 hours following surgery for assessment of any circulating
      tumor DNA in blood.

      Blood for circulating tumor DNA is collected every 28 days (+/- 7 days).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must understand and provide written informed consent and Health Insurance
             Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization prior to initiation of any
             study-specific procedures

          -  Have a life expectancy of at least 3 months

          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of histologically confirmed Glioblastoma that is felt
             on imaging to be progressive despite standard of care treatment

          -  at least 18 years of age

          -  Patient is a good medical candidate for a standard of care surgical procedure

          -  Patients may enroll independent of number of prior therapies, but must have received
             prior radiation therapy

          -  Patients must have a performance status (KPS) of at least 60.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled concurrent illness including psychiatric illness, or situations that
             would limit compliance with the study requirements or the ability to willingly give
             written informed consent

        Eligibility for treatment using the specialized Tumor Board recommendations

          -  Patients must have fully recovered from any toxicity associated with surgery

          -  Must begin treatment no longer than 35 calendar days from surgery

          -  Must have KPS at least 60

          -  Must have Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) at least 1500/mm3, platelets at least
             125,000/mm2, Hg at least 8 gm/dl

          -  Must have electrolytes (Na, K, Co2, Cl) within normal limits using institutional
             guidelines

          -  Must have baseline MRI within 14 days prior to starting cycle 1, day 1 of treatment
             (+/- 3 days)

          -  Additional laboratory guidelines will be based upon therapies suggested by the
             specialized Tumor Board based upon anticipated, known toxicities of those agents and
             must be within at least 1.5 x upper normal limits of institutional normal limits

          -  Patient must agree to follow the recommended treatment regimen, including clinic
             visits, laboratory, imaging, and toxicity assessments
