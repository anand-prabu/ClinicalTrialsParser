A standardized exercise protocol was performed in the laboratory, separated by one week.  Each subject served as his or her own control and the key which identified which intervention was utilized in the exact order (all tablets customized to appear identical) was unlocked only after data collection was completed. Therefore, all ten subjects participated in a total of thirty intervention exercise trials after the initial treadmill familiarization trial was completed."

The primary hypothesis was that activation of the V2R in sweat glands would\n      result in water reabsorption and fluid conservation during endurance exercise."

Each subject presented to the\n      exercise lab on four separate occasions. Trial 1 was a familiarization trial to determine\n      each subject's maximal aerobic capacity and peak treadmill running speak (VO2 Peak test).\n      Trials 2, 3 and 4 utilized the same exact protocol, differing only in pharmacological\n      intervention. In a randomized, double-blind order (both participant and investigator blinded\n      to the intervention), either a placebo pill, the V2 receptor antagonist tolvaptan (Samsca\u2122,\n      30mg tablet), or the V2 receptor agonist desmopressin (DDAVP\u2122, 0.2mg tablet) was ingested\n      along with the CorTemp\u2122 Core Temperature Sensor two hours before commencement of the\n      Exercise Trial with 240mL of bottled water. The exercise protocol consisted of 60 minutes of\n      treadmill running at 60% of peak speed (steady-state) followed by a performance test (the\n      VO2 Peak test). Blood, saliva and urine, were collected before the exercise trial (baseline)\n      and again after both the steady-state run and performance runs. Sweat was obtained from\n      sweat patches after both the steady-state and performance runs. Core temperature, fluid\n      intake, performance time, body weight, thirst and sodium palatability ratings were also\n      assessed. Free access to water was allowed during the trial and all urine produced during\n      the trial was measured and collected. The main outcome measure was sweat sodium\n      concentration."
