      Study to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of Lacosamide (LCM) administered in
      addition to 1 to ≤3 other Anti-Epileptic Drugs in subjects with epilepsy ≥1 month to ≤18
      years who currently have uncontrolled partial onset seizures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of
      LCM administered concomitantly with 1 to ≤3 Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AEDs) in subjects with
      epilepsy ≥1 month to ≤18 years of age who currently have uncontrolled partial onset
      seizures.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy during long-term exposure to LCM in
      subjects epilepsy ≥1 month to ≤18 years of age.

      An additional objective is to assess behavior, cognition, quality of life, and development
      during long-term LCM exposure in pediatric subjects
