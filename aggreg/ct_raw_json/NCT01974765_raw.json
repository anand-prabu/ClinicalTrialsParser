All patients who enter the study will be\n      closely monitored for side-effects. If multiple patients develop significant side effects\n      from enzalutamide, the study may be stopped early.\n\n      Enzalutamide is an androgen-receptor inhibitor, which means that it blocks the activity of\n      the hormone testosterone. In ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers that\n      express the androgen receptor, blocking the androgen-receptor may possibly slow or stop\n      tumor growth. Enzalutamide has been studied in women with breast cancer, but this is the\n      first study using enzalutamide for the treatment of patients with ovarian, primary\n      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer."
