  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dehydration can result from exposure to harsh environments including hot and dry desert
      climates.  Soldiers and non-military workers are frequently required to work in hot, dry
      conditions, and dehydration can be productivity limiting and life threatening if
      unrecognized.

      The research at UCI can use low power laser technology to take measurements of muscle tissue
      water content in volunteers before and after marathon training runs to detect dehydration.
      Two slightly different devices can be used to detect dehydration. 1)diffuse optical
      spectroscopy and 2)spatial frequency domain imaging-modulated imaging The researchers can
      determined by use other methods to assess the level of dehydration status in runners. These
      methods will include taking weight and temperature before and after run, skin-fold
      measurements pre and post run, and obtaining saliva samples from  before and after run.

      The researchers can determined the study wuse non-invasive, laser light technology measure
      tissue water concentrations, as an indicator of dehydration.
