Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more\n      tumor cells. It is not yet known if chemotherapy plus radiation therapy is more effective\n      with or without surgery for lung cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combining cisplatin,\n      etoposide, and radiation therapy with or without surgery in treating patients who have stage\n      IIIA non-small cell lung cancer."

Patients are stratified by contralateral\n      mediastinal sampling or biopsy (yes vs no), tumor stage (T1 vs T2 vs T3), and performance\n      status (70-80% vs 90-100%). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive induction with cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8 and\n           etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Treatment continues every 4 weeks for 2 courses\n           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning within 24\n           hours of the first dose of chemotherapy, patients undergo induction radiotherapy 5 days\n           a week for 5 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n           Patients without local progression or distant metastases at 2-4 weeks after completion\n           of course 2 undergo resection approximately 3-5 weeks after completion of course 2. All\n           visible, accessible bronchopulmonary, hilar, and mediastinal lymph nodes are excised.\n           The choice of surgical procedure (thoracotomy, lobectomy, or pneumonectomy with en bloc\n           resection of tumor extending into the parietal pleura, chest wall, pericardium, or\n           diaphragm) is at the discretion of the surgeon. Patients who undergo resection receive\n           2 additional courses of chemotherapy alone beginning 4-6 weeks postoperatively.\n           Patients with unresectable disease or who are medically unfit for or refuse resection\n           receive 2 additional courses of chemotherapy alone beginning immediately after\n           completion of course 2.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo induction chemoradiotherapy as in arm I but do not undergo\n           resection. Patients without local progression or distant metastases within 1 week\n           before anticipated completion of induction radiotherapy receive 2 additional courses of\n           chemotherapy beginning immediately after completion of course 2. Patients without local\n           or distant progression after completion of course 4 undergo boost radiotherapy for 8\n           days.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every\n      6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 510 patients will be accrued for this study within 4.9 years."
