  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to compare the use of deep or standard neuromuscular
      blockade (NMB) in combination with low or standard insufflation pressure in participants
      undergoing a surgical procedure, laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Insufflation refers to the
      injection of carbon dioxide into the abdomen during the laparoscopic surgery, to allow
      visualization of and access to the surgical field. The primary hypothesis of the study is
      that the use of sustained deep NMB improves the surgeon's overall satisfaction with surgical
      conditions as compared to standard NMB. The inpatient surgery is performed on Day 1 and the
      participant remains hospitalized for at least 48 hours following the surgery (or at least 24
      hours following the surgery, if local practice does not allow 48 hours of hospitalization
      post surgery). On Day 8, a follow-up visit/contact including all participants occurs.
