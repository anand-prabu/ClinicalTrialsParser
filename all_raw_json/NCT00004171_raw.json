Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to\n      give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy followed by peripheral\n      stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's\n      lymphoma."
