  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will examine the effects of incorporating a soluble fibre blend into
      commonly consumed refined carbohydrate foods on sensory parameters and postprandial blood
      glucose. A sensory evaluation will be conducted in phase I to asses for differences between
      the control and fibre enriched samples of white bread, mashed potatoes, muffin, hot
      breakfast cereal. Phase II will be investigating the postprandial blood glucose responses of
      the 8 test foods from phase I.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Literature to date points to beneficial glycemic effects from consumption of soluble fibre;
      however, whole grain products consumption  is below recommendations possibly due to the
      presence of unappealing characteristic organoleptic properties.  White, refined products are
      still the choice of the general public.  As such, we propose to investigate the feasibility
      of increasing health benefits of commonly consumed white, refined carbohydrate products by
      incorporating a soluble fibre blend.

      This research is important to determine the feasibility of developing fibre enriched
      carbohydrate foods that maintains the original organoleptic properties and is effective in
      reducing postprandial blood glucose response.

      35 subjects will be recruited in phase I to complete a sensory evaluation on the test foods.
      Following tasting of the control and fibre-enriched samples, data on each subjects' liking
      or disliking will be collected through a 9-point hedonic scale.

      An acute crossover RCT will be conducted in phase II by 10 healthy individuals. Subjects
      will be randomized to consume one the treatments at each visit and blood glucose levels over
      120min and satiety scores will be measured.

    <description>The incorporation of viscous soluble fibre in commonly consumed carbohydrate foods will result in increase in subjective satiety compared to non soluble fibre enriched products. Satiety will be measured using a satiety questionnaire in which you will answer four questions about how full you feel.</description>
