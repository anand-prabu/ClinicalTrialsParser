Since prior studies have shown that distraction by a parent or nurse\n      can be an effective analgesic, there is reason to believe that tablet computer distraction\n      will similarly reduce pain. Participants in the control group will receive a cartoon on the\n      TV monitor in the patient room, while participants in the study group will receive a more\n      immersive distraction of playing a game or watching a cartoon (for children too young to\n      play a game) on a tablet computer. Data from this study will help inform best practices for\n      administering painful procedures in a way that minimizes pain."
