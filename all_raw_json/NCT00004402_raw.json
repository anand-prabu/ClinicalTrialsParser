Compare the rate of treatment failure in osteopetrosis patients receiving\n      interferon gamma in combination with calcitriol to the rate of treatment failure in patients\n      receiving calcitriol alone.\n\n      II.  Compare the number of adverse events or clinical manifestations of disease progression\n      occurring in these patients.\n\n      III.

Patients are\n      randomized to one of two arms (interferon gamma in combination with calcitriol or calcitriol\n      alone).\n\n      Arm I: Patients receive calcitriol once daily.  Interferon gamma is administered by\n      subcutaneous injection three times a week.\n\n      Arm II: Patients receive calcitriol once daily. Patients may continue treatment in the\n      absence of toxicity and disease progression.  If disease progression is diagnosed in the\n      control group, patients will then receive interferon gamma in combination with calcitriol.\n\n      Patients are followed every 4 weeks."
