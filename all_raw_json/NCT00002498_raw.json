            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate and duration of response of elderly patients with\n      advanced breast cancer treated with first-line chemotherapy with mitigated \"classical\" CMF\n      (cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil) vs. mitoxantrone (DHAD). II. Define the\n      morbidity of CMF and DHAD in elderly patients. III. Determine quality of life in these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by participating institution.\n      The first group receives oral cyclophosphamide on days 1 through 14 and intravenous\n      methotrexate and fluorouracil on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 4 weeks for a maximum of\n      6 courses. The second group receives intravenous mitoxantrone every 3 weeks for a maximum of\n      8 courses. Concomitant therapy with hepatotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., NSAIDs) or\n      corticosteroids (even as antiemetics) is not permitted in either group. Radiotherapy is\n      allowed provided no more than 50% of the bone marrow is irradiated and at least 1 indicator\n      lesion is unirradiated. Patients who complete therapy are followed every 3 months until\n      disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 60 patients will be accrued over approximately 1 year. If extreme\n      differences between arms exist after entry of 30 patients, accrual may be stopped early."
