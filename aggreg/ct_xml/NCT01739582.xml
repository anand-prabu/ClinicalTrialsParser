      This study is an open-label, multi-center Phase 3 extension study to evaluate the safety on
      continued treatment with Androxal in subjects who completed either ZA-301 or ZA-302.  The
      study requires 6 study visits (1 for an eye exam) and is approximately 7 months in duration.
       Subjects will be treated for 26 weeks, starting at a daily dose of 12.5 mg.  At Visit 2
      (Week 6) subjects who do not achieve morning T values ≥450 ng/dL will be up-titrated to 25
      mg.  Safety will be assessed by physical and visual acuity exams, slit lamp and fundoscopy,
      refraction eye exams, clinical laboratory tests and adverse event reporting.
