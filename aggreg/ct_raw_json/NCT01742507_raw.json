It is performed as\n      part of the PCI procedure.  OCT is the optical analogue of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS),\n      except that it can provide much higher resolution of coronary cross sectional images than\n      IVUS.  The LightLab C7XR OCT system (Frequency Domain OCT) used in this Hospital has\n      obtained full CE Mark, approved by the US FDA, and approved for clinical use in Hong Kong.\n      It has been shown to be safe in clinical settings and has been used in over 300 patients\n      without complication at Queen Mary Hospital.\n\n      In this study, stent coverage and neo-intimal growth between zotarolimus-eluting stents\n      (ZES) and biolimus-eluting stents (BES) will be compared by using OCT at 9 month and\n      specific post-intervention re-study intervals.\n\n      The investigators objective is to investigate the clinical impact and OCT difference on\n      early stent healing and late lumen loss between the two new-generation limus-eluting-stents\n      - Resolute Integrity and Biomatrix, which differ in stent design, eluting drug and coating\n      polymer."

Patients with\n      symptomatic coronary artery diseases in 2 or 3 coronary vessels requiring PCI are eligible\n      for the study.  PCI will be performed in the usual manner to all the study lesions in the\n      same procedure.  In a randomized fashion, each patient will have one artery with critical\n      disease(s) treated by the Resolute Integrity Stent(s) and the other artery treated by the\n      Biomatrix Stent(s).\n\n      Baseline OCT data will be obtained right after stenting.  The remaining coronary artery, if\n      diseased and required PCI treatment, will be treated during the angiographic and OCT\n      follow-up as a staged procedure.  Patients will be randomly assigned into 5 groups with\n      equal number, receiving a follow-up coronary angiogram with OCT from 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 months\n      interval post-intervention.  Each patient will serve as his/her own control comparing the 2\n      types of stents.  At 9-month post-intervention, all patients will receive a second follow-up\n      coronary angiogram with OCT.  All OCT data analyses will be performed in a blinded fashion\n      by a core laboratory. Phone follow up will be carried out for cardiac events at 1 year and 2\n      year of post intervention."
