    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of TARGIN administration as an analgesic to
      Korean patients treated with opioid analgesics for moderate-to-severe cancer pain under
      conditions of daily practice.

    <textblock>
      An open-label, multi-center, nonrandomized, prospective, non-interventional, observational
      phase IV trial.

      At the first visit, a detailed medical history is taken, including previous analgesics and
      concomitant treatment. After inclusion, patients enter a 4-week observation period during
      which they will receive bid of TARGIN 10/5mg and/or 20/10mg. The dose adjustments of TARGIN
      as well as of analgesic co-medication, rescue-medication and other treatments (e.g.
      laxatives) can be performed at any time-point during the observation period by the physician
      in dependence of medical demand. The asymmetric dose is allowed during the observation
      period by the physician's judgment. (e.g. 10/5 mg in the morning and 20/10 mg in the
      evening).

      Data are gathered using interview-administered questionnaires at baseline (visit 1) and
      study end (visit 2).

      During the observation period, unscheduled visits are allowed after the first visit due to
      inadequate pain control or occurrence of adverse events.

        Primary endpoint in the study is the change in numeric rating scales (NRS) such as score
        for average pain levels over the previous 24 hours.

        In the previous study (U. Schutter, S. Grunert, C. Meyer, T. Schmldt, T. Nolte. Innovative
        pain therapy with a fixed combination of prolonged-release oxycodone/naloxone: a large
        observational study under conditions of daily practice, Current Medical Research &amp;
        Option), mean change in average pain levels is 2.5 and 95% confidence interval [2.3, 2.7].
        Based on the result, standard deviation 4.73 is calculated.

        In this study, standard deviation is assumed to be 4.73. Therefore, the sample size is 409
        considering that significance level is 0.05, confidence interval ±0.46. The drop-out rate
        is considered by 20% then sample size is 512.
