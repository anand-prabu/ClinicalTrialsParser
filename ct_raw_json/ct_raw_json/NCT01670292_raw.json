This study is designed to monitor both\n      physiological and patient self-report outcome variables. In addition, as there is little\n      quantitative information on Spinal Manipulation Technique procedures reported in clinical\n      trials, the study is designed to collect preliminary kinetic measures of the spinal\n      manipulation technique delivery (i.e. force-time profiles)."

The following data\n      will be collected: participant characteristics that may predict outcome or be modifiers of\n      force used by provider (gender, age, height, weight, and Body Mass Index); spinal segment\n      load during the pre-load and thrusting phases (force and moment in the pre-load phase, peak\n      load, loading rate, and thrust duration; physiological measures (posterior-anterior global\n      stiffness and flexion-relaxation); patient-centered outcomes of back pain and function; and\n      concomitant medications and treatments.\n\n      Study participants (n= 80) will be recruited from the Quad Cities metro area. A team of\n      experienced chiropractic clinicians working at the Palmer Center for Chiropractic Research\n      will treat study participants. Each of the study participants will receive 2 High Velocity\n      Low Amplitude Spinal Manipulation treatment visits per week over a 6 week period. The\n      physiological assessments will be performed immediately before and after Spinal Manipulation\n      delivery during treatment visits 1, 5 & 12 (6 sets of assessments in total). During these\n      same treatment visits, we will also capture the kinetic measures during Spinal Manipulation\n      delivery for spinal segment load analysis. We will further collect thrusting force-time\n      profiles of all Spinal Manipulation delivered in the course of treatment for thrust contact\n      force analysis. Participant patient-centered outcomes will be measured at baseline 1,\n      treatment visits 1, 6, and 13."
