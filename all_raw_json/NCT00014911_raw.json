The study also is\n      designed to learn more about diabetes control using islet cell transplantation.\n\n      This is a Phase I/II study (a study that examines effectiveness and looks for side effects).\n      The transplanting of islet cells has been studied in Type 1 diabetic patients whose blood\n      sugar levels will not stay normal, despite intensive insulin therapy. A recent study\n      conducted in Edmonton, Canada, was able to demonstrate that islet transplantation led to\n      insulin independence in a majority of the patients treated. This study extends the results\n      obtained from the Edmonton study, which used islet transplantation in Type 1 diabetic\n      patients with steroid-free immunosuppression."

            "textblock": "This is a Phase I/II study (a study that examines effectiveness and looks for side effects).\n      The transplanting of islet cells has been studied in Type 1 diabetic patients whose blood\n      sugar levels will not stay normal, despite intensive insulin therapy. A recent study\n      conducted in Edmonton, Canada, was able to demonstrate that islet transplantation led to\n      insulin independence in a majority of the patients treated. This study extends the results\n      obtained from the Edmonton study, which used islet transplantation in Type 1 diabetic\n      patients with steroid-free immunosuppression.\n\n      Eligible patients were randomly selected from the total pool of people who applied through\n      the Immune Tolerance Network. Patients will receive at least 10,000 \"islet equivalents\" per\n      kilogram (2.2 pounds) of body weight. This likely will require 2 separate islet infusions\n      from 2 separate donors. Immediately before the first transplant, patients will be given\n      anti-rejection (immune suppressing) drugs, including tacrolimus and sirolimus (orally) and\n      daclizumab (intravenously). The islets will be infused into the liver through a tube placed\n      in the portal vein. Heparin (a medication to prevent blood clots) will be administered with\n      the islet infusion.  A longer-acting form of heparin will also be given by daily injections\n      during the next week after each transplant.  After surgery, patients will receive insulin\n      intravenously for 24 hours. Patients will have an abdominal ultrasound and blood tests to\n      determine liver function. If fewer than 10,000 islets were transplanted, patients will\n      continue insulin treatment, with the dosages adjusted if necessary to account for the\n      transplanted islets. They will take daclizumab every 2 weeks for 8 weeks and tacrolimus and\n      sirolimus daily. Patients will be given antibiotics to prevent infections. Blood tests to\n      determine how much immunosuppressant drug is in the blood will be performed until the drug\n      is at a stable level. Periodically there will be tests to see if the islet cells are\n      functioning. Blood will be drawn to check drug levels and for other tests routinely. Daily\n      insulin requirements will be checked, and these will be recorded monthly. Patients will be\n      followed for at least 1 year post last islet transplantation. Additional follow-up may be\n      provided at least annually for up to 9 years post first transplantation."
