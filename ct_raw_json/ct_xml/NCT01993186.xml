      PRIMARY EFFICACY HYPOTHESIS:

      UX007 is more effective than placebo for the reduction of seizures in patients with Glut1
      DS, as measured by the reduction from baseline in frequency of generalized or partial-onset
      seizures between Weeks 2 and 8 of treatment.

      STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY:

      UX007G-CL201 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, adaptive
      study to assess the safety and efficacy of UX007 in Glut1 DS. The study will enroll
      pediatric subjects who are currently not on, or not fully compliant with a ketogenic diet.
      Enrolled subjects are otherwise able to maintain their standard treatment with 1-3
      antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) throughout the duration of the study.

      Beginning with the screening visit, subjects will record seizure frequency during the 6-week
      Baseline Period.. At the end of the Baseline Period, subjects will be randomized and dosing
      will be initiated using a 2-week titration schedule until the subject has reached 35% of
      total daily calories from study drug.

      After the initial 8-week double-blind Treatment Period, the open-label Extension Period will
      begin, wherein all subjects will be treated with UX007 through Week 52 of the study. Long
      term safety and persistence of effect of UX007 will be assessed during this Extension
      Period. Subjects who complete treatment through Week 52 may have the option to continue
      UX007 treatment, if warranted, in a separate open-label extension study.
