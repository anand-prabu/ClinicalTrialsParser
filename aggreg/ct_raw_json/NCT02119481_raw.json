The objectives are to study and answer questions regarding effects of the such\n      training in a randomized controlled trial including the following outcome measures: physical\n      and mental health status, perceived stress, post-traumatic stress symptoms, psychological\n      well-being, and sleep quality. In addition to the primary aim, the investigators plan to\n      explore potential mechanisms through which mindfulness training lead to improvement in\n      perceived stress, well-being and sleep-quality. This will be studied by mediational\n      analyses."
