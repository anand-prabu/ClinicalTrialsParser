The investigators will simultaneously study\n      300 control subjects who are receiving usual care in other regions of the province of\n      Quebec. Our hypothesis is that the program will improve the quality of life of patients with\n      asthma exposed to the program, asthma control, inhaled corticosteroid adherence, knowledge\n      of asthma, and a number of variables that relate to the conceptual model selected as a\n      framework for this study (the PRECEDE-PROCEED model of Green and Kreuter)."
