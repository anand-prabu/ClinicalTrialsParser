Drugs used in chemotherapy\n      use different ways to make tumor cells stop dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining\n      monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of trastuzumab plus paclitaxel in\n      treating patients who have metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER2."

Patients receive trastuzumab alone during course 1 and then in\n      combination with paclitaxel during subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 4 weeks until\n      patients achieve a sustained complete response of 8 weeks or disease progression occurs.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
