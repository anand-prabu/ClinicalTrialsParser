        Inclusion Criteria:

        The following initial inclusion criteria must be met for a subject to be enrolled and
        considered for the MRI-procedure:

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

          -  Able and willing to complete MRI testing

          -  Able to provide written informed consent

          -  Available for follow-up visit at the study site

          -  Implanted with an ICD System consisting only of an Iforia DR-T and Linoxsmart S 65 /
             Linoxsmart SD 65/18 with Setrox S 53 atrial lead or Iforia VR-T DX and Linoxsmart S
             DX 65/15 or Linoxsmart S DX 65/17.

          -  ICD implanted pectorally

          -  All ICD system components implanted, repositioned, or exchanged at least 5 weeks
             prior to enrollment

          -  Underlying rhythm identifiable during sensing test

          -  All pacing thresholds are measureable and are less than or equal to 2.0 V @ 0.4 ms
             (Criterion does not apply to atrial pacing threshold for subjects with an Iforia DR-T
             that have AF and are permanently programmed to VVI and for subjects with an Iforia
             VR-T DX)

          -  Ventricular sensing is measurable and &gt;6.5mV

          -  Absence of phrenic nerve stimulation at 5.0V and 1.0 ms

          -  Pacing impedance is between 200 and 1500 ohm

          -  Shock Impedance is between 30 and 90 ohm

          -  Able and willing to use the CardioMessenger II

        At the pre-MRI procedure, the following procedure-related criteria must be met for the
        subject to undergo the MRI scan:

          -  Absence of phrenic nerve stimulation at 5.0V @ 1.0 ms

          -  /pacing threshold at Pre-MRI follow-up - pacing threshold at baseline/ â‰¤ 0.5 V (ICD
             Lead Only)

          -  All pacing thresholds are measureable and are less than or equal to 2.0 V @ 0.4 ms
             (Criterion does not apply to atrial pacing threshold for subjects with an Iforia DR-T
             that have AF and are permanently programmed to VVI and for subjects with an Iforia
             VR-T DX.)

          -  Ventricular sensing is measurable and &gt;6.5mV

          -  The ICD system has been implanted for at least six weeks.

          -  Subject did not have an ICD or lead explant, exchange or reposition in the previous 6
             weeks.

          -  All lead pacing impedances are between 200 and 1500 ohm

          -  Shock impedance is between 30 and 90 ohm

          -  Battery status is at least 30% of capacity
