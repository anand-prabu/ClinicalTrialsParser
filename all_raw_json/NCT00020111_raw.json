Patients are stratified according to\n      disease (acute promyelocytic leukemia [APL] vs non-APL).\n\n        -  Stratum I (APL patients): Patients receive standard-dose arsenic trioxide IV over 2\n           hours daily 5 days a week for 4 weeks. Treatment continues every 6 weeks for up to 3\n           courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n        -  Stratum II (Non-APL patients): Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of\n           arsenic trioxide (according to the stratum 1 schedule above) until the maximum\n           tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at\n           which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the\n           MTD is determined, additional patients are accrued to receive treatment with arsenic\n           trioxide at the recommended phase II dose.\n\n      Leukemia patients in both strata without progressive disease who have not achieved complete\n      remission after the first 20 doses may continue to receive arsenic trioxide for 2 additional\n      weeks.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 18 patients will be accrued for stratum I of this study\n      within 2-3 years. A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for stratum II of this study\n      within 1-2 years."
