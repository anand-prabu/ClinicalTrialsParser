The\n      separated dendritic cells are pulsed with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) RNA. Patients\n      receive CEA RNA pulsed dendritic cells intravenously every 2 weeks for a total of 4 doses.\n      Patients undergo a second leukapheresis 2 weeks after the last dendritic cell infusion to\n      obtain specimens for immunologic tests. Patients with extra doses of dendritic cells\n      available may receive additional doses of CEA RNA pulsed dendritic cells every 2 months in\n      the absence of unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48, and every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years."
