            "textblock": "Obesity is a leading cause of preventable death in the United States, with approximately\n      300,000 related deaths per year. The most commonly performed bariatric surgical\n      interventions are Roux-en Y gastric bypass (RGB) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric band\n      placement. Despite the overall initial success of RGB to induce significant EBWL in the\n      majority of patients, significant weight regain occurs in about 25% of patients at 2+ years\n      following surgery.  Given the preliminary success of endoscopic, non-surgical salvage\n      interventions for the failed (uncomplicated) RGB patient, the present study will assess the\n      feasibility of using endoscopic radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to treat the gastric pouch and\n      stoma with the intent to cause tissue contraction and decreased compliance.  A reduction of\n      size and compliance may, as others have reported, result in re-establish weight loss and\n      achieve an acceptable EBWL with minimal patient morbidity."
