    <textblock>
      The investigators are trying to determine two different stress management techniques in
      couples undergoing IVF. One arm will be randomized to learning these techniques by
      themselves by watching and following instructions on a digital video disc (DVD). The other
      arm will have an in-person class that will teach the couples different stress reduction
      techniques.

    <description>Miscarriage will be defined as a biochemical or clinical miscarriage. A biochemical miscarriage will include a rise and then subsequent fall in beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (BhCG) to less than 5 IU/L.
