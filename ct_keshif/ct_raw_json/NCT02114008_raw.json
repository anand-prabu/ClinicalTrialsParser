All patients received both oral and written\n      information about the protocol at the outpatient clinic.\n\n      All the endoscopic procedures began at 9 AM, and were performed by the same board-certified\n      endoscopist, JMS, who was blinded as to the duration of the fast. The endoscopies were\n      conducted at Gastroclinica, Cuiaba, MT, in the period from April to June, 2013. Sedation was\n      performed by a board-certified anesthesiologist, who was also blinded as to the duration of\n      the fast. The anesthetic regimem included a intravenous bolus of 2 ml of lidocaine\n      hydrochloride (Astra Zeneca, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil) followed by 100 to 150mg of propofol before\n      endoscopy. Digital oximetry was monitored  throughout the procedure. Patients were\n      positioned in the lateral recumbent position. A flexible electronic videoendoscope (EG2770K;\n      Pentax Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) of 9 mm in outer diameter was used.  The main outcome\n      variable was the RGV measured by the endoscopist after aspiration of gastric residue."
