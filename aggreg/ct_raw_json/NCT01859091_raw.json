Presence of submental fat, which in the investigator's opinion, may benefit from the\n             treatment.\n\n          3. No weight change exceeding 10 pounds in the preceding month.\n\n          4. Agreement to maintain his/her weight (i.e., within 10 pounds) by not making any major\n             changes in their diet or lifestyle during the course of the study.\n\n          5. Subject has signed a written informed consent form.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria\n\n          1. Skin laxity in the neck or chin area for which reduction in submental fat may.\n\n          2. Evidence of any cause of enlargement in the submental area other than localized\n             subcutaneous fat.\n\n          3. Enlargement on the anterior neck that may prevent the proper placement of the\n             applicator.\n\n          4. Treatment with dermal fillers, radiofrequency or laser procedures, or chemical peels\n             in the neck or chin area.\n\n          5. Botulinum toxin injections within the neck or chin area.\n\n          6. History of a fat reduction procedure in the area of intended treatment.\n\n          7. History of prior surgery in the area of intended treatment.\n\n          8. Current dental infection.\n\n          9. Known history of cryoglobulinemia, cold urticaria, or paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria.\n\n         10. Known history of Raynaud's disease, or any known condition with a response to cold\n             exposure that limits blood flow to the skin.\n\n         11. Impaired skin sensation or thermal sensitivity in the intended treatment area.\n\n         12. Open or infected wounds in the intended treatment area.\n\n         13. Currently taking or has taken diet pills or weight control supplements within the\n             past month.\n\n         14. Any dermatological conditions, such as scars in the location of the treatment area\n             that may interfere with the treatment or evaluation.\n\n         15. Active implanted device such as a pacemaker, defibrillator, or drug delivery system.\n\n         16. Pregnant or intending to become pregnant in the next 5 months.\n\n         17. Lactating or has been lactating in the past 6 months.\n\n         18. Unable or unwilling to comply with the study requirements.\n\n         19. Currently enrolled in a clinical study of any other unapproved investigational drug\n             or device.\n\n         20. Any other condition or laboratory value that would, in the professional opinion of\n             the investigator, potentially affect the subject's response or the integrity of the\n             data or would pose an unacceptable risk to the subject."
