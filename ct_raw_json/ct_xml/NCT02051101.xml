  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Port Wine Stain birthmark is a congenital, progressive vascular malformation of skin that
      occurs in an estimated 3-5 children per 1,000 live births.  Approximately 1,500,000
      individuals in the United States and thirty-two million people worldwide have Port Wine
      Stain birthmarks.Since most malformations occur on the face, Port Wine Stain is a clinically
      significant problem in the majority of patients.
