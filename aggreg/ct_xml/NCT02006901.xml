      Introduction: This observational study is designed to test the equivalence between the
      clinical effectiveness of microdecompression and laminectomy in the surgical treatment of
      central lumbar spinal stenosis. Lumbar spinal stenosis is the most frequent indication for
      spinal surgery in the elderly, and as the oldest segment of the population continues to grow
      its prevalence is likely to increase. However, data on surgical outcomes are limited. Open
      or wide decompressive laminectomy, often combined with medial facetectomy and foraminotomy,
      was formerly the standard treatment. In recent years a growing tendency towards less
      invasive decompressive procedures has emerged. Many spine surgeons today perform
      microdecompression for central lumbar spinal stenosis.

      Prospectively registered treatment and outcome data are obtained from the Norwegian Registry
      for Spine Surgery (NORspine).
