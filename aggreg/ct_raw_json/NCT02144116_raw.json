It has been reported to be about 2-5% of the\n      general global population. Fibromyalgia is associated with balance problems and increased\n      fall frequency. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of an 8 weeks\n      dance-movement therapy programme on balance, strength, flexibility and quality of life in\n      patients with fibromyalgia."

Balance or postural stability is a very complex task that involves the\n      integration of multiple sensory inputs to execute appropriate neuromuscular activity needed\n      to maintain balance.\n\n      Patients with fibromyalgia have also muscle weakness. Muscle strength depends on both the\n      cross-sectional area of the muscle and the neural activity. Range of movement and quality of\n      life have also been reported to be affected."

For the Mini BESTest, the original BESTest 4 level (0 - 3) scoring was revised to 3 levels (0 - 2) due to redundancy. Total score = 28 points per test directions. Two items have right and left assessment in which the lower score is used within the total score (directions specify which to use).
