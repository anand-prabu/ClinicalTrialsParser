        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy Male and Female adults over 50 years of age at time of enrollment.

             surgically sterilized or 2 years post-menopausal

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any components of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient conditions including
             leukemia, multiple myeloma, lympoma, Hodgkin's disease, etc.

          -  History of autoimmune disease including multiple sclerosis(MS), lupus, polymyositis,

          -  Coagulation disorder contraindicating IM vaccination

          -  Use of any immunosuppressive therapies within the preceding 3 months including
             anti-cancer chemotherapies or radiation therapies and medication such as
             cyclophosphamide, 6-mercaptourine, azathioprine, methotrexate, steroids, cyclosporine
             A, rapamycin, leflunomide, TNF-α antagonist (For corticosteroids, this will mean
             prednisone, or equivalent dose of ≥ 15mg/day. Inhaled and topical steroids are
             allowed.)

          -  Serious chronic disorders including metastatic malignancy, severe chronic obstructive

             vaccine or is scheduled to receive any other licensed vaccine within 1 month
             following receipt of study vaccine.

          -  Subject has received diphtheria toxoid within 6 months prior to receipt of study
             vaccine or planned to receive diphtheria toxoid during full period of the study
