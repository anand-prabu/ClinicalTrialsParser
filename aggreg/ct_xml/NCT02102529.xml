      Endometriosis is one of the most frequent benign diseases that can affect women in their
      reproductive age. In severe form, the colon or rectum may be involved. It has been shown
      that the surgical treatment improve typical symptoms like pain and dyspareunia. The
      investigators evaluated the functional results and quality of life after laparoscopic
      colonic resection for endometriosis

      A clinical analysis  of thirty women with typical symptoms including pelvic pain,
      infertility and endometriotic bowel lesions who underwent laparoscopic surgery including
