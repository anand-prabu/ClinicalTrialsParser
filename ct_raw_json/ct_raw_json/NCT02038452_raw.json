            "textblock": "Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a common condition in which a nerve (known as the median\n      nerve) is squeezed where it passes through the wrist. It can cause pain or aching, tingling\n      or numbness in the affected hand. It may disturb sleep, or affect ability to do day to day\n      things.\n\n      There have been several studies into the best treatment of patients with severe symptoms of\n      CTS who are referred to a hospital for treatment. However, little is known about the best\n      treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms who visit their GP but do not require\n      hospital treatment.\n\n      The study will investigate whether a steroid injection is clinically effective in reducing\n      symptoms and improving function in the short term (6 weeks) compared to a night splint in\n      people consulting with mild to moderate CTS in primary care.We will study the effects of\n      these 2 treatments over 6 weeks and at 6 months. Subject to further funding, the Study will\n      also look at whether these 6 weeks of treatment are effective 1 year and 2 years later.\n\n      The study will take place in up to 50 GP practices and hospital clinics across the UK.\n      Patients aged 18 and over who have been diagnosed with mild to moderate CTS which has been\n      present for at least 6 weeks will be eligible for inclusion.\n\n      The steroid is a drug called \"DepoMedrone.\"  This drug is already widely used to treat CTS.\n      In this study, one injection will be given. The splint is made of elastic and has an\n      aluminium bar which sits on the palm of the hand. In this study, the splint will be worn at\n      night for 6 weeks. Each participant will  receive either a single steroid injection or a\n      splint, and will be asked to complete up to 5 questionnaires over 2 years."
