  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periconceptional supplementation with folic acid - the synthetic form of the B-vitamin
      folate - reduces the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as spina bifida. The
      underlying biochemical mechanisms for how folic acid affects health outcomes however are
      unknown. The naturally occurring form 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) is now available and
      discussed as an adequate substitute to folic acid. This study aims to determine the effect
      of folic acid compared to 5-MTHF on cellular mechanisms. Stable isotope tracer protocols
      will be used that allow determining the effect of folic acid on the dynamics of metabolic
      pathways in the human body.

      Hypothesis: Supplementation with high-dose folic acid alters the turnover rate of folate
      dependent pathways in healthy humans; but 5-MTHF does not. Genetic variations in a key
      enzyme of the folate metabolism will aggravate the effect of folic acid on the metabolic
      pathways.
