Lung function normally declines with age, and\n      both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and ART have been shown to case a decline\n      in lung function as well.  Decline in lung function can be an early indicator of chronic\n      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a significant cause of sickness and death in people\n      with HIV.  In this study, lung function will be measured at baseline and every year\n      thereafter by using a spirometer."
