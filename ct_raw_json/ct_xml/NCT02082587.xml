  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As treatments improve and patients live longer with cancer, even after it has spread to the
      brain, efforts to improve quality of life are growing.  Neurocognitive function (thinking
      ability and memory) is an area of particular concern for patients with brain metastases
      (cancer that can spread to the brain). Although there are established tests to measure
      neurocognitive function, these require a face-to-face assessment and can take a long time to
      complete.  As a result, efforts to use these tests to measure changes in neurocognitive
      function in patients following treatment for brain metastases have resulted in a large
      proportion of patients who do not return for follow-up.  This has limited the ability to
      evaluate the impact of current treatments on neurocognitive function.  This study aims to
      evaluate a shorter, telephone-based neurocognitive assessment tool, which would make it
      easier for patients to complete these tests in follow-up. If this new tool is found to
      reliably measure neurocognitive function, it could be used for future studies evaluating new
      interventions that prevent or treat neurocognitive deterioration following treatment of
      brain metastases. This is the first prospective study to evaluate the feasibility and
      reliability of a novel telephone-based brief neurocognitive assessment battery (Toronto BNB)
      compared with the same battery delivered face-to-face in this population. The investigators
      hypothesize that telephone administration of this brief neurocognitive battery will reliably
      evaluate neurocognitive function and improve patient ability to complete follow-up
      assessments.

    <description>Cronbach's alpha coefficient at each time point (baseline, 1 month, 4 months) will be calculated to assess the following z scores: Patient results from individual neurocognitive tests will be converted to a z score (the number of standard deviations above or below the mean).  Overall averaged global z scores will be compared between the telephone and clinic assessments using the Toronto BNB. Cronbach's alpha coefficient will be evaluated as follows: 0-0.2 poor agreement; 0.3-0.4 fair agreement; 0.5-0.6 moderate agreement; 0.7-0.8 strong agreement; &gt;0.8 very strong agreement.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult (&gt; 18 years old) with newly diagnosed brain metastases planned for whole brain
             radiotherapy

          -  Performance status ECOG 0-2

          -  English-speaking (due to small sample-size in this pilot study, only English testing
             will be completed)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior whole brain radiotherapy

          -  Presence of any condition which can prevent completion of neurocognitive assessment,
             including:

          -  Hearing impairment which is sufficient to prevent the patient from    comprehending
             English instructions in a quiet environment

          -  Major psychiatric diagnosis or neurological condition associated with cognitive
             impairment which, in the judgement of the investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for study participation (e.g., schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis,
             Parkinson's disease, prior ischemic stroke, dementia, traumatic brain injury with
             loss of consciousness for greater than 30 minutes, expressive/receptive aphasia,
             developmental delay)

          -  Patients with planned systemic therapy or additional radiotherapy within the interval
             between clinic and telephone Toronto BNB testing

          -  Minimal English skills such that subjects would be unable to follow simple English
             instructions (either verbal or written) or be unable to read questionnaires of a
             grade 8 standard with the help of a research assistant.
