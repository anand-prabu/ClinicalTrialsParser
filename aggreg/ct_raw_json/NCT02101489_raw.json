Women who have chosen to undergo trans-vaginal tape\n      sling (TVT) for stress urinary incontinence will be asked to enroll in this randomized\n      trial. Ten women will be randomized to receive a preoperative ultrasound before surgery and\n      20 women will have our normal pre-operative assessment (which does not include an\n      ultrasound) for the treatment of symptomatic stress urinary incontinence. Randomization will\n      be performed by the FPMRS study coordinator after a woman has given her informed consent and\n      meets the study criteria. Women randomized to receive a preoperative 3-D ultrasound will\n      then undergo a 5-minute trans-vaginal ultrasound (BK Flex Focus ultrasound with the 8838\n      transvaginal probe). The ultrasound will measure the urethral length and identify the\n      mid-urethra region for that patient. The measurement will be placed in the pre-operative\n      note. Transvaginal ultrasound is well-tolerated and has no complications associated with it.\n       Women who receive our \"usual care\" will have no pre-operative ultrasound performed. Women\n      enrolled in the study will then proceed to surgery as scheduled.\n\n      At the time of surgery the information on the length of the urethra will be used to\n      determine the placement of the sling. The surgery will proceed in its usual fashion.\n\n      Using the BK Flex Focus ultrasound with a trans-vaginal (8838) and translabial transducers.\n      These transducers are commonly used to assess for pelvic masses, abnormalities or foreign\n      body. We will measure and record the length of the urethra and will map out the mid-urethral\n      point for sling placement; we will also compare the urethral length measurement obtained by\n      preoperative 3D ultrasound to intra-operative urethral length measurement using a Foley\n      catheter. Measurements will be recorded from the bladder neck to the urethral opening. A\n      representational image will be saved."
