They are both developed and popular in China. Clinical practice showed that they\n      were both safe, efficient and cost-effective. Recurrent rates of both procedures after 1\n      year follow-up were about 10%, and quality of life improved significantly from the baseline,\n      while the.complications are different.\n\n      The purpose of this multicenter, prospective, and comparative study is to evaluate the\n      effectiveness and safety of these two procedures in the treatment of symptomatic pelvic\n      organ prolapse Stage III in China."
