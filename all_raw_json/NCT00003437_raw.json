Drugs used in chemotherapy\n      use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining\n      hormone therapy with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells. It is not yet known which\n      hormone therapy and chemotherapy regimen is most effective for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of different steroid\n      therapy and chemotherapy regimens in treating children who have acute lymphoblastic\n      leukemia."

Patients are randomized twice during the\n      study: prednisolone vs dexamethasone and mercaptopurine vs thioguanine. Patients are\n      initially stratified according to risk status (standard vs intermediate vs high). Patients\n      are stratified at the second randomization according to gender, age (under 2 years vs 2 to 9\n      years vs over 9 years), WBC (under 50,000/mm^3 vs over 50,000/mm^3), steroid allocation, and\n      early response (slow vs rapid).\n\n      Patients with verified CNS disease receive weekly intrathecal (IT) methotrexate until 2\n      consecutive clear cerebrospinal fluid samples have been obtained. Cranial radiotherapy is\n      administered over 15-21 days during weeks 5-8 concurrently with methotrexate IT in the\n      appropriate regimen. Following radiotherapy, these patients receive monthly methotrexate IT\n      for 1 year and then every 3 months until the end of therapy.\n\n      Patients with testicular infiltration receive additional radiation fractions daily for 12\n      days to both testes during weeks 5-8.\n\n      Regimen A (standard-risk patients)\n\n        -  Remission induction: Patients receive the assigned oral steroid (prednisolone or\n           dexamethasone) twice a day on days 1-28; vincristine IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; and\n           asparaginase IM three days a week for 9 doses beginning on day 4.
