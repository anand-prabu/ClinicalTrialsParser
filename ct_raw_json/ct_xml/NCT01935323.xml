  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      6-week, single site, two parallel arm, randomized, controlled trial comparing the
      effectiveness of a High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) versus a continuous Moderate
      Intensity Training (MIT) program on cardiovascular and metabolic health outcomes in
      overweight adolescent males. HIIT training may be a potent time-efficient strategy to induce
      similar metabolic and cardiovascular adaptations typically associated with MIT.

    <description>ELISA assay purchased from NW LifeSciences. Prior to analysis, all serum samples were assayed for protein concentration based on the methods of Bradford and adjusted to 4 mg・mL－1 protein using a phosphate buffer. Protein carbonyls, a measure of protein oxidation, were analyzed in duplicate in 50 μl of sera using a commercially available ELISA kit (NWK-PCK01).The intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were 2.7 % and 5%. The lower detection limit of the assay was 0.1 nmol/mg.</description>

    <description>Participants will perform the HIIT protocol on an electronically-braked cycle ergometer (Quinton Excalibur, Quinton Instrument Company, Bothell, WA). Participants will perform a 20-minute protocol, consisting of four minutes of cycling at 15% of maximum anaerobic power (Max-AP) followed by 30 seconds at 85% of Max-AP. These workloads will be based upon pre-trial Wingate tests. This cycle was repeated four times within each protocol, ending with two minutes at 15% of Max-AP. This will be performed 3d/wk for 6wks, with at least 24 hrs between each session.</description>
