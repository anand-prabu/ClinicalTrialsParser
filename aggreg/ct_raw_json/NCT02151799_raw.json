Studies regarding eating disorder\n      symptoms are lacking. Therefore studies using standardized and validated are needed. We\n      decided to prospectively study quality of life, psychological distress, and eating disorder\n      symptoms in body contouring (abdominoplasty or liposuction) patient populations. Used\n      questionnaires are 15D quality of life, Raitasalo's modification of the Beck Inventory, and\n      the Eating Disorder Inventory. We hypothesize that aesthetic body contouring plastic surgery\n      has notable quality of life effects."
