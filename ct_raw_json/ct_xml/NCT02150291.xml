  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since success of the combination therapy with PEG-IFN and RBV is contingent on maintaining
      adequate doses of both drugs throughout the treatment period, the emergence of hematological
      side effects is expected and requires intervention. The hematological adverse effects lead
      to a trade-off between continuing the treatment with optimal dosage, to clear the virus,
      exacerbating thereby the side effects versus decreasing dosage to relieve severe anemia,
      reducing thereby the chances of achieving sustained virological response (SVR).  Therefore,
      we aimed at giving Folic acid® and Neurobion® to HCV-infected patients during treatment with
      different types of PEG-IFN plus ribavirin in an attempt to evaluate its efficacy and safety
      as a prophylactic treatment to prevent hematological adverse effects. Preventing adverse
      effects without interfering with the therapeutic efficacy of different types of PEG-IFN plus
      ribavirin in HCV patients will lead to better health outcomes and improvement in their
      quality of life (HRQOL).

    <description>Maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) levels &gt;750 cells/mm3, hemoglobin levels &gt;10.5 g/dL to prevent adjustment to the PEG-INF dose or its temporary suspension. Moreover, to maintain a sustained platelet level above 45,000 platelet/mm3. During therapy thrombocytopenia was assessed at levels of 50,000 and 25,000/µl, since these levels are the usual thresholds for dose reductions or discontinuation of peginterferon alfa/ribavirin therapy.</description>

    <description>Biochemical improvement of liver function and sustained virological response (SVR). Biochemical improvement was defined as a decrease in alanine transaminase (ALT) level and Aspartate transaminase (AST). A sustained virological response (SVR) is deﬁned as undetectable serum HCV RNA (&lt; 51 IU/ml) 24 weeks after the completion of treatment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Chronic hepatitis C patients of both sexes were eligible for inclusion if they were HCV
        RNA positive, naive to PEG-INF and RBV, and had abnormal serum alanine transaminase levels
        on two occasions during the preceding six months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with significant hematological abnormalities at baseline, such as neutropenia
        (ANC &lt;1200 x 103 cells/µL), thrombocytopenia (&lt;70 x 103 cells/ µL), and anemia (&lt;10.5
        g/dL), were excluded. Patients were also excluded from study participation if they had
        serum creatinine ≥1.70 mg/dL (150 µmol), hepatitis B surface antigen positivity,
        decompensated cirrhosis, or other forms of liver disease not attributable to HCV. Patients
        with severe depression or psychosis, uncontrolled seizures, poorly controlled
        cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, or autoimmune disorders were also ineligible.
        Women were ineligible for study participation if they were pregnant or unwilling to use at
        least 2 forms of effective contraception during the entire study period.
