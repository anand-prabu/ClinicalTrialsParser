The effects of these\n      agents on cognitive performance (eg, attention and memory) and on the brain are being\n      measured. The hypothesis is that stimulants will have a positive effect on cognitive\n      performance.\n\n      Each study participant will receive once a placebo and once methylphenidate or modafinil or\n      caffeine. Methylphenidate (also known as Ritalin \u00ae) is a drug that is used in the treatment\n      of attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children, adolescents and adults.\n      Modafinil ( Vigil \u00ae) is a drug used in the treatment of narcolepsy (sleeping sickness). In\n      the study. These substances are given in the study only once and in the dosages in which is\n      also used for the treatment of the above diseases. In the case of caffeine , the dosage\n      corresponds to two cups of coffee."
