TissuGlu\u00ae will be applied to the test group prior to\n      standard closure of the abdominal flap thereby eliminating the deadspace between the fascia\n      and the flap.  No closed suction drains will be inserted in the test group.  The control\n      group will receive closed suction drains per the standard of care.  It is hypothesized that\n      the elimination of deadspace in the wound in the test group will prevent post-surgical fluid\n      from developing and causing seroma and that the number of invasive treatments related to\n      aspirations in the test group will not be inferior to the management and removal of drains\n      and aspirations for seroma in the control group.  The study will be conducted with 130\n      patients (65 test, 65 control) at up to 5 sites."
