  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a psycho-educational intervention, Managing Cancer
      Care: A Personal Guide (MCC), that is intended to improve patients' knowledge of palliative
      care and to facilitate its timely integration into self-management of their breast cancer.
      The MCC will be tested with patients with Stage I-IV breast cancer at baseline, one, and
      three months following enrollment. The intervention group will receive the MCC, and the
      attention-control group will receive a symptom management toolkit. Participants' family
      caregivers will also be enrolled to provide information on patients' self-management.
      Investigators hypothesize that users of MCC, as compared to attention-control participants,
      will demonstrate improved knowledge, feelings, and behaviors related to self-management of
      their cancer care. This innovative research can help to establish palliative care as a
      mainstay of self-management interventions that target serious illnesses.
