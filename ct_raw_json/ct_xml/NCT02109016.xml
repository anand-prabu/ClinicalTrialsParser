      The purpose of this study is to determine whether lucitanib is effective in the treatment of
      patients with FGFR1 amplified squamous non-small cell lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lucitanib is an oral inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of FGFR 1/2 and VEGFR 1-3.
      Lucitanib has demonstrated potent antitumour and antiangiogenic activity in several
      preclinical models of cancer, including a human lung cancer model (H1581) which harbors
      FGFR1 amplification.

      The first in human trial of lucitanib demonstrated that 15 mg of lucitanib given daily, can
      provide durable clinical responses in cancer patients with alterations of the FGF pathway.
      Based on these results, lucitanib is being studied in FGFR1 amplified squamous non-small
      cell lung cancer.
