Tendency to form keloids, hypertrophic\n             scars or any other healing disorders.\n\n          -  Previous tissue augmenting therapy in the lip area (including lips, oral commissures,\n             nasolabial folds, marionette and perioral lines) with HA or collagen filler, or laser\n             treatment, within 12 months before study entry.\n\n          -  Permanent implant or treatment with non-HA or non-collagen filler in the lip area\n             (including lips, oral commissures, nasolabial folds, marionette and perioral lines).\n\n          -  Previous toxin treatment below the lower orbital rim within 9 months before study\n             entry.\n\n          -  History of herpes labialis with an outbreak within 4 weeks of study entry or with 4\n             or more outbreaks in the 12 months before study entry.\n\n          -  Active skin disease, inflammation or related conditions, such as infection, psoriasis\n             and herpes zoster near or on the area to be treated.\n\n          -  History of angioedema.\n\n          -  Known hypersensitivity to HA, lidocaine or other amide-type anaesthetics or history\n             of severe multiple allergies or anaphylactic shock\n\n          -  Cancerous or precancerous lesions in the area to be treated.\n\n          -  Immunosuppressive therapy, chemotherapy, treatment with biologics or systemic\n             corticosteroids within 3 months before study treatment.\n\n          -  Any medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator would make the subject\n             unsuitable for inclusion (e.g. a chronic, relapsing or hereditary disease that may\n             affect the general condition or may require frequent medical treatment).\n\n          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding.\n\n          -  Participation in any other clinical study within 30 days before inclusion.\n\n          -  Other condition preventing the subject to entering the study in the investigator's\n             opinion, e.g. subjects not likely to avoid other facial cosmetic treatments below the\n             level of the lower orbital rim and chin, subjects anticipated to be unreliable or\n             incapable of understanding and complying with the study assessment or unrealistic\n             expectations of treatment result.\n\n          -  Study site staff or close relatives to study site staff and employees at the sponsor\n             company or close relatives to employees at the sponsor company.
