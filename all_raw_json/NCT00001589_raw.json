            "textblock": "Iron has been proposed to contribute to atherogenesis in humans by facilitating the\n      oxidation of lipoproteins.  This observational study will evaluate the association between\n      frequency of blood donation - expected to be associated with relatively reduced body iron\n      stores in frequent donors - and carotid atherosclerosis.  The primary outcome variable will\n      be whether the presence and extent of asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis as measured by\n      ultrasound is greater in infrequent (less than or equal to 1 donations/year greater than or\n      equal to 5 years) vs. frequent (greater than or equal to 4 donations/year greater than or\n      equal to 5 years) blood donors.  Body iron stores, lipid and hemostatic parameters, nitric\n      oxide formation, inflammatory parameters, and markers of vascular oxidative stress will be\n      analyzed as secondary outcome measures.  Laboratory analysis and ultrasound testing will be\n      performed blinded to the patient's phlebotomy and iron status.  Sixty frequent (n=40 males\n      greater than 40 y/o, n=20 females greater than 50 y/o) and 60 infrequent (n=40 males greater\n      than 40 y/o, n=20 females greater than 50 y/o) blood donors will be recruited for this study\n      from the Department of Transfusion Medicine, W. G. Magnuson Clinical Center.  All donors\n      will be assessed for study eligibility and cardiovascular risks during the screening visit.\n      The presence of atherosclerotic lesions by carotid ultrasound and secondary outcome\n      parameters will be assessed during a second visit."
