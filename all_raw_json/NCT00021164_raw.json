Patients are stratified according to disease\n      (metastatic cutaneous melanoma vs other tumor types). Patients are randomized to one of\n      three treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive telomerase: 540-548 peptide vaccine emulsified in Montanide\n           ISA-51 subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 of weeks 1-4 and 7-10. Patients also undergo\n           leukapheresis over 3 hours at baseline and after each course of treatment.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive telomerase: 540-548 peptide vaccine emulsified in Montanide\n           ISA-51 SC on day 1 of weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10. Patients also undergo leukapheresis over 3\n           hours at baseline, after the vaccine on week 4, and after each course of treatment.\n\n        -  Arm III: Patients receive telomerase: 540-548 peptide vaccine emulsified in Montanide\n           ISA-51 SC on days 1-4 of weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10. Patients undergo leukapheresis as in\n           arm II.\n\n      Treatment in all arms repeats every 13 weeks for 4-6 courses in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with a complete response (CR) receive 1\n      additional course of treatment after achieving CR.\n\n      Eligible melanoma patients with progressive disease on vaccine alone on any of the 3 arms\n      may receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) combined with vaccine as in arm II. Beginning the day after\n      each immunization, IL-2 is administered IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours over 4 days on\n      weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10 for a maximum of 12 doses. Patients continuing to experience disease\n      progression on combined vaccine and IL-2 therapy go off study after 2 courses of combined\n      therapy.\n\n      Patients are followed at 3 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90-162 patients (30-54 per treatment arm; 45-81 per stratum)\n      will be accrued for this study within less than 2 years."
