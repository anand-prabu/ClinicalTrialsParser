The primary goal of this study is to\n      provide early access to TMC114 administered with low-dose ritonavir (TMC114/r) and other\n      antiretrovirals (ARVs, agents that are used to treat viral infections).

This study will\n      monitor and evaluate the safety and efficacy of TMC114/r in combination with ARVs during the\n      course of the study. Treatment with TMC114/r will be continued until virologic failure (the\n      inability to achieve or maintain suppression of viral replication), treatment-limiting\n      toxicity, loss to follow-up, study withdrawal, pregnancy, until discontinuation of TMC114\n      development or when TMC114 becomes reimbursable for treatment-naive patients or when TMC114\n      becomes commercially available for treatment-experienced patients."
