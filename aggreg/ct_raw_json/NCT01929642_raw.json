The\n      present study will employ an ABA design in which three pediatric participants will be\n      selected to receive baseline medical, developmental, behavioral, and cognitive evaluations,\n      followed by a 26 week administration of sirolimus, repeated baseline assessments at the end\n      of the 26 week treatment phase, and a 4 week titrated withdrawal followed by a 22 week\n      period in which no sirolimus is administered.  All participants will again be administered\n      baseline medical, behavioral, and cognitive evaluations at the end of the study in order to\n      compare all evaluations done at baseline, the end of the 26 week treatment, and completion\n      of the study.   These comparisons will be done to assess secondary outcomes that include\n      reductions in autistic symptoms, self-injury, and aggression, as well as improvements in\n      cognitive function across multiple domains. Furthermore, administration of the secondary\n      outcome measures will also allow us to better understand the sensitivity of these measures\n      in patients with TSC during the course of a clinical trial.\n\n      Families of potentially eligible children who express interest in the study and meet\n      prescreening criteria will be invited to attend a screening visit to determine eligibility,\n      inclusion/exclusion criteria, and availability for eight additional study visits.  Prior to\n      enrollment, informed consent will be obtained from the parent or legal guardian.\n\n      Investigators will use the methods of analysis of single-subject research (ABA design, where\n      first A represents baseline, B represents treatment, and A represents reversal of treatment.\n      The analysis will focus on each of the 3 subjects separately.  Data on feasibility and\n      safety (primary outcome) and on frequency of disruptive behavior (secondary outcome) will be\n      plotted and visually inspected to detect any temporal changes by phase:  1. Baseline, 2.\n      Treatment, 3. After treatment.  Data in each phase will be summarized as mean +/- standard\n      deviation (SD). We will use the summary data to assess the potential effect of the\n      intervention. Consistency of the effect will be examined across the 3 study participants."
