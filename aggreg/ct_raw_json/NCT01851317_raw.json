As the cuff is located in the patients' trachea, the shape of the patents' trachea\n      may be change depending on the position of the patient's head and therefore, the CP may also\n      change. If the intracuff pressure will increase as the patient's head is moved into a flexed\n      or extended position, these patients may be at risk for tracheal damage. The investigators\n      will prospectively evaluate the relationship between the patient's head position and CP in\n      patients undergoing otolaryngological surgery."
