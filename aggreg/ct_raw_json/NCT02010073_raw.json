We wish to specifically examine\n      the contribution of ARDS as defined by the Berlin Definition to the burden of hypoxaemic\n      respiratory failure.\n\n      Why?\n\n      The purpose of this study is to provide new and current data on the disease burden of acute\n      hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS. It will answer the following questions:\n\n        -  What is the frequency and disease burden of acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure in\n           winter?\n\n        -  What are the aetiologies of acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure requiring ventilatory\n           support?\n\n        -  What is the incidence of ARDS based on the Berlin definition within this patient\n           cohort?\n\n        -  What is the mortality from ARDS within this cohort, and how does this vary based on\n           ARDS severity?\n\n        -  What is the natural history of ARDS?\n\n        -  What are the key patterns of therapeutic resource utilization, particularly approaches\n           to sustain gas exchange, in these patients?\n\n      When?\n\n      The study is performed over a 4 week period between February 1st and March 31st 2014 in the\n      Northern Hemisphere and June 1st to August 31st in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\n      What data is required?\n\n      A basic dataset is collected on all patients admitted with acute acute hypoxaemic\n      respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support, with a more detailed dataset collected on\n      patients diagnosed with ARDS."

ICUs enrolling into existing\n      databases (e.g., ERIC study, ICON audit) will be invited to participate. It is important\n      that participating ICUs commit (by written agreement) to fully comply with the study\n      protocol. ICU recruitment in each country will be spearheaded by a national coordinator Each\n      ICU will be requested to recruit for 4 consecutive 'winter' weeks\n\n        1. Northern Hemisphere - 4 week period between February 1st and March 31st 2014.\n\n        2. Southern Hemisphere: 4 week period between June 1st - August 31st 2014 There will be 2\n           data collectors per participating ICU's. Each data collector will undergo an online\n           training program designed to standardize data interpretation [esp. CXR's] and will\n           receive a login authorization following completion of this training.\n\n      INCLUSION CRITERIA: All patients admitted to the participating ICUs receiving invasive or\n      noninvasive ventilation will be screened and included in the database.\n\n      EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Age < 16.\n\n      DATA COLLECTION: Data collection will web based, permitting conditional Data Collection\n      screens, i.e. data collectors will be automatically guided as to which sections to complete\n      based on data entered indicating whether Inclusion Criteria are met. Data collection will be\n      done at 10am each morning. Our aim is to obtain a sample of at least 1000 ARDS patients\n      within the cohort of patients receiving assisted ventilation. The reported incidence of ARDS\n      in ICU patients varies, from 2.2% of ICU admissions develop ARDS in ALIEN, 7.1% in ALIVE\n      Study, to 17.5% of Ventilated patients in KCLIP . A reasonable projection of the incidence\n      of ARDS among patients admitted in ICUs can be estimated to approximate 5% of ICU admission.\n      As a conservative estimate, if a medium-sized ICU admits 50 patients/month and collects data\n      for four, 500 ICUs will be necessary to achieve this number."
