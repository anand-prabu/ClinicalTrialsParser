    <textblock>
      Miscommunication during patient handover can jeopardize patient safety and is the focus of
      Quality Improvement initiatives by many organizations. It is widely recognized that such
      miscommunication is preventable using a number of strategies identified in the literature.

      Currently, there is no formal handover process of General Internal Medicine in-patients,
      otherwise known as the Clinical Teaching Unit (CTU) at Vancouver General Hospital, which is
      a major patient safety concern. This project will implement a formal handover program and
      evaluate whether there are changes in resident satisfaction with handover, but more
      importantly, whether the investigators can improve patient outcomes.
