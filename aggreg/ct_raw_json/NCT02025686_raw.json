It has been shown in animal studies with rats\n      that HBO could reduce the paw edema induced by carrageenan as an inflammatory agent. The\n      authors are not aware of similar studies in human subjects investigating this effect of HBO.\n      Aim: To investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of HBO by reducing the hyperalgesia induced\n      by heat stimulation in healthy subjects and promote future research and understanding of the\n      anti-inflammatory processes in humans. The primary endpoint is a reduced area of secondary\n      hyperalgesia after HBO."
