Agrees to stay in contact with the study site for the duration of the study, provide\n             updated contact information as necessary, and has no current plans to move from the\n             study area for the duration of the study\n\n          4. Agrees to avoid elective surgery for the full duration of the study\n\n          5. For female participants: agrees to avoid pregnancy from 21 days prior to Study Day 0\n             and for the full duration of the study. Women physically capable of pregnancy (not\n             sterilized and still menstruating or within 1 year of the last menses if menopausal)\n             in sexual relationships with men must use an acceptable method of avoiding pregnancy\n             during this period. Acceptable methods of avoiding pregnancy include a sterile sexual\n             partner, sexual abstinence(not engaging in sexual intercourse), hormonal\n             contraceptives (oral, injection, transdermal patch, or implant), vaginal ring,\n             intrauterine device (IUD), or the combination of a condom or diaphragm with\n             spermicide gel\n\n          6.

Received immunoglobulin or blood products within 42 days before randomization\n\n         11. Received any investigational drug therapy or investigational vaccine within 182 days\n             before randomization, or planned participation in any other investigational study\n             during the study period\n\n         12. Received investigational Mtb vaccine at any time prior to randomization\n\n         13.

History of allergic disease or reactions (including allergy to kanamycin-related\n             antibiotics, allergic reaction to eggs, and severe eczema), likely to be exacerbated\n             by any component of the study vaccine\n\n         17. Previous medical history that may compromise the safety of the participant in the\n             study, including but not limited to: severe impairment of pulmonary function from\n             pulmonary disease; chronic illness with signs of cardiac or renal failure; suspected\n             progressive neurological disease; or uncontrolled epilepsy\n\n         18. Evidence of chronic hepatitis (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C\n             antibody)\n\n         19. Chronic heavy ethanol intake which, in the opinion of the investigator, may\n             compromise the safety of the participant or interfere with the evaluation of the\n             safety of the vaccine\n\n         20. Cannabis smoking 3 or more days per week\n\n         21. Positive urine test for illicit drugs (opiates, cocaine, amphetamines)\n\n         22. History or evidence on physical examination of any systemic disease or any acute or\n             chronic illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the\n             evaluation of the safety or immunogenicity of the vaccine\n\n         23. All female participants: currently pregnant or lactating/nursing; or positive urine\n             pregnancy test during screening or on the day of study injection\n\n         24. Received a tuberculin skin test within 3 months (90 days) prior to Study Day 0\n\n         25. Any current medical, psychiatric, occupational, or substance abuse problems that, in\n             the opinion of the investigator, will make it unlikely that the participant will\n             comply with the protocol or may compromise the safety of the participant"
