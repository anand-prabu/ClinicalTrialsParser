    <textblock>
      1. Evaluate quantitative VCEUS imaging for determining early breast cancer response to
           neoadjuvant chemotherapy and compare results to co-temporal volume change on grayscale
           ultrasound and post-treatment mammography findings utilizing final surgical pathology
           and clinical outcome.

        2. Assess incremental benefit of quantitative VCEUS to planar CEUS tumor perfusion
           measurements and enhancement patterns in predicting tumor response to adjuvant
           treatment in clinical studies.

      The contrast agent Definity® is FDA approved for use as a contrast agent during ultrasound
      (echocardiography) of the heart.  Definity® will be used &quot;off-label&quot; (during ultrasound of
      the breast) in this study.  The administration of Definity® during this study will follow
      total dose guidelines approved by the FDA.

    <description>Evaluate quantitative VCEUS imaging for determining early breast cancer response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and compare results to co-temporal volume change on grayscale US, utilizing final surgical pathology and clinical outcome as reference standards. Specifically, changes in peak signal intensity and area under the curve will be compared with co-temporal changes in volume on grayscale US.</description>

    <description>Compare quantitative VCEUS to planar CEUS tumor perfusion measurements and enhancement patterns in predicting tumor response to neoadjuvant treatment utilizing final surgical pathology and clinical outcome as reference standards. Specifically, co-temporal early peak signal intensity and area under the curve will be compared to determine whether increased VCEUS has increased efficacy to determine response to neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer.  Additionally, pre-surgical imaging will be compared to final surgical pathology,</description>

    <description>Patients with breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy will undergo quantitative VCEUS imaging and 2D grayscale imaging as follows:
prior to initiation of treatment (baseline);
at 14  (± 4 days) after initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (early treatment);
at 28 days (± 4 days) after initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (inter-regimen);
at completion of therapy prior to definitive surgery (usually 2-3 months after initiation of treatment).  Each patient will undergo a total of four VCEUS examinations.</description>
