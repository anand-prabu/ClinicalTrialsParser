            "textblock": "Evidence from preliminary studies suggests that people with PTSD have heightened fear\n      responses and that cortisol suppression reduces this heightened fear. Research has shown the\n      drug dexamethasone (DEX), a cortisol suppressor,  reduces the startle response in civilians\n      with PTSD. This current research proposal represents a blinded, randomized,\n      placebo-controlled efficacy study with the goal of determining whether a drug that\n      suppresses the stress hormone cortisol will increase the efficacy of exposure therapy.\n      Specifically, it is proposed that a dose of DEX, given the night before (approximately 10\n      hours before) each of 5 to 11 individual virtual reality exposure (VRE) therapy sessions,\n      will significantly enhance the rate of response and possibly the efficacy of treatment.\n      Participants will be treated until they have experienced at least a 70% reduction in PTSD\n      symptoms from baseline or up to 12 sessions or until they and their therapist agree\n      treatment should be terminated, a minimum of 6 sessions to a maximum of 12 sessions.\n      Comprehensive multi-modal outcomes will be assessed by independent assessors blind to\n      subject condition on interviews, self-report measures, and psychophysiological measures.\n      Participants will be assessed pre- and post-treatment and at a follow-up of 3, 6 and 12\n      months to assess long term effects."
