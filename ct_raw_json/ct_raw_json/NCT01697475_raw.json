Text messaging interventions have the potential to encourage positive\n      changes in health behavior in these groups.\n\n      Purpose: To examine if a six week program of motivational text messaging increases physical\n      activity (step count) among older African Americans in an urban setting.\n\n      Design: Randomized, controlled trial pilot study with assignment to motivational text\n      messaging group or a control group.\n\n      Setting/Participants: Thirty-six African Americans aged 60 to 85.\n\n      Intervention: The intervention group received motivational text messages three times a day,\n      three days a week, for six weeks. Both groups received pedometers and walking manuals to\n      record step counts. Study was conducted and analyzed in 2011.\n\n      Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcome measure was step count. Secondary outcome measure was\n      perceived activity levels assessed by the Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (LTEQ).\n\n      Results/Conclusion: In press - American Journal of Preventive Medicine (Jan 2013)"
