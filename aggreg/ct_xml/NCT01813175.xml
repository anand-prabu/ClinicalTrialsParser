    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy term infants (gestational age ≥ 37 1/7 and ≤ 41 6/7 weeks) aged 46 - 65 days
             (inclusive) at entry into the study

          -  Fully formula fed for at least one week (not applicable for the breastfeeding
             reference group since these infants must be exclusively breastfed before and
             throughout the study)

          -  Parents' or legal guardian's written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria for run-in period (visit 1, screening) are:

          -  Being weaned before inclusion (introduction of any other foods other than formula or
             human milk)

          -  Moderate or severe acute malnutrition, defined as weight-for-age and sex below -2
             z-scores of the median WHO growth standards

          -  Medical condition for which a special diet other than standard (non hydrolised) cow's
             milk-based infant formula is required

          -  Known congenital diseases or malformations which could interfere with the study (e.g.
             gastrointestinal malformations, congenital immunodeficiency), as per investigator's
             clinical judgement

          -  Use of systemic antibiotics or anti-mycotic drugs in the 4 weeks prior to entry into
             the study

          -  Received Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine (IPV) or Rotavirus Vaccine (RV) prior to
             entry into the study

          -  Gastroenteritis or diarrhoea in the last two weeks prior to entry into the study

          -  Participation in any other studies involving investigational or marketed products
             concomitantly or within two weeks prior to entry into the study

          -  Investigator's uncertainty about the willingness or ability of the parents to comply
             with the protocol requirements
