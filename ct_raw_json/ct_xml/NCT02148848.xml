  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Femoral neck fracture in the elderly is one indication for initiating osteoporosis
      treatment. Bisphosphonates remain the first line therapy; however, many orthopaedic surgeons
      concern regarding their effects on fracture healing process. Therefore, therapy is usually
      delayed for a period of time. To the best of our knowledge, there is no scientific data to
      support whether bisphosphonate treatment should be given immediately after the surgery or it
      should be delayed.

      Femoral neck fracture in the elderly is one indication for initiating osteoporosis
      treatment. Bisphosphonates remain the first line therapy; however, many orthopaedic surgeons
      concern regarding their effects on fracture healing process. Therefore, therapy is usually
      delayed for a period of time. To the best of our knowledge, there is no scientific data to
      support whether bisphosphonate treatment should be given immediately after the surgery or it
      should be delayed.

      This study aims to compare functional recovery between early- and late administration of
      bisphosphonate in patients who received hemiarthroplasty following femoral neck fractures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient diagnosed with femoral neck fracture and was treated with bipolar
             hemiarthroplasty

          -  Age more than 50 years old and bone mineral density (BMD) was in osteoporotic

             filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 30 ml/min), allergy to bisphosphonates, severe esophagitis,
             gastroesophageal reflux disease etc.

          -  Patients with conditions/disorders which have an affect on bone mineral density or
             bone metabolism e.g. renal insufficiency, rheumatoid arthritis, Paget's disease,
             renal osteodystrophy, hyperparathyroidism, glucocorticoids use etc.

          -  History of bisphosphonates use within 12 months
