At the request of the CF\n      Foundation (CFF), the Investigators have designed a standardized diagnostic protocol based\n      on current recommendations for the diagnosis of NTM by the American Thoracic Society, as\n      well as forthcoming recommendations by the CFF and the European CF Society. The study is\n      observational in nature, and is not intended to change the current diagnostic approach to\n      the infection, but rather standardized the collection of data to facilitate the decision\n      making process. When validated, this protocol will be easily assessable to the entire CFF\n      Care Center Network."
