  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hearing loss is the most common sensory congenital disorder and this condition is
      diagnosable and treatable. Children that are born with hearing loss have to undergo several
      hearing tests to diagnose the condition and many families are delayed in receiving this
      testing or never obtain the needed testing. This research employs a new method for helping
      children with hearing loss receive timely care by using a patient navigator, who is someone
      who teaches and provides emotional/social support for the families of these children. The
      hypothesis of this study is that a patient navigator will hasten the timing of pediatric
      audiological testing, improve compliance with scheduled appointments, and expand parental
      knowledge of pediatric hearing loss.

      Parents of children who fail infant hearing screening at birth at the University of Kentucky
      will be enrolled in the first part of the study and randomized into either a patient
      navigator group or the standard practice group. We will compare the failure to follow-up for
      testing rates between groups. Of those enrolled subjects, the age of the children when they
      obtain diagnostic testing will be assessed and compared between the patient navigator group
      and the standard practice group. This arm will further quantify the effect of the navigator
      on diagnostic testing timing.

      The second arm strives to continue and build upon the first assessment by evaluating hearing
      follow up in children up to six months of age who are diagnosed with hearing loss.  Parents
      of children born at the University of Kentucky and at other hospitals who are following up
      as outpatients at UK who are diagnosed with hearing loss will be approached for enrollment.
      Parents of children in this arm of the study are also randomized from the age of enrollment
      until one year old to a patient navigator group or standard practice group.  This group of
      subjects will be assessed to find what follow up is conducted once the child is diagnosed
      with hearing loss.   As in the first arm, the navigator group will have regular phone follow
      ups with the patient navigator and the standard practice group will not have contact.  Both
      groups will be given or mailed questionnaires, asking them about where they obtained
      services for the child with regard to hearing follow up and intervention. This will assess
      the effect of a navigator on parental education and support, timing of diagnostic services,
      and implementation of interventions with regard to pediatric hearing loss.
