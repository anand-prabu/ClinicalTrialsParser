    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a mobile phone application (&quot;app&quot;) for
      Major Depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder is practical and acceptable to young men
      who are attracted to men, and whether it reduces their anxiety and depressive symptoms. The
      investigators will also evaluate whether reductions in symptoms are maintained over a 10
      week follow-up period after young men complete the mobile phone intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to conduct a feasibility trial and then a small randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) for a 10-week, culturally tailored mobile phone intervention that
      uses principles of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to reduce anxiety and depression among
      young men who are sexually attracted to other males.

      The primary purpose of the feasibility study is to collect feedback about the intervention
      from the participants. This feedback, along with usage data on which features are used more
      or less often by the participants, and how the features are used, will be evaluated to make
      improvements to the intervention. The investigators will also assess clinical outcomes (such
      as anxiety and depressive symptoms). After the feasibility trial, the investigators will
      conduct the small RCT.
