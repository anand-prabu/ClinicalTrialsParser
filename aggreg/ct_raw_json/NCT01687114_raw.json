We hypothesize the consumption of this cranberry beverage in a\n      progressive dosing schedule will increase PAC-A2 excretion in urine. Five generally healthy,\n      nonsmoking, pre-menopausal women (absent major chronic diseases including cardiovascular,\n      endocrine, gastrointestinal, and renal conditions), age 20-40 years, with a body mass index\n      (BMI) of 18.5-25 kg/m2 will be recruited from the Boston area because sexually active women\n      in this age range are particularly vulnerable to urinary tract infection. Volunteers will be\n      asked to consume their assigned cranberry beverage at a dose of 8 oz/day according to a\n      weekly dosing schedule. Relevant clinical information and eleven 24-hour and morning spot\n      urine samples each will be collected from subjects during the study. Urinary PAC-A2\n      concentration will then be determined to validate if it can serve as a marker of compliance\n      of cranberry juice consumption."

            "textblock": "People who frequently eat whole grains, fruits and berries, vegetables, beans and legumes,\n      nuts, seeds, cocoa, tea, wine, and fruit or vegetable juices may have decreased risk of\n      diseases.  It is believed that some of these health benefits are due to phytochemicals\n      present in these foods and beverages. Phytochemicals are nutrients that are naturally\n      present in plant-based foods and beverages. Recently, cranberry containing foods and\n      beverages are believed to prevent urinary tract infection. However, how cranberry decrease\n      urinary tract infection is not very clear. To better understand how phytochemicals in\n      cranberries may benefit health, we want to learn how they are absorbed and eliminated from\n      the body. Thus, the purpose of the main study is to see whether we can measure\n      phytochemicals from cranberries in health volunteers after they drink cranberry juice."
