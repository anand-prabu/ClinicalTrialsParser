Pelvic floor function is directly affected by\n      gynecological cancer and treatment, and pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD) can severely affect a\n      patient's life. PFD negatively affects health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Evaluation of\n      PFD provides information about the disease burden and treatment-related effects directly\n      from the patient's perspective and informs clinical decision-making. The pelvic floor\n      musculature and sacral nerves are not easily accessible, and it is difficult to test them.\n      Several functional assessments have been used to evaluate pelvic floor dysfunction; however,\n      reports on methodology are sparse, and consensus on their use is lacking. Research on\n      functional outcomes is highly complex and, consequently, must be addressed in a\n      comprehensive framework."

Vaginal pressure is measured using a\n           vaginal silicon pressure sensor (cmH2O; sensitivity0.06kPa,sensitivity 5mV,\n           threshold1.5V).\n\n        -  The motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the pelvic floor are obtained by sacral and\n           transcranial magnetic stimulation using a Magstim 200 stimulator (Magstim Co.,\n           Whitland, Wales, UK).
