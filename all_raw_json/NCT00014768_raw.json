Patients undergo an indirect calorimetry over 20 minutes on day 2.\n      Patients receive stable-labeled leucine and stable-labeled glucose IV over 3 hours followed\n      by insulin and glucose IV over 4-4.5 hours on day 2 using the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic\n      clamp technique.\n\n      Blood and breath samples are collected to measure glucose tolerance, peripheral insulin\n      sensitivity, and whole body protein turnover.  Hepatic glucose production is measured by\n      mass spectrophotometry.\n\n      Patients maintain a 3-day food journal before pregnancy, during each trimester, and after\n      pregnancy.\n\n      Patients undergo each study during the final 2 weeks of each trimester of pregnancy and then\n      at 6 months post-partum."
