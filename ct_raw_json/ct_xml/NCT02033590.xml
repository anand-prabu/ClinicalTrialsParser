        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be willing to undergo immediate breast reconstruction following a skin-sparing or
             nipple sparing mastectomy with healthy, sufficiently thick, well-vascularized skin
             flaps, and the implantation of SERI® Surgical Scaffold and breast implant

          -  Be female, between 18 and 65 years of age at the time of enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have undergone prior radiation treatment on the study breast(s) and/or is
             preoperatively evaluated to require radiation treatment to the study breast(s) during
             the course of the study

          -  Have undergone a mastectomy in the study breast(s) with either a wise pattern,
             vertical, circumvertical or peri-areolar incision of greater than 30% circumference
             and not extending across the medial half of the nipple areolar complex (NAC)

          -  Have undergone a skin reducing mastectomy

          -  Have 3rd degree ptosis (as classified by the modified Regnault ptosis scale)

          -  Have a BMI that is &lt;17 or ≥ 30

          -  Receive an implant size more than 100% of the excised breast weight

          -  Predicted implant weight more than 500 grams

          -  Have mastectomy weight greater than 600 grams

          -  Have smoked within the last 2 years prior to surgery

          -  Have any concurrent procedure on the study breast(s), except for lymph node sampling
             or resection

          -  Have mastectomy flaps that are deemed by the physician intra-operatively to be too
             thin or have significant ischemia. This would be assessed by the operating surgeon
             with a sizer or the definitive implant in place as having a capillary refill &gt; 2
             seconds, non-bleeding edges and mastectomy flap pallor. These subjects will be exited
             from the study as screen failures and standard of care will be followed

          -  Have collagen-vascular, connective tissue, or bleeding disorders

          -  Have any disease clinically known to impact wound healing ability, including
             uncontrolled diabetes with a documented HbA1c of ≥ 7.0mg/ml within 6 weeks prior to
             study entry

          -  Have a positive nasal swab for either Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus Aureus
             (MSSA) or Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA)

          -  Have a known allergy to silk

          -  Have uncontrolled hypertension

          -  Have documented autoimmune disease or an immune deficiency

          -  Have undergone neo adjuvant chemotherapy

          -  Taking immunosuppressive drugs with the exception of chemotherapeutics

          -  Require the use of any additional medical device for soft tissue support of the
             contralateral breast, except in bilateral breast reconstructions, where the use of
             SERI® Surgical Scaffold is allowed

          -  Planned tissue flap in addition to prosthetic implant

          -  Have undergone previous surgery (mastectomy, breast augmentation, mastopexy) on the
             study breast(s) with the exception of open breast biopsy, cyst removal and breast
             conserving lumpectomy

          -  Have had a prior soft tissue support device implanted in the study breast

          -  Currently have an alcohol/substance abuse problem or have had a relapse within 1 year
             prior to screening visit

          -  Have documented history of mental disease/disorder exclusive of depression /anxiety

          -  Have concomitant unrelated condition of breast/chest wall/skin (e.g. significant
             chest wall abnormalities including pectus excavatum or pectus carinatum)

          -  Have an abscess or active infection at any location within one month prior to surgery

          -  Have surgery that will involve the use of an investigational breast implant

          -  Be pregnant, lactating, or if of childbearing potential, be unwilling to use
             contraceptive methods and avoid pregnancy throughout the study
