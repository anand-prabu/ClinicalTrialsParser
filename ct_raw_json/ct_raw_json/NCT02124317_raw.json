            "textblock": "Advanced PDA is a lethal disease with a approximately 6 months of median survival.\n      Gemcitabine is always the only approved single agent. The recent results of the phase III\n      trial MPACT (Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Clinical Trial) demonstrated an\n      improvement in overall response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall\n      survival (OS) for the combination of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine compared to gemcitabine\n      alone. Thus, the combination of nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine became one of a standard\n      treatment in metastatic PDA. S-1 is an oral fluoropyrimidine, and shown to be non-inferior\n      to gemcitabine on OS for unresectable pancreatic cancer, and also demonstrated non-inferior,\n      and even superior to gemcitabine as adjuvant chemotherapy. This single-arm study is to\n      explore the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel plus S-1 as first-line treatment in\n      Chinese patients with local advanced or metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma."
