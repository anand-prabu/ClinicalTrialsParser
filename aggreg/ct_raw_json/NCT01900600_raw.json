The subjects will received the experimental\n      treatment as randomized in the main CANTOS trial and they will not receive any additional\n      experimental treatment as part of the sub-study.\n\n      This study is a an Investigator-initiated (Dr. Abbate) single-center (Virginia Commonwealth\n      University) sub-study of the CANTOS trial, supported by Novartis pharmaceuticals."
