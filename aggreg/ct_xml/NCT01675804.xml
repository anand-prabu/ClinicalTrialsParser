  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current research aimed to compare the efficacy of computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation
      (CACR), stimulant drugs and placebo on executive functions and clinical symptoms of children
      with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      the investigators administered a randomized controlled trial (RCT) through random assignment
      of ADHD subjects in to three different groups to compare the effects of CACR,
      immediate-release methylphenidate, and a Placebo treatment (i.e. some computerized tasks
      assumed not have any therapeutic effects)on ADHD children's performance.

    <description>The research design was experimental type and pretest, post-test, and follow-up with two experimental groups. All of participants were assessed about executive functions(working memory, inhibition response,planning,sustain attention)and clinical symptoms of attention deficit hyperactive disorder in duration of before, after interventions (i.e. after 8 weeks), and 3 month after the interventions were stop.</description>
