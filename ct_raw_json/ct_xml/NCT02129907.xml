    <textblock>
      In total 50 subjects with iron deficiency anemia treated with intravenous iron are planned
      for inclusion in this trial. After signing an informed consent a blood sample will be
      obtained from each participant before iron treatment. The investigators will measure the
      thrombin generation in plasma assessed by the calibrated automated thrombogram (CAT).
      patient will go face to face interview and will be asked to answer structured questionnaire
      which will include information on demographics, clinical data ( fever, allergies , etc.) and
      comorbidities

      Two weeks after completing intravenous  iron administration additional blood samples will be
      taken: thrombin generation  will be measured
