    <textblock>
      Antioxidants are important for having a good memory and for smart thinking when people get
      old, and that is important for everyone's quality of life. This research will find out if
      normal aging and Alzheimer's disease use up brain antioxidants. It will develop a new
      imaging tool that can help doctors to stop cognitive decline.

    <textblock>
      The objective of this proposal is to advance the mission of improving the health and
      well-being of older Americans by augmenting ongoing dementia prevention and treatment
      initiatives. It undertakes research on dementia associated with both normal aging and AD. A
      new scientist will develop a novel and powerful human brain antioxidant assay using
      state-of-the art instrumentation. The approach will be translated to the clinical
      environment so that it can be disseminated for use with new research. Specifically, the
      concentrations of two important antioxidants, ascorbate (Asc) and glutathione (GSH) will be
      measured noninvasively in the human brain. One aim is to measure whether a recent finding of
      lower brain GSH concentration in the occipital cortex of cognitively normal elder subjects
      is also found in the posterior cigulate cortex, and whether human brain Asc homeostasis
      persists in both brain regions. A complementary specific aim is to determine whether lower
      brain GSH concentration also occurs under the oxidative stress associated with Alzheimer's
      disease (AD). At the same time, data measured in subjects with AD have potential to advance
      this powerful new technology toward discovering an early stage biomarker. A sub aim is to
      make this technology available to a wide range of physicians and investigators. As such,
      data processing will be fully automated using commercially available software. This novel
      noninvasive technology facilitates a paradigm shift from systemic assays to quantifying
      antioxidants directly in the affected brain region. The approach will take advantage of
      state of the art 7 T instrumentation while developing analogous methods on a clinical 3 T
      scanner. The process of optimizing magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) for quantification
      of brain Asc and GSH concentrations necessitated reliable quantification of an extensive
      neurochemical profile (i.e. 19 brain metabolites), which includes the four compounds that
      are typically observed. Spectra acquired in stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) will be
      de-convolved quantitatively into contributions from the metabolites that contribute
      discernable resonances using a linear combination model approach (LCModel). Reliable
      quantification of brain GSH and Asc concentrations will first be achieved using ultra high
      field MRS with multiple transmit coil technology and accompanying radiofrequency (B1)
      shimming, then translated to a lower field clinical platform. Successful completion will
      determine whether low brain glutathione concentration is widespread in the elder human brain
      and whether this difference is exacerbated by AD.

        In the first phase of this project, images and spectra will be obtained by enrolling 4
        healthy adults who have given informed consent for validation of methodological
        development. To study normal aging, 18 healthy young (age 18 - 22 years old) and 18
        healthy elder (age 70 -89 years old) subjects will be enrolled. To study the second aim,
        23 patients with AD and 23 age - matched controls will be enrolled to study
        neurodegenerative disease associated demand on the antioxidant system.
