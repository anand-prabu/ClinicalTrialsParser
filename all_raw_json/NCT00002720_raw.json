Patients are stratified by center.\n      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo quadrantectomy with dissection of level I and II axillary lymph\n           nodes.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo quadrantectomy without axillary lymph node dissection.\n           Patients on both arms receive tamoxifen daily for 5 years.\n\n      Patients are followed every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 642 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
