(1) In experimental studies, the\n      threshold values for SI that best discriminated lungs with signs of Ventilator Induced Lung\n      Injury ranged between 0.9 and 1.1. (2) During EVLP, the isolated lungs are free from the\n      effect of chest wall impairment and represent the effective response of lung parenchyma to\n      ventilatory setting.\n\n      Use of SI monitoring in isolated and perfuse lung reconditioning, may be an useful tool to\n      prevent hyperinflation and opening-closing conditions by titrating optimal protective\n      ventilation As previously reported by our group, in the first trial of lung reconditioning,\n      signs of mechanical stress were detected with Paw-t curve. (3) Therefore we implemented EVLP\n      procedure with continuous stress index analysis to detect and quantify the occurrence of\n      hyperinflation or opening closing condition."

This approach is based on the observation that, at constant flow the rate of change of the Paw-t curve corresponds to the rate of change of the compliance of the respiratory system during tidal inflation. A progressive increase in slope (i.e. a downward concavity of the curve) indicates that compliance is progressively increasing with tidal inflation (tidal recruitment). A progressive decrease in slope (i.e. a upward convexity of the curve) indicates that compliance is decreasing with tidal inflation (tidal hyperinflation). Clinical and experimental data show that presence of Stress Index values indicating mechanical stress are associated to morphological, histological and inflammatory evidence of ventilator induce lung injury.",
