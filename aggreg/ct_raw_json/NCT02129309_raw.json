A substance\n      called 'apelin', that naturally occurs in the body has been shown to have an important role\n      in heart disease.  Previous studies have shown that it can make blood vessels get wider, and\n      help blood flow around the body and thus improve the way the heart and lungs work.\n\n      The investigators are looking to recruit both healthy and COPD pulmonary hypertension\n      patients to study 3 types of apelin.  The purpose of this study is to help the investigators\n      understand how Pulmonary Hypertension occurs which may will help with the development of\n      future treatments."
