      Study to evaluate the efficacy of Lacosamide (LCM) administered in addition to 1 to ≤3 other
      Anti-Epileptic Drugs in subjects with epilepsy ≥4 years to &lt;17 years of age who currently
      have uncontrolled partial onset seizures.

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of LCM administered
      concomitantly with 1 to ≤3 Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AEDs) in subjects with epilepsy ≥4 years to
      &lt;17 years of age who currently have uncontrolled partial onset seizures.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of LCM in subjects ≥4
      years to &lt;17 years of age.

      An additional objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LCM in subjects ≥4 years
      to &lt;17 years of age.
