Interleukin-12 may kill tumor cells by stopping blood\n      flow to the tumor and by stimulating white blood cells to kill melanoma cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to determine the effectiveness of vaccine therapy given\n      with interleukin-12 in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV melanoma."

Evaluate immune reactivity to tyrosinase and gp100 peptides emulsified with\n      Montanide ISA-51 (ISA-51) with or without interleukin-12 following surgical resection in\n      HLA-A2 positive patients with stage III or IV melanoma.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, parallel study. Patients are stratified by prior therapy\n      (immunotherapy or chemotherapy vs surgery only). Patients are randomized to receive 1 of 2\n      treatment arms: Arm I: Following surgery, patients receive tyrosinase and gp100 peptides\n      emulsified with Montanide ISA-51 (ISA-51) subcutaneously (SQ) once weekly during weeks 0, 2,\n      4, 6, 10, 14, 18, and 26 for a total of 8 vaccinations. Arm II: Following surgery, patients\n      receive treatment as in Arm I followed by interleukin-12 SQ once weekly during weeks 0, 2,\n      4, 6, 10, 14, 18, and 26 for a total of 8 vaccinations. Patients are followed at 2-4 weeks,\n      then every 3 months for 2 years after resection, then every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      yearly if without evidence of disease.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years."
