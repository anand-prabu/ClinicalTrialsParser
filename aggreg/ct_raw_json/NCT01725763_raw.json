            "textblock": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a life-threatening cardiovascular disease characterized by\n      pathological elevation of mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) >/= 25 mmHg at rest. mPAP\n      < 20 mmHg is defined as normal, values in the range between 21-24 mmHg are described as\n      \"borderline PH\" diagnosed by right heart catheterization. Based on the etiology, PH is\n      assigned to 5 groups (WHO, Data Point, 2008), whereas classification of disease is an\n      important prognostic and therapy-deciding criterion.\n\n      Cardiac magnetic resonance tomography (CMR) provides a reliable technique to estimate\n      elevated mean pulmonary arterial pressure from period of existence of a vortical motion of\n      blood flow in the main pulmonary artery. Vortex can be visualized in 3-dimensional vector\n      field, particle trace and streamline representations and can be analysed with respect to\n      vortex related measures (geometry of center, vortex formation, vorticity, propagation\n      dynamics \u2026). Furthermore T1-mapping and non-contrast enhanced lung perfusion/ventilation\n      scans represent promising techniques for PH characterization.\n\n      Aim of this explorative study is to 1. analyse PH-associated blood flow characteristics in\n      the heart and the surrounding great vessels with respect to the 5 groups of PH, and 2.\n      investigate the hemodynamic state of \"borderline PH\" compared to normal mPAP and manifest PH\n      by non-contrast CMR."
