A washout period of 2 weeks is required prior to randomization.\n\n          -  Prostate volume \u2264 75 cc.\n\n          -  Prostate length \u2264 5.5 cm.\n\n          -  American Urological Association (AUA) Symptom Index score < 20.\n\n          -  Judged to be medically fit for IGRT and HDR brachytherapy boost by a radiation\n             oncologist.\n\n          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1.\n\n          -  \u2265 18 years of age.\n\n          -  Patient consent must be appropriately obtained in accordance with applicable local\n             and regulatory requirements. Each patient must sign a consent form prior to enrolment\n             in the trial to document their willingness to participate.\n\n          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Patients registered on this\n             trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies there\n             must be reasonable geographical limits (for example: 1 \u00bd hour's driving distance)\n             placed on patients being considered for this trial. Investigators must assure\n             themselves the patients registered on this trial will be available for complete\n             documentation of the treatment, adverse events, and follow-up.\n\n          -  Protocol treatment is to begin within 4 weeks of patient randomization.

In addition to routine contraceptive methods, \"effective contraception\"\n             also includes heterosexual celibacy and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or\n             with a side-effect of pregnancy prevention). However, if at any point a previously\n             celibate patient chooses to become heterosexually active during the time period for\n             use of contraceptive measures, he is responsible for beginning contraceptive\n             measures.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  History of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).\n\n          -  Patients with a history of other malignancies, except: adequately treated\n             non-melanoma skin cancer, or other solid tumours curatively treated with no evidence\n             of disease for \u2265 5 years.\n\n          -  Prior or current bleeding diathesis.\n\n          -  Prior pelvic or prostate radiotherapy.\n\n          -  Previous history of (or planned) androgen deprivation therapy.\n\n          -  Evidence of metastatic disease.\n\n          -  Any serious active disease or co-morbid medical condition, laboratory abnormality,\n             psychiatric illness, active or uncontrolled infections, or serious illnesses or\n             medical conditions that would prevent the patient from participating or to be managed\n             according to the protocol (according to investigator's decision)."
