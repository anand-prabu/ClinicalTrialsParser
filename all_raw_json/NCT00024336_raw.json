Combining radiation\n      therapy with tamoxifen may be effective in treating newly diagnosed brain stem glioma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining radiation therapy and\n      tamoxifen in treating children who have newly diagnosed brain stem glioma."

Within 2 weeks after the\n      initiation of radiotherapy, patients receive oral high-dose tamoxifen once daily. Tamoxifen\n      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years."
