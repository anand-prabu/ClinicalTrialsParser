While a few clinical studies have already been performed with augmented\n      trochanteric nails in proximal femur fractures, no clinical studies exist with the use of\n      Proximal Humerus Internal Locking System (PHILOS) and (PMMA) augmentation for the treatment\n      of fractures in the proximal humerus.\n\n      In this study a new standardized technique for augmentation of screw tips using high viscous\n      PMMA cement (Traumacem V+) with the PHILOS plate will be applied. Fracture treatment with\n      PHILOS Screw Augmentation will be compared with treatment with PHILOS without augmentation."
