    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD, coronary heart disease) is the leading cause of death in the
      U.S., causing 1 in 5 deaths in 2005. The current method for diagnosing coronary artery
      disease that is considered most accurate is coronary angiography however it involves risk
      and radiation. Alternatively nuclear imaging test and MRI stress test only permits the semi
      qualitative analysis of the myocardial perfusion images.

      In this proposal the investigators will develop a means to calculate Coronary Flow Reserve
      (CFR) using the MRI. the investigators approach has the potential to reduce mortality from
      myocardial infarction by effecting a change in the patient management paradigm. Absolute
      quantification of myocardial perfusion will detect coronary stenosis and CAD in patients
      with more accuracy than the semi-quantitative or qualitative analysis of perfusion images.
      Measurement of Coronary Flow Reserve is important for the following reasons: decrease of
      coronary flow reserve has been identified as a first effect of CAD; it provides an objective
      measure of treatment efficacy.

      The purpose of this study is to compare images from nuclear stress test and/or coronary
      angiography with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that will evaluate subjects with coronary
      artery disease calculating myocardial blood flow using a novel MRI technique combined to an
      extracellular Gadolinium-based contrast agent and stressor agent

      The main hypothesis the investigators will test is that changes in myocardial blood volume,
      under physiologic stress, correlate with myocardial flow reserve as measured in low spatial
      resolution nuclear SPECT scans. Secondary hypothesis is that stress perfusion as quantified
      with bolus height corrected gadofosveset trisodium images, better correlate with SPECT
      perfusion than uncorrected, relative perfusion values.

      The investigators  propose implementing the scan protocol using a 1.5T or 3.0T MRI scanner.
      The investigators  will scan a series of 20 patients recruited from the nuclear stress lab
      at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. These subjects will be approached and enrolled into a
      HIPPA Compliant, IRB approved research study to assess the effectiveness of myocardial
      perfusion and blood volume images to measure myocardial blood volume. Subjects will be
      scanned with a modified version of the clinical stress-perfusion protocol. Correlation
      analysis will be used to test the hypothesis that quantitative blood volume is an indicator
      of myocardial flow reserve.

    <description>The investigators anticipate that a novel MRI imaging protocol using a high relaxivity blood-pool contrast agent (gadofosveset trisodium) is capable of quantifying coronary flow reserve based on quantification of myocardial blood volume and is strongly correlated with myocardial flow reserve as measured in low spatial resolution nuclear SPECT scans. Pre- and post- gadofosveset    trisodium images will be used to calculate the myocardial blood volume (in ml/100g of tissue).</description>

    <description>The investigators anticipate that CBV changes (in ml/100g of tissue) under stress reflect complementary physiologic feed back to stress perfusion scans, contrary to the hypothesis by many groups who claim that cardiac BOLD and/or rest-perfusion scans can determine without recourse to exercise or pharmacological stress.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Under an Institutional Committee on Human Research board approved protocol, 20 patients
        with a suspected myocardial ischemic disease with positive stress nuclear medicine test
        laboratory will be recruited in this prospective study.  All subjects will be screened for
        GFR within 24 hours before the exam. All patients must have a GFR &gt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2 to be
        included in the study.

        All subjects will be selected following the Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF)
        guidelines. All dialysis patients or end-stage renal disease patients with a creatinine
        clearance of &lt; 30mL/min will not be selected for the study to avoid NSF.
