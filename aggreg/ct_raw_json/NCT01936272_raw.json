Surgery is\n      required to insert a shunt into the brain and the abdomen. In recent years, we have\n      developed another treatment called Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy (ETV) with Choroid\n      Plexus Cauterization (ETV/CPC). This research study is being done to measure the results of\n      these procedures in children less than six months of age who have hydrocephalus as the\n      result of a brain infection, called post-infectious hydrocephalus, or PIH. This is the most\n      common cause of hydrocephalus in Ugandan babies. This study will evaluate patients in more\n      detail to measure brain growth and development. Children in the study will have special\n      testing to measure developmental progress as well as special imaging to evaluate the\n      progress of their brain growth."
