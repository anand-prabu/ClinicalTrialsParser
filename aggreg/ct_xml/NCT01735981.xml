      To examine the benefits of using a video-game, Dance, Dance, Revolution, as an exercise
      modality to improve gait and balance in individuals with Huntington's disease.

      The primary purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a therapist-guided
      Video-game Biofeedback Modulated Exercise (ViBE) program administered via Dance Dance
      Revolution to improve dynamic balance, gait and mobility in individuals with Huntington's
      Disease. Secondary aims were to explore whether the ViBE intervention would improve quality
      of life, fall risk, and neuropsychological functions. The investigators hypothesized that
      the video-game program would lead to greater improvements in walking, dynamic balance,
      quality of life, fall risk, and neuropsychological function than a control  handheld video
      game program. Since motivation is essential to the long-term maintenance of an exercise
      program the investigators were also interested in finding out how successful people with
      Huntington's Disease were at playing Dance Dance Revolution, what their perceptions were of
      playing the game, and whether they thought that it was beneficial
