For this test, subjects will rest in the supine position with a brachial blood pressure cuff on one arm and a finger tip probe on each of two fingers (one on the left hand, one on the right hand). After 5 minutes of rest, the blood pressure cuff will be inflated and remain inflated for 5 minutes.  Then the cuff pressure will be released and the subject will remain resting for 5 additional minutes.  This test will be repeated 3 hours after the test meal.",
