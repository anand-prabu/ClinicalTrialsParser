  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alopecia areata (AA) is a common disease of the immune system, known as an &quot;autoimmune&quot;
      disease. In the disease, the immune system mistakenly destroys the hair follicle, causing
      hair to fall out. Despite many people having this disease, research into its cause and into
      new, better ways to treat AA has lagged far behind other similar diseases of the immune
      system. Currently, there are no Federal Drug Administration approved drugs for AA.

      Ruxolitinib (made by Incyte) is an intervention known to effectively treat a disease of the
      bone marrow, known as myelofibrosis. It is also being studied in the treatment of rheumatoid
      arthritis, another &quot;autoimmune&quot; disease, by fighting inflammation. There are some genetic
      and chemical similarities between those with myelofibrosis, active rheumatoid arthritis and
      AA, suggesting that treatment with ruxolitinib may be effective in AA. In mice specially
      designed for testing drugs for the treatment of human alopecia areata, this medication
      worked to prevent the disease AA from starting in mice that would have otherwise developed
      the disease. To test Ruxolitinib, we are going to treat 10 patients with moderate to severe
      AA for 3 months. This is an &quot;open-label&quot; study, meaning that there will not be a placebo
      group; all patients enrolled in the study will receive the active medication. The
      effectiveness of the medication will be measured by changes in hair re-growth as determined
      by physical exam and photography, as well as by patient and physician scoring. Patients will
      be followed for another 3 months off of the drug to see if the effects of treatment last and
      if there is delayed response. The safety of the medication, ruxolitinib, in patients with
      alopecia areata will also be evaluated.

      Blood work will be collected before medication is started, during the treatment period, and
      after ruxolitinib is stopped, in order to monitor for adverse effects of the medication.
      Small scalp biopsies and peripheral blood will be taken at the beginning of the study before
      treatment and also after 12 and possibly 24 weeks. The chemical analysis of these skin
      samples and blood will help us to understand how the disease happens, how the treatment
      works, and may even guide us to better treatments in the future.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alopecia areata (AA) is a common autoimmune disease resulting from immune destruction of the
      hair follicle and subsequent hair loss. Despite its high prevalence, research into the
      pathogenesis and the development of innovative therapies in AA has lagged far behind other
      autoimmune diseases. Currently, there are no FDA approved drugs for AA. Ruxolitinib (Incyte)
      is an intervention known to effectively treat myelofibrosis and also rheumatoid arthritis by
      modulating the inflammatory response of the interferon response pathway by inhibition of
      Jak1/Jak2. Rheumatoid arthritis shares several susceptibility genes in common with AA. All
      three diseases share the central role of the interferon-gamma response pathway, which is the
      rationale for selecting Ruxolitinib for evaluation in this clinical trial. Both systemic and
      topical Ruxolitinib have been shown to prevent the onset of AA in the C3H-HeJ animal model
      of AA, demonstrating preclinical proof-of-concept data in AA. To test the safety and
      efficacy of Ruxolitinib in patients with moderate to severe AA, we propose this open-label,
      single arm pilot study with a total of 10 patients, treated for 3 months. Efficacy will be
      measured by changes in hair re-growth as determined by physical exam and photography, as
      well as by patient and physician global evaluation scores. Patients will be followed for
      another 3 months to evaluate durability of response following the treatment phase. Punch
      biopsies and peripheral blood will be obtained at baseline prior to treatment and then after
      12 and possibly 24 weeks for immune monitoring and for molecular studies.
