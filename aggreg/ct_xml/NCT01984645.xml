  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New York-Presbyterian Hospital has created a system that notifies its primary care providers
      whenever their patients are admitted to the hospital. In this study, the investigators want
      to evaluate how accurate this system is and how it is affecting the primary providers and
      their health care delivery.

      The investigators will interview the participating providers to understand if they were
      aware of the admission of their patients, and how they want to get involved in the care of
      that patient while he/she is in hospital. The investigators will also look at the data in
      the Electronic Health Record system to understand how providers are acting in response to
      the notifications.

    <description>The investigators will measure the time from each patient's discharge until their first follow-up visit in the outpatient setting. The investigators hypothesize that the automated notification will result is earlier post-discharge followups.</description>

    <description>Once a primary care provider is notified about their patient's admission via a secure health message (SHM), the investigators will measure number of such SHMs that are read within 24 hours and within 7 days</description>

    <description>The investigators will compare the rate of readmission for patients associated with providers in the two arms of the study, to assess if provider's notification about their patient's visit to the emergency department has any effect on rate of readmission.</description>
