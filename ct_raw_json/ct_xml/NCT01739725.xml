    <textblock>
      The Boston Scientific Helical Stent is a unique stent designed to improve flexibility and
      comfort. It is designed to conform more to the shape of the ureter (hollow tube connecting
      the kidney and the bladder) to ultimately improve patient comfort and decrease the need for
      painkillers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ureteral stents have been used for many years for a variety of clinical indications. Many
      surgeons routinely use ureteral stents after the endourologic removal of stones to
      facilitate in urine passage and facilitate excretion of any left over stones. There is a
      multitude of literature that reveals that most patients find ureteral stents to be
      uncomfortable. This discomfort often causes pain severe enough that patients anxiously
      anticipate stent removal, and often request early stent removal, and/or require use of pain
      medications that have many side effects and cause further discomfort to these patients.

    <description>The primary objective is to decrease the percent of patients who have pain during the stent indwell period beyond protocol-defined postoperative pain therapy from 25% for standard stents (the Control Stent in previous studies) to 10% for the Helical Stent. The previous clinical trial found that patients with Percuflex Plus stents had pain 25.2% of the time following stent insertion (J Urol 183:1037, 2010).</description>
