Consumers given negative information about the victim of DVH\n      will be more likely to implicitly collude with the perpetrator than consumers given negative\n      information about the perpetrator.\n\n      Aim 2: To determine how media portrayals of domestic violence impact descriptive and\n      injunctive norms about domestic violence and, ultimately, drive implicit collusion with\n      perpetrators.\n\n      Hypotheses: Controlling for individual pre-existing attitudes and social norms, consumers\n      exposed to thematic frames or the label of DV will be less likely to shift their norms in a\n      way that supports DV than those exposed to episodic frames or the label of assault.\n      Consumers provided negative victim information or non-relevant characteristics that humanize\n      the perpetrator will be more likely to shift their norms to accept DV.\n\n      Exploratory Aim: To identify racial/ethnic, gender, age, and regional differences in DV\n      social norms.\n\n      Hypothesis: The media will differentially impact subpopulation DV attitudes, social norms\n      and implicit collusion."
