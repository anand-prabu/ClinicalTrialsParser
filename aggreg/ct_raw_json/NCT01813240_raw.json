Limited mobility, the need for assistance in all human activities,\n      shame, and many medical complications related directly to the neural deficits make\n      paraplegia an important target for prevention. Our study will evaluate the efficacy of\n      Minocycline in two different groups:\n\n        1. Minimizing the neurological damage among trauma patients.\n\n        2. Preventing neurological damage through operation  in spinal tumors patients.\n\n      2.OBJECTIVES\n\n      The primary objectives of the trial are to determine:\n\n        1. Efficacy of administrating minocycline in minimizing the neurological damage among\n           acute spinal cord injury patients and spinal cord tumors (primary and metastases)\n           patients?\n\n        2. Efficacy of administrating minocycline at changing the natural history and\n           rehabilitation of spinal cord trauma patients.\n\n        3. Safety of applying minocycline in spinal cord injuries patients and spinal cord tumors?"
