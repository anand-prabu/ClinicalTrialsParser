  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of participation in this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of
      different dosing schedules of LY2605541 and how different dosing schedules of LY2605541
      affect Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).  Participants will be treated for up to 36 weeks with
      LY2605541 (one 12-week Lead-in period and two 12-week Randomization periods) and 42 weeks
      total study enrollment (10 day screening period and 4 week Follow-up period).
