The changes in the vessel walls will be determined by\n      an ultrasound test looking at and measuring: carotid vessel wall changes called carotid\n      Intimal-Media Thickness (cIMT) and the presence of new blood vessels (neovascularization)\n      using a contrast agent.  Ultrasound findings will be correlated with markers of inflammation\n      in the blood, findings from other radiology studies (such as MRI) already ordered as part of\n      routine clinical care, and physical exam findings and symptoms of consistent with disease\n      activity.  15 arteritis patients and 5 healthy controls will be recruited."
