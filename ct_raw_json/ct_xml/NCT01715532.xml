      Primary Outcome Measures:

      - To compare the progression free survival(PFS) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular
      carcinoma(HCC) treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization(TACE) with or without
      Huachansu, and the correlation between PFS and expression of peripheral Na+/K+-ATPase α3
      family.

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

      - To compare the overall survival(OS), objective response rate(ORR), and side effects of
      treating HCC with TACE plus Huachansu or TACE alone.

      Exploratory Outcome Measures:

      - To evaluate the correlation between prognosis and expression of peripheral Na+/K+-ATPase
      α3 family.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects 18-75 years of age.

          -  Diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Biopsy is the preferred method of diagnosis
             (option 1). As far as clinically possible, the results of a biopsy should be obtained
             to confirm the diagnosis prior to the initiation of investigational product
             administration.. Non-biopsy criteria are allowed in cases where a biopsy result is
             unavailable and a biopsy procedure is not clinically indicated (option 2).    (Option
             1: Biopsy-proven HCC (histology or cytology); Option 2 - patient must fulfill the
             following criteria: i. Radiological evidence of HCC showing lesion arterial
             hypervascularity and venous phase washout by either dynamic (triple-phase),
             contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen OR dynamic (triple-phase)
             contrast (gadolinium)-enhanced MRI, AND ii. Serology positive for hepatitis B or C,
             AND iii. Alpha fetoprotein &gt; 400 μg/L at the time of diagnosis.)

          -  No metastasis outside liver.

          -  Unable or unwilling to receive radical surgery.

          -  No prior transcatheter arterial chemoembolization.

          -  No prior treatment of bufalins including Huachansu.

          -  At least one measurable untreated lesion. All subjects must have at least one
             measurable lesion unidimensionally by CT or MRI scan, according to modified RECIST
             for HCC, that has not been previously treated with surgery, irradiation,
             radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol or acetic acid injection, or
             cryoablation.

          -  Cirrhotic status of Child-Pugh Class A or B.

          -  Adequate hematologic function with absolute neutrophil counts ≥ 1.5×109 /L, platelet
             count ≥ 50 x 109/L, and hemoglobin ≥ 85 g/L.

          -  Signed Written Informed Consent.

          -  Subjects who have a life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of
             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study that the risk of pregnancy is
             minimized.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previously treated target lesion with irradiation, TACE, radiofrequency ablation,
             percutaneous ethanol or acetic acid injection, or cryoablation.

          -  Cirrhotic status of Child-Pugh Class C.

          -  Severe diseases of heart, liver, kidney, etc that may cause inadequate organ
             functions

          -  History of other malignant tumor in 5 years.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.

          -  Mentally disordered.

          -  Participation of other clinical trials within a month.
