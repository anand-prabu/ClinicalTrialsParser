  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many men develop urine leakage after prostate cancer surgery. Usually it is temporary, but
      pelvic floor muscle training and exercise (including urine control strategies) have been
      shown to reduce the time to regaining urine control. This study will test an evidence-based,
      pelvic floor muscle training program that has been adapted to telehealth format and pilot
      tested in a VA-funded pilot/developmental trial. Training is begun 1 month before surgery
      and continued 2 months after surgery. Content is delivered in daily 10-minute sessions using
      a telehealth device, a simple home messaging unit that is used throughout the VA to help
      veterans improve their health. In our pilot study, veterans reported that the home messaging
      units were easy to set up and use, that they appreciated receiving the training in the
      privacy of their homes, enjoyed the interactive style of the learning experience, and felt
      better prepared to deal with urine leakage and empowered with new knowledge and skills to
      help themselves. The control group will also receive a telehealth device, but without the
      pelvic floor muscle training component. Content for both groups will include general
      perioperative care; wetness, odor and skin care management; and outcome measures. Only the
      treatment group will receive the pelvic floor muscle training. Outcomes will be measured
      with brief validated questions administered by the telehealth device.

      Many men develop urine leakage after radical prostatectomy. Usually it is temporary, but
      pelvic floor muscle training including bladder control strategies has been shown to  reduce
      the severity of incontinence and reduce the time to regaining continence. This study will
      test an evidence-based pelvic floor muscle training program that has been adapted to
      telehealth format and pilot tested in a VA-funded pilot/developmental trial. Training is
      begun 1 month before surgery and continued 2 months after surgery. Content is delivered in
      daily 10-minute sessions using a telehealth device, a simple interactive home messaging unit
      that is used throughout the VA to help veterans improve their health. In our pilot study,
      veterans reported that the home messaging units were easy to set up and use, that they
      appreciated receiving the training in the privacy of their homes, enjoyed the interactive
      style of the learning experience, and felt better prepared to deal with urine leakage and
      empowered with new knowledge and skills to help themselves.

      This study is a randomized, controlled trial of the telehealth-delivered, evidence-based,
      intervention developed in the pilot/developmental study. Participants will be randomized 1:1
      to the pelvic floor muscle training program or to a control group. The control group will
      also receive a telehealth device, but without the pelvic floor muscle training component to
      control the use of technology. Content for both groups will include general perioperative
      care; wetness, odor and skin care management; and outcome measures. Only the treatment group
      will receive the pelvic floor muscle training. Outcomes will be measured with validated
      questions administered by the telehealth device.

    <description>The International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Short-Form (ICIQ-SF) is one of a series of International Consultation on Incontinence questionnaires that have been meticulously developed and tested. The ICI questionnaires are becoming the outcome measures of choice in incontinence clinical trials internationally, allowing comparability between studies. The ICIQ-SF is a brief (4 items), reliable (Cronbach's alpha = 0.95), questionnaire that quantifies both symptom burden and impact of incontinence and has been validated in men and women.</description>
