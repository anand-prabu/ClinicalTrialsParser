    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to demonstrate that the Aeolus device providing
      automated control of fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) adjustments in spontaneously
      breathing infants with fluctuating arterial blood oxygen saturation levels is safe and
      efficacious in the routine clinical environment.  Specifically, it is hypothesizes that the
      Aeolus will perform as well or better than standard practice for maintaining infants'
      arterial blood oxygen saturation in a target range while minimizing the exposure to elevated
      levels of oxygen in the inspired gas.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Preterm infants being treated with high flow nasal cannula therapy

          2. A need for supplemental oxygen as demonstrated by an required FiO2 &gt; 0.25 at
             enrollment

          3. Requiring a flow rate of greater than 2 L/min such that the assumed inspired oxygen
             fraction matched delivered oxygen fraction (definition of HFNC).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Major congenital abnormalities

          2. Hemodynamic instability, defined as being outside of a normotensive range based on
             each infant's individual characteristics

          3. Seizures

          4. Ongoing sepsis

          5. Meningitis

          6. Clinician's concern regarding stability of the infant
