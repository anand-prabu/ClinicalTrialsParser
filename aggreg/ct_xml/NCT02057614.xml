    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of topical sirolimus (TD201) 1%
      for plantar keratoderma for the treatment of pachyonychia congenita. This study would also
      like to assess the potential of sirolimus (TD201) to improve the clinical severity of
      plantar keratoderma, including pain.

                  All female subjects (including those with tubal ligations) will be considered to
                  be of childbearing potential unless one or more of the following criteria are
                  met:

                    -  Over age  60

                  use double-barrier contraception methods BEFORE beginning the study and for the
                  duration of the study (37 weeks) or for 12 weeks after the last dose if study
                  drug is discontinued prematurely

        Exclusion Criteria:

               2. Significant condition in the dermatologic treatment area such as trauma, which
                  could impair evaluation for the treatment of PC or nonhealing chronic wound,

               3. History of hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or to drugs of similar
                  chemical classes or history of serious allergic reaction; known allergy to
