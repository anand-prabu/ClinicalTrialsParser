Ankle Brachial Pressure Index \u22650.80. (Calculations made using measurements from\n             posterior tibial & dorsalis pedis arteries & both arms).\n\n          3. Presence of a venous leg ulcer extending through the full thickness of the skin, but\n             not down to muscle, tendon, or bone. The largest ulcer will be designated the SU and\n             the only one included in the study. If other ulcerations are present on the same leg\n             they must be more than 2 cm apart from the SU.\n\n          4. Venous disease confirmed by Doppler ultrasound to demonstrate reflux of > 0.5 seconds\n             in saphenous (great or small), calf perforators or the deep venous system. Subjects\n             with prior venous surgery may be included if they still demonstrate significant\n             reflux in a remaining venous segment and the SU continues to suffer poor healing\n             because of venous hypertension.\n\n          5. SU has been present 1 \u2264 x \u2264 12 months prior to the initial screening visit, and is\n             excluded if it has undergone 12 months of continuous high strength compression\n             therapy over its duration.\n\n          6. SU with a 2.5 \u2264 x \u2264 20 cm2 at the T1 visit (PD).\n\n          7. SU with a clean, granulating base free of adherent slough at the T1 visit (PD).\n\n          8. In the case of a female patient of childbearing potential, willingness to use\n             acceptable methods of contraception. A urine pregnancy test at the T1 visit must be\n             administered, and must be negative for inclusion.\n\n          9. Understanding of and willingness by the patient to participate in the clinical study\n             and ability to comply with study procedures and study visit schedule.\n\n         10. Reading, approval, and signature by the patient of the IRB/IEC ICF before screening\n             procedures are undertaken.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:Potential subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be\n        excluded from enrollment and subsequent randomization:\n\n          1. Ulcer(s) deemed by the Investigator to be caused by a medical condition other than\n             venous insufficiency. These may include, but are not limited to: ulcerations due to\n             fungal, malignant, diabetic, and/or arterial insufficiency causes.\n\n          2. Ulcer exhibits clinical signs and symptoms of infection at S1 or T1. The infection\n             should be treated & afterward the patient may be re-assessed for eligibility for\n             study re-entry.\n\n          3. Known allergy to any of the protocol-stipulated treatment procedures or non-tolerance\n             of multi-layer compression therapy.\n\n          4. Ulcer, in the opinion of the Investigator, is suspicious for cancer.\n\n          5. A history of more than 2 weeks treatment with immunosuppressants (including systemic\n             corticosteroids), cytotoxic chemotherapy, or application of topical steroids to the\n             ulcer surface within 1 month prior to S1, or treatments with such medications during\n             screening, or anticipated requirement of such medications during the course of the\n             study.\n\n          6. Treatment with any investigational drug(s) or therapeutic device(s) within 30 days\n             preceding S1; or anticipated use of any of these therapies during the course of the\n             study.\n\n          7. Malignant disease not in remission for 5 or more years, other than basal cell or\n             squamous cell carcinomas of the skin that have been medically or surgically treated\n             without evidence of metastases.\n\n          8. History of radiation at the SU site.\n\n          9. As determined by medical history, presence of one or more medical conditions\n             including renal, hepatic, hematologic, active auto-immune or immune diseases that, in\n             the opinion of the Investigator, would make the subject an inappropriate candidate\n             for this ulcer healing study.\n\n         10. Known history of having AIDS or history of HIV infection.\n\n         11. Previous participation in any VitroGro\u00ae ECM trial within the past 6 months.\n\n         12. SU has been previously treated with tissue engineered materials or other scaffold\n             materials within 30 days prior to S1.\n\n         13. SU which in the opinion of the Investigator might require negative pressure wound\n             therapy or hyperbaric oxygen during the course of the trial.\n\n         14. Presence of any condition(s) that seriously compromise(s) the subject's ability to\n             complete this study, or a known history of poor adherence with medical treatment.\n\n         15. NYHA Class III and IV congestive heart failure (CHF), as defined by the following\n             criteria:\n\n               -  Class III: Symptoms with moderate exertion\n\n               -  Class IV: Symptoms at rest\n\n         16. Uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus, as measured by an HbA1c >10%.\n\n         17. Ulcer on the dorsum of the foot or with more than 50% of the ulcer below the\n             malleolus is excluded.\n\n         18. Pregnancy or breast-feeding.\n\n         19. Increase or decrease by >30% in the SU surface area at the T1 visit (PD) as compared\n             to the SU surface area as measured at the S1 visit (PD)."
