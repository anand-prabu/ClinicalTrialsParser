      The primary objectives of the study are to explore the effect of treatment with orally
      inhaled tiotropium + olodaterol fixed dose combination  with and without exercise training,
      and tiotropium comparing to placebo, on top of behavioural modification in improving
      exercise capacity in patients with COPD

             claudication or morbid obesity.

          -  Patients who have taken an investigational drug within one month or six half lives
