  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 proof-of-concept study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,
      crossover study to investigate ganaxolone treatment in children with fragile x syndrome
      (FXS). Up to 60 subjects (ages 6-17 yrs) will be randomized to receive either ganaxolone or
      placebo for 6 weeks and then cross over to the opposite treatment for another 6 weeks. The
      aim of the study is assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ganaxolone for treatment
      of anxiety and attention in subjects with FXS. The hypothesis is that ganaxolone treatment
      compared to placebo will improve anxiety and attention as measured by the several
      neuropsychological and psychometric tests.

    <textblock>
      This is a single center study at UC Davis MIND Institute. Children with fragile x syndrome
      between the ages of 6-17yrs, inclusive will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive
      ganaxolone or placebo treatment for 6 weeks, discontinue treatment and washout for 2 weeks,
      and then cross over to the opposite treatment for another 6 weeks. The primary aim of the
      study is to assess efficacy of ganaxolone treatment compared to placebo on clinical
      behaviors such as anxiety and attention as measured by Clinician's Global
      Impression-Improvement (CGI-I). The key secondary efficacy measure is the Pediatric Anxiety
      Scale (PARS). Other secondary efficacy measures include the visual analog scale (VAS),
      Anxiety, Depression, Attention, and Mood Scale (ADAMS), Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham-IV
      Questionnaire (SNAP-IV), and Aberrant Behavior Checklist- Community Edition (ABC-C).
      Tolerability and safety will be monitored by routine vital signs, physical/neurological
      exams, ECGs, clinical laboratory and adverse event assessments.
