On day 0, patients receive umbilical\n      cord blood infusion. If TBI is not tolerated, busulfan is substituted and administered\n      orally every 6 hours for 4 days on days -8 to -5. Cyclosporine and methylprednisolone begin\n      on day -2 and continue for 6 months.\n\n      Patients are followed at least monthly for 1 year, then every 6 months for the second year,\n      and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be a maximum of 48 patients accrued into this study over 4\n      years."
