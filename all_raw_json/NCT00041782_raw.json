            "textblock": "Study Plan:  Adult cancer patients who have a low risk profile and present with DVT will\n      receive dalteparin 200 IU/kg subcutaneously daily (based on actual body weight with a\n      maximum dose of 18,000 IU).  Eligible patients who have signed the informed consent will be\n      instructed on injection technique, will give themselves their first subcutaneous injection\n      under supervision of the physician or the nurse and will be observed for a minimum of 1-2\n      hours prior to discharge.  Patients may be admitted to an observation unit for up to 24\n      hours prior to discharge if medically necessary.  Those patients without complications\n      during the observation period will be given discharge instructions and an outpatient\n      schedule to see one of the physician investigators daily for their subcutaneous injection of\n      dalteparin, routine lab work and initiation of oral anticoagulation therapy.\n\n      Patients that are proficient in administering their own injection with dalteparin will be\n      evaluated every other day by the physician investigator.  On days of home injection, the\n      study nurse will call the patient to check on the patient's status and to remind the patient\n      of his/her daily injection.  Patients will undergo a physical examination every other day by\n      the physician investigator directed towards the clinically affected areas until a\n      therapeutic response (INR 2-3) on oral warfarin has been achieved or the patient's clinical\n      condition warrants modification of therapy with or without hospitalization.  Patients will\n      remain on study for a minimum of 5 days with at least 1 day of therapeutic oral\n      anticoagulation.\n\n      The quality of life of the patients enrolled will be assessed by using the Modified Medical\n      Outcome Study Short Form-20.  An adapted version of the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist will be\n      used to specifically assess patients with thrombosis.  Patients will complete these two\n      instruments at study entry, day 3, day 5 and at the end of study if different from day 5."
