    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a multi-center, randomized, double blind (patient and assessor), sham
      controlled clinical trial using a parallel 2 group design recruiting 220 patients of at
      least 18 years of age. The investigators will include patients presenting with clinically
      and radiologically diagnosed knee OA according to the criteria of the American College of
      Rheumatology, who experienced knee pain lasting for at least six months, and were diagnosed
      with radiographic severity of ≥ 2 on the Kellgren-Lawrence grading system or had one or more
      of the following signs and symptoms in the knee; restricted range of motion, pain in motion,
      crepitations, morning stiffness. Patients will be randomly allocated to receive TENS or sham
      TENS for 3 weeks.

      Background

      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common arthritic condition, which is one of the leading
      causes of disability in adults. Currently, no treatment can stop or reverse the progressive
      joint degeneration caused by OA. Most clinical interventions aim to improve pain and
      physical function. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is widely used in the
      management of knee OA to relieve osteoarthritic pain and facilitate the performance of
      therapeutic activities in order to maintain or improve physical function. Although its use
      is widespread, the available evidence is of questionable quality. An adequately sized and
      well conducted randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating the effectiveness and safety
      of TENS as treatment modality for knee OA is warranted to assist clinicians and policy
      makers to make decisions that are based on high-quality evidence, ultimately optimizing
      delivery of health-care in knee OA.

      Objective

      To determine TENS safety and effectiveness on pain and physical function compared to sham
      TENS in patients with knee OA.

      Methods

      Multi-center, randomized, double blind (patient and assessor), sham controlled clinical
      trial using a parallel 2 group design. Patients will be randomly allocated to receive TENS
      or sham TENS for 3 weeks. Informed consent of eligible patients will be obtained prior to
      randomization. Patients will be assigned on a 1:1 basis to the TENS or sham TENS group.
      Randomization will be centralized using randomization software and an electronic
      randomization form, generated by the trial coordinating centre (CTU Bern). Patients will be
      randomized once demographic data and selection criteria are completed by the recruiting
      physician in an electronic form. Randomization will be stratified according to treatment
      centre, TENS naivety and clinical severity.
