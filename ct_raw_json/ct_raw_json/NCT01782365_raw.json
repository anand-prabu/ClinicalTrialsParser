Slow wave sleep (SWS), in particular, with its\n      slow oscillating activity have shown to enhance declarative, hippocampus-dependent memory\n      representations. This impact of sleep on memory performance can be additionally enhanced by\n      exogeneous induction of transcranial slow oscillating stimulation (tSOS) within the\n      frequency range of SWS in humans (0,7- 0,8 Hz) during sleep, as has been demonstrated in\n      young, healthy subjects. If patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI)- usually\n      characterized by initial difficulties in hippocampus dependent memory functions - benefit\n      from transcranial slow oscillatory stimulation (tSOS) during sleep as well has not been\n      studied so far. The primary goal of the study is therefore to investigate the impact of\n      oscillating current stimulation (tSOS) during a daytime nap on declarative memory\n      consolidation in MCI patients."
