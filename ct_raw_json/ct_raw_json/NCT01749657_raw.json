            "textblock": "Orthotic devices serve as essential elements of conservative care programs for posterior\n      tibial tendon dysfunction (PTTD).  Data on currently used devices remain limited.  Current\n      device designs are restrictive and focus on correction of flatfoot kinematics in subjects\n      with stage II PTTD. Restrictive designs that limit ankle motion may lead to weakness and\n      altered gait dynamics.  It remains unclear if less restrictive device designs would be more\n      optimal for subjects with stage II PTTD. The aims of the current proposal are to examine the\n      in-vivo biomechanics of different device designs and to use outcomes to identify the device\n      and design optimal for subjects with stage II PTTD. Research Design: This study will use a\n      laboratory based repeated measures design to explore the function of four different orthotic\n      devices in a sample of 60 subjects with stage II PTTD at baseline. Then each subject will be\n      followed prospectively for 12 weeks while wearing one of the orthotic devices. Clinical\n      outcomes including strength, tendon morphology, and self-reported outcomes will be measured\n      at 12 weeks. Baseline foot kinematics will be collected using a three segment foot model\n      (first metatarsal, calcaneus, tibia) while data on ankle kinetics will be derived from the\n      kinematic data and the ground reaction forces.  Impact: There are currently no head-to-head\n      comparisons available among the various devices used in the conservative management of stage\n      II PTTD.  The proposed study will provide the necessary controlled data to determine the\n      kinematic and kinetic effects of selected devices and the specific components needed to\n      optimize device design.  Outcomes will be used to determine which designs are successful to\n      use clinically."

Rasch analyses for the FFI-R indicated a Pearson reliability of 0.96 and item reliability of 0.93. The domains of the 34 items in the FFI-R questionnaire include pain and stiffness, social/emotional issues, personal disability, and social activity limitation. Although the FFI-R is relatively new, the 23 items from the FFI were the basis for the revised scale. The FFI has been used to measure outcomes for a variety of foot and ankle problems including plantar fasciitis, diabetes, and PTTD [32]. The overall score of the FFI-R will be used as a primary outcome variable while the subscales will be used as secondary outcome variables.",
