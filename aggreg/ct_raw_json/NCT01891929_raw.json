It includes computer based and paper and pencil exercises that target 6 main cognitive functions (selective attention; verbal memory; visuo-spatiale attention and memory, working memory, reasoning, and speed of execution) which have been recommended by the MATRICS consensus. Each exercise has 10 difficulty levels. Allocation of the training modules in RECOS is determined according to the standard scores obtained in the comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Each patient participates in the module corresponding to his/her most altered cognitive area."

Measuring the efficiency of the cognitive remediation program RECOS (COgnitive\n           REmediation in Schizophrenia) on the capacity of the patients suffering from\n           schizophrenia to improve the integration in sheltered employment (ESAT and EA).\n\n        2. Comparing the efficiency of the program of cognitive remediation RECOS (RECOS arm) to\n           the one of an usual program of coverage/care (TAU arm = Treatment As Usual) on\n           integration in sheltered employment of patients suffering from schizophrenia.\n\n        3. Realizing a comparative analysis, in both arms, of :\n\n             1. the number of working hours achieved in protected environment during the 6 months\n                following the two programs (reported to the working time planned by the contract\n                of employment)\n\n             2. the duration of such employments in protected areas.\n\n        4. Estimating the impact of RECOS on the neuropsychological variables, the symptomatology,\n           the consciousness of the disorders(insight), the quality of life and the social\n           autonomy before the treatment (month M0), at the end of the treatment (month M3), and 6\n           months later (month M9), and looking for a correlation between the improvement of these\n           parameters and sheltered employment.\n\n        5. Estimating the impact of cognitive remediation on integration in sheltered employment."
