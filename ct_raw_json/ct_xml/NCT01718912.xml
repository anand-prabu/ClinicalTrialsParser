  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many physically handicapped patients at the dental department, Toronto Rehabilitation
      Institute(TRI) have considerable gingival inflammation and breath odour because of the
      inability to effectively handle a toothbrush.  These patients have considerable periodontal
      disease.  There is a concern that these pathogens may have a detrimental effect on wound
      healing in other areas of the body.

      Hypothesis: Patients attending the dental department at TRI that are treated with the
      antibiotic-antifungal rinse containing metronidazole and nystatin will show substantial
      decrease in periodontal disease as measured by bleeding points and pocket depth when
      compared to the group that continues to use their regular oral hygiene methods (control
      group).
