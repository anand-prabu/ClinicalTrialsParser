There is already a well establish\n      relationship between total body fat excess, cardiometabolic diseases and increased\n      mortality, knowing that abdominal fat (android pattern), different from body index, presents\n      an additional influence to health risks. Women with their abdominal adipocytes (visceral\n      fat) show an increased lipolitic activity that releases free fat acids to the systemic and\n      portal circulation leading to a metabolic syndrome, increasing the risk of cardiovascular\n      diseases Aerobic exercise is a way to decrease fat as it stimulates lipolysis through an\n      increase in catecholamine's level resulting from a sympathetic system nervous activity\n      raise. The most used exercise for lipid elimination is the prolonged aerobic moderate\n      exercise with a minimum of 30 mn.\n\n      Nevertheless aerobic exercise practice reduce globally lipidic sources and not locally .\n      Electrolipolysis using microcurrent has been used in clinical practice as a technique to\n      reduce abdominal fat. This technique can be applied transcutaneously or percutaneously\n      seeming that the former is not so effective as skin can be an obstacle to the current effect\n      on visceral and subcutaneous fat .\n\n      Abdominal fat excess is associated with cardiometabolic diseases and can be prevented using\n      microcurrent and aerobic exercise to stimulate lipolysis."
