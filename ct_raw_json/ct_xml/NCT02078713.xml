      The investigators have designed a tablet-based decision support tool to help women learn
      more about their birth control options and support them in choosing a method they are happy
      with. The investigators will test whether the decision support tool helps women choose a
      birth control method they can continue using successfully by having some women use the tool
      before their birth control-related visit to a health care provider, and some women not use
      the tool before their visit. The investigators will then follow up with all the women at
      three months and six months after their visit to see if they are still using the birth
      control method they chose at the visit and how happy they are with the method.

      Hypotheses:

        1. The contraceptive decision support tool will increase women's knowledge and use of
           highly effective reversible contraception, compared to usual care.

        2. The contraceptive decision support tool will decrease decision conflict, compared to
           usual care.

        3. The contraceptive decision support tool will increase patient satisfaction with the
           clinic visit and with their method, compared to usual care.

        4. Women who use the contraceptive decision support tool will be more likely to continue
           using their chosen method at six months follow-up, compared to women who receive usual
           care.

        5. Women who use the contraceptive decision support tool will have fewer unintended
           pregnancies during the follow-up period, compared to women who received usual care.

        6. The contraceptive decision support tool will increase shared patient-provider decision
           making in contraceptive counseling visits, compared to usual care.

        7. The contraceptive decision support tool will decrease provider frustration when
           providing contraceptive counseling and increase provider job satisfaction.

    <textblock>
      The impacts of unintended pregnancy include adverse maternal and infant outcomes for women
      who continue their pregnancies, with higher rates of infant low birth weight, infant
      mortality, and maternal mortality and morbidity for these pregnancies as compared to planned
      pregnancies. In addition, children resulting from unplanned pregnancies have been found to
      be more likely to experience developmental delay.

      Over the past several decades, the proportion of unintended pregnancy in the United States
      has remained stubbornly high at approximately 50%. Each year, one in 20 women of
      reproductive age experiences an unintended pregnancy, and it is estimated that over half of
      women will have an unintended pregnancy in their lifetime. This high rate of unintended
      pregnancy in the United States places a heavy burden on both women and the health care
      system. A disproportionate amount of this burden is experienced by minority women and women
      of lower socioeconomic status. Given the high rate of unintended pregnancies in this
      country, interventions designed to help women achieve their fertility goals could have a
      substantial impact on their health outcomes and life course. In addition, identifying
      strategies that are appropriate for use in high-risk, diverse populations could address
      disparities in women's ability to plan their pregnancies.

      The investigators propose a cluster randomized trial to investigate the effect of an
      interactive, tablet-based contraceptive decision support tool that women will use
      immediately prior to their contraceptive counseling visits. The goal of the tool is to
      facilitate shared decision-making between the woman and her health care provider, with the
      ultimate goal of helping the woman to choose a contraceptive method that is consistent with
      her values and preferences, and is therefore best suited to helping her to avoid an
      unplanned pregnancy. The tool will be available in both English and Spanish.

      The investigators will measure the tool's effect on women's contraceptive continuation, as
      well as on their experience of contraceptive counseling, measured both quantitatively and
      qualitatively. In addition, the investigators will collect quantitative and qualitative data
      to determine the impact of the implementation of this tool on the experiences of providers
      and the clinics in which they work.
