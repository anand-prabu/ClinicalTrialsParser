    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of three intratumoral
      injections of VCN-01, either administered alone or in combination with gemcitabine, in
      patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and to determine the recommended phase II
      dose of VCN-01 combined with gemcitabine.

      The study consists in two parts:

        -  Part I is a dose escalation study to determine the safety and tolerability of three
           intratumoral injections of VCN-01 in combination with a fixed dose of gemcitabine

        -  Part II only intratumoral VCN-01 consisting of three intratumoral injections will be
           administered
