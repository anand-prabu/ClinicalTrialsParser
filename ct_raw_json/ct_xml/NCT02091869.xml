      The purpose of this study is to see if using a mobile phone application asthma action plan
      will help improve asthma management.

    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a randomized trial to examine the effectiveness of a
      mobile-based Asthma Action Plan that will meet the national guidelines recommendation for
      individualized Asthma Action Plan treatment plans.  The mobile app will provide immediate
      instructions and feedback once data is entered by the participants.  This is an randomized
      trial which will be compared with an paper asthma action plan.  Participants will be
      randomized through a statistical table.  The mobile app will be password and Health
      Information Portability and Protection Act protected.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 12 and ≤ 17 years.

          -  Access to Apple or Android based smart phone

          -  Mild to severe persistent asthma or poorly controlled asthma (see  definitions
             below).

             o A different assessment of eligibility will be performed depending on whether or not
             the parent reports use of a preventive asthma medication at baseline.  This is
             consistent with 2007 National Asthma Education Prevention Program recommendations
             that make a strong distinction between classifying asthma severity (for children not
             using preventive medications) and assessing control (for children using preventive
             medications).  If a child has used a preventive medication in the past, but reports
             no use of the medication in the prior 3 months, we will assess severity.)

          -  Children not using a preventive medication at baseline: Assess for mild persistent to
             severe persistent asthma. Any 1 of the following, during the prior 4 weeks (as
             defined by parent interview in the waiting room) will determine severity:

               -  An average of &gt;2 days per week with asthma symptoms

               -  &gt;2 days per week with rescue medication use

               -  ≥2 nights per month awakened with nighttime symptoms

               -  Minor limitation of activity

               -  ≥2 episodes of asthma during the past year that have required systemic
                  corticosteroids

          -  Children using a preventive medication at baseline:  Assess for poorly controlled
             asthma.  Any 1 of the following, during the prior 4 weeks (as defined by parent
             interview in the waiting room) will determine control:

               -  An average of &gt;2 days per week with asthma symptoms

               -  &gt;2 days per week with rescue medication use

               -  ≥2 nights per month awakened with nighttime symptoms

               -  Some limitation of activity

               -  ≥2 episodes of asthma during the past year that have required systemic
                  corticosteroids.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant underlying respiratory disease other than asthma (such as cystic fibrosis
             or chronic lung disease) that could potentially interfere with asthma-related outcome
             measures.

          -  Significant co-morbid conditions (such as moderate to severe developmental delay,
             i.e. special education classroom or diagnosis) that could preclude participation in
             an education-based intervention.

          -  Inability to speak or understand English (child or parent).

          -  Children in foster care or other situations in which consent cannot be obtained from
             a guardian.

          -  Prior enrollment in the study.
