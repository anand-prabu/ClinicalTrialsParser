    <textblock>
      HIP ATTACK is an international randomized controlled trial  of 1000 patients with a hip
      fracture that requires a surgical intervention.  This trial will determine the effect of
      accelerated medical clearance and accelerated surgery compared to standard care on the
      30-day risk of a major perioperative complication (i.e., a composite of mortality, nonfatal
      myocardial infarction, nonfatal pulmonary embolism, nonfatal pneumonia, nonfatal sepsis,
      nonfatal stroke, and nonfatal life-threatening and major bleeding).

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  age ≥45 years; and

          -  diagnosis of hip fracture during working hours with a low-energy mechanism (i.e.,
             falling from standing height) requiring surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients requiring emergent surgery or emergent interventions for another reason
             (e.g., subdural hematoma, abdominal pathology requiring urgent laparotomy, acute limb
             ischemia, other fractures or trauma requiring emergent surgery, necrotising
             fasciitis, coronary revascularization, pacemaker-implantation);

          -  open hip fracture;

          -  bilateral hip fractures;

          -  peri-prosthetic fracture;

          -  therapeutic anticoagulation not induced by warfarin or unfractionated heparin, (e.g.,
             administration of therapeutic Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) (&gt;6,000 u/24h) in
             the 24 hours prior to enrolment or any intake of Dabigatran, Apixaban, Rivaroxaban,
             or Edoxaban);

          -  patients on a therapeutic vitamin K antagonist with a history of heparin induced
             thrombocytopenia (HIT);

          -  patients refusing participation; or

          -  patients previously enrolled in the study.
