  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a new research agent named 89Zr-DFO-trastuzumab can
      show esophagogastric cancer tumors on a PET scan.  Also to see how long 89Zr-DFO-trastuzumab
      lasts in the blood when given in small amounts.

    <description>Antibody imaging is considered feasible if 70% of the patients are antibody-imaging positive.  Antibody imaging will be considered feasible if 7 or more of the 10 patients in the first cohort are antibody-imaging-positive.We will also require that none of these patients experience severe toxicity attributable to the initial antibody.</description>

    <description>Samples will be obtained just prior to injection of the 89Zr DFO-trastuzumab tracer this sample will be banked at -80degree C for future testing for immune response (HAHA) if altered biodistribution is observed., and at 5 ± 2 minutes, 15 ± 5, 30 ± 9, 60 ± 19 minutes, and 120 − 240 minutes after the injection of the tracer 1, and at the time of each subsequent day of imaging.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive 5 mCi + 0.5 mCi of 89Zr-DFO-trastuzumab given IV over 5-10 min. Injection of cold trastuzumab will be mixed with 89Zr-DFO-trastuzumab so that total mass is equal to 50 mg [1]. In the first ten patients we wish to obtain normal organ dosimetry, pharmacokinetics &amp; determine optimal imaging time, therefore these patients will undergo imaging at 4 time points post injection, whole body counts &amp; blood draws. Subsequent patients will receive the antibody &amp; will only undergo imaging at a single time point (based on the first 10 patients) &amp; will not have whole body counts or serial bloods for pharmacokinetics. The administration of 89Zr-DFO-trastuzumab to patients undergoing a second study will be identical as for their baseline study. Patients undergoing a second injection will only have one scan that will be performed within 1 day before or 2 days after their optimum imaging time point, determined from their baseline imaging study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Registered patient at MSKCC

          -  Age ≥18 years

          -  Pathologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or primary esophagogastric
             cancer HER2 positive status by FISH or IHC as currently being implemented for
             patients with esophagogastric cancer. HER2 overexpression and/or amplification as
             determined by immunohistochemistry (3+) or FISH (≥2.0)

          -  Measurable or evaluable disease, lesions that have not been previously radiated, with
             clinically indicated imaging evaluation performed within 4 weeks prior to study entry
             (CT, MRI, FDG PET or bone scan). Patients requiring concurrent radiation treatment
             are not eligible unless additional lesions that are not being irradiated and are
             assessable for targeting are present.

          -  Karnofsky Performance Score ≥ 60

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign informed consent

          -  Negative pregnancy test, to be performed on female patients of childbearing potential
             within 1week before administration of radioactive material.

          -  Life expectancy of at least three (3) months.

          -  Willingness to use birth control while on study.

          -  The patients will be asked to consent to provide access to data obtained from
             molecular analysis that has been done on archived tumor tissue that will be
             correlated with 89Zr-DFO-trastuzumab imaging results.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to lie still for the duration of the scanning procedure.

          -  Patients with known sensitivity or contraindication to any of the component of
             89Zr-DFO-trastuzumab (89Zr or Desferroxiamine (DFO) or trastuzumab)

          -  Patients who have received trastuzumab must have at least a washout period for
             trastuzumab of 14 days, this will not apply to 89Zr-DFO-trastuzumab repeat, post
             treatment assessment where patients may be receiving trastuzumab.

          -  HIV positive or active hepatitis.

          -  History or presence of clinically relevant cardiovascular abnormalities such as
             uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure NYHA classification of 3,
             unstable angina or poorly controlled arrhythmia. Myocardial infarction within 6
             months prior to study entry If prior experimental therapy has been received a period
             of washout appropriate to the prior treatment is required (for example 2 weeks for
             trastuzumab). Patients requiring concurrent radiation treatment will not be recruited
             unless they have additional lesions that are not being irradiated and are assessable
             for targeting.

          -  Hematologic

               -  Platelets &lt;50K/mcL

               -  ANC &lt;1.0 K/mcL

          -  Hepatic laboratory values

             o Bilirubin &gt;2 x ULN (institutional upper limits of normal), with exception of
             patients with Gilberts disease. AST/ALT &gt;2.5 x ULN (institutional upper limits of
             normal); &gt;5 x ULN if liver metastasis

          -  Renal laboratory values o Estimated GFR (eGFR) &lt; 30mL/min/1.73m2
