  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare 6% hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 130/0.4 in a balanced
      electrolyte solution (Volulyte®) with modified fluid gelatin (Geloplasma®) as the priming
      solution for the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit. The microvascular reactivity and the
      effects on tissue (StO2) and cerebral (ScO2) oxygen saturation will be examined using
      near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Adult consenting patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting surgery
        on moderately hypothermic (&gt; 32°C) CPB without blood transfusion. Age ≥ 18 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria are an ejection fraction &lt; 25%, a known allergy to HES, admission of
        HES or gelatines within the preceding 2 weeks, renal insufficiency (creatinine &gt; 2.0
        mg/dl), significant hepatic disease (liver function tests &gt; 3x upper limit of normal),
        history of cerebrovascular disease, significant carotid artery stenosis (&gt; 60%),
        perioperative use of corticosteroids, and need for vasopressor or inotropic therapy before
        surgery. An expected haematocrit on CPB, calculated based on preoperative haematocrit,
        calculated blood volume and amount of cardioplegia, of &lt; 23% is also considered an
        exclusion criterium
