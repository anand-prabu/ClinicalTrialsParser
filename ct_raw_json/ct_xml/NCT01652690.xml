  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this prospective, observational study in Czech Republic and Slovakia is to
      describe per country the characteristics of women treated with Prolia® (denosumab) in
      routine clinical practice and the clinical management of these patients during the first 2
      years of treatment.  In addition, the study aims to collect safety data in the real-life
      clinical practice settings on adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and serious ADRs.
