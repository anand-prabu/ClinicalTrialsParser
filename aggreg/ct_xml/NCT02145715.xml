  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Velcade (bortezomib), thalidomide and dexamethasone (VTD) has been demonstrated to be a
      highly effective combination in both patients with previously untreated and those with
      relapsed multiple myeloma. In previously untreated patients VTD demonstrated clear
      superiority to TD as induction therapy prior to planned tandem autologous stem cell
      transplant.

      The rationale of this trial is to combine a 'gold standard' antiMM combination with the HDAC
      inhibitor Panobinostat. There is emerging data to support the concept of clinical synergy
      between BTZ and HDACi's.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and estimated
      response rates of panobinostat, administered in combination with VTD, in subjects with
      relapsed and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.
