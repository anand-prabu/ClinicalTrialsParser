Efficacy will be assessed using visual grading, device\n      measurements and digital photography. Tolerance and safety will be evaluated by grading for\n      objective and subjective signs of irritation, and the incidence and severity of adverse\n      events. Efficacy and tolerance of this product are compared to that of Hydroquinone, which\n      is applied to one side of the subject's face while the herbal de-pigmenting regimen is\n      applied to the other side of the face.\n\n      The two product pigmentation reducing herbal regimen is based on the novel concept of\n      inhibiting all 14 major and the 3 branch steps in the melanin cascade."
