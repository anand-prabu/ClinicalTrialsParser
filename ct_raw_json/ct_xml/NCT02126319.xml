  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to examine whether a cognitive-affective preparation was more
      beneficial, in general, and more specifically for certain subgroups, such as
      African-American men and individuals with high monitoring style.

    <textblock>
      High risk men enrolling in a state of the science Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment Program (N
      = 128) underwent a Pca counseling visit immediately followed by either a cognitive-affective
      preparation (CAP) session designed to help men process the information they received or a
      general health education session to control for time and attention (comparison group). All
      men chose to participate in Pca screening.
