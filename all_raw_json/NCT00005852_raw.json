Determine the\n      efficacy of high dose cyclophosphamide and antithymocyte globulin as conditioning regimen\n      for a second bone marrow transplant in patients who reject their first graft. III. Determine\n      the efficacy of methylprednisolone and anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody as a conditioning\n      regimen for a second bone marrow transplant in patients who reject their first graft and are\n      poor candidates for cyclophosphamide and antithymocyte globulin.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients with graft failure with the following organ function and performance\n      status are assigned to arm I: Performance status: Karnofsky 60-100% Pulmonary: FEV1 and DLCO\n      at least 50% Cardiac: Left ventricular ejection fraction at least 45% Hepatic: None to mild\n      venoocclusive disease Patients with graft failure with the following organ function and\n      performance status are assigned to arm II: Performance status: Karnofsky 20-50% Pulmonary:\n      FEV1 or DLCO less than 50% Cardiac: Left ventricular ejection fraction less than 45%\n      Hepatic: Moderate to severe venoocclusive disease Patients with aplastic anemia are assigned\n      to arm I. Arm I: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -5 to -2,\n      antithymocyte globulin IV over 8 hours on days -5 to -3, and bone marrow transplant on day\n      0. Arm II: Patients receive methylprednisolone IV twice a day on days -5 to 62; monoclonal\n      antibody OKT3 IV on days -1 to 24; bone marrow transplant on day 0; oral cyclosporine twice\n      a day starting day 20; and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously once a day starting day -5\n      until blood counts recover. Patients are followed once a week for 3 months and then monthly\n      for one year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients (20 with aplastic anemia and 20 with graft\n      failure) will be accrued for this study."
