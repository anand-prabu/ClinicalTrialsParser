Prior to rTMS, single pulse TMS will be used to localize the specific brain\n      region that we are interested in."

Each treatment session will involve implementing rTMS, while the patient is\n      involved in a cognitive exercise such as naming object or action.  The study sessions will\n      be scheduled as follows: Block 1: 5 days/week for two weeks followed by 2 days a week for 1\n      week, followed by once a week for 1 week (total of 13 treatments); Pause: 4 weeks of no\n      treatment; and Block 2: another 13 sessions of treatment with the same pattern as Block 1.\n      One of these two sets of treatment (Block 1 or Block 2) will be sham and one will be real.\n      Sham treatment sessions are identical to real treatment sessions, except that there is no\n      magnetic stimulation. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either sham or real\n      treatment first. The purpose of sham treatment is to have a control group data that the\n      plausible improvement as a result of rTMS can be compared to. By designing two sets of\n      sham-real or real-sham treatment sessions, every participant will receive a real treatment,\n      while we will also have control data.\n\n      The cognitive assessments will be done at the baseline, and then on weekly basis. A subgroup\n      of the study population will be recruited for investigating the second objective: effect of\n      rTMS on sleep quality. Those patients will be required to sign a second consent; then, the\n      patients will go through full-night sleep study at Misericordia Health Center at the same\n      time intervals as their cognitive assessments."
