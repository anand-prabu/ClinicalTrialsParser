  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized control trial evaluating a novel smoking cessation intervention in individuals
      at a an inpatient clinic for clients with addiction and concurrent disorders. The
      intervention is based on cognitive bias modification, where participants are explicitly or
      implicitly trained to make avoidance movements by pushing a joystick in response to pictures
      of smoking, and as a result altering their cognitive biases towards smoking and tobacco
      dependence.

      Hypothesis: Participation in the experimental (tobacco-avoidance) condition will induce
      reduction of smoking, assessed as lower levels of carbon monoxide measured  at baseline and
      12 week follow-up.

    <description>The breath carbon monoxide monitoring device will be used both before the intervention for a baseline measure and at the 12-week follow-up for comparison. These two measurements will be used to detect changes in smoking patterns that may have occurred during this interval. The method allows to objectify abstinence from smoking.</description>

    <description>The FTND is a 6-item questionnaire scored to test level of nicotine dependence, and will be presented to patients prior to the intervention. Patients meeting a cut-off score of 5 or higher will be eligible to participate in the intervention portion of this study.</description>

    <description>The Tobacco Retraining of Automatic Approach The tobacco-RAA will be the intervention in changing approach tendencies towards tobacco. The task uses pictures of tobacco related objects (e.g, a cigarette) and pictures of non-tobacco related objects (e.g, a spoon). Patients will be presented with a joystick while pictures are presented on a computer screen. Patients will be presented with pictures, pulling pictures in a portrait format, while they push pictures in a landscape format. In the experimental condition pictures pushed will almost exclusively be smoking related pictures. In the control condition smoking pictures will be equally divided into push and pull conditions.</description>
