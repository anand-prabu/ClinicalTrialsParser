The PBMC will be activated with OKT3 and expanded in IL-2 to generate from 20-320 \u00d7109 ATC during a maximum of 14 days of culture. Three patients will be treated at each dose level. The dose levels for each infusion are: 5, 10, 20, and 40 billion. Each patient will receive a total of 8 doses of armed ATC given twice weekly for 4 weeks. If the patients encounter toxicities related to armed ATC, the dose and administration will be modified as delineated per the protocol. The patients will also receive subcutaneous injections of IL-2 (3.0 \u00d7 105 IU/m2/day) starting 3 days before the 1st armed ATC infusion and ending 7 days after the last armed ATC infusion. GM-CSF (250\u03bcg/m2 twice per week) will given subcutaneously to start 3 days before the 1st armed ATC infusion and ending 7 days after the last dose of armed ATC."

The PBMCs are treated\n      ex vivo with monoclonal antibody OKT3 to form armed activated T cells (ATC). The armed ATC\n      are expanded for 14 days in interleukin-2 (IL-2).\n\n      Patients receive armed ATC IV over 30 minutes twice weekly for 4 weeks. Patients also\n      receive IL-2 subcutaneously (SC) once daily and sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC twice weekly\n      beginning 3 days before the first infusion of armed ATC and continuing until 7 days after\n      the last infusion of armed ATC.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of armed ATC until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional\n      patients are treated at that dose.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1, 2, and 5 months and then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of this\n      study and a total of 18-33 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of this study\n      within 4-6 years.\n\n      PLEASE NOTE: THIS STUDY WAS INTENDED TO BE A PHASE I/II STUDY, BUT NEVER MOVED FORWARD TO\n      PHASE II.
