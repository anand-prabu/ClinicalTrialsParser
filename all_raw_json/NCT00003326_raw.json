Determine the objective response rate of paclitaxel administered as a weekly\n      one hour infusion in patients with metastatic, locally recurrent, or unresectable squamous\n      cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. II. Evaluate the safety of paclitaxel in\n      this patient population. III. Assess the overall survival and quality of life of these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive intravenous paclitaxel\n      over 1 hour weekly. Each course consists of four weeks. Patients receive treatment until\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects is observed. Patient response is assessed\n      every 2 courses during the first year and then every 3 months in subsequent years. Quality\n      of life is assessed prior to treatment, prior to each course for 6 courses, then every 2\n      courses. Patients are followed every 3 months until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study."
