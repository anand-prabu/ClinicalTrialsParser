  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is primarily designed to assess the safety and the tolerability of Debio
      1347(CH5183284) at increasing doses in patients with advanced solid malignancies, whose
      tumours have an alteration of the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) 1, 2 or 3 genes.

    <time_frame>Approximately 18 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>The dose escalation part of the study will be guided by a well-established statistical method/model to estimate the maximum tolerated dose(s) and/or the recommended dose for expansion (RDE). Safety(incidence and nature of DLTs), pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data will guide dose escalation decisions.</description>

    <time_frame>Every 28 days from baseline visit to 28 days after study drug discontinuation</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>This will be assessed by looking at the number of Adverse Events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs) changes in hematology and chemistry values, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), dose interruptions and reductions</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Signed written informed consent approved before undertaking any study-specific
             procedures.

          2. Patients with advanced solid malignancies, whose tumours have an alteration of the
             FGFR 1, 2 or 3 genes, confirmed by local site genetic tests on a biopsy.

          3. Age ≥ 18 years.

          4. Eastern Cooperative  Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) ≤ 2.

          5. Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumour that has recurred or
             progressed following standard therapy, has not responded to standard therapy or for
             which no standard therapy exists.

          6. Patients have measurable or non-measurable disease.

          7. Adequate organ function in bone marrow, cardiovascular, hepatic and renal systems.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of hypersensitivity to any of the excipients in the Debio 1347 (CH5183284)
             formulation.

          2. History of another malignancy, unless patient has been disease-free for 5 years.

          3. Patients with brain tumours and/or brain metastases unless brain metastases are
             asymptomatic and they are not currently receiving corticosteroids and/or
             anticonvulsants.

          4. History and/or current evidence of endocrine alteration of calcium-phosphate
             homeostasis.

          5. History and or current evidence of ectopic mineralisation/calcification including but
             not limited to the soft tissue, kidneys, intestine, myocardium and lung with the
             exception of calcified lymph nodes and asymptomatic coronary calcification.

          6. Concomitant use of a systemic steroid or any other drug that affect calcium and
             phosphorus metabolism.

          7. Corneal disease, such as bullous or band keratopathy, corneal desquamation,
             keratitis, corneal ulcer, or keratoconjunctivitis.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
