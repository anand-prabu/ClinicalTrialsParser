We choose 39 hospitals\n      whose experienced in CAS or/and CEA spread all over the country as multiple centers for this\n      clinic registration study. All cases inclusion must be continuously registration.\n\n      The subject choice:All registered patients must be signed informed consent to register for\n      non intrusive research this study ,the researchers during the study period should be\n      continuous registration in patients undergoing surgical treatment of carotid stenosis, to\n      ensure that the selected participants reflect the target patient population.\n\n      Medical Center choice: This research for the study of the registration, therefore, when the\n      choice, all the medical center will be based on market research data.\n\n      Primary endpoint or the main aim of this registration study is to observe the following\n      details:\n\n        1. The participants who suffer from stroke(ischemic or hemorrhagic), death or\n           cardiovascular events within 30 days after any revascularization procedure.\n\n        2. The participants who suffer from ipsilateral stroke(ischemic or hemorrhagic) or death\n           beyond 30 days to 12 months after any revascularization procedure.\n\n      Secondary endpoint or the other aims of this registration study:\n\n        1. Success rate of any procedure (CAS or CEA).\n\n        2. postoperative complications, including hyperperfusion syndrome,TIA, ipsilateral\n           infarction, vascular dissection and other adverse events.\n\n        3. To observe the rate of restenosis during follow-up.\n\n        4. Stroke in patients with TIA mainly heart attacks and other cardiovascular events during\n           follow-up.\n\n        5. Changes of the patients with mRS NIHSS Barthel Index score.\n\n        6. Postoperative patients with drug use.\n\n        7. Patient survival after 12 months.\n\n        8. Patients hospitalized cost during follow-up.\n\n      This study does not need to be random. The study is expected to begin in July 2013 in the\n      first, participants in the group stage for two years, to the end of June 2015 into the group\n      of patients after surgery, follow-up of at least 12 months after the last case the\n      participants into groups and followed up for 12 months, is expected to be completed in June\n      2015."
