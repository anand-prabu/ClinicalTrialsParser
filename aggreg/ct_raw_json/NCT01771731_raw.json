            "textblock": "Our primary objective is to assess whether inhaling vaporized cannabis ameliorates chronic\n      pain in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). As these patients will all be on chronic\n      opioid analgesics, the investigators will also assess the possible synergistic affect\n      between inhaled cannabis and opioids. The investigators will also assess the clinical safety\n      of the concomitant use of cannabinoids and these opioids in patients with SCD by monitoring\n      the short-term side effects associated with combined therapy.  Finally, the investigators\n      will evaluate the short-term effects of inhaled cannabis on markers of inflammation and\n      disease progression in patients with SCD.\n\n      Hypotheses are as follows:\n\n        1. Inhaled cannabis will significantly reduce chronic pain in patients with SCD.\n\n        2. Inhaled cannabis will significantly alter the short-term side effects experienced by\n           patients who take opioids for SCD.\n\n        3. Inhaled cannabis will significantly alter markers of inflammation and disease\n           progression in patients with SCD compared to placebo."

The study will be comprised of two 5-day intervention\n      periods in the inpatient setting (the Clinical Research Center at SFGH), with completion of\n      a 5-day daily pain diary prior to admission to establish an outpatient baseline.\n      Participants will be randomly assigned, in double-blind fashion, to treatment with (A)\n      vaporized cannabis with an approximately 1:1 ration of\n      delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol:cannabidiol or (B) vaporized placebo.  Those who receive\n      treatment A during the first admission will receive treatment B in the second, and those who\n      receive treatment B during the first admission will receive treatment A in the second.  The\n      two admissions will be spaced at least 14 days apart.\n\n      On Day 1 of each admission, subjects will provide blood samples for baseline markers of\n      inflammation and SCD disease progression.  They will undergo assessments of pain, mood, and\n      quality of life.  At 12 pm on Day 1, they will inhale vaporized study agent (equivalent to 1\n      cannabis/placebo cigarette) using the Volcano\u00ae vaporizer; on Days 2-4 they will inhale study\n      agent at 8 am, 2 pm, and 8 pm, and they will inhale their final dose on Day 5 at 8 am.\n      Subjects will continue their pre-study analgesic regimen while in the study.  If additional\n      analgesia is required, supplemental therapy will be administered and the dose recorded.\n      Pain measurements by visual analogue scale will be obtained every 2 hours while subjects are\n      awake.  On Day 5 a second set of blood samples for inflammation markers and disease\n      progression will be obtained, and subjects will again complete pain, mood, and quality of\n      life assessments."
