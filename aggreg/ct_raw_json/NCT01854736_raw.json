            "textblock": "There is a first stage of clinical trial (GT-20) in which ALK- Abell\u00f3 is directly working\n      into the MEICA project to explore human immunological mechanisms of SIT (observed after\n      Grazax\u00ae treatment). In this trial, different potential biomarkers of early and sustained\n      effect of specific immunotherapy have been identified. Therefore, for a further research, it\n      was necessary to carry on a new clinical double blind placebo control trial to evaluate a\n      selected panel of biomarkers that can be applied in the selection and monitoring of patients\n      during immunotherapy. They can be of value in the evaluation of future product candidates\n      for specific immunotherapy. For this purpose, it is necessary that the Biomarkers selected,\n      clearly differentiate between active and placebo treated groups. Moreover, specific\n      immunological changes differences between active and placebo patients during pollen seasons\n      are unknown. This first study allowed us identifying a potential set of biomarkers and time\n      points for each of them that might correlate with treatment effect. This second study is\n      needed to evaluate the potential of these biomarkers to discriminate placebo treated\n      patients and it is a necessary step before incorporating them in big prospective efficacy\n      studies.\n\n      A third year in an active IMP design after the two years in a double blind placebo setup is\n      included as a way to validate the differences observed intergroup during the first year of\n      therapy. This is needed as pollen seasons significantly differ in strength and duration.\n      Moreover, there is a unique opportunity of analysing immunological changes of the\n      intervention before a careful baseline monitoring of patients undergoing placebo treatment,\n      with the opportunity of understanding immunological clues in the natural evolution of\n      allergy disease."
