This may be\n      because patients are not eating enough protein or are not eating the right kinds of protein.\n      The protein eaten in foods (such as meat, eggs, or beans) may not be able to make up for the\n      amount of protein lost due to HIV infection. This study gives patients high-quality protein\n      food supplements to help them maintain and/or gain weight."

Dietary sources of protein are\n      presumably inadequate to meet the high metabolic needs caused by HIV infection. To achieve a\n      target protein intake in the range (1.5 to 2.0 g/kg/day) demonstrated in other catabolic\n      diseases necessary to achieve positive nitrogen balance and to generate substantial anabolic\n      effects, this study will administer a supplement containing high-quality protein.\n\n      Two groups of 28 patients each are randomly chosen to receive either an oral nutritional\n      supplement (Optimune) containing increased amounts of high-quality protein (whey), which is\n      rich in cysteine and glutamine, or an isocaloric, identical-tasting supplement without added\n      whey protein or amino acid supplementation. Weight, body composition, anthropometry, dietary\n      intake, and general physical health are assessed at baseline and at Weeks 6 and 12. Plasma\n      cysteine, glutathione, C-reactive protein, and prealbumin, along with urine IL-6, sTNFrII,\n      and IL-1ra, are assessed at baseline and at Week 12."
