Gene therapy such as GEM 231 may inhibit the growth of cancer\n      cells and make the tumor more sensitive to chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining docetaxel and GEM 231 in\n      treating patients who have recurrent or refractory solid tumors."

Determine any preliminary antitumor\n      activity of GEM 231 in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of GEM 231 and docetaxel. Patients receive\n      docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1, immediately followed by GEM 231 IV over 2 hours on days\n      1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment continues every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated with escalating doses of GEM 231\n      and docetaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as\n      the dose at which no more than 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients\n      are followed monthly for 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 1 patient will be accrued per week for this study until the\n      maximum tolerated dose is reached."
