Patients are stratified according to\n      transplanted organ type and transplant center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment\n      arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo sliding-scale reduction of immunosuppressive drugs from 1 of 5\n           regimens at physician's discretion. Patients then receive partially HLA-matched\n           allogeneic cytotoxic T cells IV over 5 minutes once weekly for a total of 4 weeks.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo reduction of immunosuppression as in arm I alone. Patients are\n           followed monthly for 6 months and then every 3 months for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study."
