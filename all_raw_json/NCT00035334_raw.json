            "textblock": "AA amyloidosis is associated with chronic inflammatory conditions (rheumatoid arthritis,\n      ankylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease), chronic infection (tuberculosis,\n      osteomyelitis), and Familial Mediterranean Fever. Rheumatoid arthritis is the major cause of\n      AA amyloidosis in Western Europe and North America.  The most common clinical feature of AA\n      amyloidosis is renal dysfunction manifested as nephrotic-range proteinuria or renal\n      insufficiency at the time of diagnosis.  End-stage renal failure is the cause of death in\n      40-60% of cases. Gastrointestinal involvement is also frequent and is usually manifested as\n      chronic diarrhea, body weight loss and malabsorption.  Enlargement of the liver and spleen\n      may also occur in some patients. The median survival time from diagnosis varies from 2 to 8\n      years depending on the stage of the disease at time of diagnosis. The goal of the current\n      therapy in AA amyloidosis is the control of the associated disease. However, the current\n      approaches for the treatment of AA amyloidosis are unspecific, toxic, invasive, and not\n      sufficiently effective in many cases.  NC-503 was specifically designed to compete with the\n      naturally occurring sulfated GAGs for the binding to amyloidogenic precursor proteins, and\n      to inhibit amyloid deposition into tissues. The proposed therapy with NC-503 is based on the\n      prevention of the amyloid fibril formation. The objective of this clinical phase II/III\n      study is to determine the efficacy and safety of NC-503 compared to a placebo in patients\n      suffering from secondary (AA) amyloidosis by the assessment of clinical improvement/\n      worsening of both renal and gastrointestinal functions."
