  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The registry has been designed as a prospective, observational program for patients
      undergoing lumbar or cervical fusion using VariLift device with the ultimate goal to aid in
      the development of strategic treatment pathways and improved patient care. All patients who
      agree to participate in the registry will sign an informed consent form and subsequently be
      treated by their surgeon with the VariLift device. Potential treatment procedures include
      bilateral posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF), unilateral transforaminal lumbar
      interbody fusion (TLIF), or bilateral anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) for the lumbar
      spine, or cervical unilateral or bilateral ACDF procedure. Surgical procedures can be
      performed in either an inpatient or outpatient facility.  It is anticipated that the
      VariLift devices will improve patient outcomes and lead to the development of treatment
      pathways to improve patient care.

        Patients undergoing spinal fusion using VariLift lumbar or cervical devices must be
        screened by the investigating surgeon for eligibility into the registry using the primary
        diagnosis parameters and the inclusion/exclusion criteria. In addition physicians must
        follow the associated VariLift Instructions for Use.
