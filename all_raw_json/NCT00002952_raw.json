Interleukin-12 may kill tumor cells by stopping blood flow to\n      the tumor and by stimulating a person's white blood cell to kill melanoma cells. Combining\n      vaccine therapy with interleukin-12 may kill more melanoma cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy plus interleukin-12\n      in treating patients who have metastatic melanoma."

Determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose level of the vaccine\n      consisting of MAGE-3 or Melan-A (human tumor antigen genes) peptide-pulsed autologous\n      peripheral blood mononuclear cells plus interleukin-12. II. Determine if the procedure\n      results in successful immunization. III. Assess the response of the tumor to the vaccine.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label, nonrandomized, single institution study. Patients receive 3\n      initial courses of treatment consisting of 21 days each. Treatment consists of an\n      immunization with MAGE-3 or Melan-A peptide-loaded autologous PBMC and interleukin-12\n      (IL-12) on the first day, IL-12 on days 3 and 5, and 16 days of rest. The first cohort is\n      not administered IL-12 and the next cohorts are given escalating doses of IL-12. The Phase\n      II dose will be one dose level below the MTD. Patients who have a tumor remission response\n      or stable disease may continue treatment for up to one year. Phase I completed as of\n      04/1999. Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 34 patients will be accrued for this study."
