It serves to improve clinical\n      efficacy and prolong anaesthesia as an alternative to long-lasting and potentially more\n      dangerous LA, especially in patients with increased cardiovascular risk. There is scarce\n      clinical data about the safety of the use of hyaluronidase in dental procedures.\n\n      This study aimed to compare hemodynamic and electrocardiographic variables during a dental\n      surgical procedure using a local anaesthetic associated with hyaluronidase or placebo in\n      healthy subjects."

Cardiovascular parameters,\n      including systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate\n      (HR), were monitored using oscillometric and photoplethysmographic methods in 10 clinical\n      stages. Electrocardiographic records (ECG) of 12 leads were obtained in four steps.\n      Hyaluronidase injected concomitantly with LA did not induce changes in SBP, DBP and HR\n      compared to placebo. There were no instances of ST segment depression, ST segment elevation,\n      wide QRS complex extrasystoles, or narrow QRS complex extrasystoles.\n\n      To date, few studies in dentistry have investigated the effects of local anaesthetic\n      efficacy in hyaluronidase, and even fewer have studied the relation to systemic effects\n      induced by this interaction.\n\n      The use of LA injected concomitantly with 75 TRU/mL of hyaluronidase is safe when using this\n      dose and route of administration.\n\n      Clinical Relevance: In dentistry, few studies have investigated the effects of hyaluronidase\n      on local anaesthetic efficacy, and even fewer have examined the possible systemic effects\n      induced by this interaction."
