            "textblock": "Much of the long-term success of classic bladder exstrophy closures depends on the initial\n      closure.  Several studies have demonstrated that a key to successful initial closure\n      involves deep dissection of the pelvic floor so that the bladder can be placed in the most\n      posterior and inferior position possible.  Oftentimes, the need for repeat closure of the\n      abdomen is required if the initial surgeon failed to properly dissect deep enough into the\n      child's pelvic floor.  Many surgeons are unfamiliar with the complex anatomy and are unable\n      to verify that they have properly reached the true pelvic floor during this initial surgery.\n       This often leads to failed closures, which result in poor continence rates later in life.\n\n      The investigators are attempting to determine the safety and efficacy of the use the\n      Brainlab, Inc. VisionVector\u00ae Cranial Image Guided Surgery System during closure of bladder\n      exstrophy. The value of this research is two-fold.  Firstly, the project will help us to\n      verify if the investigators are indeed dissecting down to the proper plane required for\n      successful initial closure of bladder exstrophy. Secondly, this project will help others\n      with relatively less experience with bladder exstrophy to properly identify where they are\n      anatomically during closure of exstrophy, thus yielding higher success rates and better\n      patient care at other centers."
