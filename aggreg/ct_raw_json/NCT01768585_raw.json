            "textblock": "Experimental and clinical data suggest that sustained elevation of heart rate contributes to\n      the pathogenesis of vascular disease (1, 2). In animal studies accelerated heart rate is\n      associated with signalling events leading to vascular oxidative stress, endothelial\n      dysfunction and acceleration of atherogenesis (3). The underlying mechanisms are only\n      partially understood and appear to correlate with mechanic properties such as reduction of\n      vascular compliance. Heart rate reduction by I(f)-channel inhibition with ivabradine\n      (Procoralan\u00ae, Servier, France) attenuates oxidative stress, improves endothelial function\n      and reduces the formation of atherosclerotic plaques in mice models of lipid-induced\n      atherosclerosis (1, 4).\n\n      Aortic stiffness is a consequence of arterial aging and vascular risk factors and\n      determinates cardiovascular mortality (5). Heart rate depending repetitive pulsations appear\n      to induce fatigue and fracture of elastin lamellae of central arteries. As a result the\n      vessel stiffens and pulse wave reflections return earlier to the heart. In consequence\n      aortic pressure rises and pulsations of flow extend further into smaller vessels of organs\n      (notably the brain and kidney). Stiffening leads to increased left ventricular (LV) load\n      with hypertrophy, decreased capacity for myocardial perfusion, and increased hemodynamic\n      stresses on small arterial vessels.\n\n      Several experimental investigations revealed an interaction between heart rate and vascular\n      compliance demonstrating a positive association between increased heart rate and arterial\n      stiffness (6). Recent experimental data suggest that heart rate reduction by ivabradine\n      (Procoralan\u00ae, Servier, France) significantly improves aortic distensibility in cholesterol\n      fed ApoE -/- mice measured by MRI technique (7). While a benefit of pharmacological heart\n      rate reduction on vascular outcomes was observed in animal studies, prospective clinical\n      data are limited and evidence determining whether chronic modulation of heart rate can\n      improve vascular function and compliance in patients with chronic stable coronary artery\n      disease is needed."
