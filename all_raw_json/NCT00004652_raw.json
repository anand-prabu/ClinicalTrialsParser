Determine whether tic severity, medication side effects, academic performance and\n      psychosocial functioning are better in the short term pimozide therapy or longer term\n      pimozide therapy."

In the short\n      term pimozide group, patients receive pimozide over 2 weeks. Then, pimozide is gradually\n      replaced by an inactive placebo within the following 10 weeks.\n\n      Patients in the long term pimozide group receive pimozide. Patients continue treatment for\n      12 months or until a worsening of tics or behavioral symptoms are present for which an\n      increased dosage is required.\n\n      Patients who do not experience an exacerbation of tics requiring an increase in dosage are\n      followed for 1 year from the date of entry."
