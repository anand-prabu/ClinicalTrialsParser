PARP inhibitors are drugs tht prevent cancer cells from\n      repairing their DNA. In this research study, we are looking to see how well the drug\n      olaparib works in women who have never received a PARP inhibitor for recurrent ovarian\n      cancer as well as those who have received a prior PARP inhibitor and whose cancer has\n      re-grown after receiving that PARP inhibitor."
