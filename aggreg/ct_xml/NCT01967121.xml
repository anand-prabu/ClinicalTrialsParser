  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if the application of ice, control group,
      or a muscle stimulation program from the Compex® series can help reduce or eliminate delayed
      muscle soreness from performing leg extension and flexion. Individuals will complete a
      health history questionnaire to determine if they qualify for this study.  We will measure
      your leg girth with a measuring tape and take a pain measurement of your hamstrings by using
      a spring to press down on your leg. Individuals will then warm-up on a bike without
      resistance for 5 minutes followed by 10 regular leg extension and flexion exercises.
      Individuals will then perform 6 sets of 10 leg extension and flexion exercises on a biodex
      machine (similar to leg curl machines in the gym). Individuals will perform each set to the
      maximum effort of their capables. After each set of 10 individuals will have a 2 minute
      rest. We will ask you to rank your leg soreness on a scale from 1-10.

      Individuals will then be assigned to a modality of either ice, control group or compex.
      Individuals will perform the modality (ice, control, compex) we assign you to until you are
      no longer sore.

      Over the next five days individuals will return to measure their level of soreness, leg
      girth and pain pressure.

      This study will examine the following hypotheses:

      H1:  There will be no difference in pressure pain threshold after using the Compex compared
      to other groups.

      H2: There will be no difference in perceived soreness after using the Compex compared to
      other groups.

      H3: There will be no difference in muscular strength after using the Compex compared to
      other groups.

      H4: There will be no difference in active range of motion after using the Compex compared to
      other groups.

    <description>Visual Analog Scale for Muscle Soreness scale The scale for measuring the intensity of muscle soreness will be a 10 cm visual analog scale, spaced by one centimeter increments from one to 10. Ten will represent the maximum amount of soreness and zero represents no soreness at all. Subjects will be asked to complete this scale once per day at the same time of day until the soreness has dissipated.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The studied population will be composed of 45 physically active college students
             between the ages of 18-30 years old.

          -  Inclusionary criteria will be participation in a physical activity as defined by the
             ACSM, which can be a mixture of moderate (i.e., sufficient to raise the heart rate
             and begin to sweat) and vigorous (i.e., breathing hard and fast with a rapidly rising
             heart rate) intensity aerobic activity and muscle strengthening (i.e., weights lifted
             to the point where anther repetition cannot be completed without help) activities two
             or more time per week (ACSM, 2011.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusionary criteria will be surgery within the last six months requiring
             immobilization for more than four weeks, discomfort performing intense physical
             activity, diseases like muscular dystrophy that predispose muscular damage beyond
             reasonable levels resulting from physical activity, and current injury of the knees
             or hips.
