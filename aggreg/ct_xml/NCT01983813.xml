  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial will examine whether a centralized Prevention Health &amp; Cardiovascular Risk Service
      (PHCVRS) run by clinical pharmacists at the University of Iowa can be implemented in primary
      care offices and whether it can improve the care delivered to patients at risk for
      developing cardiovascular disease.  The study will be conducted in 12 medical practices in
      Iowa that are either a Federally Qualified Health Center or part of the IRENE practice-based
      research network.
