  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess whether Chinese ocular exercise is effective in altering distant and near visual
      acuity, ocular accommodation and visual symptoms in myopic teenager, and thus might have the
      possibility of slowing myopia progression in teenager through a weak but long-term effect.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myopia is a public health problem worldwide, especially in some Asian countries like China,
      Singapore, and Japan. Chinese ocular exercise, originating in 1963 with the theory of
      Traditional Chinese Medicine, is a kind of massage on acupuncture points around the eye to
      prevent myopia and alleviate visual fatigue. The exercise has been spreaded as a community
      ritual and living habit of primary and high school students for nearly half a century.
      However, the prevalence of myopia in Chinese children increased remarkably in recent years.
      Therefore, the efficacy of Chinese ocular exercise on preventing myopia or alleviating
      visual fatigue is widely questioned. Evidence from clinical trials of high level is needed
      to clarify that whether Chinese ocular exercise is effective in slowing and preventing
      myopia progression, or at least in part in easing the symptoms related to myopia and visual
      fatigue.
