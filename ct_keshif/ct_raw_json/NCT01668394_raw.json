            "textblock": "Coronary heart disease is one the most common cause of death in Denmark and is also a\n      chronic disease that 300,000 people in the country are living with. Cardiac rehabilitation\n      is of great significance for this group of people because of its potential to reduce\n      mortality and morbidity. However a lot of people are not succeeding in changing their\n      lifestyle in a positive direction, and it is a great challenge to develop new methods which\n      can help the patients to maintain a more healthy lifestyle in the long run. A concept for\n      patient education, called learning and coping, has been developed in Norway. It is a health\n      education method based on a high degree of involvement from the participants and on what is\n      important for them. Planning, performance and evaluation happens in close cooperation\n      between the health staff and so-called experienced patients. The course begins and ends with\n      individual clarifying conversations.\n\n      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of the concept of learning and coping\n      strategies in cardiac rehabilitation on quality of life, risc- and lifestyle factors,\n      morbidity and mortality.\n\n      The number of participants are estimated to 750 ptt.s with datacollection at baseline, just\n      after rehabilitation and 3 months after rehabilitation. It is carried out as an open\n      randomized controlled parallel group study in three hospitals in Hospitalsenheden Vest,\n      Central Denmark Region, where the participants is randomized to either the intervention\n      group with learning and coping strategies or to the standard group without the strategies.\n      The rehabilitation courses in both groups lasts for eight weeks and consists of both\n      training and educations sessions. The concept of learning and coping is applied to the\n      intervention group by letting 'experienced patients' participate in the education and not\n      using standardized teaching slides. Also clarifying individual conversations are completed\n      before and after the course. The 1:1 randomization is computer generated and is stratified\n      by hospital, diagnosis and gender. All analyses will be performed after the principle of\n      'intention to treat'."
