             uninfected skin that has not been treated with study drug; each untreated venous
             access area should provide a margin of at least 5 cm radius around the venipuncture
             site

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant confounding conditions as assessed by study doctor

          -  Unstable or actively infected AD

          -  Active or potentially recurrent dermatologic condition other than atopic dermatitis
             that may confound evaluation

          -  History or evidence of allergies requiring acute or chronic treatment (except
             seasonal allergic rhinitis)

          -  Concurrent or recent use of certain topical or systemic medications or phototherapy
             without a sufficient washout period

          -  Treatment for any type of cancer (except squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell
             carcinoma, or carcinoma in situ of the skin, curatively treated with cryosurgery or
             surgical excision only) within the last 5 years

          -  Current pregnancy or lactation, or intent to become pregnant during the study

          -  Known sensitivity to any of the components of the study drug

          -  Participated in any other trial of an investigational drug or device within 30 days
             or participation in a research study concurrent with this study

          -  Participated in a previous AN2728 clinical study
