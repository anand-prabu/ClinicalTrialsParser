These cells are called Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes,\n      or TIL and we have given this type of treatment to over 100 patients. In this study, we are\n      selecting a specific subset of white blood cells from the tumor that we think are the most\n      effective in fighting tumors and will use only these cells in making the tumor fighting\n      cells.\n\n      Objective:\n\n      The purpose of this study is to see if these specifically selected tumor fighting cells can\n      cause melanoma tumors to shrink and to see if this treatment is safe.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Adults age 18 and over with metastatic melanoma who have a tumor that can be safely\n      removed.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and\n           undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests\n           as needed\n\n        -  Surgery: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo\n           surgery to remove a tumor that can be used to grow the TIL product.\n\n        -  Treatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital\n           for the conditioning chemotherapy, the TIL cells and aldesleukin.  They will stay in\n           the hospital for about 1-2 weeks to recover from the treatment.\n\n        -  Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab\n           tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to\n           1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking."

            "textblock": "Background:\n\n        -  Autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) followed by high dose aldesleukin can\n           mediate the regression of bulky metastatic melanoma when administered to a patient\n           following a non-myeloablative but lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen.\n\n        -  In animal models, mixing irrelevant (non-reactive) cells with tumor-reactive cells\n           negatively impacts on tumor treatment possibly by competing for cytokines, suggesting\n           that enrichment for tumor-reactive cells could enhance clinical efficacy. Additionally,\n           preclinical animal models and clinical investigation have demonstrated that prolonged\n           in vitro culture negatively impacts on tumor treatment.\n\n        -  The current method for enrichment of tumor-reactive TIL requires screening of multiple\n           independent TIL cultures for anti-tumor specificity using gamma-interferon production\n           by TIL. However, in vitro screening depends on autologous tumor reagents that are often\n           unavailable, and IFN gamma release in vitro may not be the best effector function to\n           evaluate tumor recognition. The screen increases the length of in vitro culture times (\n             30 days), which results in shorter telomere lengths and more differentiated cells.\n           Additionally, selection of a few highly reactive cultures for further expansion may\n           reduce the diversity of CD8+ repertoire recognizing the tumor.\n\n        -  4-1BB is a co-stimulatory molecule up-regulated on the cell surface of T cells upon TCR\n           engagement. Pre-clinical studies in the Surgery Branch have evaluated a fast and\n           simplified method to select and expand a diverse tumor-reactive repertoire, regardless\n           of knowledge of the specific antigen recognized, based on selection of 4-1BB expressing\n           TIL from the fresh tumor digest.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n        -  To determine the safety and objective response rate of patients with metastatic\n           melanoma receiving ACT using 4-1BB selected TIL plus aldesleukin treatment following a\n           chemotherapy preparative regimen.\n\n        -  To determine the survival of patients receiving this treatment regimen.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      Patients who are 18 years or older must have:\n\n        -  Evaluable metastatic melanoma;\n\n        -  Metastatic melanoma lesion suitable for surgical resection for the preparation of TIL;\n\n        -  No contraindications to high-dose aldesleukin administration;\n\n        -  No concurrent major medical illnesses or any form of immunodeficiency\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Patients with metastatic melanoma will have a lesion resected and 4-1BB expressing\n           tumor infiltrating lymphocytes will be isolated using a FACS sorter approved for\n           clinical use. The 4-1BB selected cells will be rapidly expanded in vitro and\n           administered plus aldesleukin following a non-myeloablative chemotherapy preparative\n           regimen.\n\n        -  The study will be conducted using a stage 2 optimal design to determine if this\n           treatment is able to be associated with a clinical response rate that can rule out 10%\n           (p0=0.10) in favor of a modest 30% PR + CR rate (p1=0.30).\n\n        -  Up to 35 patients may be enrolled over 2 years."
