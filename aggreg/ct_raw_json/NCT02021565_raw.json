Experts (OTs) who provide this training will also\n      recommend, provide, and install assistive technology devices such as grab bars, bed rails,\n      and toileting aids as needed.  Research assistants conduct home visits with the dyads pre\n      and post intervention to determine the effects of the program on Veteran and caregiver\n      quality of life measures (burden, depression, task efficacy, lifespace).\n\n      Half of the couples in this study will receive the training from the expert remotely through\n      a tele-video conferencing device.  Research assistants will bring the device to\n      participants' homes and assist in the training session."

            "textblock": "Introduction and Objective: The primary objective of the proposed four-year randomized,\n      controlled trial is to document that providing a hands-on skills training and assistive\n      technology (AT)/environmental modification program for older Veterans who are dependent in\n      activities of daily living (ADLs) and their informal caregivers will result in improvements\n      in caregiving processes (i.e., caregiving skills) and outcomes (i.e., safety during tasks)\n      compared to the current standard of care and have beneficial direct and indirect effects for\n      both members of the dyad. Secondary objectives are to determine the effects of the program\n      on Veteran and caregiver subjective well-being (depression, quality of life) and to compare\n      the relative effectiveness of two validated implementation modalities the traditional\n      in-person approach and real-time interactive tele-video conferencing.\n\n      Research Plan. The study will be conducted with older Veterans (>60yrs) with mobility\n      impairments who live in the community and are dependent on an informal caregiver for ADL\n      assistance involving mobility, transfer or positional change.  The study will utilize a\n      modified randomized controlled cross-over design with four study arms and three or four\n      outcome assessment periods. Prior to the first home visit, participants will be randomized\n      to an intervention modality (in-person vs. tele-video) then randomized within those groups\n      to an immediate intervention (IIG) or delayed intervention/control group (DICG).\n\n      Methods. In-home interviews will be completed with 180 Veteran caregiving dyads to obtain\n      baseline, self-reported measures of caregiving needs, processes and outcomes using\n      standardized, validated instruments. In-home visits by an Assistive Technology Specialist\n      (ATS) will mirror the interview visits (within 1 week) to independently and objectively\n      assess needs through observation of functional tasks. Dyads will be re-evaluated one (T2),\n      two (T3), and four to five (T4) months later to ascertain change. Following T1 assessments,\n      those in the IIG will receive 2 additional home visits from the ATS to (1) deliver the\n      intervention and (2) reinforce the intervention. A 2nd blinded ATS will conduct the T2\n      outcome assessments. At T2 an ATS will conduct observation-based assessments which will also\n      serve as a repeat baseline for the DICG. The intervention schedule will then be repeated for\n      dyads in the DICG during T3.  The final assessments for both groups will be collected 3\n      months after the intervention during T4.\n\n      Intervention. The Caregiver Assessment of Skill Sets & Individualized Support Thru Training\n      or CG ASSIST program has recently undergone feasibility testing in a VA RR&D pilot study.\n\n      The intervention consists of (a) provision of assistive technology (AT) and simple home\n      modifications to facilitate ADLs and (b) dyad training on the appropriate use of the devices\n      and proper task execution using standardized protocols individualized to the needs and\n      preferences of the dyad and environmental features of the home.\n\n      Clinical Relevance. Supporting and assisting caregivers in providing care for Veterans to\n      help them age in place  has important implications for the VHA system and the safety,\n      dignity and quality of life of the Veterans we serve."
