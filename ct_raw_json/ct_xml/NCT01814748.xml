    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and efficacy of once-weekly MK-3102 in

      participants 18 to &lt;45 years of age with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and inadequate glycemic
      control. The study hypothesis is that treatment with MK-3102 compared with placebo provides
      greater reduction in hemoglobin A1c (A1C) in participants after 24 weeks.
