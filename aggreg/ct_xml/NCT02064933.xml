  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a rare serious medical condition that causes problems
      both with the immune system and with easy bruising and bleeding. The immune abnormalities
      cause patients with WAS to be very susceptible to infections. Depending on the specific type
      of primary immune deficiency diseases, there are effective treatments, including
      antibiotics, cellular therapy and gene therapy, but studies of large numbers of patients are
      needed to determine the full range of causes, natural history, or the best methods of
      treatment for long term success.

      This multicenter study combines retrospective, prospective and cross-sectional analyses of
      the transplant experiences for patients with WAS who have already received HCT since 1990,
      or who will undergo Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) during the study period. The
      retrospective and prospective portions of the study will address the impact of a number of
      pre and post-transplant factors on post-transplant disease correction and ultimate benefit
      from HCT and the cross-sectional portion of the study will assess the benefit of HCT 2 years
      post-HCT in consenting surviving patients.
