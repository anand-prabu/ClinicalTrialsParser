Patients concurrently undergo cranial radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for\n           6 weeks.\n\n        -  Group II: Patients receive PCI-0120 IV over 30-60 minutes once daily concurrently\n           during radiotherapy. Patients undergo cranial radiotherapy as in group I.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients in each group receive escalating doses of PCI-0120 until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 2 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
