Prior to the first session, each participant was given a pedometer with their name on it.  They were asked to take 100 steps and the sensitivity and positioning of the pedometer was adjusted to assure accurate measurement.  At the termination of each session, the pedometers were collected and the number of steps taken by each participant at that session recorded.  A record of the number of steps taken for every participant at each session over the 40 week period was maintained."

Aims included determining the\n      feasibility of recruiting and retaining a random sample of people age 60+ for such a trial\n      as well as collection of preliminary data on the efficacy of the interventions.  The\n      long-term goal of this research program is to determine whether sustained physical and/or\n      mental exercise interventions are efficacious in delaying the onset of dementia and to\n      understand the role and mechanisms of brain growth in this process."
