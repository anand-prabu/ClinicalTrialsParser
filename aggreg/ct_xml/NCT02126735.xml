  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CD36, a protein that facilitates tissue uptake of fat, as a common link between blood fat
      concentrations and metabolic disease states such as diabetes mellitus.  Genetic variants in
      the CD36 gene are more common in African Americans compared to Whites and it may  confer
      protection against metabolic diseases by altering the amount of fat  in the blood.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the levels of fat in the blood and to assess
      endothelial dysfunction among carriers versus non-carriers of the coding SNP, rs3211938 of
      the CD36 gene after a high fat meal challenge

    <description>We expect that subjects heterozygous for the minor allele of CD36 rs3211938 (G/T) would have an increase of 250 units in the area under the curve for triglycerides which is ~50% of the observed difference between patients with CD36 deficiency and normal controls. Assuming that the common standard deviation is 199, using a two group t-test with a type I error of 0.05, a total of 28 subjects (14 carriers and 14 non-carriers) would provide 90% power to detect a difference in our primary endpoint between carriers versus non-carriers of genotype</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline in flow mediated dilation at 4 hours after high fal meal</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>our primary outcome will be the percent change in flow mediated dilation at baseline and 4 hours after a high fat meal (peak effect). Assuming a conservative estimate of standard deviation of 3.19 our proposed study with a total of 28 subjects (14 carriers and 14 non-carriers) would have at least 80% power with type I error of 0.05 to detect a minimum difference in the mean response of 3.5 %.</description>
