Urine\n      culture will be as well collected if urinary symptoms appeared.\n\n      Primary end points: To determine in both groups: the incidence of pyelonephritis.\n\n      Secondary end points:  To determine outcomes in both groups (renal function,\n      hospitalization, rejection, graft loss, opportunistic infections and mortality) and\n      infection by multiresistant microorganisms."
