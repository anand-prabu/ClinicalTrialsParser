            "textblock": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT)is the only therapeutic option\n      for many hematological malignancies. Unfortunately, about 75% of patients who require\n      allo-HSCT lack human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donors. The alternative is\n      hematopoietic stem cells from an HLA-mismatched family donor. However, this strategy, which\n      is called haploidentical HSCT, may be associated with high risk of early death and severe\n      GVHD.\n\n      Opportunistic infections are common complications after allo-HSCT. Due to the absence of\n      effective preventive and therapeutic drugs for most viruses, viral infections has become one\n      of the most important causes of death. The immunosuppression regimen including ATG has been\n      shown effective to prevent severe GVHD in haploidentical HSCT. But this strategy delays\n      immune reconstitution, and therefore increase the risk of viral infection.\n\n      The optimal dose of the different ATG preparations with respect to prevention of GvHD is not\n      fully understood today.  The total doses between 6 mg/kg to 15 mg/kg are effective for\n      prevention of GVHD, but the dose above 10 mg/kg may increase the development of viral\n      infection.\n\n      In this trial, we will focus on viral infections in patients treated with 7.5mg/kg or\n      10mg/kg of ATG. The incidence of post-transplant viral infections and GVHD will be compared\n      between different dose arms."
