AA is the second most\n      common cause of alopecia in childhood; no FDA-approved treatments exist. The use of focused\n      narrow-band ultraviolet-B light via the excimer laser is a common treatment for many skin\n      diseases in patients of all ages. In this study, the feasibility of the 308-nm excimer laser\n      for treatment of patch type AA of the scalp will be examined. We anticipate the excimer\n      laser will be safe and a feasible option for patients with patch type AA. The excimer laser\n      may represent a novel treatment for childhood AA and no comparison or large studies\n      currently exist in the literature.\n\n      Hypotheses The 308-nm excimer laser procedure is a feasible, well-tolerated and safe\n      treatment for patch type alopecia areata of the scalp in children."
