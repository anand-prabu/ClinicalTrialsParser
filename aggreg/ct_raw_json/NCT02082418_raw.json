            "textblock": "Aging modifies the metabolic pathway of the neurotransmitter serotonin by reducing the\n      synthesis rate and increasing the breakdown rate of serotonin, possibly related to the\n      observed enhanced sensitivity of the serotonergic pathway. Since serotonin plays a prominent\n      role in neuropsychological functions such as anxiety, mood and memory, the enhanced\n      sensitivity of the serotonergic pathway in aging can probably explain the fact that elderly\n      are more vulnerable to develop cognitive deficits and depressive symptoms.\n\n      Serotonin synthesis in brain is regulated by its precursor tryptophan (TRP). Because\n      tryptophan is an essential amino acid, modifying the availability of tryptophan through\n      dietary intake, can directly influence central serotonin metabolism and consequently\n      affective and cognitive processes.\n\n      The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that an acute intake of whey protein with\n      high levels of TRP such as alpha-lactalbumin can stabilize the metabolism of serotonin and\n      subsequently enhance metabolic and cognitive functions in healthy older adults. The acute\n      effects of this dietary protein will be investigated in subjects with mild cognitive\n      impairment (MCI) and compared to control subjects in order to examine whether healthy older\n      subject with MCI benefit more from the intake of alpha-lactalbumin. The investigators will\n      investigate if this meal can optimize serotonin metabolism by elevating plasma TRP levels\n      and plasma TRP appearance and enhance splanchnic TRP extraction. In addition, the effects on\n      mood and cognitive functions will be examined."
