  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if ibuprofen use after electrocautery
      tonsillectomy increases the post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage rate.

      Hypothesis: Use of ibuprofen does not increase the post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage rate.

      Primary outcome:  Rate of tonsillar hemorrhage following adult tonsillectomy in those
      receiving narcotic pain medications plus ibuprofen compared to those receiving narcotics
      alone.

      Secondary outcome: Determine whether ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug
      (NSAID), decreases post tonsillectomy pain, narcotic pain medication use, or cost of pain
      management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tonsillectomy is common procedure associated with significant post-operative pain typically
      managed by narcotic pain medication. Narcotics, however, can have inherent unwanted side
      effects such as respiratory depression. In fact, a recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) warning has reported deaths from respiratory distress that were associated with use of
      codeine in children after tonsillectomy. Finding alternative pain management regimens
      therefore is essential in post-tonsillectomy care. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID)
      medications may provide an effective alternative to narcotics, but use of NSAIDs routinely
      after tonsillectomy has been limited due to concern for theoretical increased risk of
      post-operative bleeding, This is likely true for NSAIDs such as aspirin. NSAIDs such as
      ibuprofen, however, are believed to have no greater risk of bleeding than baseline, but this
      has not been proven.  Recent, well-designed, prospective pediatric studies have demonstrated
      effective analgesia improvement with the addition of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      such as ibuprofen to post-operative pain management regimens, and no increased rate of
      post-surgery bleeding. This has not adequately been studied in adults but could provide many
      patients significant pain relief in the post-operative period if it is shown to not increase
      post tonsillectomy hemorrhage rates, as already demonstrated in the pediatric population.
