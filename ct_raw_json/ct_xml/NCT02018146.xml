  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Failed mask ventilation poses an increased risk of de-oxygenation to the patient undergoing
      general anesthesia. Nasopharyngeal ventilation may be a valid alternative for mask
      ventilation allowing for better oxygenation during the induction phase of general
      anesthesia. Oxygenation may be maintained better in case of difficult mask ventilation. This
      study evaluates this alternative method in comparison with the standard method of mask
      ventilation.

      General Design This is a randomized, controlled, cross over study. Patients will be
      randomized to mask ventilation followed by nasopharyngeal airway placement and ventilation
      or vice versa.

      Primary Study Endpoints We will test the hypothesis that ventilation via a nasally placed
      ETT is superior in its efficacy (as measured by tidal volume) to routine facemask
      ventilation in patients undergoing oto-laryngologic or oral maxillofacial surgery that
      requires nasal intubation.

      General Design This is a randomized, controlled, cross over study. Patients will be
      randomized to mask ventilation followed by nasopharyngeal airway placement and ventilation
      or vice versa.

      Primary Study Endpoints We will test the hypothesis that ventilation via a nasally placed
      ETT is superior in its efficacy (as measured by tidal volume) to routine facemask
      ventilation in patients undergoing oto-laryngologic or oral maxillofacial surgery that
      requires nasal intubation.

      Subject Selection and Withdrawal General Characteristics of the Proposed Subject Population

      Subjects will be enrolled at the University Pre-Op clinic or the University Pre-Op holding
      area. There is no data indicating that ethnicity affects airway management. We accordingly
      will accept patients from all minority groups. Based on the population of greater
      Louisville, we expect that 85% of the subjects will be Caucasian. We will include male and
      female patients in the study.

      Anticipated Number of Research Subjects We are planning to enroll 20 patients scheduled for
      elective oto-laryngeal and oral maxillofacial surgery under general anesthesia with nasal
      endotracheal intubation.  Patients will qualify for enrollment in the study if they meet the
      inclusion criteria as defined.

      Inclusion Criteria I. Subjects undergoing  any elective oto-laryngeal or maxillo-facial
      surgery requiring nasal intubation II. Adult patients 18 years of age or older III. Subjects
      are capable of understanding and signing the Informed Consent Form or have an acceptable
      representative capable of giving legally authorized consent on the subject's behalf.

      Exclusion Criteria I. Subjects will be excluded from this study in cases where there will
      not be an attempt at mask ventilation.  This includes patients that will require an awake
      fiberoptic intubation as well as those needing a rapid sequence intubation.

      II. Subjects with full stomachs, known hiatal hernia, and severe gastroesophageal reflux
      will be excluded.

      III. Subjects with known or suspected basilar skull fractures will be excluded.

      Subject Recruitment and Screening Subjects will be recruited by review of cases listed on
      the draft daily operating room schedule and schedule for pre-operative clinic at the
      University of Louisville hospital.

      The study is confined to a short period at induction of anesthesia.

      Visit 1 Screening Visit - at the screening visit subjects will undergo an airway exam.

      Visit 2 Visit - Based on the screening results subject will be enrolled in to the study and
      randomized to one of the study groups. Immediately after randomization subject's nares will
      be prepped with two sprays of nasal decongestant bilaterally. NeoSynephrine nasal 0.5% spray
      will be used.  Subject will be transferred to the OR.

      Safety Assessments Routine anesthesia parameters (tidal volume, train of four, heart rate,
      oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide, chest rise and BIS monitor) will be used to
      evaluate the safety of the proposed ventilation methods.

      Effectiveness Assessments Tidal volume, train of four, heart rate, oxygen saturation,
      end-tidal carbon dioxide and chest rise will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the
      study treatment

      Sample Size Determination Preliminary data have shown that nasopharyngeal ventilation may
      improve applied tidal volumes compared to mask ventilation. Sample size analysis: a
      within-group difference of 50 ml tidal volume will be considered to be clinically
      significant in our study, because such difference will be equivalent to a 10% increase in
      tidal volume during naso-pharyngeal ventilation. Accordingly, per our a priori assessment,
      in order to detect an increase of 10% of tidal volume 16 patients will be required with 90%
      power at a significance level of 0.05. We propose to enroll 20 patients for this cross-over
      trial.

      Statistical Methods Tidal volumes and airway pressures will be compared with paired T-tests.
      Data will be expressed as mean Â± SD. Descriptive parameters and categorical variables will
      be compared using Chi-square tests.
