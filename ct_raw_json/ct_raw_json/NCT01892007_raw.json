            "textblock": "One in ten people aged between 55-74 years have a significant hearing impairment in their\n      better hearing ear (as defined by audiometric hearing thresholds). Yet, it is becoming\n      increasingly clear that the challenges faced by older listeners cannot be explained by the\n      audiogram. The ability for people with hearing loss to use cognition to support context\n      allows for compensation of degraded auditory input, which in turn offers promise for new\n      cognitive-based rehabilitative interventions. Working memory is known to be highly\n      associated with language and recent evidence has shown significant generalisation of on-task\n      learning from Cogmed working memory training to improvements in sentence-repetition skills\n      of children with severe to profound hearing loss and use cochlear implants. This evidence\n      offers support for further investigation into the potential benefits of working memory\n      training to improve speech perception abilities in other hearing impaired populations. This\n      study aims to assess whether Cogmed (adaptive) working memory training improves the\n      listening abilities of adults with mild to moderate hearing loss as assessed using untrained\n      measurers of cognition, speech perception and self-reported hearing ability, compared with\n      an active control (Cogmed, non-adaptive) group. A 6 month follow-up will assess retention of\n      any training-related improvements in outcomes for the adaptive training group."
