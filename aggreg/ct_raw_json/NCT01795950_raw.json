PLX-PAD is a cell-based product made of allogeneic\n      Mesenchymal-like Adherent Stromal Cells (ASCs), derived from human full-term placentas\n      following an elective caesarean section.  This year-long study will evaluate the safety of\n      three different dose levels of PLX-PAD, each given as a single intravenous infusion.  This\n      study will also evaluate effects that PLX-PAD may have on PAH, such as changes in the\n      ability to exercise and on other tests used to measure the disease severity."
