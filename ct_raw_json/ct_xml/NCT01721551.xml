  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current study is to investigate whether changes in patients' sleep
      quality and quantity will be followed by improvements in parameters related to physical and
      mental fatigue in  patients receiving hemodialysis therapy.

      More specific, the current project will investigate the effect of a 6 months intradialytic
      exercise training (combination of aerobic and resistance training) in combination with
      melatonin treatment in aspects related to fatigue, quality of life and depression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic renal disease is a &quot;silent epidemic&quot; affecting up to 10% of the population in the
      EU, USA, and Asian with some of the sufferers progressing into end-stage renal failure.

      Renal disease patients are characterized by progressively worsening muscle weakness and
      muscle atrophy due to both a metabolic and a disuse component collectively described as
      uremic myopathy. While various interventions in stable HD patients have helped these
      patients improve their functionality, they still have not proven enough to bring their
      muscle quality and quantity up to the levels of a healthy sedentary person. Moreover,
      patients present with sleep problems, neurological and quality of life issues, anxiety
      and/or symptoms of depression but most notably they complain of chronic fatigue and &quot;lack of
      energy&quot;.

      Other factors that contribute to the excessive fatigue are a lack of restorative sleep,
      excess pre-dialysis weight, poor nutritional status, restless legs syndrome and the overall
      mental status of the patients. Evidently, of all of these factors can contribute to a
      self-exacerbating process, a vicious circle, of fatigue due to inactivity and further
      inactivity due to fatigue. This sensation of an enduring fatigue interferes with physical
      and social activities and feeds perceptions of increased restrictions and barriers, and
      leads to a significant reduction of physical activity and functional capacity, which in turn
      contributes to the increased cardiovascular risk and a high mortality rate among these
      patients.

      Rationale: The investigators hypothesize  that by improving the quality of sleep will
      increase patients' rest levels resulting in more energy during day and therefore more
      physical activity, total body and mind recovery and therefore better capacity for exercise,
      and more secretion of growth hormone and therefore increased anabolism. Our mission is to
      help the HD patient to better cope with their sensation of fatigue.

    <description>The patients will be required to complete 3 exercise sessions per week for 24 weeks. Training will include a 35-45 min aerobic training on a rehabilitation cycle ergometer (Monark Rehab Trainer 881E) in the supine position during dialysis session followed by a resistance training session including training in 5 muscle groups (3 sets of 10 reps). The intensity will progress from 30-40% of the maximum exercise power to 60-70%.</description>
