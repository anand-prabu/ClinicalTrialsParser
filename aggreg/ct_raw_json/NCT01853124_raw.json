            "textblock": "The burden of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) on children and their families continues to be\n      enormous. It accounts for 1.7 million pediatric emergency department (ED) visits annually in\n      the United States and nearly 240,000 in Canada. Children often suffer from prolonged and\n      severe illness; amongst hospitalized Canadian children, 19% have clinical sepsis, 7%\n      seizures and 4% require intensive care unit admission.3 In a study that we conducted at 11\n      Canadian EDs, 51% of children experienced moderate to severe disease. Parents rate such\n      episodes as being equivalent to a 10 day admission (moderate) and persistent moderate\n      hearing loss (severe). The burden is augmented by the 50% household transmission rate2, 6\n      and 42% prolonged work absenteeism rate. Apart from supportive care, health-care providers\n      have little to offer to relieve suffering.\n\n      Probiotics, which are defined as viable microbial preparations that have a beneficial effect\n      on the health of the host, represent a rapidly expanding field. While they are available as\n      over-the-counter products, according to the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug\n      Administration has not yet approved a single agent for any health claims. Further, a 2012\n      meta-analysis concluded that there is limited data to support their indications and no\n      published pediatric gastroenteritis trials reported on side effects. Thus, understanding the\n      benefits and side effects of probiotics is crucial before widespread use can be endorsed.\n      Although probiotic clinical trials have been performed, only one (still unpublished) has\n      been ED based. Most studies to date have been significantly flawed and guidelines do NOT\n      endorse their use stating that well-controlled human trials are needed. Consequently, we and\n      others have found that they are rarely used in clinical practice. Reasons cited include (1)\n      questionable clinical meaning to the outcomes evaluated thus far; (2) absence of studies in\n      the appropriate patient population, and (3) a lack of confidence in the quality of probiotic\n      agents studied.\n\n      This study will address (1) the needs of the medical community, which is aware of the\n      widening gap between the number of important pediatric and adult trials and (2) the interest\n      of caregivers in \"probiotics\" - 71% are aware of the term; 31% believe they may be\n      beneficial in children with diarrhea, and > 90% would administer a probiotic if it could\n      make their child better. Furthermore, our pilot study has provided promising preliminary\n      data and has proven the feasibility of our methods. Thus we are poised to conduct a\n      randomized controlled trial (RCT)that will definitively determine if meaningful benefits are\n      derived from probiotic use and will provide critical information regarding their mechanism\n      of action. This information will impact on practice, the burden of disease, and ensure that\n      children receive the best care possible. The results of our proposed RCT will enable\n      guidelines to either clearly endorse or recommend against the routine use of a probiotic\n      agent in children with Acute Gastroenteritis."
