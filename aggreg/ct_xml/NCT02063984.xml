  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will continue  research designed to improve treatment outcomes for adolescent
      substance use disorders by integrating neuroscience- and behaviorally-based treatments. In
      particular, this project will be the first to evaluate whether Working Memory Training can
      enhance cognitive function and reduce impulsive decision making to improve abstinence
      outcomes. In addition, an adaptive abstinence-based incentive program will be evaluated as a
      new method for intervening with those who do not respond to their first-line treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will test two novel strategies to enhance outcomes. Working Memory Training (WMT),
      an efficacious method for strengthening specific cognitive processes, aims to improve
      factors (e.g., delay discounting / impulsive decision-making) that have shown a strong
      relation to substance use and treatment response. Second, more intensive and higher
      magnitude CM (ICM) will be used to motivate abstinence among teens who are not abstinent by
      Week 6. The investigators hypothesize that these strategies will improve outcomes by
      modifying a fundamental cognitive system involved in making choices to engage in risky
      behavior and by increasing motivation to abstain in early nonresponders. Aim 1 will pilot
      and refine the new procedures in a community clinic in preparation for the randomized trial.
      A sequential, multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) will allow the study to determine
      the most effective first-line treatment and the most effective adaptive strategy (Aim 2).
      All teens will begin treatment with BT/CM or BT/CM/WMT. After 6 weeks, responders will
      continue in their first-line treatments, while nonresponders will be randomized to ICM or to
      continue with first-line treatment. Aim 3 will conduct mechanistic analyses to assess
      whether cognitive changes related to WMT engender increased abstinence, and whether specific
      tailoring variables moderate treatment effects. Aim 4 will gather formative data on
      implementation factors to inform future large-scale studies and dissemination efforts.
      Primary hypotheses are: (1) first-line treatment with WMT will improve abstinence outcomes
      and reduce relapse; (2) strategies with ICM for nonresponders will result in better outcomes
      than those without; (3) WMT will reduce delay discounting, which will predict outcome. The
      unique approach holds promise for reducing multiple types of risky behaviors by affecting
      basic mechanisms that determine impulsive decision-making.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Participants must be 12 to 18 years of age, must live at home with the parent who will
        participate, report using marijuana during the previous 30 days or provide a
        marijuana-positive urine test, meet criteria for cannabis abuse or dependence, and have a
        parent who can participate.

        To accommodate WMT, the study will also require that the teen have access to a computer
        and broadband internet at home to facilitate compliance. The investigators expect over 85%
        of teens will have such access.(US Department of Commerce, 2010). If they do not have such
        access, the investigators will consider inclusion if they agree to and are able to attend
        the clinic and complete the WMT training each weekday.

        Exclusion Criteria: DSM criteria for dependence (likely to be adjusted for DSM-5 Use
        Disorder) on alcohol or other drugs other than marijuana (use of or meeting criteria for
        abuse of other substances will not be an exclusion criterion), active psychosis, severe
        medical or psychiatric illness limiting participation, or pregnant or breast-feeding.
