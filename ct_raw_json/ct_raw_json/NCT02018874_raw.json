LY2780301 has shown\n      synergistic activity in combination with targeted agents or chemotherapy including\n      gemcitabine. We propose herein to combine LY2780301 with gemcitabine and to treat different\n      tumor types with molecular alterations. This may validate the anti-tumor activity of the\n      LY2780301 and it will increase our knowledge regarding molecular predictors of its efficacy."
