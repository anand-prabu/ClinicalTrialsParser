  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether general anesthesia or sedation technique is
      preferable during embolectomy for stroke, measured in terms of three months neurological
      impairment. In addition we study if there is any difference between the methods regarding
      complication frequency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a common cause of neurological disability. Early diagnosis of ischemic stroke now
      enables treatment with thrombolysis and / or endovascular therapy (embolectomy). In order to
      implement this procedure, the duration of which varies from 2-6 hours, the patient has to
      remain immobilized. Two techniques are currently used routinely to achieve this.

      One technique is general anaesthesia, that will ensure that the patient is completely
      immobile throughout the procedure, which is an advantage from a neuroimaging perspective. A
      disadvantage is that preparation for, and the induction of anesthesia prolongs the time to
      embolectomy. Another disadvantage may be that the patient´s blood pressure drops during
      anesthesia, which could impair the brain blood supply and subsequently neurological outcome.
      The ability to evaluate the patient's neurological symptoms also disappears.

      The second technique consists of sedation during surgery. The advantages of this technique
      are that the time to the beginning of embolectomy is getting shorter and the blood pressure
      becomes more stable. One drawback is that it cannot guarantee that the patient remains
      immobile throughout the procedure, which increases the risk of motion artifacts and may lead
      to the duration of embolectomy becomes prolonged. There is also a risk of hypoventilation
      and the patient aspirates during surgery.

      Retrospective studies suggest that patients receiving general anesthesia have worse
      neurologic outcome three months after stroke. This could be explained by more or less
      pronounced anesthesia-induced episodes of hypotension, compared with lightly sedated
      patients with more stable blood pressure. In these retrospective analyzes, however, the
      patients who received general anesthesia were, neurologically speaking, more ill than
      patients who only received sedation. This may probably, at least in part, explain why
      anesthetized patients have a worse neurologic outcome. In these retrospective studies, many
      centers were involved, with various endovascular and anesthesia procedures.

        Inclusion Criteria:Patients with acute stroke considered for thrombectomy and meeting the
        following inclusion criteria included:

          1. the patient is ≥ 18 years

          2. the patient has a CT angio verified embolization * and / or a NIHSS scores ** ≥ 10
             (R) or 14 (L) depending on the side engagement

          3. embolectomy (= groin puncture) started &lt;8 hours after symptom onset

               -  Embolus in one of the following arteries: internal carotid artery, anterior
                  cerebral (A1 segment), cerebri media (M1 segment) and proximal cerebri media
                  branches (M2 segment).

                    -  NIHSS (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale). Patients with embolus
                       in left hemisphere circulation require ≥ 14 points, while patients with
                       embolus in the right hemisphere circulation require ≥ 10 points. This is
                       because occlusion on the right side does not usually cause aphasia, a
                       symptom that usually leads to higher total score of NIHSS.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. the patient must receive general anesthesia, for medical reasons, according to the
             responsible anesthesiologist

          2. the patient cannot receive general anesthesia, for medical reasons, according to the
             responsible anesthesiologist

          3. the patient has an embolization of posterior brain vessels

          4. CT-confirmed intracerebral hemorrhage

          5. spontaneous recanalization or spontaneous neurological improvement

          6. any other reason that does not allow embolectomy (co-morbidities)

          7. premorbid MRS ≥ 4
