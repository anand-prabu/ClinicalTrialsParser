The aim of\n      this research is to evaluate the thoracopulmonary recruitment by comparison of inspiratory\n      vital capacity (VC ins)and inspiratory/expiratory vital capacity (VC ins-ex) with the vital\n      capacity (VC) according to pathology and  severity of pulmonary damage of patients with\n      neuromuscular diseases. The methodology consists in realize VC by support of\n      inspiratory/expiratory pressures, while the patient is passive and realizing a maximal\n      inspiratory/expiratory effort simultaneously, with the aid of mechanical\n      insufflation/exsufflation device (Cough Assist\u00ae). The evaluation will last for 30 minutes\n      and the non-inclusion criteria are those for an insufflation. The study hypothesis is that\n      long term insufflation/exsufflation device use could improve thoracopulmonary mobility."
