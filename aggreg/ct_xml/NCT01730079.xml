      Background:

      - Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a functional imaging technique that can be uses light
      to study brain function while allowing for movement. To look at blood flow in the brain,
      NIRS uses a low-power light source with detectors that see how the light changes as it
      passes through brain tissue. Brain blood flow can indicate which parts of the brain are
      active during different tasks. Researchers want to study children with attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and will use NIRS to
      compare the blood flow in the brain of children with ADHD and ASD with that of typically
      developing children.

      Objectives:

        -  To see how well NIRS can detect changes in brain blood flow during tests of thinking
           and memory in children.

        -  To compare blood flow in the brains of typically developing children and those with
           ADHD or ASD.

      Eligibility:

      - Children between 4 and 8 years of age with ASD, ADHD, or children with no psychiatric
      diagnoses.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened for eligibility. Those who are taking stimulant
           medication for ADHD or ASD will need to stop taking it for 3 days before the study
           visit.

        -  After participating in a screening assessment, all participants will have one study
           visit. At this visit, they will have be asked to complete two tasks during a NIRS scan.
           For both tasks, they will react to images on a computer screen. This visit will last
           about 2 hours.

        -  This is a testing study only. No blood or other samples will be needed for this study.

      Objective: to test whether Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy (NIRS) can be used to monitor
      cognitive brain function and detect markers for differentiation of Autism Spectrum Disorders
      (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

      Study population: Children with ASD, ADHD, and typically developing children, all between 4
      and 8 years of age.

      Design: The study will investigate NIRS signal changes while children with ASD, ADHD, and
      typically developing children perform well-known functional tasks.

      Outcome Measures: Graded changes in blood flow and oxygen, measured with NIRS, in response
      to different functional tasks.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Children will be between 4 to 8 years of age (4 years, 0 months to 8 years, 11 months).
        English speakers only will be recruited for the study, because the language measures/tests
        and stimuli being used are in English and were developed and standardized on English-only
        samples.

        Typically Developing Group:

        -Development in nonverbal and verbal areas within age expectations (per scores onthe
        Differential Ability Scales, Second Edition or the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of
        Intelligence        Fourth Edition , no more than 1.5 standard deviation below the mean)

        ASD Group:

          -  Diagnosis of Autistic Disorder, Asperger   s disorder, or Pervasive Developmental
             Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified (PDD     NOS), based on diagnostic evaluation
             conducted through a separate screening protocol

          -  Minimum Nonverbal IQ score of 80;  Minimum Verbal IQ score of 60

        ADHD Group:

        -Diagnosis of ADHD  based on diagnostic evaluation conducted through a separate screening
        protocol Minimum Nonverbal IQ of 80; Minimum Verbal IQ score of 60

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All children who meet the following criteria:

          -  Primary language spoken at home is other than English

          -  Any skin disease that affects the scalp

          -  Past or present vascular disease, such as lupus, ankylosing spondylitis or
