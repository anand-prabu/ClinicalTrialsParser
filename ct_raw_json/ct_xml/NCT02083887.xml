  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two vaccines, ChAd63 ME-TRAP and MVA ME-TRAP, are being tested to see if they will form a
      safe and effective vaccination strategy against malaria. The vaccines have been found to be
      well tolerated when tested in Gambian adults, young children and infants, who are at risk of
      severe malaria. Both vaccines will be given to participating infants at the same time as
      some EPI (Expanded Program on Immunization) vaccines, and assess whether they are safe and
      still helpful in making the body's defense system respond.
