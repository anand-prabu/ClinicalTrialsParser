    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label study of Rabies Immune Globulin (Human),
      Caprylate/Chromatography Purified (RIG-C), in approximately 12 healthy subjects.  The
      purpose of this study is to characterize the rabies virus-specific antibody titer after a
      single intramuscular injection of 20 IU/kg RIG-C and to evaluate the safety and tolerability
      of RIG-C.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  In good health in the judgment of the Investigator as determined by medical history,
             physical examination, and screening laboratory assessments.

          -  Female of childbearing potential must have a negative result on the screening serum
             pregnancy test and must agree to practice contraception by a method of proven
             reliability (includes abstinence) for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating females.

          -  Clinical evidence of any significant acute or chronic disease that may interfere with
             successful completion of the trial.

          -  Clinically significant history of the following: cardiovascular disease,
             hyperlipidemia, serious respiratory disease including bronchitis or asthma, endocrine
             disorder, liver disease, glaucoma, gastrointestinal disease, disorder of the
             reticuloendothelial system, or neurologic illness.

          -  History of angioedema or nephrotic syndrome.

          -  Non-controlled arterial hypertension.

          -  Anemia at screening.

          -  Significant proteinuria (&gt; 1 + on urine dipstick) and/or has a history of acute renal
             failure and/or severe renal impairment or a blood urea nitrogen or creatinine more
             than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal at screening and/or currently receiving
             dialysis.

          -  Elevated liver enzymes (aspartate transaminase, alanine aminotransferase) and
             Gamma-glutamyl Transferase) equal to or greater than 1.5 times the upper limit at
             screening.

          -  Previously received the rabies vaccine and/or rabies immune globulin.

          -  Received infusion of a blood/plasma product or fraction within the past 12 months,
             including any type of immune globulin.

          -  Known adverse reaction to administration of any immune globulin or other blood/plasma
             products.

          -  Experienced anaphylactic shock with the administration of blood/plasma products.

          -  Known medical history of selective immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency.

          -  Received any corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, or immunomodulators within 6 weeks
             prior to screening.

          -  Expects to receive oral or topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
             acetaminophen, antihypertensives, and/or antihistamines 24 hours before or after
             investigational product administration during the Baseline/Treatment, Study Day 0
             visit.

          -  Currently receiving any anti-viral treatment.

          -  Screening laboratory results indicative of an acute or chronic infection with

             immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or parvovirus B19 (B19V).

          -  Participated in another clinical trial within 30 days prior to screening (imaging
             studies without investigative treatments are permitted) or has received any
             investigational products within the previous 3 months.

          -  Not willing to postpone receiving any live virus vaccines until 3 months after
             receiving investigational product.
