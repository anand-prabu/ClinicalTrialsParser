      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of Helicoll (a collagen wound
      dressing) in treating chronic and non-chronic wounds of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis
      bullosa (RDEB) patients. Helicoll will be compared to standard wound dressings.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Written consent must be obtained from subjects over age 18, or from a parent or
             legally authorized representative if subject is under 18. Assent will be obtained
             from subjects age 7 - 17.

          2. Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of RDEB by a dermatologist.

          3. Have at least three target wounds that meet the following criteria:

               -  One chronic wound, of approximately 6 months or more duration. If the subject
                  has an additional chronic wound of similar size and duration, this additional
                  wound will be treated with standard dressings and followed in the study.  A
                  wound in an area that consistently heals and then breaks down again will be
                  considered a chronic wound.

               -  Two non-chronic wounds, of approximately 3 months or less duration, of similar
                  size, and able to be dressed separately.  Both wounds should have approximately
                  the same duration.

             All wounds must be:

               -  Open, and not scabbed or crusted over

               -  Not actively infected

               -  Not requiring surgical intervention

          4. A parent or legally authorized representative must be willing and able to ensure
             subject is present for all required study visits (for minor subjects).

          5. The subject or caregiver (or a parent or legally authorized representative for
             subjects under 18) must be able to follow instructions.

          6. Subject must be age 7 or older.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Inability to travel to Stanford for study visits.

          2. Complicating illness as determined by study investigators to be exclusionary
             including any infection requiring systemic antibiotics.

          3. Presence or history of squamous cell carcinoma at target wound site.

          4. Known bovine (cow) or ovine (sheep) sensitivity.

          5. Therapy with an investigational agent during the study.
