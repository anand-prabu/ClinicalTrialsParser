  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of diabetes in pregnancy is rising in all maternal age groups.  There is
      increasing evidence that in-utero exposure to maternal diabetes is associated with an
      increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes in children and adults. There is an urgent
      need to reduce these increasing rates of obesity and diabetes in subsequent generations.

      The MiTy Trial (Metformin in Women with Type 2 Diabetes in Pregnancy Trial) is a CIHR-funded
      multi-centre, randomized controlled trial of women with type 2 diabetes in pregnancy (sample
      size n=500). The MiTy Trial is looking to determine the effect of the addition of metformin
      to a standard regimen of insulin in women with diabetes, on perinatal morbidity and
      mortality.

      The MiTy Kids Trial is a follow-up to the MiTy Trial which will determine whether treatment
      with metformin during pregnancy in women with type 2 diabetes will lead to a reduction in
      adiposity and improvement in insulin resistance in the offspring of women with diabetes at 2
      years of age.
