As a result of this\n      bladder dysfunction, individuals with SCI have to undergo regular invasive examination of\n      their bladder function (urodynamic examination).\n\n      The nerve growth factor (NGF) is released from smooth muscle cells of the bladder, and there\n      are reports, that the concentration of NGF is elevated in the urine of patients with bladder\n      dysfunction. The NGF concentration can also be measured in the blood. The concentration of\n      NGF in the blood and urine of SCI individuals has not yet been investigated. These\n      concentrations may correlate with the severity of bladder dysfunction, and may thus be used\n      to replace or at least reduce the number of the more invasive urodynamic examinations.\n\n      The hypothesis that urine and blood NGF concentrations in individuals with SCI are higher\n      compared to individuals with healthy bladder function will be tested."
