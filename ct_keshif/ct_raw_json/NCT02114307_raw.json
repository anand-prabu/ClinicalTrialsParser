The Revitive IX device is a neuromuscular\n      electrical stimulation device that gives wide pulse pattern electrical stimulation via foot\n      pads. A cycle of treatment consists of a 30 minute programme of 15 varying waveforms that\n      last a minute each.\n\n      Twenty patients with venous insufficiency will be screened according the eligibility\n      criteria. Patients will be randomised to either treatment or control (sham device) group.\n      Patients are advised to use the device 30 minutes a day, everyday, for 6 weeks. Compliance\n      will be monitored with a data logger and diary card.\n\n      Primary outcome measure:\n\n      a) improvement in venous haemodynamics.\n\n      Secondary outcome measures:\n\n        1. improvement in lower limb oedema\n\n        2. improvement in clinical symptoms\n\n        3. reduction in lower limb pain and discomfort\n\n        4. improvement in quality of life measures\n\n        5. device satisfaction."
