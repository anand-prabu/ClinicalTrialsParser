Determine the\n      median survival of patients treated with IL-2. III. Further delineate the toxicity of IL-2\n      in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients receive bolus interleukin-2 on days 1-5 and\n      8-12. The cycle repeats every 3 weeks. Patient response is evaluated after 2 cycles.\n      Patients with stable disease, partial, or complete response may be treated with maintenance\n      IL-2 for up to 4 additional cycles. Patient evaluation is performed after every 2 cycles. At\n      this point, patients with stable or responding disease may be treated with IL-2 every 6\n      weeks until disease progression, intolerable toxic effects, or 2 cycles beyond complete\n      response.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued."
