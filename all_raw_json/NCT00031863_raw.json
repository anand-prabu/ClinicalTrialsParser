It is not yet known if rofecoxib is effective\n      in treating colorectal cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of giving rofecoxib after\n      surgery in treating patients who have stage II or stage III colorectal cancer."

Patients\n      are stratified according to participating center, site of disease (colon vs rectum), disease\n      stage (II vs III), age, adjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs no), and type of chemotherapy regimen\n      (1 vs 2 vs 3 vs 4 vs 5). Within 3 months of surgical resection alone or completion of\n      adjuvant radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy after surgical resection, patients are randomized\n      to one of four treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral rofecoxib once daily for 2 years.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral rofecoxib once daily for 5 years.\n\n        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for 2 years.\n\n        -  Arm IV: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for 5 years. Treatment continues in\n           all arms in the absence of disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 7,000 patients (1,750 per treatment arm) will be accrued for\n      this study within 5 years."
