Radiation therapy\n      uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. In intensity-modulated radiotherapy, multiple\n      beam angles and dozens of beam segments are used to deliver highly conformal radiation\n      therapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different\n      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from\n      dividing. Giving PET-adjusted IMRT together with combination chemotherapy may kill more\n      tumor cells."
