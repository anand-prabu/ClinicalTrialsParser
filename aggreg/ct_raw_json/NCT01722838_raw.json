The study will utilize a pre-test/post-test design with participants randomized to\n      intervention and comparison groups; have a strategy to retain at least 80% of participants\n      through study completion; collect data at baseline, at 3 months post-intervention, and at 6\n      months post-intervention; and rigorously measure outcomes that directly impact HIV risk.\n      Data will be collected at each assessment point to assess B-ME's ability to improve\n      behavioral outcomes that directly impact Black MSM HIV risk: (1) number of unprotected anal\n      and vaginal sex events; (2) number of unprotected sex events with persons of unknown HIV\n      status; (3) frequency of HIV testing, and (4) increased communication between partners about\n      sex and strategies for reducing the risk of HIV infection."
