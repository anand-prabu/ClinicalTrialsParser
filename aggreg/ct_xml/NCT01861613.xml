  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, children less than 15 y of age have been regarded as a key group for hepatitis B
      immunization in China. However, there is not yet special immunization strategy for
      population above 15 y of age. In this study, we investigated the seroprevalence of hepatitis
      B and immune response to HB vaccine among Chinese college students to uncover the need on
      universal mass vaccination or booster immunization only for students with HBV vaccination
      history against hepatitis B in Chinese college students to inform decision making.
