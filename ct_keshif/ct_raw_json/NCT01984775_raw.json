Determination of skin types is\n             based on sunburn and tanning history in response to the first 30 to 45 minutes of sun\n             exposure.\n\n          -  A woman is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential, defined\n             as a woman with functioning ovaries who has a documented bilateral tubal\n             ligation/sterilization or hysterectomy, bilateral oopherectomy, or postmenopausal\n             with at least 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  History of known or suspected intolerance to GSK2894512, any of the ingredients of\n             the study products, adhesive tape/plaster, or the test chambers.\n\n          -  Inability to evaluate the skin at and around the potential test sites on the back due\n             to sunburns, unevenness in skin tone, tattoos, scars, excessive hair, freckles,\n             birthmarks, moles, or other skin damage or abnormality.\n\n          -  Clinically-relevant skin disease, including psoriasis, eczema, atopic dermatitis,\n             acne, dysplastic nevi, or other skin pathologies, or a history of skin cancer, that\n             may, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicate participation or interfere\n             with test site evaluations.\n\n          -  Considered immunocompromised, or has a clinically-relevant history of or currently\n             suffering from any disease or condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,\n             might affect the evaluation of the study product or place the subject at undue risk.\n\n          -  Used prohibited concomitant medications or products within the defined washout\n             periods before the Day 1 visit.
