    <description>The time from the start of study treatment to the first documented progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.  The progression date will be assigned to the earliest time when any progression is observed.  If withdrawal from the study due to adverse events or change of therapy occurs before documented progression or death, then these observations will be censored at the date when the last complete myeloma response assessment determines a lack of progression.  For subjects who do not develop PD during the study, if the response from the last visit is 'not evaluable', the most prior visit date with a complete evaluation indicating no PD will be used as the censor date.  Sensitivity analyses will be performed based on different censoring rules for PFS, which will be specified in the statistical analysis plan.</description>

             that would prevent the subject from participating in the study

          -  Any condition including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the

               -  Untransfused platelet count (a platelet count drawn at least 7 days after the
                  administration of the last platelet transfusion) &lt; 50,000 cells/microL (50 ×
                  109/L)
