  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants face many feeding challenges during hospitalization which can prolong
      hospitalization, raise parental anxiety and can lead to medical instability.  The Feeding
      Progression study will randomize preterm infants to one of two currently accepted oral
      feeding schedules; oral feed attempts every 3 hours or every 6 hours.  The study will
      collect data on oral feeding success, milk transfer, sucking strength, growth and medical
      complications.

    <textblock>
      Preterm infants are at high risk for feeding issues.  Feeding difficulties lead to prolonged
      hospitalization, increase medical complications and raise parental anxiety. The transition
      from tube feeding to oral feeding is an especially important step in a preterm infant's
      early life.  Currently, there is limited evidence to guide this transition.  There are two
      commonly used schedules for transitioning preterm infants to oral feeding: an every 6 hour
      schedule and an every 3 hour schedule.  However, there is currently no evidence to guide
      providers in their choice of oral feeding schedule.

      The primary objective of this study is to explore whether an every 6 (q6) hour oral feeding
      schedule will improve time to full oral feedings as compared to an every 3 (q3) hour oral
      feeding schedule. The secondary objectives are to test whether every 6 hour feeding allows
      for improved medical stability and oral-motor coordination as compared to the other commonly
      used q3 hour schedule.  Each infant will be randomly assigned to a q6 hour or q3 hour oral
      feeding schedule.  Data on oral feeding progression, respiratory status and oral motor
      proficiency will be collected and compared.  The study will collect data on how long it
      takes each infant to get to full oral feeds, respiratory status throughout their time of
      oral feeding, whether there were any episodes of medical complications, measures of oral
      motor feeding skills, and the time to discharge from the hospital.  This study is a crucial
      first step towards determining which feeding schedule is optimal for preterm infants to
      ensure timely attainment of full oral feeds and hospital discharge without compromising
      medical stability.
