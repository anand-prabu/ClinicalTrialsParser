      Eligible patients will receive subcutaneous vaccinations of the hTERT/survivin/CMV
      multipeptide vaccine and GM-CSF over a 24 month period.  All patients will receive
      basiliximab 20 mg 1 day prior to the start of vaccinations.  Prevnar vaccine will be
      administered at the time of Vaccines 1,3, and 5.  Patients who remain clinically stable
      after the fourth vaccine, may continue to receive vaccinations every 4 weeks for up to 2
      years.

    <textblock>
      hTERT is widely found in breast cancer cells and has a role in tumor growth and development,
      making it attractive for immunotherapy.  Also, recent data suggest that breast cancer is
      potentially responsive to immunological therapies.  In one trial, patients with advanced
      cancer received a series of hTERT vaccinations and 4 of 7 patients with advanced breast or
      prostate carcinoma developed hTERT-specific T lymphocytes.  Partial tumor regression was
      observed in 1 patient.  In a second trial, 19 HLA A2+ patients with metastatic breast cancer
      were vaccinated with hTERT 1540 peptide in adjuvant with GM-CSF. 68% of patients exhibited
      immunological responses with development of CD8+ hTERT-specific T-cells.  Overall survival
      of vaccine responders was signifiantly better than the overall survival on non-responders.
      In order to expand the number of possible immune responses and to potentially bypass immune
      tolerance, multiple peptides have been added to the vaccine.  In addition, the monoclonal
      antibody basiliximab is included to decrease the regulatory T cells which prevent the immune
      system to work against the tumor, and GM-CSF and Prevnar are used to boost the immune
      system.  Subjects will receive a maximum of 28 vaccinations over a 24 months period.

             to or greater than 3.0, Plt equal to or greater than 75,000, Hgb equal to or greater
             than 10 g/dl

          -  Adequate renal function established within 14 days before treatment defined as serum
             creatinine less than 1.5 times upper limit of normal

          -  Adequate hepatic function established within 14 days before treatment defined as:
             Total bilirubin, less than 1.5 times upper limit of normal, and ALT and AST less than
             2.5 times upper limit of normal

          -  Contrast CT and/or MRI of the brain negative for central nervous system metastases
             within 30 days of treatment

          -  Women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (blood or urine)
             within 14 days before treatment and agree to use appropriate contraception from study
             screen through the duration of the trial. Men must agree to use appropriate
             contraception from study screen through the duration of the trial.

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of brain metastases within the last four years

          -  Positivity for HIV-1/HIV-2, Hepatitis B virus, and Hepatitis C virus active infection

          -  The use of the following within 14 days before treatment: Chemotherapy, Radiation
             therapy, Immunosuppressive drugs, Systemic glucocorticoids, Hematopoietic growth
             factors, Experimental therapy

             treatment, with the exception of low dose anti-coagulants to maintain intravenous
             catheter patency.

          -  Initiation of hormonal agent (such as tamoxifen, anastrazole, or letrozole) in the 30
             days before treatment. 6. Patients who have been on a hormonal agent for at least 30
             days prior to treatment with progressive or stable disease are permitted to enroll,
             but required to stay on this hormonal agent for the duration of the study.

          -  Initiation of immunotherapy (such as trastuzumab-Herceptin) in the 30 days before
             treatment. Patients who have been on trastuzumab for at least 30 days prior to
             treatment with progressive or stable disease are permitted to enroll, but required to
             stay on trastuzumab for the duration of the study.

             that would jeopardize protocol compliance or compromise the patients ability to give
