  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical background: Weight loss is a common problem in patients suffering from upper
      gastrointestinal cancer. It is demonstrated that the prognosis for cancer patients with
      weight loss is worse than that for weight stable patients. Malnutrition in cancer patients
      is associated with a poor prognosis and is an important predictor of mortality.
      Supplementation with home parenteral nutrition in aphagic and terminal patients has shown
      improved quality of life, energy balance, body composition and prolonged survival.

      Aim: The aim of this study is primarily to study the effects of supplementation with
      parenteral nutrition, to patients with advanced incurable gastrointestinal cancer on lean
      body-mass and body composition. Patients found to be at nutritional risk will be included in
      the study and will be randomized to either best supportive nutritional care or best
      supportive nutritional care and Parenteral Nutrition.

      Design: This study is a controlled, randomized trial with two parallel study arms. The study
      will include patients with advanced upper GI cancers at nutritional risk, performance status
      0-2 and with an expected survival of a minimum of 3 months.

      A total of 100 patients are planned to be enrolled and randomized to either best supportive
      nutritional care or best supportive nutritional care and supplemental parenteral Nutrition.

      Primary endpoint is improvement of lean body mass, and by that improvement of quality of
      life, performance status and cancer treatment tolerance.

      Discussion: The planned study will provide important information about the effect of
      parenteral nutrition in a patient group with advanced gastrointestinal cancer.  Palliative
      treatment strategies are set up to improve quality of life as well as prolongation of life.
      Parenteral nutrition in this patient group may indeed contribute to both these aspects of
      palliation.

      Randomizing. The patients will be enrolled in the study, by block randomizing using a
      computer generated list, stratifying in respect to performance status 0 and1 in opposite to
      PS 2.
