One \"experimental\" probe at each site will be perfused with the 'compound' 20ug/dl at 2.0 \u00b5L/min to assess the interstitial conversion of androstenedione to estrone and estradiol.  The 'compound' will be infused. Either one or the other hormone (androstenedione OR testosterone) will be used per experiment.

The present study will try to find the most promising\n      substances by studying small numbers of women and trying to remove the substances that are\n      causing the problem.\n\n      Hypothesis:  A circulating factor or factors, either hormonal, inflammatory or metabolic,\n      causes relative pituitary hypofunction and correction of this reproductive deficit will\n      allow obese women with infertility who have failed to reduce their body weight to normal to\n      conceive, and may also prevent the horizontal passage of an adverse metabolic phenotype to\n      the offspring."
