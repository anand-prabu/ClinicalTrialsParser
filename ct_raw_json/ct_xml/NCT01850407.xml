  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children are typically inadequately prepared for the sexual abuse medical examination.
      Caregivers report lack of examination knowledge as a barrier to preparing their children.
      The purpose of this study was to determine if informational leaflets provided prior to the
      examination are helpful to caregivers in preparing their children.
