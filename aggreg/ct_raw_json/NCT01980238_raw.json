This exploratory study was conducted\n      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new diversion method called spontaneously closed\n      cannula ileostomy (SCCI), which was designed to protect rectal anastomosis in patients with\n      high risk factors on AL. Results of SCCI were compared to those of the loop ileostomy (LI)\n      method."

In the cannula ileostomy group, a double row of concentric purse-string\n      sutures were placed in the ileum wall using 3-0 absorbable suture. The diameters of the\n      purse-string rings were about 10 mm and 20 mm, respectively. The investigators then made a\n      small incision within the inner purse-string and inserted the trachea cannula into the\n      proximal end of the ileum. The inner purse-string suture then was tied, followed by the\n      outer purse-string suture. The outer purse string should capsulate the inner purse string to\n      prevent leakage. Normal saline was injected into the air bag  until the ileum wall began to\n      turn pale. The investigators then pulled the cannula out through the abdominal wall. The\n      incision site in the ileum was approximated to the inner abdominal wall and extraperitonized\n      by fixing the mobilized ileum wall around the cannula to the inner abdominal wall. This was\n      accomplished using 3-4 interrupted sutures.\n\n      In the LI group, patients accepted reversal operation at least 3 months after operation if\n      operation condition permission.\n\n      In the cannula ileostomy group, the cannula will be removed after 3-4 weeks. If anastomotic\n      leakage occurred, The investigators will keep the cannula until the anastomotic leakage was\n      cured."
