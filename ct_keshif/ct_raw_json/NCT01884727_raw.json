A proprietary electrolytic\n      and catalytic process rearranges the salt water solution to mimic the redox signaling\n      molecular composition of the native salt-water compounds found in and around human cells.\n      Data obtained thus far, suggests the possibility that consumption of the ASEA beverage may\n      increase energy expenditure and thus be beneficial for the treatment of obesity, however,\n      this has not been assessed in human clinical studies. To this end, we will measure the\n      effects of ASEA consumption on energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry using the indirect\n      room calorimeter at the University of North Carolina (UNC) Nutrition Research Institute.\n\n      The primary outcome measures will be the change in 24-h energy expenditure and respiratory\n      quotient in response to ASEA consumption. The secondary outcome variables will include\n      changes in relevant peptide hormones, and norepinephrine/epinephrine and their relationship\n      to changes in energy expenditure in response to consumption of ASEA."
