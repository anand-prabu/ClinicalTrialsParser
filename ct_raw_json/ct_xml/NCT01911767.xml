      The primary objective of the study is to prospectively evaluate pregnancy outcomes in women
      with multiple sclerosis who were exposed to dimethyl fumarate since the first day of their
      last menstrual period prior to conception or at any time during pregnancy.

    <textblock>
      The Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) Pregnancy Registry is a prospective, observational
      registry designed to evaluate pregnancy outcomes in women with multiple sclerosis (MS) who
      were exposed to dimethyl fumarate (DMF) since the first day of their last menstrual period
      prior to conception or at any time during pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential are a
      considerable segment of the patient population affected by MS and are likely to be exposed
      to DMF around the time of conception and during pregnancy. Although the data are very
      limited, there is currently no evidence of increased risk of fetal abnormalities or adverse
      pregnancy outcomes associated with gestational exposure to DMF during the first trimester.
      Therefore, it is important to evaluate, in a global pregnancy registry, how DMF exposure may
      affect pregnancy and infant outcomes. Data will be collected on prospective pregnancies
      (i.e.enrollment prior to knowledge of outcome) at time of enrollment, 6 to 7 months
      gestation, and approximately 4 and 12 weeks after estimated date of delivery. The prevalence
      of spontaneous abortions, birth defects, and other pregnancy and infant outcomes will be
      calculated and compared to background rates from external sources such as the European
      Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies.

        Approximately 310 to 375 pregnant DMF exposed women will be enrolled in order to observe
        300 prospective pregnancy outcomes. The infants born to these women will also be part of
        the population studied.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient consent

          -  Patient has a diagnosis of MS.

          -  Documentation that the patient was exposed to DMF since the first day of her LMP
             prior to conception or at any time during pregnancy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prenatal testing that could provide knowledge of the outcome of pregnancy must not
             have been performed prior to the time of enrollment (e.g., alpha fetoprotein,
             sonography, amniocentesis). However, initial maternal health assessment upon
             confirmation of pregnancy does not preclude participation in the Registry unless a
             patient tests positive for a medical condition associated with negative pregnancy
             outcomes (e.g., syphilis) in the opinion of the health care professional.

          -  The outcome of the pregnancy must not be known at the time of enrollment.
