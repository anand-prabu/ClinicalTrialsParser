Lodotra\u00ae dose cannot exceed\n      more than 10mg.\n\n      Lodotra\u00ae should be taken at bedtime (at about 10 pm), with or after the evening meal and be\n      swallowed whole with sufficient liquid. If more than 2 - 3 hours have passed since the\n      evening meal, it is recommended to take Lodotra\u00ae with a light meal or snack.\n\n      Modified-release tablets are not to be broken, divided or chewed.\n\n      Treatment procedure:At Visit 1(week 0), subjects who qualify for entry into the study will\n      medicated to Lodotra\u00ae starting dose of 10 mg daily.
