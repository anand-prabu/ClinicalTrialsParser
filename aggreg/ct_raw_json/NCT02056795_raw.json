            "textblock": "Introduction:  Ankle sprains, the most common sports-related musculoskeletal injury, account\n      for approximately 25% of sports injuries.  An estimated 40% of these individuals will\n      progress to develop chronic functional ankle instability (CFAI), which can significantly\n      affect athletic performance and activities of daily life.  Stresses from the injury can\n      damage the ligaments, muscles, nerves and mechanoreceptors.  It is widely accepted that\n      ankle proprioception is critical for balance and that individuals with CFAI demonstrate\n      decreased proprioception and altered muscular function, which impairs postural stability.\n      The goal of this study is to determine if a single application of electroacupuncture can\n      have an immediate positive outcome related to balance in individuals with CFAI.\n\n      Methods:  This single blinded randomized trial will include 12 subjects receiving a single\n      application of electroacupuncture and 12 subjects in the placebo group receiving sham\n      electroacupuncture.  Subjects aged 18-50 with a history of unilateral inversion ankle\n      sprain(s) and chronic symptoms of instability will be selected.  Balance will be assessed\n      pre- and post-treatment using force plate data during a single-leg stance and via the Star\n      Excursion Balance Test (SEBT).  GB-34 and GB-40 will be used for the experimental group and\n      non-traditional points on the medial aspect of the leg will be used for the sham\n      electroacupuncture group.  Both will be connected to the electrical stimulation unit for 10\n      minutes.  Results from this study may inform future research investigating the ability of EA\n      at decreasing the risk of ankle sprains, improving perceived stability, and reducing the\n      risk of subsequent degenerative changes."
