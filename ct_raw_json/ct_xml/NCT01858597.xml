  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the most common complication in pregnancy. Both
      mother and offspring have a significantly increased future risk for metabolic and
      cardiovascular disease as a consequence of GDM. Pathological insulin resistance and the
      pancreatic β-cell dysfunction may contribute to the development and adverse outcomes of GDM.

      Recently, fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) and FGF21 have emerged as key endocrine
      regulators of glucose, lipid and energy metabolism. Both factors activate FGFRs in the
      context of co-receptor βKlotho(KLB) expression. After that, both proteins alter ERK
      phosphorylation and stimulate glucose uptake. Furthermore, these two factors ameliorate
      insulin resistance through various ways including up-regulating insulin mRNA, IRS-1, GLUT-1
      expressions, down-regulating GH-IGF-1 levels in different tissues and blood circulation and
      also improving dyslipidemia.

      Our previous studies showed that several factors which involved in insulin resistance and
      FGF19/FGF21 signaling pathway had differential expression in placenta from GDM and normal
      glucose tolerance pregnancy. Those led us to hypothesize that FGF19/FGF21 signaling pathway
      could play an important role in the pathogenesis and development of insulin resistance state
      in GDM.

      In the present study, we will further investigate whether maternal and neonatal FGF19/FGF21
      signaling pathway are altered and associated with insulin resistance, glucose intolerance,
      dyslipidemia and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Thus we will evaluate the regulating action of
      FGF19/FGF21 on gestational insulin resistance.

      The aim of this study is to elucidate the role of FGF19/FGF21 in insulin resistance and
      metabolic disorder in GDM.
