  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis of this study is that consumption of capsinoids increases brown
      adipose tissue activity, detectable by infrared thermal imaging.

      The secondary hypothesis is that consumption of capsinoids can affect an individual's
      glycaemic response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been recently established that brown adipose tissue (BAT) exists in adult humans. BAT
      is a thermogenic tissue which dissipates energy as heat. The primary objective of this study
      is to use thermal imaging to assess the effect of capsinoids on BAT activity in adult
      humans, and whether there is a relationship between the increase in energy expenditure and
      BAT activity after capsinoids intake. The secondary objective is to investigate whether
      capsinoids will have an effect on an individual's glycaemic response. Lean, healthy male
      volunteers will be recruited. There will be two test sessions which are randomized, where
      subjects will consume either capsinoids or placebo capsules, and a standardized amount of
      white rice (equivalent to 50g carbohydrates). Indirect calorimetry will be used to assess
      energy expenditure before and after consumption of the test meal. Thermal imaging of
      supraclavicular BAT, the primary BAT depot in humans, will be undertaken using an infrared
      thermal camera to assess changes in BAT temperature. Blood glucose levels will be monitored
      by finger prick blood sampling method. This study aims to investigate whether capsinoids
      consumption leads to changes in BAT temperatures detectable by the infrared thermal camera,
      to confirm the feasibility of using thermal imaging as a rapid, noninvasive, and
      reproducible way of studying BAT activity thus providing a platform to advance research in
      this emerging field of human BAT.
