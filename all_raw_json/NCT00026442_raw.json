Patients are stratified according to\n      Karnofsky performance status (70-80% vs 90-100%) and presence of hepatic metastases (yes vs\n      no). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive lower-dose oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive higher-dose oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14.\n\n      In both arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at the end of the third and sixth courses, and at\n      completion of therapy.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients (60 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 9 months."
