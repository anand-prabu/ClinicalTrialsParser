Type 1\n      Gaucher disease affects an estimated 30,000 persons worldwide and is the most common. Type 1\n      Gaucher disease does not involve the central nervous system. Patients with Type 2 Gaucher\n      disease present with acute neurological deterioration, which leads to early death. Those\n      with Type 3 disease typically display a more sub-acute neurological course, with later onset\n      and slower progression.\n\n      The primary objective of this study is to  evaluate the long-term safety of every other week\n      (EOW) dosing of velaglucerase alfa in Japanese patients with Gaucher disease who completed\n      study HGT-GCB-087 and elected to continue treatment with velaglucerase alfa.\n\n      Velaglucerase alfa has been developed and approved as an enzyme replacement therapy for Type\n      1 Gaucher disease."

Gaucher disease is also designated\n      in the Medical Aid Program for Specified Categories of Chronic Pediatric Diseases.\n\n      The prevalence of mutations and the phenotype of patients with Gaucher disease in Japan\n      differs from that in non-Japanese populations. Some patients with type 1 Gaucher disease in\n      Japan have more severe and progressive disease compared to non-Japanese patients and the\n      disease is characterized by an earlier onset of symptoms.\n\n      Velaglucerase alfa, a highly-purified form of the naturally occurring enzyme\n      glucocerebrosidase, has been developed as an enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher disease\n      for the symptoms (anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and bone\n      manifestation).\n\n      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety of every other week\n      (EOW) dosing of velaglucerase alfa in Japanese patients with Gaucher disease who completed\n      study HGT-GCB-087 and elected to continue treatment with velaglucerase alfa."
