            "textblock": "Many hospitalized patients experience pain during their hospital stay, and less than half\n      report adequate pain relief. Common treatments for pain include opioid medications, which\n      have associated side effects and complications. Research has shown that acupuncture is\n      effective for surgical, postoperative and cancer-related pain, nausea, and vomiting. More\n      research is needed on the effectiveness of adding acupuncture to routine care for\n      hospitalized patients. The objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of\n      acupuncture delivered in a \"real-world\" setting according to the principles of traditional\n      Chinese medicine among hospitalized patients to manage pain and other symptoms. 250\n      hospitalized participants will be randomized in a 1 to 1 ratio to receive either 1) usual\n      care or 2) usual care with acupuncture offered (125 in each group). The primary outcome\n      measure will be change in daily pain intensity. Data on other symptoms, such as nausea,\n      vomiting, anxiety, and depression, as well as functionality and quality of life will be\n      collected in person, on a web-based survey, or via telephone follow-up. The aims of the\n      study are to examine the effectiveness of acupuncture to manage pain and other symptoms\n      among hospitalized patients; to evaluate the impact of acupuncture on patient satisfaction\n      among hospitalized patients; and to estimate costs and cost-effectiveness of acupuncture\n      among a subset of hospitalized patients.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that compared to hospitalized patients receiving usual care\n      alone, hospitalized patients receiving acupuncture will have:\n\n        1. decreased pain severity\n\n        2. higher patient satisfaction"
