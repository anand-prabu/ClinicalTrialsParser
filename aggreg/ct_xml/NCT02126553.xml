      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if Revlimid® (lenalidomide) can help to
      keep AML participants in remission. The safety of this drug will also be studied.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will take
      lenalidomide by mouth with water 1 time a day during each 28-day cycle. If participant's
      doctor thinks it is needed, the amount of lenalidomide they take while on study may be
      increased.

      Study Visits:

      Every month for the first 3 months, then every 3 months until Month 12, then every 6 months
      after that, participant will have a physical exam.

      Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests 1-2 times every week during
      Cycle 1, then every 2-4 weeks during Cycles 2-6, then every 4 weeks after that.

      After cycle 1, after 3 months of therapy, then every 3 months until Cycle 12, and then every
      6 months after that, participant will have a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy to check the
      status of the disease. This may be performed at other times if participant's doctor thinks
      it is needed.

      As part of the study, participant will be enrolled on a special program called REMS that
      will inform them about the risks of lenalidomide and pregnancy.  As part of this program,
      participant will be required to have regular pregnancy tests if they are a female who is
      able to have children.

      Length of Treatment:

      Participant may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in
      their best interest.  Participant will no longer be able to take the study drug if the
      disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study
      directions.

      This is an investigational study.  Lenalidomide is FDA approved and commercially available
      for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and multiple myeloma (MM).  Its use in
      participants with high risk AML that is in remission is investigational.

      Up to 110 participants will be enrolled in this multicenter study.  All will take part at MD
      Anderson.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients aged 18 to 55 years with high risk (as defined in #2) AML who have achieved
             their FIRST CR or CRi within 12 months of enrollment and are not immediately
             candidates for allogeneic stem cell transplant. Patients above age 55 who are not
             eligible for other protocols may be considered for enrollment on a case by case basis
             after discussion with the PI.

          2. 2. Patients in their FIRST CR or CRi may be eligible for enrollment only if they have
             a high risk feature, including, but not limited to: adverse karyotype, FLT3 mutation,
             history of antecedent hematologic disorder (AHD), presence of dysplasia in the bone
             marrow, therapy-related AML, history of requiring more than 1 cycle of intensive
             induction chemotherapy to achieve first remission, or presence of persistent minimal
