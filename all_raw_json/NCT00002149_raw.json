Symptoms of\n      sinusitis in HIV patients are often refractory to aggressive Western medical management, and\n      antibiotic intolerance can occur. Traditional Chinese Medicine consisting of acupuncture and\n      herbal treatment may provide a low-risk, low-cost alternative to conventional antibiotic\n      therapy."
