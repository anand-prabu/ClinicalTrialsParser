      Hypothesis 1: Blood alcohol concentration will be &lt;25 mg/100ml (equivalent to a blood
      alcohol concentration of &lt;0.025%) after a 1 hour urinary catheter ethanol lock.

      Hypothesis 2: Daily urinary catheter ethanol locks will not result in increased hematuria or
      increased urinary white cells.

      This study involves a confirmatory/refuting approach to the above stated hypothesis. The
      investigators will test this hypothesis by addressing the following aims/objectives:

      Specific Aim 1:

      Quantify blood alcohol levels after a 1 hour 74% ethanol lock in urinary catheters utilized
      in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit.

      Specific Aim 2:

      Compare cellular components in urinalyses after the introduction of the ethanol locks.

      Potential study subjects will be recruited from the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta -
      Egleston Pediatric Intensive Care Unit.  Children that are anticipated to have an indwelling
      urinary catheter for &gt;48 hours will be included.  For this pilot study, the investigators
      will enroll 10 patients. Subject ages will range from 6 months to 17 years. Children who are
      on a service other than Critical Care Medicine will have clearance from the primary team
      prior to approaching for enrollment.  The consent process will take place prior to or during
      the initial 24 hours of urinary catheter placement.

    <description>An ethanol lock, utilizing 74% ethanol, will begin within 24 hours of catheter placement.  The lock will be done every 24 hours for 1 hour. Blood alcohol levels will be obtained every day, approximately 1 hour after ethanol lock release, for 3 days.</description>

    <description>An ethanol lock, utilizing 74% ethanol, will begin within 24 hours of catheter placement.  The lock will be done every 24 hours for 1 hour, for a total of 3 days.
A baseline urinalysis will be obtained prior to the first instillation of ethanol.Looking for hematuria or increase in white blood cell count.
A urinalysis will be obtained approximately1 hour after the lock was released.</description>

    <description>Ethanol lock, utilizing 74% ethanol, will begin within 24 hours of urinary catheter placement. The lock will be done every 24 hours for 1 hour. The volume that will be instilled depends upon the fill volume of the catheter, which is imprinted by the manufacturer on each catheter. Once the alcohol is in the catheter, the proximal end of the catheter will be clamped for 1 hour. After the 1 hour dwell time, the clamp will be removed and the alcohol in the lumen of the catheter will be flushed out by the patient's own urine output.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: 6 months - 17 years

          -  Urinary catheter placed at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta

          -  Anticipated urinary catheter need for &gt; 48 hours

          -  Parent or legal guardian (or patient when applicable) consent for  enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  18 yo or older.

          -  Urosepsis at time of study enrollment

          -  Known bladder or genitourinary abnormalities

          -  Chronic bladder drainage regimen

          -  Urologic surgeries (as part of the current admission)

          -  Medical urgency preventing timely administration of the consenting process, or any
             condition that, in the opinion of the attending physician, would place the patient at
             undue risk by participating.

          -  Anuria or oliguria (&lt;0.5 cc/kg/hr averaged over the previous 12 hours)

          -  Other technical considerations that would prevent the timely acquisition of
             sufficient samples such as (but not limited to) absence of a study team member.

          -  Parent or legal guardian (or patient when applicable) refuses to sign informed
             consent.
