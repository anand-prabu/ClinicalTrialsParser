Vitamin C may increase the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide by\n      making cancer cells more sensitive to the drug.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to determine the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide plus vitamin C\n      in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory multiple myeloma."

Treatment continues every 7 weeks for up\n           to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of arsenic trioxide until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of\n      3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n        -  Phase II: Patients receive the MTD of arsenic trioxide with ascorbic acid as outlined\n           above.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for up to 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 31-43 patients (6-18 for phase I and 16-25 for phase II) will\n      be accrued for this study within 2.5 years."
