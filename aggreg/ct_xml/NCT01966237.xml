  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in 40% of children following heart surgery. Serum
      creatinine (Scr) is a late biomarker of AKI, rising 24-48 hours after surgery. Thus, for
      medicines excreted in the urine, AKI could potentially lead to toxic levels in the blood.
      Urinary biomarkers have the ability to detect AKI earlier. Whether early detection of AKI
      through urinary biomarkers can predict altered drug levels is unknown.

      Milrinone is used to improve heart function after surgery, but accumulates in AKI resulting
      in low blood pressure. Dose adjustments are not currently possible because of the late rise
      in SCr, and are based on clinical parameters that may lead to clinically relevant over or
      under-dosing.  Thus, this study will address an important knowledge gap being the first to
      use elevations of AKI biomarker concentrations to anticipate increased milrinone levels.

    <description>Parameters of hemodynamic function defined by a decrease in central venous pressure of &gt; 5cmH20, and/or a decrease in superior vena cava saturation by &gt;10% at 12-36 hours after cardiopulmonary bypass. These surrogate markers of clinical outcome will be correlated with the following: operative mortality, longer time to achieve negative fluid balance, higher vasoactive inotrope score and longer intensive care and hospital length of stay.</description>
