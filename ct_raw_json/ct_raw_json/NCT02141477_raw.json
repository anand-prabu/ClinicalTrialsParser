            "textblock": "Study Groups:\n\n      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study\n      group based on when you join this study.  Up to 2 groups of up to 6 participants will be\n      enrolled in the Phase 1 portion of the study, and up to 60 participants will be enrolled in\n      Phase 2.\n\n      If you are enrolled in Phase 1, the dose of decitabine you receive will depend on when you\n      joined this study.  If the first group of participants to receive decitabine has intolerable\n      side effects, a second group will receive a lower dose.\n\n      If you are enrolled in Phase 2, you will receive decitabine at the highest dose that was\n      tolerated in Phase 1.\n\n      All participants will receive the same dose level of omacetaxine.\n\n      Study Drug Administration:\n\n      Each cycle is 28 days.\n\n      Omacetaxine will be given as an injection under your skin 2 times each day on Days 1-3 of\n      every cycle.\n\n      Decitabine will be given by vein over about 1 hour on Days 1-5 of every cycle.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      Every week (+/- 2 days), blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine\n      tests.  If the disease appears to get better, this blood will only be drawn every 2-4 weeks\n      while you are still receiving the study drugs, and every 4 to 8 weeks after that as long as\n      you are on study.  If you can become pregnant, this blood or urine will also be used for a\n      pregnancy test.  If you live far from the clinic, this blood and urine can be collected at a\n      clinic close to your home, and the results will be reported to the study doctor.\n\n      At the beginning of every cycle, you will have a physical exam.\n\n      At Week 3 (+/- 7 days) and then every 4 weeks after that (+/- 7 days), you may (based on the\n      results of your blood tests) have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy collected to check the\n      status of the disease and for cytogenetic testing.\n\n      At Week 48, blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn and you will have a bone marrow\n      aspirate and/or biopsy to check the status of the disease.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best\n      interest.  You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if\n      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.\n\n      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.\n\n      Follow Up:\n\n      You will have follow-up visits every 3-6 months for up to 5 years after you stop receiving\n      the study drugs.  At these visits, you will have a physical exam.  If you cannot come to the\n      clinic, you may just be called by the study staff and asked about your health.  These calls\n      should last about 5-10 minutes.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Omacetaxine is FDA approved and commercially available\n      for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).  Its use in this study is\n      investigational.  Decitabine is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of\n      MDS.\n\n      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.\n\n      Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this study.  All will take part at MD Anderson."
