The\n      tube passes beyond the stomach and into an opening in the liver called the bile duct.\n      Another small flexible endoscope is inserted inside the ERCP scope to directly visualize the\n      bile duct to ensure that there are no cancers or stones in the bile duct and occasionally to\n      take a sample from the bile duct. The purpose of our study is to examine wither performing\n      this procedure can transmit bacteria from the bile duct to the main blood stream."
