It is hypothesized that the current manual will require few\n      modifications for use with ASD and that, in comparison to a wait-list control group,\n      families who undergo PCIT training will evidence significant gains on measures of parenting\n      stress, child externalizing behaviors and compliance to parental requests. To address the\n      pilot study aims, we will recruit a total of 20 families of children with ASD (ages 2.6-6.11\n      years) whose children are already receiving intensive, one-on-one behavioral treatment\n      services (15-30 hours per week) but no structured parent training. Families will be\n      randomized to either intensive services + PCIT or intensive services alone (wait list\n      control). Assessments will be completed at baseline, mid-treatment (10 weeks post baseline),\n      post-treatment (20 weeks after the baseline assessment) and long-term follow-up (12 weeks\n      post-treatment). PCIT families will attend 20 weekly, one-hour coaching sessions. Both\n      active treatment and wait-list control families will continue to receive intensive ABA\n      services in the home or community. Control families will receive PCIT training after 16\n      weeks on the \"wait-list.\" The aims of the pilot study are:\n\n        1. To assess the utility of the current PCIT treatment manual with preschoolers with ASD\n           and disruptive behavior and their parents;\n\n           Hypothesis 1: The current PCIT treatment manual will be able to be utilized with\n           families of children with ASD with only minimal modifications.\n\n           Hypothesis 2: Families of children with ASD will consistently attend PCIT sessions.\n\n        2. To determine if PCIT with this population will result in an increase in appropriate\n           parent behaviors and a subsequent decrease in targeted child behaviors (e.g., direct\n           assessment of noncompliance, behavior rating scales).\n\n      Hypothesis 3: Families receiving PCIT training will evidence statistically greater decreases\n      on measures of disruptive behavior, quality of parent-child interactions and parental stress\n      than families on the wait-list control group.\n\n      Hypothesis 4: Gains attained at 20 weeks will be maintained at a 12-week post-treatment\n      follow-up."

            "textblock": "Young children with ASD often present with a range of externalizing behavior problems,\n      including aggression, tantrums and difficulty transitioning. Interventions based on the\n      principles of applied behavior analysis (ABA) have been shown to offer an effective means of\n      addressing many of these concerns. Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) is a manualized,\n      empirically supported parent coaching intervention that has been found to be highly\n      effective for typically developing preschoolers presenting with a range of mental health\n      concerns. It also holds considerable promise as a potentially effective treatment for\n      children with ASD. The focus of PCIT treatment is to both improve parent-child interactions\n      and to reduce child behavior problems. PCIT involves the coaching of parents in real-time,\n      via a one-way mirror and a \"bug-in-the ear\" device that allows the therapist to provide\n      feedback and directions to the parent while interacting with his/her child. The aim of the\n      current proposal is to determine if the PCIT treatment manual can be successfully utilized\n      for preschoolers with ASD and to evaluate its ability to significantly decrease measures of\n      problem behavior. It is hypothesized that the current manual will require few modifications\n      for use with ASD and that, in comparison to a wait-list control group, families who undergo\n      PCIT training will evidence significant gains on measures of parenting stress, child\n      externalizing behaviors and compliance to parental requests. To address the pilot study\n      aims, we will recruit a total of 20 families of children with ASD (ages 2.6-6 years) whose\n      children are already receiving intensive, one-on-one behavioral treatment services (15-30\n      hours per week). Families will be randomized to either intensive services + PCIT or\n      intensive services alone (wait list control). Assessments will be completed at baseline,\n      mid-treatment (10 weeks post baseline) and post-treatment (20 weeks after the baseline\n      assessment). PCIT families will attend 20 weekly, one-hour coaching sessions. Both active\n      treatment and wait-list control families will continue to receive intensive ABA services in\n      the home or community. The results of this study will provide pilot data in a subsequent\n      application for federal funding to conduct larger controlled trials, including examining the\n      use of PCIT in school-age children with ASD and intellectual disability and to assess the\n      individual and combined efficacy of PCIT and psychopharmacological treatment."
