      Background:

      EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) is a major diagnostic tool in the patient with
      pancreatic mass with high specificity, specificity and accuracy. However FNA with small
      needle has sometimes failed in acquisition of tissue due to small caliber. To overcome this
      limitation, newly designed ProCore needle was developed and flexible 22 and 25 gauge ProCore
      needles were frequently used. However there was no comparative study of the efficacy and
      accuracy between 22 and 25 gauge ProCore needle yet.

      Aim:

      To compare the efficacy and accuracy of EUS-guided FNA between 22 and 25 gauge ProCore
      needle. (The investigators hypothesized that the accuracy of 25 gauge Procore needle is not
      inferior to 22 gauge ProCore needle.)

      Patient and methods:

      Patients who have pancreatic or peripancreatic mass in imaging studies which need pathologic
      confirm. These patients were randomly assigned to 22 gauge or 25 gauge group.

      Procedure:

      They underwent EUS-guided FNA, 3 times with 10 times of to-and pro movement each.

      The number of patients required:

      One hundred fifty five patients in each group The investigators assumed that the accuracy of
      25 gauge is not inferior to 22 gauge, if the accuracy of 25 gauge is within the 10% of the
      accuracy of 22 gauge. (under 5% significant level, 80% power)
