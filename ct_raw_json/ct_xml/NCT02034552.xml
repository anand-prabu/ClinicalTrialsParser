  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, the potential for added clinical benefit and safety of radium-223
      dichloride in combination with abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide will be investigated
      evaluating radiological progression free survival, overall survival, and skeletal events.
      This study will also explore the clinical utility of different imaging modalities (whole
      body technetium-99 bone scan, diffusion-weighted MRI, and sodium fluoride PETCT scan) in
      assessing bone lesions in subjects with CRPC and bone metastases being treated with radium-
      223 dichloride. All patients involved in the study will be randomized (assigned by chance)
      into one of three arms: radium-223 dichloride 50 kBq/kg administered every 4 weeks;
      radium-223 dichloride 50 kBq/kg administered every 4 weeks together with abiraterone acetate
      1000 mg orally daily plus prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily; and radium-223 dichloride 50
      kBq/kg administered every 4 weeks together with enzalutamide 160 mg orally daily. The study
      will be conducted in the United States. The study will consist of screening, treatment, and
      follow-up. Study treatment will continue until disease progression as determined by
      investigator or when the patient meets criteria for withdrawal from study. Follow-up will
      continue until patient dies, is lost to follow-up, or withdraws informed consent. Active
      followup will continue up to 2 years following last dose of radium-223 dichloride. Long-term
      follow-up for survival and treatment-related safety events will continue up to 7 years
      following last dose of radium-223 dichloride.
