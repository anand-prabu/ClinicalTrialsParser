(Scores at 6 weeks and 3 months in clinical review and postal scores at 9 weeks\n      and 1 year) between patients held in neutral versus current standard rotation. These will be\n      compared to scores taken pre-operatively.\n\n      Benefits:\n\n      There may be no extra benefits to patients from this trial however the results from the\n      trial will help improve treatment for future patients at this hospital, and others across\n      the country.\n\n      Risks/disadvantages:\n\n      The operation is the same in both groups studied, the study is investigating the use of the\n      two different slings. The post-operative treatment is also the same, and all patients on the\n      trial will receive the same amount of physiotherapy. It isn't anticipated that there will be\n      any additional risk from this trial."
