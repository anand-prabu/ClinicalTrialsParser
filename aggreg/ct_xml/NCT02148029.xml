  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite standard care, 25%-50% of patients with clots in the deep veins of the arms and legs
      progress to chronic post-clot problems resulting in significant disability, loss of
      productivity, and healthcare costs. Reverse flow in the veins from an organizing clot is the
      primary cause of post-clot problems. Veins with early clot breakdown have a lower incidence
      of reverse flow. The investigators have observed that clot breakdown is enhanced by
      increased blood flow and that moderate arm and leg exercise result in increased venous blood
      flow. Hence, the investigators predict that a supervised exercise program in patients with
      deep vein clots could increase leg vein blood flow, accelerate clot breakdown, and decrease
      the risk of post clot problems. The primary hypothesis is that increased blood flow across
      the clot (induced by supervised exercise) will increase clot breakdown and decrease severity
      of post clot problems. The investigators are conducting a randomized clinical trial of
      standard therapy compared to progressive exercise training in patients with leg deep vein
      clots.

    <textblock>
      Standard anticoagulation therapy for acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) reflects the current
      short term focus on preventing pulmonary embolism (PE) and recurrent DVT. Despite standard
      care, 25% to 50% of patients with DVT progress to the chronic post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS)
      resulting in significant disability, loss of productivity, and healthcare costs. The
      investigators postulate that a supervised exercise program in patients with acute DVT could
      increase lower extremity venous flow, accelerate thrombus resolution, and thereby decrease
      the risk of PTS. Aim 1 will test whether a 3-month exercise program has long-term clinical
      benefits in acute DVT. The primary outcome measures will be Villalta score for PTS and
      VEINS-QOL score (Venous Insufficiency Epidemiological and Economic Study-QOL) for venous
      quality of life at 2 years of follow-up. Aim 2 will evaluate whether exercise therapy in
      patients with acute DVT enhances thrombus resolution. Aim 3 will assess the relationship
      between PTS, venous hemodynamics and exercise capacity.
