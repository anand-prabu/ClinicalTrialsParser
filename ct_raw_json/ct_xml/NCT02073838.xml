  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study of ribavirin which will be given in combination with vismodegib
      and/or azacytidine. The purpose of this study is to see if patients respond to treatment
      when ribavirin is given with vismodegib alone or in combination with azacytidine.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with AML M4 or M5 FAB subtype or high eIF4E are eligible..

          2. All patients must have failed primary therapy (defined as two induction
             chemotherapies), have relapsed, or are not suitable candidates for intensive
             induction chemotherapy.

          3. Patients who have a dry aspirate or extramedullary disease only are eligible for this
             study if they have a pre-treatment marrow or tissue biopsy demonstrating AML M4 or M5
             subtype or high eIF4E.

          4. ECOG performance status 0, 1, 2 or 3.

          5. Life expectancy &gt; 4 weeks.

          6. Age is &gt; 18 years

          7. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (beta-HCG)
             pregnancy test within 14 days of starting protocol and must not be breastfeeding. Men
             and women of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective means of
             contraception throughout the study and for at least six months after completion of
             protocol.

          8. Adequate renal and hepatic function: serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN; AST or ALT &lt; 2.5 x
             ULN (or &lt; 5 x ULN if liver involvement with leukemia); serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN

          9. Provide written consent after the investigational nature, study design, risks and
             benefits of the study have been explained.

         10. Accessible for treatment and follow up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with low adenosine kinase (ADK) and equilibrative nucleoside transporter
             ENT1.

          2. Uncontrolled central nervous system involvement by AML.

          3. Active cardiovascular disease as defined by New York Heart Association (NYHA) class
             III-IV categorization.

          4. Intercurrent illness or medical condition precluding safe administration of the
             planned protocol treatment or required follow-up.

          5. Received any previous therapy for AML within 28 days prior to the study entry. Hydrea
             is permitted for the treatment of leukocytosis but must be stopped prior to starting
             study drugs.

          6. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          7. Concurrent treatment with other anti-cancer therapy.

          8. Known infection with HIV.

          9. History of other malignancy.  Subjects who have been disease-free for 2 year or
             subjects with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer or
             successfully treated in situ carcinoma are eligible.

         10. FAB AML M1, 2, 6, 7 will be excluded if they do not have high eIF4E expression. AML
             M3 is always excluded.
