The course\n      (vardagsSMART) teach the participants how to use a Smartphone to better organize their\n      everday life and will be compared to a wait list control group (CONT) that later will\n      recieve the same course without guidance from a supervisor(selfSMART). It is hypothesized\n      that VardagsSMART will be superior to CONT on ability to organize everyday life and\n      ADHD-symptoms, and that vardagsSMART will be superior to selfSMART on adherence,\n      understanding and perecived usefullness."

The automation by smartphones of these tasks\n      away from caregivers to the individual is a process that is both time saving and positive\n      for the individuals sense of autonomy.\n\n      There is too little research to date to say with clarity that smartphones is this tool for\n      most of the patient group but many patients with ADHD report that a smartphone system for\n      organisation and remembrance is a key that helps many live a more meaningful life.\n\n      The best way to teach these skills has not yet been proven. There is a clear advantage with\n      teaching courses concerning IT in an online setting since hyperlinks and other texts can be\n      easily forwarded and the course participants can easily use premade calendars and other\n      tools. This research will try to determine if this type of online course is helpful for\n      these patients.\n\n      VardagsSMART is an online course which will be compared to a waiting list controll group\n      (CONT) which weekly records how they manage their ADHD symptoms.\n\n      The main purpose of this study is to examine whether the VardagsSMART course have a positive\n      effect for the patient group. An untreated control group is used to ensure that the effects\n      are not only due to spontaneous improvement. The control group will afterwards be offered\n      the course without therapist support (SelfSMART), in order to make a preliminary evaluation\n      of the importance of therapist support."
