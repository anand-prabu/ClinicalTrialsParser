Exercise may help decrease feelings of\n      being tired caused by cancer, may help improve strength, and may help build up lost muscle\n      tissue. Nutritional intervention plus exercise intervention may be effective at preventing\n      metabolic syndrome."

Assess changes in BMI z-score, waist circumference, body composition, blood pressure\n      exercise tolerance and physical activity at baseline, immediately post intervention and\n      three months later.\n\n      III. Assess changes in serum glucose, insulin, leptin and adiponectin in patients over the\n      intervention course and at 3 months post intervention.\n\n      IV. Assess changes in self-reported quality of life, physical activity, caloric intake, and\n      fatigue associated with the nutrition and exercise program in the participant and their\n      primary caregiver.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\n      ARM I: Patients receive standard of care individualized diet and exercise plan and monthly\n      booster follow-up sessions from the nutritionist and exercise physiologist and weekly phone\n      counseling with a trained health coach to address barriers to improve plan adherence.\n\n      ARM II: Patients receive standard of care individualized diet and exercise plan.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months."
