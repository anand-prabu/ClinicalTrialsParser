Intracranial pressure increased\n      can lead to further structural and functional impairment owing to its deleterious effect on\n      the compromised microcirculation and metabolism. This study was to compare the\n      intra-cerebral pressure (ICP) and hemodynamic parameters between the sustained\n      low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) in post-\n      brain tramatic patients."

We started the study after the hemodynamic stable and\n      acceptable ICP  less than 20mmHg22. The ESRD patients with active brain hemorrhage, cardiac\n      arrhythmia during dialysis, residual urine output, with inotropic equivalent more than 15\n      were excluded.\n\n      All the patients were ventilated in supine position in controlled-volume mode after stable\n      from brain hemorrhage. During data collection, supportive therapies, ventilatory settings\n      and vasopressor therapy were kept unchanged. Patients were randomized to receive CVVH or\n      SLED and the next day on the other.  The ICP monitor was equipped and the indwelling radial\n      artery catheter connected to the FloTrac/Vigileo hemodynamic monitoring system and for whom\n      the ultrafiltration rate was set around 1.0 kg/8hr to 1.5 kg/8hr according to fluid status.\n      Ultrafiltration rate and sodium concentration were fixed during each session.\n\n      Clinical assessment The biochemical parameters were measured using the Toshiba TBA-200FR\n      Clinical Chemistry Analyzer (Toshiba, Tochigi-Ken, Japan). When multiple daily measurements\n      were performed, the data obtained closest to 8:00 AM were analyzed 23. The baseline\n      hemodynamic was defined as average of two hours prior dialysis in each dialysis sessions."
