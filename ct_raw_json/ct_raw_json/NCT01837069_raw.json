OPTIMIZE will be a\n      prospective randomized trial that will enroll patients during pre-surgical testing before\n      orthopedic surgery. This trial will investigate different strategies aimed at lowering\n      cardiovascular events following orthopedic surgery. The study will compare an intensive\n      multifactorial intervention comprising behavioral modification and polypharmacologic therapy\n      aimed at several modifiable risk factors versus usual care. The trial hypothesis is that a\n      personalized optimization approach is superior to usual care in reducing a composite of\n      death, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial necrosis, venous\n      thromboembolism or thrombosis requiring reoperation at 30-days. Secondary endpoints include\n      length of stay, major bleeding, each individual endpoint from the primary endpoint, and\n      quality of life."
