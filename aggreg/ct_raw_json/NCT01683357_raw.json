To\n      this purpose we studied the ratio between the number of patients surgically explored and\n      those who effectively received resection.\n\n      The secondary outcome was the safety of the procedure. To this purpose we studied morbidity,\n      mortality, amount of blood loss, rate of blood transfusions, and postoperative trend of\n      liver function tests.\n\n      The tertiary outcome measure was the reliability of the procedure from an oncological\n      standpoint. For this purpose we studied the following:\n\n        1. the rate of true local recurrence (cut-edge) after a minimum follow-up of 6 months;\n\n        2. the long-term follow-up, analysing the overall survival (survival after surgery), time\n           to recurrence (survival without recurrence), and time to liver recurrence (survival\n           without liver recurrence).\n\n        3. the overall survival compared with that based on an intention-to-treat criterion also\n           including the outcome of those patients who met the inclusion criteria but resulted\n           unresectable on exploration."
