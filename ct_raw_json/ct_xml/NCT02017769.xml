  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We want to study whether  MRI and ultrasound can be useful in diagnosing and monitoring
      patients with CIDP or MMN in maintenance treatment with immunoglobulin
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic inflammatory neuropathies such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating
      polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) can be successfully
      treated with immunoglobulin either intravenously (IVIG) or subcutaneously (SCIG).

      CIDP and MMN are diagnosed by electrophysiology which is time-consuming and unpleasant for
      the patient.

      New techniques suggest that Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and ultrasound imaging can be
      used to detect injuries in the peripheral nerves

      We want to study if MRI and ultrasound is able to detect damages in peripheral nerves, nerve
      roots and plexus in patients with CIDP or MMN.

      Moreover, we want to compare these findings to healthy matched controls and to see if
      treatment with immunoglobulin changes findings in MRI and ultrasound
