A serum pregnancy test was performed on all females at Screening, Day -1\n             of each period, and Day 6 of Period 4 only, or if a subject prematurely discontinued.\n             Results must have been negative in order for study drug to be administered.\n\n          -  Female subject was using, and agreed to continue the use of, a double-barrier method\n             of birth control. Oral, patch, implants, or injectable contraceptives were accepted\n             as 1 method if the subject had been taking them for greater than 2 months at the\n             Screening Visit. Subjects who had a bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or\n             bilateral oophorectomy for a minimum of 6 months, or surgical sterilization of\n             partner (vasectomy for 6 months minimum), or were postmenopausal (defined as the\n             absence of menses for 2 years or the absence of menses for 12 months and\n             follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] level of >40 IU/L) did not require the use of\n             birth control.\n\n          -  Subject had a negative breath test result for H pylori prior to enrollment.\n\n          -  At the Screening Visit, subject had a body mass index (BMI) within the range of 18 to\n             30 kg/m2, as determined by the following calculation.\n\n          -  Subject was in general good health as evidenced by a medical history, a complete\n             physical examination, and ECG without clinically significant abnormalities.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Subject had current evidence of cardiovascular, central nervous system, hepatic,\n             hematopoietic, renal, or metabolic dysfunction; serious allergy, asthma, history of\n             significant sensitivity to any drug; or lactose intolerance that would contraindicate\n             taking ilaprazole or esomeprazole or would interfere with the conduct of the study."
