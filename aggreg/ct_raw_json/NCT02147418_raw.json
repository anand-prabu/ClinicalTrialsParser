A central\n      problem in the early diagnosis of HPV-OPSCC is the relative inaccessibility of the tonsillar\n      crypts, where oncogenic infections are thought to originate. Unlike the relatively smooth\n      surface of the cervix which permits mechanical sampling with Pap tests and which can be\n      evaluated visually for evidence of dysplasia, much of the tonsillar epithelium is found\n      below the surface in a complex network. As a consequence, any screening modality cannot\n      depend upon direct access to malignant lesions.  What is needed is a minimally invasive,\n      diffusible or circulating marker of HPV-OPSCC, and a means to collect and detect it."
