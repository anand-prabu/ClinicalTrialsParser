  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency anaemia is common in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), affecting at least
      20% patients at any one time. Hepcidin, a recently described anti-microbial peptide
      synthesized by the liver, is a key regulator of iron homeostasis. It interferes with
      absorption of iron into enterocytes, macrophages and hepatocytes by binding to ferroportin.
      Hepcidin levels rise when total body iron levels rise and protect against iron overload;
      conversely, in iron deficiency, levels are low.  Hepcidin levels also rise under the
      influence of interleukins (IL)-6 and -1, a factor likely to contribute to iron deficient
      erythropoesis in active IBD. Whether hepcidin levels predict resistance to oral iron therapy
      in IBD is unknown, though it may impair its immediate oral absorption. Adult IBD patients
      who are anaemic report quality of life and fatigue scores comparable to those seen in
      malignancy.

      IBD diagnosed in adolescence interferes with growth, education and employment as well as
      psychosocial and sexual development.  Not surprisingly, adolescents with IBD have a high
      prevalence of psychological distress, particular depression. Limited historical, and our own
      data suggest that children and adolescents with IBD are more anaemic than adults, and less
      often treated with oral iron. What is not clear is whether the apparent under-utilisation of
      oral iron in paediatric care is because of a perceived lack of benefit or doctors' concerns
      about possible side effects including worsening disease activity.

      To address these questions, the investigators propose a comparative study of 6 weeks of oral
      iron supplementation in adolescents and adults with iron deficiency anaemia in IBD.
      Patients will be given oral iron supplementation. Before and after iron therapy, the
      investigators shall assess haemoglobin concentrations; IBD activity; quality of life (QOL),
      perceived stress, mood and fatigue; iron metabolism, including serum hepcidin.
