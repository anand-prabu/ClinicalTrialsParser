    <textblock>
      This project will test Attention Bias Modification Training (ABMT) among children and
      adolescents who have completed a full protocol of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for
      anxiety and still meet criteria for a primary diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. The purpose
      of this project is to determine whether ABMT leads to reductions in anxiety and related
      impairment, relative to a placebo task condition.
