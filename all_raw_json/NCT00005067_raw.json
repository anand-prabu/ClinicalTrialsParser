This may be effective treatment for locally recurrent prostate cancer.\n      Photosensitizing drugs, such as lutetium texaphyrin, are absorbed by cancer cells and, when\n      exposed to light, become active and kill the cancer cells"

Determine the dose limiting toxicities and maximum tolerated dose of photodynamic therapy\n      (PDT) using 730 nm light and lutetium texaphyrin in patients with locally recurrent prostate\n      adenocarcinoma who have failed previous definitive radiotherapy.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. Measure lutetium texaphyrin levels in needle biopsies of the prostate before and after\n      PDT using an HPLC and tissue fluorescence assay and calculate the percent change in lutetium\n      texaphyrin after treatment.\n\n      II. Measure lutetium texaphyrin fluorescence in situ in the prostate before and after PDT\n      using optical methods and correlate these results with the direct tissue measurements made\n      in the biopsies of these patients.\n\n      III. Determine clinical outcome including clinical response, progression free survival, time\n      to complete response, time to biochemical relapse, time to local progression, time to\n      distant failure, overall survival, and disease specific survival in these patients treated\n      with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lutetium texaphyrin and light fluence.\n\n      Patients receive lutetium texaphyrin IV over 10-15 minutes 3-24 hours before photodynamic\n      therapy (PDT). Optical fibers attached to a laser are inserted through a catheter into the\n      prostate. The laser delivers 730 nm light to the prostate until the specified fluence is\n      delivered. Patients undergo biopsy of the prostate and bladder before and after PDT. Cohorts\n      of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of lutetium texaphyrin and light fluence until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at\n      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, then every 3 months until 2\n      years, then every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
