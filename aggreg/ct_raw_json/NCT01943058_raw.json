To compare both the side effect profiles, such as weight gain and mood changes as well as\n      compliance with assigned treatment between the 2 treatment arms.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To describe fertility-related outcomes, ovulation, menstrual pattern and fertility\n      abnormalities determined during usual workup (e.g., semen analysis), pregnancy and delivery\n      within 18-months of treatment.\n\n      II. To characterize the incidence of endocrine comorbidities (e.g., hypothyroidism,\n      polycystic ovarian syndrome, and diabetes).\n\n      III. To characterize the association of levels of endoplasmic reticular (ER) stress and\n      protein kinase B (Akt)-activation in endometrial samples with clinicopathologic-response to\n      Progestin (therapeutic progesterone) therapy.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM A: Patients receive megestrol acetate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for up to 18 months\n      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      ARM B: Patients receive levonorgestrel-releasing IUS with continuous release for up to 18\n      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months."
