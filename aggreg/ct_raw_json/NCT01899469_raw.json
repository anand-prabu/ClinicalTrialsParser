Methods:\n      Subjects have been divided into 2 groups: TENS and Back School or Electromagnetic therapy\n      and Back School. They have received 20 sessions of treatment. Treatment efficacy was\n      evaluated at the end of treatment, in terms of pain, measured with the Visual Analogue\n      Scale. Anthropometric and physical activity variables have been collected from the clinical\n      story and with physical activity fast sorter."
