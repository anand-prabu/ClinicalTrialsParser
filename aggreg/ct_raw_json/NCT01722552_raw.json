Patients whose mean adherence in the previous month was <95% will be required to have a counseling session, while those with higher adherence will be given the option to have a counseling session."

The study will\n      involve: assessing the feasibility and acceptability of using real-time feedback, a wireless\n      technology-updated adaptation of an approach the investigators found to be feasible and\n      effective in China, to promote ART adherence among Chinese patients, including IDU;\n      generating preliminary effectiveness data of real-time feedback on adherence, CD4 count, and\n      HIV viral load; and identifying the factors that explain how real-time feedback influences\n      intervention success or failure.\n\n      The specific aims of the study are:\n\n      SA1: Determine the feasibility and acceptability of using real-time feedback, a wireless\n      technology-updated adaptation of an approach we found to be feasible and effective in China,\n      to promote ART adherence among Chinese patients. The investigators will conduct a pilot RCT\n      of the real-time feedback intervention among Chinese patients in order to assess its\n      feasibility and acceptability in this population.\n\n      SA2: Generate preliminary effectiveness data of real-time feedback on adherence, CD4 count,\n      and HIV viral load. The RCT will allow the researchers to generate rigorous estimates of\n      effect sizes on these important endpoints.\n\n      SA3: Describe the factors that explain how real-time feedback influences intervention\n      success or failure. The investigators will use a quantitative-qualitative mixed-methods\n      research approach to explore how the intervention influences the experience of adherence\n      support in this patient population."

Enrolled patients will be randomized to intervention vs.\n      comparison group for the 6-month intervention. The study will follow all patients for an\n      additional 3 months to determine sustainability of intervention impact. In addition to\n      adherence and clinical data, quantitative and qualitative data will be collected using\n      survey instruments, focus groups, and in-depth interviews. Analysis of these data will\n      enable achievement of the specific aims and contribute to the scientific evidence base on\n      effective approaches to promoting ART adherence among IDU and other patients."
