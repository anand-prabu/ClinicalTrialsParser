Specifically, the effects of the three anesthetic\n      techniques when used intraoperatively as a sole anesthesia modality were studied on\n      postoperative pain, time-to-first pain, analgesic consumption, fast-tracked PACU bypass\n      rate, length of PACU stay, time-to-discharge home, sleep duration, and related adverse\n      effects. The investigators hypothesized that CISB results in a superior postoperative\n      recovery profile as compared to SISB or GA alone."

We\n      undertook this randomized trial to compare the recovery profile of patients receiving SISB,\n      CISB or GA for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair surgery through the first postoperative\n      week. Our primary hypothesis was that highest NRS pain rating (worst pain score) at the end\n      of the study week is lower for patients in the CISB group than for patients in the SISB or\n      GA groups.\n\n      Methods After Institutional Review Board approval and informed consents were obtained, 71\n      patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-III, \u226518 years of\n      age, and BMI\u226435 kg/m2, scheduled for elective outpatient arthroscopic rotator cuff repair,\n      were enrolled. CISB patients received 20 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine as bolus through the\n      catheter whereas SISB patients received the same volume of injection through a needle. CISB\n      patients received an infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine at 5mL/h with a patient controlled bolus\n      of 5 mL hourly. GA only patients received a standardized general anesthetic. All patients\n      were prescribed acetaminophen (500mg) with hydrocodone (7.5mg) every 4h as needed. CISB was\n      discontinued 48 h after surgery. Postoperative highest pain scores (NRS) through the first\n      postoperative week, time-to-first pain, analgesic consumption, fast-tracked postoperative\n      care unit (PACU) bypass rate, length of PACU stay, time-to-discharge home, sleep duration,\n      and related adverse effects were recorded in the PACU and at home on postoperative days 1,\n      2, 3, and 7."
