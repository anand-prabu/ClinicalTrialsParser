These include, but are not limited to the\n      following clinical syndromes: Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy; myoclonic epilepsy and\n      ragged-red fibers (MERFF); mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like\n      syndrome (MELAS); Kearn-Sayre syndrome; subacute necrotizing encephalopathy (Leigh\n      Syndrome); POLG-related disorders (Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome, Autosomal Dominant\n      Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia, Autosomal Recessive Progressive External\n      Ophthalmoplegia, Childhood Myocerebrohepatopathy Spectrum Disorders, Myoclonic Epilepsy\n      Myopathy Sensory Ataxia, POLG-Related Ataxia Neuropathy Spectrum Disorders); Mitochondrial\n      neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome (MNGIE), also called myoneurogastrointestinal\n      encephalopathy syndrome or POLIP syndrome; others, e.g., mitochondrial cardiomyopathies and\n      other syndromes due to multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions.\n\n      Screening eligibility criteria for each subject will be reviewed by participating\n      Investigators and Raptor's medical officer, in an attempt An effort to ensure at least 2/3\n      of the enrolled subjects have Leigh Syndrome (i.e., patients with Leigh Syndrome clinical\n      presentation, genetically confirmed by known Leigh Syndrome mutations and no variants of\n      uncertain significance).\n\n      Initially, up to 32 patients will be enrolled if there is no toxicity up to the level of 1.3\n      g/m2/day of RP103.  After the two interim analyses planned to occur after 12 and then 24\n      subjects complete Week 24, sample size may be decreased to 24 or increased to a maximum of\n      64 subjects.\n\n      The rationale for choosing patients with inherited mitochondrial disease who are age 2 and\n      older is based on available clinical data collected in previous and current RP103 studies in\n      other indications, in subjects aged 2 years and older."
