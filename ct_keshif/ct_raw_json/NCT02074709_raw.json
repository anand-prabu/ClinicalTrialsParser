The remaining aspect of perioperative care,\n      including the general anesthetic technique, postoperative care will be standardized and will\n      be similar for all patients. The duration of the involvement in the study will be until 48\n      hours postoperatively.  The pre-anesthesia care unit personnel will identify patients during\n      their preoperative clinic visit.\n\n      Patients in Group 1 will receive ultrasound-guided bilateral TAP block at the end of the\n      surgery. Patients in Group 2 will receive Exparel prior to closing the incision which will\n      be injected subfascially and subcutaneously. In the first 24-h postoperative period,\n      patients in both Groups will receive acetaminophen 1000 mg every 6 h orally, ketorolac 30\n      mg, IV every 6 h, orally and morphine via an intravenous patient controlled analgesia\n      (IV-PCA) system to maintain adequate pain control. In the 24-48 h study period, all patients\n      will receive oral ibuprofen 800 mg and acetaminophen 1000 mg three times a day and a\n      combination of hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5mg/ 325 mg 1-2 tablets, as needed.\n\n      The postoperative analgesia will be documented using the visual analog score (0=no pain,\n      10=worst pain). In addition, total opioid dose over the 48-h study period will be\n      documented. Postoperative nausea will be measured using a categorical scoring system\n      (none=0, mild=1, moderate=2, severe=3) and episodes of vomiting will be documented. Rescue\n      antiemetics will be given to any patient who complains of nausea and/or vomiting.\n\n      All variables will be assessed at 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours, postoperatively by an\n      investigator blinded to group allocation."
