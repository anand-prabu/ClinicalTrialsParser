Participants in Arm A and Arm B\n      will also receive matching placebo to etanercept once weekly through study Week 28. At study\n      Week 12, Arm C participants will be re-randomized to receive their first dose of MK-3222 200\n      mg or MK-3222 100 mg, and will receive additional doses of study medication according to\n      their re-randomized treatment assignment at Week 16. Participants in Arm C will also receive\n      matching placebo to etanercept through treatment Week 28. Participants in Arm D will\n      continue with once weekly doses of etanercept through study Week 28 in combination with\n      matching placebo to MK-3222.\n\n      In Part 3 of the base study (Week 28 to Week 52), participants in Arm A with >= PASI-75\n      response at Week 28 will be re-randomized to either continue MK-3222 200 mg or receive\n      MK-3222 100 mg at study Weeks 28, 40, and 52. Participants with >= Psoriasis Area\n      Sensitivity Index of 50% (PASI-50) response but < PASI 75% (PASI-75) response will continue\n      to receive MK-3222 200 mg every 12 weeks and those participants with < PASI-50 response will\n      be discontinued from the study. Participants in Arm B with >= PASI-75 response at Week 28\n      will continue to receive MK-3222 100 mg every 12 weeks.
