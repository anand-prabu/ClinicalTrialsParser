Increasing caloric intake fails to consistently restore lean tissue patients with\n      HIV associated weight loss. Megestrol acetate has been shown to stimulate appetite and\n      weight gain in subjects with cancer and in those with HIV associated weight loss. However,\n      the weight gained during treatment with megestrol acetate was predominantly or exclusively\n      fat. An important factor is the preferential increase in body fat seen in both of these\n      studies may have been due to hypogonadism that occurs as a result of treatment with\n      megestrol acetate, a progestational agent. Hypogonadism is associated with an increase in\n      body fat and a decrease in LBM. Concomitant testosterone replacement should  substantially\n      increase the amount of LBM accrued during megestrol acetate therapy. This study will\n      determine whether anabolic potential can be realized when caloric intake is increased in the\n      absence of concomitant hypogonadism."
