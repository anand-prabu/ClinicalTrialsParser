Dynamic preload dependence indicators are well validated\n      during surgery in supine position. Positioning from supine to sitting position under\n      anesthesia is responsible of several hemodynamic changes. Predictability and cut-off values\n      of dynamic preload dependence indicators during surgery in sitting position are unknown. The\n      objective of this prospective study is to evaluate ability of three dynamic preload\n      dependence indicators, i.e. PPV (Pulse Pressure Variation), SVV (Stroke Volume Variation)\n      and PVI (Plethysmographic Variability Index), during neurosurgery in sitting position."
