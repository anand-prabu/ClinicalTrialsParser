      To determine the diagnostic performance of FFRCT by coronary computed tomographic
      angiography (cCTA), as compared to cCTA alone, for non-invasive determination of the
      presence of a hemodynamically significant coronary lesion, using direct measurement of
      fractional flow reserve (FFR) during cardiac catheterization as a reference standard.

      Recently, coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (cCTA) of 64-detector rows or greater has
      emerged as a novel non-invasive imaging modality that is capable of providing
      high-resolution images of coronary artery lesions (Budoff 2008; Miller 2008; Meijboom 2008).
       While cCTA demonstrates good diagnostic performance for detection and exclusion of anatomic
      coronary artery stenoses, numerous prior studies have revealed an unreliable relationship
      between detection of obstructive anatomic coronary artery stenoses by cCTA and
      hemodynamically (HD)-significant coronary artery disease (CAD), identified by myocardial
      perfusion SPECT or fractional flow reserve (FFR) (Di Carli 2007; Klauss 2007; Rispler 2007;
      van Werkhoven 2009). Individual subjects may have HD-significant CAD despite cCTA assessment
      demonstrating angiographically mild (&lt;50%) maximal stenosis (Schuijf 2006).  These findings
      emphasize the need for additional measures beyond anatomic stenosis severity for the
      detection and exclusion of HD-significant CAD.

      Measurement of FFR during invasive cardiac catheterization represents the &quot;gold standard&quot;
      for assessment of the hemodynamic significance of coronary artery lesions (Kern 2010).
      Anatomic coronary artery stenosis assessment by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) also
      correlates very poorly with FFR Melikian 2010). This was highlighted by the results of the
      FAME study in which FFR-guided coronary revascularization improved healthcare and economic
      outcomes compared to the conventional angiographically guided strategy (Pijls 2010; Tonino
      2009; Tonino 2010).

      The major disadvantage of FFR is that it has to be measured invasively. HeartFlow, Inc.
      ('HeartFlow') has recently developed a non-invasive method to determine FFR which computes
      the hemodynamic significance of CAD (FFRCT) from subject-specific cCTA data using
      computational fluid dynamics under rest and simulated maximal coronary hyperemic conditions.
       Preliminary results in subjects suggest that FFRCT accurately predicts the hemodynamic
      significance of coronary lesions when compared to directly-measured FFR during invasive
      cardiac catheterization (Koo 2011).

    <description>The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC of ROC) of a patient-based model intended to detect hemodynamically significant obstruction. FFR is used as the reference standard to determine the presence or absence of hemodynamically significant obstruction. cCTA stenosis will be calculated for each patient as the highest cCTA stenosis category for any vessel segment with diameter ≥2.0 mm. Only subjects with maximum cCTA stenosis in the range of 30 to 90% (as determined by the investigative site) in one or more vessel segments with diameter ≥2.0 mm will be included in the primary analysis.</description>
