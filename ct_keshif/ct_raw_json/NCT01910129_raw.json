The patient is diagnosed with epilepsy with; primary generalized tonic-clonic or\n             partial complex or simple complex or focal onset seizures, with or without secondary\n             generalization.\n\n          2. The patient's present antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy is ineffective or intolerable\n\n          3. The patient is receiving a stable dose of up to 2 oral AED medication(s) and is not\n             expected to have any change in his/her baseline AED treatment during the treatment\n             period.\n\n          4. The patient is having more than 2 recordable seizures a month.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. The patient has had status epilepticus within the last six months.\n\n          2. The patient has had epilepsy surgery or a VNS implant.\n\n          3. The patient has had a history or presence of seizures occurring only in clusters (too\n             frequently or indistinctly separated to be reliably counted).\n\n          4. The patient has had 4 weeks continuous seizure freedom last 2 months.\n\n          5. The patient has psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) seizures.\n\n          6. The patient has a concomitant progressive CNS disease including progressive myoclonus\n             epilepsy.\n\n          7. The patient has a significant history of cardiac, renal, neurologic (other than\n             epilepsy), psychiatric, oncologic, endocrinologic, metabolic, or hepatic disease,\n             which would adversely affect their participation in this study.\n\n          8. The patient has had an episode of status epilepticus within 4 weeks of Screening.\n\n        10. Has a lesion (including lymphadenopathy), dysaesthesia, previous surgery or abnormal\n        anatomy at the GammaCore treatment site.\n\n        11. Has known or suspected severe atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, severe carotid\n        artery disease (e.g. bruits or history of TIA or CVA), congestive heart failure (CHF),\n        known severe coronary artery disease or recent myocardial infarction.\n\n        12. Has an abnormal baseline ECG (e.g. second and third degree heart block, atrial\n        fibrillation, atrial flutter, recent history of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular\n        fibrillation, or clinically significant premature ventricular contraction).\n\n        13. Has had a previous bilateral, right, or left cervical vagotomy. 14. Has uncontrolled\n        high blood pressure. 15. Is currently implanted with an electrical and/or neurostimulator\n        device, including but not limited to cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator, vagal\n        neurostimulator, deep brain stimulator, spinal stimulator, bone growth stimulator, or\n        cochlear implant.\n\n        16. Has a history of carotid endarterectomy or vascular neck surgery on the right side.\n\n        17. Has been implanted with metal cervical spine hardware or has a metallic implant near\n        the GammaCore stimulation site.\n\n        18. Has a recent or repeated history of syncope. 19. Has a known history or suspicion of\n        substance abuse or addiction. 20. In the opinion of the investigator/research staff the\n        subject is incapable of operating the GammaCore device as intended and performing the data\n        collection procedures.\n\n        21. Is pregnant, nursing, thinking of becoming pregnant in the next 9 months, or of\n        childbearing years and is unwilling to use an accepted form of birth control."
