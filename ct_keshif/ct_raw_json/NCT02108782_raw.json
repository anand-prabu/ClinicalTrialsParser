To determine the safety of dovitinib in patients with progressive well-differentiated\n      PNETs.\n\n      II. To evaluate time to treatment failure, time to progression, and overall survival.\n\n      III. To evaluate radiographic and biochemical response rates.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To assess the pharmacodynamic effect of dovitinib on plasma biomarkers by measuring\n      concentrations of circulating growth factors and soluble receptors (e.g. basic fibroblast\n      growth factor [bFGF], VEGF, placental growth factor [PLGF], soluble VEGF receptor 1\n      (sVEGFR1) and 2, collagen IV, fibroblast growth factor 23 [FGF23]).\n\n      II. Archival tissue collected from patients prior to registration will be banked to later\n      analyze baseline expression of potential biomarkers (e.g., bFGF, FGFR).\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive dovitinib lactate orally (PO) on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, and 22-26. Courses\n      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 6 months,\n      every 3 months for 6 months, and then periodically for 2 years."
