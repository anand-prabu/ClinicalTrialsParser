  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to identify new virulence factors produced by Staphylococcus
      lugdunensis that can be associated with clinical sign of severe infections and identified
      symptoms. The methodological approach is based on the comparison between the production of
      toxins by a given S. lugdunensis isolate classified in patients groups according to the
      infection clinically defined. Each group will be compared to the presence or not of studied
      virulence factors. Clinical features associated with toxin activity are not known for S.
      lugdunensis. This comparative approach is based on the hypotheses that drove to the
      definition of patient groups and their clinical criteria. However, in the absence of the
      evident correlation between production of toxins and kind of infection, the statistical
      evaluation will be completed by a multi-varied analysis. This approach has not been choosen
      first because of the multiple parameters that undergo during infection that may reveal
      relationships without true correlation. About the number of included patients in each
      defined group, if one of them does not reach the expected count, we still might extend
      inclusions to 3-6 months more. The presence of severe infections without usually defined
      risk is intriguing. For these last patients, we have planned, after their individual consent
      to achieve an exome sequencing. The obtained data will be compared to available resources
      for the human genome. By filtering data through usual protocols, we hope to able to focus
      onto few genes that evoke specific sensitivity to infections, e.g. severe endocarditis due
      to S. lugdunensis without defined risk.
