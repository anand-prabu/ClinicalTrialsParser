Red yeast rice (RYR), is a reddish-purple fermented rice, containing\n      statins which are known to inhibit cholesterol synthesis.  Laboratory studies have also\n      shown that RYR has direct effects on androgen dependent and androgen independent prostate\n      cancer cells, inhibiting their growth.  It is thought that RYR may have clinical benefit in\n      those subjects with localized prostate cancer who have chosen to be managed by active\n      surveillance."

There is a strong\n      rationale for the use of RYR in patients being managed with active surveillance for\n      localized, low risk, prostate cancer.
