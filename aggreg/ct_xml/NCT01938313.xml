  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programs have been introduced with purposes of
      reducing the surgical stress response and obtaining optimal recovery after surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is strong evidence of the usefulness of the ERAS programs in patients undergoing
      colorectal surgery in terms of significantly reduced postoperative complications and shorter
      length of hospital stay, compared to the patients of conventional treatment.

      However, few studies exist about the implication of ERAS programs in the laparoscopic
      gastrectomy.

      The aim of this study was to compare the recovery rate, morbidity, and quality of life in
      the patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer,  receiving either ERAS
      protocol or conventional postoperative cares.
