Epidemiological studies of kidney allograft\n      recipients can aid in the understanding of cause and effect of health and disease\n      post-transplantation. The combination of health care and information technology has made the\n      potential of transplant professionals to use health information effectively crucial to guide\n      kidney transplant management. The aim of this study is to undertake an observational cohort\n      study of kidney allograft recipients, supported by linking analysis across different\n      database sources, to provide a comprehensive biomedical dataset of information."
