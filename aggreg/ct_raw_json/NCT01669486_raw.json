Each items has been\n      evaluated in three different moments: before, during and after the nurses' care.\n\n      The investigators compare the scales between them. Then, every time the investigators value\n      the score of these scales with the self-report of patients with the VAS scale (when it is\n      possible) and finally with  the physiological parameters (blood pressure, heart rate and\n      respiratory rate).\n\n      In the end, the investigators compare two different classes of patient: the surgical and\n      medical one. The investigators search for some differences in the perception of the pain\n      between these two classes."
