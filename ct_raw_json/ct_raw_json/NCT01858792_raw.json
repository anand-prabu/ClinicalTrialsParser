Each of these Phase III studies achieved statistical significance for belimumab 10\n      mg/kg on the pre-specified primary endpoint of SRI response at Week 52; therefore, these\n      nearly identical studies provide independent replication of results.  While pooling is not\n      necessary to establish the effectiveness of belimumab, it was considered appropriate in\n      order to evaluate treatment effects in the high disease activity subgroup of interest, given\n      that the individual studies were not designed to provide sufficient power to demonstrate\n      effectiveness within subgroups.  Thus, statistical evaluation pooling the studies and\n      testing for a treatment-by-study interaction was undertaken.  A significant\n      treatment-by-study interaction would indicate that the relative treatment differences were\n      statistically different in the two studies and pooling would not be justified.  Conversely,\n      the lack of a treatment-by-study interaction would indicate the studies resulted in a\n      similar treatment response and pooling would be justified.\n\n      When the two Phase III studies were pooled for the SRI analysis, the treatment-by-study\n      interaction was >0.5.  Likewise, for the target population of high disease activity, the\n      treatment-by-study interaction was >0.7 suggesting that the high disease activity subgroup\n      may be more homogenous and therefore have a more similar treatment effect between the\n      studies than the population as a whole.\n\n      Given these considerations, it is reasonable and valid to pool the two studies and allows\n      better precision for evaluation of subgroups."
