  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pharmacokinetic study to determine the safety and tolerability of pregabalin in
      healthy lactating women. The objectives are to determine whether pregabalin is secreted in
      breast milk and if so, to characterize pregabalin pharmacokinetics in breast milk. Other
      objectives are to estimate potential infant exposure to pregabalin if administered to
      lactating women and to characterize the safety and tolerability of pregabalin in lactating
      women.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy lactating females between the ages of 18 and 45 years (inclusive) who are
             actively breast-feeding or expressing breast milk and are at least 12 weeks post
             partum.

          -  Subjects must be willing to temporarily discontinue breast feeding their infants
             before the Day 1 evening dose through to 42 hours after the last dose

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of significant adverse reaction to pregabalin or gabapentin.

          -  Subjects pregnant or unwilling or unable to comply with the Lifestyle guidelines
             presented in the protocol during the study period and through the follow-up visit.

          -  Subjects with evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal,
             endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric
             (including post natal depression), neurologic or allergic disease (including drug
             allergies, but excluding untreated asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of
             dosing).
