In  western  countries,  the  prevalence  of  NAFLD  in  the  general\n      population  is estimated to be 20-30%; in obese populations, this increases to 57.5-74%.\n      But, it hasn`t been clearly elucidated yet regarding the underlying disease pathophysiology\n      and treatmet strategy.\n\n      Recently, members of the C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein (CTRP) family have been\n      reported to share structural homology with adiponectin. To date, 15 CTRP family members have\n      been found that might play major roles in glucose metabolism and inflammation.\n\n      The investigators tried to clarify the relationship between CTRP family and NAFLD in Korean\n      men and women."
