Exercise training in a structured pulmonary rehabilitation program\n      can generate substantial gains in functional capacity, but increases in functional capacity\n      do not necessarily lead to improvements in daily PA. The proposed study will examine the\n      effects of a lifestyle physical activity intervention designed to increase PA in people with\n      moderate and severe COPD. The intervention includes a combination of (a) structured\n      laboratory-based exercises with a self-efficacy enhancing intervention, (b) structured\n      home-based exercises and (c) lifestyle physical activities performed at home. The\n      intervention gradually transitions subjects from the structured laboratory-based exercises\n      that focus on walking and circuit training to fully integrated lifestyle physical activities\n      that integrate structured home-based exercises and lifestyle physical activities into daily\n      life. Ideally the laboratory-based component would be as short as possible to facilitate the\n      application of this intervention in the clinical setting. The purpose of this preliminary\n      study is to compare the effects of a program that includes either one-month or two-months of\n      structured lab-based training and subjects will be followed for a total of 18 weeks."
