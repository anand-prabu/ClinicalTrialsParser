The\n      pilot study will use a mixed-methods approach to intervention evaluation. Self-report and\n      observed quantitative data for intervention and control groups will be collected at pre-test\n      and post-test evaluation. Primary outcomes will include parent-reports and observations of\n      child behavior problems. In addition, as an exploratory study, this phase will examine\n      initial pre-post intervention effects for potential mediating factors of parenting behavior,\n      parental stress, parental depression, and perceived social support. However, this phase will\n      not test mediation effects due to small sample sizes. Quantitative assessments will also\n      collect data on program fidelity, exposure/adherence, participant engagement, and\n      satisfaction. Furthermore, qualitative focus groups with intervention participants and group\n      leaders will examine issues of program feasibility, content, deliver, and satisfaction.\n      Randomization will be done on an individual level and include a wait-list control group that\n      will receive the intervention 3 months after the post-test evaluation. Results from the\n      feasibility pilot study will be shared with intervention partners and advisory groups. If\n      necessary, final program adjustments will be made prior to further testing. Results will\n      also be disseminated to community forums, local organizations, government stakeholders, and\n      via academic conferences.\n\n      Research hypotheses:\n\n      Hypothesis 1: Children in the intervention group will demonstrate reduced observed and\n      parent-reported child behavior problems in comparison to the control group.\n\n      Hypothesis 2: Parents in the intervention group will demonstrate increased observed and\n      self-reported positive parenting outcomes and decreased observed and self-reported harsh and\n      inconsistent parenting outcomes in comparison to the control group.\n\n      Hypothesis 3: Parents in the intervention group will demonstrate decreased parental\n      depression and parental stress outcomes and increased perceived social support outcomes in\n      comparison to the control group.\n\n      Hypothesis 4: The Sinovuyo Caring Families Program will be implemented with an acceptable\n      degree of program fidelity, exposure/adherence, and participant satisfaction."
