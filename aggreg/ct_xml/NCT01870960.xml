  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main problem of using xenogenic bone in sinus floor elevation is the slow rate of
      absorption, which gives the percentages of vital bone low (20 to 30% depending on the study)
      in which the dental implant will be positioned However, osseointegration of the implant can
      be achieved only in vital bone. Enamel Matrix Derivative, through their angiogenic and
      osteogenic properties known, could promote bone healing during surgery sinus floor elevation
      by increasing the percentage of vital bone reformed, when added to xenografts.
