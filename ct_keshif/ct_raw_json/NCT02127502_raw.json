The primary purpose of the study is to\n      validate SeptiCyte\u00ae Lab in this population as compared to: 1) the doctor's impression and 2)\n      an existing blood test, procalcitonin. The investigators also hope to assess how well a\n      related, new blood test, SeptID\u00ae identifies different types of infection, as compared to\n      cultures and other lab tests."
