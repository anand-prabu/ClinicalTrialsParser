  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet the following criteria to be eligible to participate:

          1. Healthy adult females, ≥ 18 and ≤ 35 years of age.  &quot;Healthy&quot; shall be defined by the
             absence of any illness, acute or chronic, that requires ongoing systemic therapy for
             the control of symptoms or prevention of disability.

               -  Subjects on stable (no change in ≥ 3 months) therapy for findings (e.g.,
                  hypertension or hyperlipidemia) that are not associated with symptoms or
                  disability are eligible, as are users of hormonal contraceptives.

               -  Subjects who receive intermittent prophylaxis for risks associated with
                  asymptomatic findings (e.g., antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental procedures
                  in a subject with mitral valve prolapse) are eligible.

               -  Ongoing therapy will be defined as continuous or, if intermittent, more frequent
                  than once every 3 months (e.g., use of an inhaled bronchodilator for
                  exercise-induced bronchospasm more than once every 3 months).
                  Immunosuppressives are subject to exclusion criterion #5 below.

               -  Persons being treated for illnesses or conditions that would become acutely
                  symptomatic or disabling in the absence of treatment are not eligible.

          2. Willing and able to give informed consent prior to study enrollment.

          3. Able to comply with study requirements.

          4. Women who are not surgically sterile must have a negative urine pregnancy test prior
             to each vaccination; will be advised through the Informed Consent process to avoid
             becoming pregnant over the duration of the study, and must assert that they will
             employ an effective form of birth control for the duration of the study. Acceptable
             forms of birth control are: credible history of continuous abstinence from
             heterosexual activity, hormonal contraceptives (oral, injectable, implant, patch,
             ring), double-barrier contraceptives (condom or diaphragm, with spermicide), and IUD.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded if they fulfill any of the following criteria:

          1. Participation in research involving investigational product (drug / biologic /
             device) within 45 days before planned date of first vaccination.

          2. History of a serious reaction to any prior vaccination.

          3. Received any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the study vaccination; or any RSV
             vaccine at any time.

          4. Any known or suspected immunosuppressive condition, acquired or congenital, as
             determined by history and/or physical examination.

          5. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 continuous days) of
             immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within 6 months prior to the
             administration of the study vaccine. An immunosuppressant dose of glucocorticoid will
             be defined as a systemic dose ≥10mg of prednisone per day or equivalent. The use of
             topical, inhaled, and nasal glucocorticoids will be permitted.

          6. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months
             preceding the administration of the study vaccine or during the study.

          7. Donated blood within 3 weeks of the planned date of first vaccination.

          8. Acute disease at the time of enrollment (defined as the presence of a moderate or
             severe illness with or without fever, or an oral temperature &gt;38.0°C on the planned
             day of vaccine administration).

          9. Known disturbance of coagulation.

         10. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or plan to become pregnant during the study.

         11. Suspicion or recent history (within one year of planned vaccination) of alcohol or
             other substance abuse.

         12. Any condition that in the opinion of the Investigator would pose a health risk to the
             subject if enrolled or could interfere with evaluation of the vaccine or
             interpretation of study results (including neurologic or psychiatric conditions
             deemed likely to impair the quality of safety reporting).
