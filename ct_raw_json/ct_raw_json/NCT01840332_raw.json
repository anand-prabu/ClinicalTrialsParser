In the follow-up of patients it is necessary to induce TSH elevation\n      for the measurement of thyreoglobulin and/or total body scanning. There are two principal\n      methods to obtain TSH elevation: 1) injection of recombinant human TSH , and 2)  to stop\n      L-thyroxin replacement for several (3-4) weeks. As use of recombinant TSH is rather\n      expensive, this method is not feasible in many countries. The problem with stopping\n      L-thyroxin is development of severe hypothyroidism for several weeks with concomitant\n      symptoms and signs.\n\n      Current pilot study aims to induce the necessary  TSH elevation by decreasing the L-thyroxin\n      dose. The main hypothesis is that necessary TSH stimulation will be achieved during 4-6\n      weeks in majority of patients with fixed dose of L-thyroxin. Concomitantly, blood tests and\n      symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism will be obtained to get information about possible\n      deviations during treatment with low dose of thyroxin."
