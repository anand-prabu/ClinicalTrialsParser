Establish whether changes between baseline and 2-month post androgen\n      suppression endorectal coil MRI results predict for biochemical control following\n      radiotherapy with androgen suppression in patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients undergo a baseline endorectal coil MRI, followed by total androgen\n      suppression (TAS) with either leuprolide IM or subcutaneous goserelin once a month plus oral\n      flutamide 3 times a day for 2 months. Patients then receive a second endorectal coil MRI,\n      followed by 2 months of external-beam radiotherapy plus TAS. Patients may receive an\n      additional 2 months of TAS at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients are\n      followed every 6 months for 3 years, then yearly thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 180 patients (approximately 60 per year) will be accrued\n      for this study over a 34 months."
