            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether epoetin alfa treatment improves the quality of life in\n      anemic patients who are undergoing chemotherapy for advanced malignancy. II. Determine\n      whether epoetin alfa increases hemoglobin levels and decreases transfusion requirements in\n      these patients. III. Validate or refute the use of an algorithm using pre- and posttreatment\n      epoetin alfa, ferritin, and hemoglobin levels to predict 16 weeks response or no response to\n      therapeutic doses of epoetin alfa as set forth by these patients. IV. Explore whether anemic\n      patients receiving platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens experience less nephrotoxicity\n      if they receive concurrent epoetin alfa compared to those who receive placebo.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind study. Patients are stratified by primary\n      malignant disease (lung vs breast vs other), life expectancy (4-6 months vs greater than 6\n      months), planned concurrent radiotherapy (yes vs no), and degree of anemia (mild or at least\n      9 g/dL vs severe or less than 9 g/dL). Patients receiving chemotherapy are randomized to\n      receive epoetin alfa subcutaneously once a week for a maximum of 16 weeks (arm I) or placebo\n      subcutaneously once a week for a maximum of 16 weeks (arm II). Quality of life is assessed\n      at randomization and monthly throughout study. Patients are followed every 6 months for 1\n      year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 300 patients (150 patients per arm) accrued into this study\n      over 11 months."
