Position and\n      orientation of the capsule are interpreted by dedicated computer software and transit times,\n      progression velocity and contraction frequencies can be revealed.\n\n      The study is mainly descriptive and is designed to test and evaluate the usefulness of the\n      Motilis 3D Transit system in UC patients and to tell investigators more about GI motility\n      during and after severe inflammation.\n\n      Motilis 3D-Transit system gives investigators a unique chance to study the gastrointestinal\n      canal as a whole during and after severe illness.\n\n      The investigators expect to include 20 patients suffering from severe UC admitted to\n      Hospital with the purpose of getting medical treatment. The investigators do not expect any\n      drop out, but in case of drop out a new patient will be included."
