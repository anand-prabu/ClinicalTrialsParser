Assess a limited sampling of pharmacokinetics and correlate with toxicity in\n      these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive dolastatin 10 IV every 3 weeks. Treatment continues for at least 4\n      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with\n      documented complete response receive an additional 2 courses, and may receive retreatment at\n      the time of progression at the discretion of the investigator. Patients are followed every 3\n      months for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study over 4-15\n      months."
