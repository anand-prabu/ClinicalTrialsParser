            "textblock": "The serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor is the most abundant excitatory serotonin (5-HT,\n      5-hydroxytryptamine) receptor in the human brain, and multiple positron emission tomography\n      (PET) studies have investigated the 5-HT2A receptors in the human brain using antagonist\n      radioligands. However, the currently available antagonist PET radioligands bind the total\n      pool of 5-HT2A receptor receptors whereas a 5-HT2A receptor agonist binds the high-affinity\n      subgroup of the receptors which are also G-protein coupled, and thus hypothesized to be the\n      functional relevant population of receptors. At the Center for Integrated Molecular Brain\n      Imaging (CIMBI),  a novel agonist PET radioligands for brain imaging of 5-HT2A receptors was\n      recently validated in animals (Ettrup et al. 2011, EJNMMI). In the human brain,\n      [11C]Cimbi-36 was validated as a selective 5-HT2A receptor agonist PET radioligand through a\n      blocking study with the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist pharmaceutical ketanserin. In this\n      validation study, the biodistribution and kinetic modelling of [11C]Cimbi-36 binding in the\n      human brain was also validated. With these studies, investigators will test the most\n      promising of these, [11C]Cimbi-36, in clinical trials, where it will provide a novel method\n      for detecting dysfunction in the 5-HT system. The specific aim of this clinical trial is:\n\n      - To examine the effect of acute alterations in 5-HT levels on cerebral [11C]Cimbi-36\n      binding in healthy volunteers who will be PET-scanned at baseline and after pharmacological\n      or dietary interventions that either increase or decrease cerebral 5-HT levels.\n\n      It is hypothesized that this novel agonist radioligand will provide both a more\n      physiological relevant measure of the 5-HT2A receptors and also reflect levels of cerebral\n      5-HT in humans, more specifically:\n\n      BP will decrease after pindolol and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment\n      and increase after acute tryptophan depletion (ATD). Placebo will leave binding potential\n      (BP) unchanged."
