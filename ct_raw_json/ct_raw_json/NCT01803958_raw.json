            "textblock": "This study was designed and developed in the Emilia Romania research and innovation program\n      (PRI ER). The study does not have commercial sponsors and comes under the independent\n      studies provided for by Ministerial Decree 17.12.2005. The PRI ER program will guarantee a\n      contribution to the study for the first three years of recruitment through the regional\n      Innovation Fund, to cover the costs of coordination and data management sustained by the\n      Coordinating Center.\n\n      Primary Objectives The study proposes to evaluate whether partial hypofractionated and\n      accelerated irradiation of the sole surgical cavity, in patients suffering from breast\n      cancer with low risk of local recurrence and who undergo conservative surgery, is not\n      inferior to postoperative irradiation with conventional fractionation of the entire breast\n      as regards local control (incidence of ipsilateral recurrences as prime event).\n\n      Secondary Objectives Comparison of the global survivals, freedom from locoregional\n      recurrences (with exception for contralateral tumors and second tumors), distant\n      relapse-free (except for local or regional relapses or in the contralateral breast) in\n      patients treated with conventional radiotherapy and accelerated partial radiation.\n\n      To evaluate whether accelerated partial irradiation offers cosmetic results, acute toxicity\n      comparable with conventional irradiation.\n\n      Possible connection with other national and international studies Similar studies which\n      nonetheless evaluate different methods of partial irradiation are currently underway.\n\n      Study Design Multicenter phase III controlled randomized, unblinded study of\n      non-inferiority.\n\n      Number of cases Recruitment of 3302 patients is planned. Target Population of the Study\n      Women aged = > 49, ECOG 0-2, undergoing conservative breast surgery for invasive breast\n      cancer, pT 1-2 (< 3 cm in diameter) pN0-N1 M0, unifocal, resection margins histologically\n      negative (\u00b3 2 mm) at first intervention or after subsequent widening.\n\n      Duration of the recruitment and of the subsequent follow-up A recruitment of 8 years is\n      planned and a follow-up period of 5 years for an overall duration of the study of 13 years.\n\n      Treatment\n\n      The patients will be randomized to receive one of the following treatments:\n\n      Trial arm 38.5 Gy total in 10 fractions (3.85 Gy per fraction), twice a day with an interval\n      of at least 6 hours between the two fractions, for five consecutive working days.\n\n      Control arm 50.0 Gy in 25 fractions (2 Gy per fraction), once a day for 5 days in the week.\n\n      Endpoints Primary: survival free of local ipsilateral recurrence as prime event Secondary:\n      global survival, locoregional recurrence-free, distant recurrence-free, acute and late\n      toxicity (RTOG) and cosmetic result.\n\n      Evaluation and Follow-Up Program Controls are planned during the radiotherapy, at the end of\n      treatment, at 6 weeks, 3-6-12 months from the end of the radiotherapy and then once a year\n      until the end of 5 years.\n\n      Data Analysis Partial irradiation will be considered not inferior to the standard\n      irradiation if the top extreme of the HR confidence interval at 95% (to endpoint) does not\n      exceed the established value of 1.5 The study was sized in relation to the rate of local\n      ipsilateral breast recurrences as prime event at 5 years and assuming that this rate in the\n      standard treatment group is 4%, accepting as maximum Hazard Ratio inferior to 1.5 and error\n      a and b equal respectively to 0.05 and 0.10 and test at an endpoint.\n\n      The survivals will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The hazard ratio (HR) will\n      be calculated using the Cox model and its confidence interval at 95% will be reported.\n\n      Ethical Aspects and Informed Consent For participation in the study an informed consent is\n      planned appropriately drawn up and submitted to the approval of the Ethics Committees.\n\n      The clinical study will be carried out according to the ethical principles of the Helsinki\n      Declaration, the GCP guidelines, the Italian laws and regulatory activities for carrying out\n      clinical studies.\n\n      Before formal commencement of the study its approval/sole opinion by the reference Ethics\n      Committee of the proposing group is stipulated. The individual investigators of the\n      different participating institutions are directly responsible for the submission for\n      approval of the protocol by their Ethics Committees."
