    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of cardioneuroablation for the
      treatment of neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS), also known as &quot;vaso-vagal&quot; syncope. Syncope is
      a general term for passing out spells and neurocardiogenic syncope is a specific form of
      passing out spells caused by sudden drops in heart rate or blood pressure. Although the
      specific mechanisms of NCS are not well understood, it is believed that some people are
      prone to developing passing out spells in specific situations such as standing up for a long
      period of time, pain or nausea. In these situations, the body reacts with a paradoxical
      reflex which leads to a drop in blood pressure and heart rate and causes passing out.
      Certain types of medications are used to treat NCS including beta-blockers, midodrine and
      florinef, among others. However, none of these medications are particularly effective at
      preventing passing out spells and many people continue to have episodes despite trying
      different medications.

      Cardioneuroablation is a new form of treatment for NCS. The term ablation means using a wire
      to make small electrical burns in the heart. Ablation has been used for many years to treat
      other electrical disturbances in the heart but the use of ablation to treat NCS is a new
      application. The goal of cardioneuroablation is to identify areas within the heart which are
      believed to initiate the reflex which triggers the drop in heart rate and blood pressure
      that leads to passing out. In preliminary studies, it has been suggested that
      cardioneuroablation may be significantly more effective than medications at preventing
      passing out spells for people with NCS.

      Hypothesis: Cardioneuroablation of vagal inputs in the left atrium may serve as an effective
      treatment modality for the prevention of NCS by blunting the initial trigger of the cascade
      that leads to symptoms and syncope.
