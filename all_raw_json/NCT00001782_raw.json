Previous neuroimaging studies\n      have shown that both the right and left hemispheres are involved when processing information\n      given in American Sign Language (ASL).  However, the study also showed that when processing\n      spoken language, the left hemisphere was mostly involved.\n\n      Researchers would like to find out more about how the brain processes American Sign Language\n      (ASL).  This study is designed to determine if the right hemisphere is necessary for normal\n      understanding of ASL."
