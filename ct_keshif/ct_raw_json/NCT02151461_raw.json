In this study, standard metformin therapy will be defined\n      as 1000 g/day for Day 1 to Day 14 and then escalated to 1700 g/day for Day 15 to Day 28.\n      Subjects meeting all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be randomized to one\n      of four treatment arms.\n\n      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the change in fasting plasma glucose from\n      Baseline (Day 1) to Week 4 (Day 28) in subjects receiving various fixed-dose combinations of\n      leucine and metformin compared to standard metformin monotherapy.  Secondary objectives will\n      also assess changes in baseline-corrected plasma glucose and insulin area under the\n      concentration curves from baseline to day 28 and changes in insulin secretory rates as\n      assessed during a 3-hour meal tolerance test.  Finally the effects of gastrointestinal\n      symptoms will be assessed by subject questionnaires.\n\n      The study will include a total of 3 periods: screening or washout of current diabetic\n      monotherapy, a pre-treatment period to ensure subjects will be compliant, and a treatment\n      period of 4 weeks, with the first dosing of medication on day 1 of the study.  Each day\n      blood glucose readings will be measured and recorded by patients.  Three-hour standardized\n      meal tests will be performed at Baseline (Day 1) and at Study Termination (Day 28).  In\n      addition, two, 7-day continuous glucose assessments will be conducted, as well as two seven\n      point glucose profiles.  Patients will also be asked about any gastrointestinal side effects\n      they experience."
