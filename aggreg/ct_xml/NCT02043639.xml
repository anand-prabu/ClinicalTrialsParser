  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the goal is to find out if the clinicCompanion™ is effective in measuring
      range of motion when compared to the goniometer.  Currently, the goniometer is an approved
      device to measure range of motion by the FDA, but the clinicCompanion™ is not.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study procedure will test the range of motion of the subjects  shoulders two different
      ways: using a goniometer and using the clinicCompanion™. Both tools are designed to measure
      the degree of movement subjects are able to do.  Researchers will take 12 measurements on
      each arm for each device, for a total of 24 measurements per device. That is a total of 48
      measurements for both devices.
