  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One purpose of this study is to test whether adding metformin will limit some of the
      unwanted effects of clozapine, compared to not adding metformin.  Metformin is a medication
      that is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment
      of type-2 diabetes.    Studies have found that people with type-2 diabetes often lose some
      weight when they take metformin, however the FDA has not approved metformin for weight loss,
      so for this study the use of metformin is investigational.  This study will test whether
      metformin can help people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders lose weight.

      Another purpose of this study is to test whether adding fish oil will improve the benefit of
      clozapine and/or limit some of the unwanted effects of clozapine, compared to not adding
      fish oil.  Fish oil is a medication used to reduce levels of some fats (triglycerides) in
      blood.  Some studies have found that adding fish oil reduces psychosis (voices,
      suspiciousness).  However the FDA has not approved fish oil for reducing psychosis, so for
      this study the use of fish oil is investigational.  This study will test whether fish oil
      can help people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders have less psychosis.  Fish
      oil is not an antipsychotic medication.
