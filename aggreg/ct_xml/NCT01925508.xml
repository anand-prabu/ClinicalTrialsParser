      The purpose of this study is to verify that the implementation of a protocol physiotherapy
      musculoskeletal pain and reduces anxiety and improves quality of life in patients
      hospitalized at the clinic of high-risk pregnancies at the Hospital das Clinicas of Ribeirao
      Preto, with a diagnosis of preeclampsia and chronic hypertension with superimposed
      preeclampsia. Where patients will be recruited, answered questionnaires before and after
      application of physiotherapy protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypertensive disorders in pregnancy affect approximately 5-8% of pregnant women
      worldwide, contributing significantly to serious maternal and fetal complications. There are
      various forms of hypertensive disorders that occur during pregnancy and among them are
      pre-eclampsia and chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia. These two disorders
      present with high blood pressure and proteinuria, which leads often to hospitalization of
      these women. It is believed that with such an accent hospitalization occur in pain
      conditions that often affect pregnant women. Given these complications, this study aims to
      evaluate the effectiveness of a physical therapy protocol used in pregnant women with
      preeclampsia admitted with respect to blood pressure levels, responses maternal-fetal and
      perinatal, and measure an expected improvement in quality of life in the reduction of
      reported pain and anxiety. The study will include the participation of women with
      preeclampsia and chronic hypertension with superimposed pre-eclampsia, hospitalized, with no
      significant complications that may hinder the normal progress of pregnancy. Pregnant women
      will answer questionnaires about quality of life, anxiety and scales to identify
      musculoskeletal discomfort. Monitoring will be done both the pregnant woman and the fetus
      through imaging and laboratory, in addition, pregnant women carry the exercise protocol
      previously proposed work. This is expected to achieve satisfactory results in the
      improvement of maternal and fetal hemodynamics in aspects of muscle discomfort and quality
      of life in a secure way for these women.
