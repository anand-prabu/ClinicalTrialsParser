            "textblock": "This is a research study about an experimental (investigational) oral ETEC vaccine (ACE527).\n      ACE527 is a live attenuated vaccine that is being made to prevent disease from\n      enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), which causes watery diarrhea, largely in children\n      living in developing countries and in travelers to those countries.  This research study is\n      also testing an investigational adjuvant called dmLT.  An adjuvant is something that is\n      added to a vaccine to make it work better. The purpose of this study is two-fold. First,\n      Part A aims to find out if the vaccine by itself or the vaccine combined with the adjuvant\n      is safe, tolerable, and initiates an immune response. Second, Part B aims to find out if the\n      vaccine by itself or the vaccine combined with teh adjuvant prevents diarrheal disease when\n      challenged with ETEC H10407. About 60 healthy adults, ages 18-50, will participate in Part\n      A, and they will be required to stay in the research facility for several nights for the\n      first dose, but will not be required to stay overnight for the second and third doses.\n      Participants will be assigned to receive either the vaccine alone, the vaccine with\n      adjuvant, or placebo by mouth. Study procedures include: stool samples, blood samples, and\n      documentation of side effects. Participants will be involved in study related procedures for\n      about 8 months.\n\n      Interested volunteers from Part A will along with volunteers who were never vaccinated in\n      Part A will return to participate in Part B. These volunteers will be required to stay\n      overnight in the research facility for several nights after challenge, after which they will\n      be treated with antibiotics and sent home. Study procedures include stool samples, blood\n      samples, and documentation of infection with ETEC H10407. If the vaccine with/without\n      adjuvant is effective, the volunteers should not development diarrhea, but if the vaccine\n      with/without adjuvant is not effective, the volunteers will have diarrhea for a few days."

            "textblock": "This study is a single site, Phase 1/2b, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,\n      clinical trial in healthy adult volunteers to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and\n      efficacy of a live attenuated ETEC vaccine, ACE527, with and without a mucosal adjuvant,\n      dmLT. ACE527 comprises three genetically attenuated and engineered strains of E. coli, with\n      antigen profiles covering a wide range of ETEC surface colonization factor antigens (CFA/I,\n      CFA/II [CS1, CS2, CS3] and CFA/IV [CS5, CS6]) and also expressing LT-B, the inactive subunit\n      of LT (ETEC heat labile toxin). LT(R192G/L211A), or dmLT, is a derivative of wild-type\n      enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli  heat-labile enterotoxin that has been genetically modified\n      by replacing the arginine at amino acid position 192 with glycine and the leucine at amino\n      acid position 211 with alanine. Approximately 36 volunteers (projected enrollments plus\n      possible alternates) will be enrolled in Part A into each of two separate Cohorts.\n      Approximately 30 volunteers per Cohort will be randomized to receive 10^10 cfu total live\n      dose ACE527 vaccine alone, 10^10 cfu total live dose ACE527 vaccine + 25 \u00b5g dmLT, or\n      placebo.  The placebo preparation will be CeraVacx, which is being used as the buffer in\n      both vaccine formulations. Cohort 1 and 2 volunteers will receive 10^10 cfu total dose of\n      ACE527, 10^10 cfu total dose of ACE527 with 25 \u00b5g dmLT, or placebo at 0, 1, and 2 months.\n      Enrollment and dosing of Cohort 2 will be dependent on an acceptable safety profile of the\n      first dose of Cohort 1, based on evaluation of data up until Day 3 by the Safety Review\n      Committee (SRC). The first immunization of each Cohort will be administered in the Center\n      for Immunization Research (CIR) Inpatient Unit, followed by 72 hours of direct\n      post-immunization observation.  A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will meet after the first\n      dose of cohort to determine continuation of volunteer dosing on an outpatient basis, and\n      enrollment of Cohort 2. The SRC will meet again after the first dose of Cohort 2; if after\n      review by the SRC the first dose appears safe and well tolerated, subsequent doses will be\n      administered on an outpatient basis. Safety will be assessed by solicited symptoms/subject\n      memory aid and laboratory evaluations. Adverse events (AE)s will be graded according to\n      standardized criteria. The immunogenicity outcome measures of interest include serum IgG and\n      IgA antibodies by ELISA against all vaccine antigens, cytokine assays, B and T cell memory\n      responses, shedding profile of ACE527, and vaccine specific mucosal IgA responses\n\n      Part B challenge cohorts will include at least 14 and up to 24 volunteers per vaccine\n      treatment group, recruited among those participating in Part A; at least 4 and up to 12\n      placebo recipients recruited among those participating in Part A; plus additional\n      unvaccinated control volunteers sufficient to enroll up to a total of 60 recruited, as\n      needed. Volunteers in the Phase 2b study will be enrolled and challenged in 2-4 cohorts due\n      to the CIR Inpatient Unit capacity of 30 beds. A minimum of 8-10 controls will be challenged\n      with each cohort of vaccinees to ensure comparability of attack rates across challenge\n      cohorts. Volunteers will be admitted as inpatients and challenged, with approximately 2 x\n      10^7 cfu of the fully virulent ETEC strain, H10407, followed by 5 days of direct\n      observation. A Data Review Committee (DRC) will be convened to review the clinical data for\n      all challenged volunteers and verify all outcomes per protocol definitions before any\n      vaccine efficacy assessments are made.\n\n      This study was designed initially as a single site, Phase 1, double-blind, randomized,\n      placebo-controlled, clinical trial in healthy adult volunteers to evaluate the safety and\n      immunogenicity of a live attenuated ETEC vaccine, ACE527, with and without a mucosal\n      adjuvant, dmLT. The addition of this challenge step provides a unique opportunity to\n      evaluate the efficacy of the new lyophilized formulation of ACE527 vaccine, given in a two\n      or three dose regimen, with and without dmLT, against wild type ETEC  strain H10407\n      challenge (designated as Part B: Phase 2b Open Label Challenge Study).  In addition,\n      challenging the volunteers may allow for the identification of immune correlates of\n      protection, taking advantage of newly available technologies (immune proteomics,\n      transcriptomics, etc.) This is a first in man study to explore the immunogenicity and\n      efficacy of lyophilized ACE527 alone and in combination with dmLT. The primary objectives of\n      this study are to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity tolerability, and immunogenicity of a\n      lyophilized, oral, live attenuated, ETEC vaccine designated ACE527 when administered orally\n      with or without double mutant heat labile toxin (dmLT) at Days 0, 28, and 56; and to\n      evaluate vaccine efficacy 4-6 months later after with ETEC H10407. The secondary objectives\n      are to examine shedding of ACE527 during the week following each vaccination, to assess\n      whether dmLT enhances the immunogenicity of the ACE527 vaccine, and to measure the\n      protective efficacy of 2 or 3 doses of vaccine and vaccine plus adjuvant against severe\n      diarrhea resulting from challenge with ETEC strain H10407."
