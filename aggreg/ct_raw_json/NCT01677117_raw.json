Mechanical ventilation as the main measure to\n      improve hypoxemia cannot correct all hypoxemia and relating complications of mechanical\n      ventilation, mechanical ventilation in the treatment of severe ARDS has gradually been\n      challenged.  Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation\uff08ECMO) technology matures, so that\n      clinicians have more choices in the face of hypoxemia, and with the deepening understanding\n      of ECMO, ECMO may become severe ARDS first-line treatment. Currently, ECMO therapy has been\n      recognized by the majority of medical workers. Therefore, we assume that accurately grasping\n      the ECMO indications and standardizing the implementation of treatment can significantly\n      improve the prognosis, shorter hospital stays, lower hospitalization costs."
