Bone marrow transplantation may be able to replace immune cells\n      that were destroyed by chemotherapy used to kill cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by\n      G-CSF and peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients with chronic myelogenous\n      leukemia."

Evaluate the efficacy of MCE (mitoxantrone/cytarabine/etoposide) followed by\n      granulocyte colony-stimulating factor to mobilize peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) in\n      patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). II. Evaluate the toxicity of this regimen.\n      III. Evaluate the cytoreductive effects of this regimen in CML as determined by the ability\n      to mobilize Philadelphia chromosome-negative PBSC. IV. Assess the time of peak CD34+ and\n      CD34+/CD38- cell concentrations in the peripheral blood of patients treated with this\n      regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: The following acronyms are used: ARA-C Cytarabine, NSC-63878 DHAD Mitoxantrone,\n      NSC-301739 G-CSF Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (source not specified) HU\n      Hydroxyurea, NSC-32065 MCE DHAD/ARA-C/VP-16 VP-16 Etoposide, NSC-141540 Single-Agent\n      Cytoreduction followed by 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy/Stem Cell Mobilization.
