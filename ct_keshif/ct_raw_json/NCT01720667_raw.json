Current treatments are\n      poorly effective and have significant side effects.\n\n      Levetiracetam (LEV) has great potential as a treatment for neonatal seizures but is not\n      approved for use in children less than 2 years of age.\n\n      This study aims to obtain essential data regarding the efficacy and safety of LEV in this\n      vulnerable and under researched population and simultaneously to develop EEG monitoring\n      systems that facilitate seizure detection and research.\n\n      Specific aims are:\n\n        1. To determine the efficacy of intravenous LEV in terminating neonatal seizures when\n           given as first line therapy.\n\n        2. To obtain dose escalation data by studying the additional efficacy of a further dose in\n           non responders.\n\n        3. To obtain additional pharmacokinetic data to confirm findings from our previous\n           pharmacokinetic study.\n\n        4. To obtain further safety data of LEV in neonates.\n\n        5. To prove the feasibility of centralized remote monitoring of continuous EEG monitoring\n           in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) via the internet and test a promising\n           automated neonatal seizure detection algorithm.\n\n      The study design is a phase 2 randomized blinded controlled study."
