            "textblock": "The purpose of this research is to study the effects of rosiglitazone, a drug usually taken\n      for Type II diabetes, on HIV-associated hyperlipidemia.  HIV-associated lipodystrophy is a\n      medical condition characterized by gradual changes in the distribution of body fat.  The\n      body fat located in the extremities and face disappears while body fat around the abdomen\n      and upper back increases.  Certain biochemical changes occur in association with these\n      changes in fat distribution.  Lipid levels particularly serum triglycerides are increased.\n      HDL, the \"good cholesterol\" is decreased.  Higher than normal level of insulin or insulin\n      resistance is also found in this condition.  This latter condition is one of the hallmarks\n      of Type II diabetes. The protease inhibitors, a class of HIV medications, are associated\n      with the occurrence of HIV-associated lipodystrophy.  It has been suggested that a\n      biochemical pathway known as the peripheral peroxisomal activating receptor (PPAR) gamma\n      system is blocked leading to the onset of this condition.\n\n      Rosiglitazone is a new drug approved by the FDA in 1999 for the treatment of type II\n      diabetes. It lowers blood sugar by improving insulin resistance, which as mentioned before,\n      is the hallmark of Type II diabetes. It has also been noted to improve blood lipid levels.\n      Rosiglitazone works by stimulating the PPAR gamma system. It is hoped that this drug can\n      turn on the PPAR system and reverse the HIV-associated lipodystrophy syndrome."
