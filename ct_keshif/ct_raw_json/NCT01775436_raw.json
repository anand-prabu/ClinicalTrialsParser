            "textblock": "Our goal is to advance palliative care with persons living with AIDS (PLWA) or life-limiting\n      co-morbidities to decrease suffering and increase quality of life (QOL). Left without\n      advance care planning (ACP) for end-of-life decision, miscommunication and disagreements may\n      result in families being charged with neglect or court battles over treatment choices, unmet\n      care or delivery of unnecessary or unwanted care, and non-relative caregivers being\n      dismissed (e.g. gay partners). We hope to increase families' understandings of their family\n      member's wishes for end-of-life care to decrease conflict through the FAmily-CEntered\n      Advance (FACE) Care Planning intervention. We will also study communication, quality of\n      life, and spiritual struggle. Families will be randomized into either the Control (N=96\n      families) or the FACE Intervention (n=192 dyads).  FACE families will meet with a\n      trained/certified researcher for two 60-minute sessions scheduled one week apart: Session 1:\n      The Respecting Choices Interview\u00ae; and Session 2: Completion of The Five Wishes\u00a9. Control\n      families will also meet with a researcher for two 60-minute sessions scheduled one week\n      apart: Session 1: Developmental History; and Session 2: Nutrition and Exercise.\n      Questionnaires will be administered five times, Baseline and at 3, 6, 12 and 18 month\n      post-intervention, for an average of 2 years.\n\n      AIM 1. To determine the efficacy of FACE on congruence in treatment preferences between PLWA\n      and their surrogates over time, and the effect of the pattern of congruence development\n      trajectory on healthcare utilization (i.e., distal outcomes: number of hospitalizations,\n      dialysis, ER visits).\n\n      Hypothesis A: Development of congruence may not be homogeneous and FACE may influence the\n      pattern of congruence development.\n\n      Hypothesis B: Different patterns of congruence development may have different effects on\n      health care utilization.\n\n      Hypothesis C: Compared to Controls, FACE participants will better maintain congruence over\n      time.\n\n      AIM 2. To determine the efficacy of FACE on key components of QOL for PLWA. Hypothesis: FACE\n      participants will increase or better maintain psychosocial QOL compared to Controls.\n\n      AIM 3. To minimize health disparities in ACP between Blacks and non Blacks and identify\n      factors associated with disparities.\n\n      Hypothesis: Blacks in the FACE intervention will complete advance directives at a rate\n      comparable to non Blacks, and at significantly greater rates compared to Controls."

            "textblock": "Our goal is to advance palliative care with persons living with AIDS (PLWA) or life-limiting\n      co-morbidities aimed at relieving suffering and maximizing quality of life. One objective is\n      to identify variables which influence decision-making with respect to advance care planning\n      (ACP) for PLWA, as well as to determine the unique person-centered needs of subgroups of\n      PLWA, as these are unknown. The negative consequences of no ACP or poor ACP include: unmet\n      care or delivery of unnecessary or unwanted care, conflict erupting in the ICU, or the\n      importance of non-relative caregivers being dismissed, for example gay partners. A second\n      objective is to identify a \"best approach\" for standard of care in ACP, a key component of\n      palliative care, as an end of life support. This approach may minimize health disparities in\n      the likelihood of both identifying a surrogate decision-maker and using advance directives.\n      We propose building on our evidence based, theoretical model, FAmily-CEntered (FACE) Advance\n      Care Planning intervention, an HIV specific ACP program for Black teens which gained\n      acceptance and demonstrated efficacy through increased congruence in treatment preferences\n      and universal complete of advance directives with a surrogate decision-maker. Given the\n      demonstrated needs and benefits of ACP and the low utilization among adult Black PLWA, we\n      propose meeting this need by building on our FACE model with adults living with advanced\n      AIDS and/or life-limiting co-morbidities in Washington, District of Columbia (DC) a city\n      with endemic HIV and significant health disparities in death rates by race in an\n      adequately-powered, randomized, clinical, 2-arm, single-blinded, controlled trial. We will\n      test the efficacy of the FACE intervention for increasing congruence in end-of-life\n      treatment preferences between PLWA and their surrogate decision-maker, to determine if\n      increased congruence can be maintained over time. We will also determine if FACE is\n      acceptable to primarily Black inner city adult PLWA. We will recruit from four\n      hospital-based clinics and randomize 288 patient/surrogate dyads (N=576 subjects) in a 2:1\n      ratio to either FACE Intervention (N=192 dyads) or Control (N=96 dyads). Participants with\n      HIV dementia, suicidality, homicidality or psychosis will be excluded. Two 60-minuted\n      sessions will be conducted with a trained/certified facilitator at weekly intervals: FACE\n      Session 1: The Respecting Choices Interview (R); Session 2: Completion of The Five Wishes\n      (c). Control will also be administered in a dyadic format: Session 1: Developmental History;\n      Session 2: Nutrition and Exercise. Standardized self-report measures will be administered at\n      baseline, 3 month post-intervention 6 month post-intervention, 12 month post-intervention,\n      and 18 month post-intervention. Thus, participants will be followed for an average of 2\n      years. This will be the first study to test an ACP model, integrating person-centered (GMM)\n      and variable-centered analysis (GEE) to assess study outcomes."

TAS scores are found to demonstrate a high degree of agreement with children's open-ended descriptions of negative life events, indicating adequate convergent validity of this measure. Theoretically, threat appraisal is related to Lazarus' concept of primary appraisal, particularly to the way in which the event threatens the child's commitments, goals, or values.
