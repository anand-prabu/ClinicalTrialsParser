It is not known what causes the illness, but exposure to chemicals is\n      suspected.  The Hubbard detoxification program consists of exercise and sauna therapy\n      together with administration of several dietary supplements, particularly crystalline niacin\n      used at increasing concentrations over a period of about four weeks.  The investigators\n      hypothesize that this program will reduce symptoms, as tested by administration of cognitive\n      and quality of life tests and serum clinical chemistry tests."

            "textblock": "This will be a randomized controlled trial of changes in fatigue and pain symptoms, measured\n      quality of life, mental health status, and neuro-cognitive functioning of a group of GWVs\n      after a 4 to 6 week sauna detoxification regimen as compared to control. For control\n      subjects we will also have a group of GWVs receiving usual care who are randomly assigned to\n      a waitlist and who will start the intervention after a four to six week delay.  The waitlist\n      group will also take part in the baseline tests a second time just prior to their treatment\n      4 to 6 weeks later and a 7-day post-treatment battery of tests the same as described for the\n      treatment group. Finally, there will be a 3-month follow-up with both the groups.  The\n      Severna Park Health and Wellness Center (SPHWC) is a commercial center that offers the\n      Hubbard detoxification program.  The investigators will contract with SPHWC to provide the\n      program to the subjects of this study and to provide office space for the Study Coordinator,\n      so that all components of this project except the initial Physician evaluation and blood\n      sample acquisition can be done at the Center, not just the detoxification.\n\n      Study Variables:  The investigators will examine:\n\n        -  Quality of life as measured by the Veterans Short Form (SF36-V). The SF36-V also\n           includes physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) component summary scores.\n\n        -  Case status for GWI will be assessed utilizing the Kansas criteria.\n\n        -  Symptoms of GWI will be measured with the Kansas Gulf War Veterans Health Project\n           Questionnaire, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, and the short-form McGill Pain\n           Questionnaire.\n\n        -  Cognitive function will be measured with a battery of neurocognitive tests. These will\n           include visual motor, memory and executive functioning as measured by the Trailmaking\n           test, Grooved Pegboard, Wechsler Memory Abbreviated test, and the Stroop color word\n           test. To account for potential confounding in neurocognitive testing, mental health\n           status will be evaluated using the Symptom Checklist 90 revised and the State Trait\n           Anxiety Inventory.\n\n        -  Physical health status will be measured via standard medical examination and laboratory\n           analyses of serum metabolic panel, lipid profile and hormones.\n\n      Sampling Method:  This will be a convenience sample and will consist of Gulf War Veterans\n      who meet the Kansas case definition for Gulf War illness and reside in the\n      Washington/Baltimore area.  The individuals who show interest in this study, who meet\n      eligibility criteria and subsequently agree to participate will be selected to enroll in the\n      study.\n\n      Randomization: Volunteers will be randomly assigned to a group when they enroll.  One group\n      will be the immediate experimental intervention group and one group will be the wait-list\n      control group.  Random assignment will be achieved by use of sequentially numbered, opaque,\n      sealed envelopes.  Both will undergo the detoxification protocol, but the control group will\n      be tested twice prior to treatment."
