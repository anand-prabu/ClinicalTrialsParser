The multicenter trial is composed of two phases and will\n      involve a double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel design. The goal of Phase I is to\n      examine the ability of nifedipine vs. placebo to decrease adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)\n      levels, as well as to begin to assess the dose-dependency of nifedipine effects.  The goal\n      of Phase II is to evaluate the long-term effects of nifedipine; that is, can attenuation of\n      ACTH release by nifedipine permit a decrease in the dosage of glucocorticoid needed to\n      suppress the HPA axis?  Such a decrease would, in turn, reduce the deleterious effects of\n      glucocorticoid treatment in CAH."}, "overall_status": "Completed", "phase": "Phase 1/Phase 2", "study_type": "Interventional", "study_design": "Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment, Masking: Double-Blind, Primary Purpose: Treatment", "condition": "Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia", "intervention": {"intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Nifedipine"}, "eligibility": {"criteria": {"textblock": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  diagnosed with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)\n\n          -  normal ECG during baseline evaluation\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  history of liver disease, or elevated liver function tests\n\n          -  history of cardiovascular disease"}, "gender": "Both", "minimum_age": "14 Years", "maximum_age": "35 Years", "healthy_volunteers": "No"}, "location": {"facility": {"name": "Medical University of South Carolina", "address": {"city": "Charleston", "state": "South Carolina", "country": "United States"}}}, "location_countries": {"country": "United States"}, "verification_date": "January 2004", "lastchanged_date": "June 23, 2005", "firstreceived_date": "November 3, 1999", "has_expanded_access": "No", "condition_browse": {"mesh_term": ["Adrenal Hyperplasia, Congenital", "Adrenogenital Syndrome", "Adrenocortical Hyperfunction", "Hyperplasia"]}, "intervention_browse": {"mesh_term": "Nifedipine"}}}
