  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this project is to help 9-1-1 emergency medical dispatchers save the lives
      of more cardiac arrest victims.  The investigators will develop teaching tools to help the
      dispatchers recognize abnormal breathing that may indicate a victim as having a cardiac
      arrest.  After training sessions, the investigators will see if dispatchers can get better
      at recognizing abnormal breathing, how often they give CPR instructions, and if use of the
      teaching tool will increase bystander CPR and the number of victims leaving the hospital
      alive.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death in Canada; it is defined as the sudden cessation
      of cardiac mechanical activity.  It is uniformly fatal if not treated within minutes. More
      than 85% of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) occur in residential locations so public
      access to automatic external defibrillators, to restart the heart, are not helpful.  The
      overall rate of survival for OOHCA rarely exceeds 8%.

      Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is chest compression and ventilations provided
      by someone not on the emergency response team.  A victim or cardiac arrest is almost 4 times
      more likely to survive when receiving bystander CPR.  However, despite various attempts to
      improve bystander rates they have remained low, not exceeding 15% in Ontario. It has been
      shown that since the ambulance dispatch centres in Ontario implemented dispatch-assisted CPR
      instructions (given to callers while emergency vehicles were on the way), there was a
      significant increase in use.

      Emergency medical dispatchers can identify about 70% of OOHCA cases over the phone.  Agonal
      breathing (laboured breathing preceding death) may be misinterpreted as a sign of life, and
      is responsible for as much as 50% of missed diagnoses.  There is no specific training on the
      significance of this sign, and minimal information about recognizing cardiac arrest.  An
      educational intervention designed to better understand the significance of agonal breathing
      and to clarify the existing CPR instruction protocol will most likely increase the frequency
      of CPR instructions, bystander CPR rates, and potentially survival of victims of cardiac
      arrest.
