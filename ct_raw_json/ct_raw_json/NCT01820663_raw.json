It is based on the hypothesis that after stroke, the brain's\n      utilization of glucose, it's primary source of energy, is disrupted. The MAD is a\n      low-carbohydrate diet that has can switch the body's metabolism from using glucose to using\n      products of fat metabolism, so-called ketones. Ketones may act as an alternative energy\n      substrate for the brain. Ketones also have several neuroprotective effects after stroke."
