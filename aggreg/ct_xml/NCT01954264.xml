  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to characterise P. falciparum transmission intensity in subjects aged
      ≥6 months and &lt;10 years by measurement of P. falciparum parasite prevalence, and to estimate
      the use of malaria control interventions at some centres selected for the EPI-MAL-002 and
      EPI-MAL-003 studies in sub-Saharan Western Africa.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two subsequent studies (EPI-MAL-002 and EPI-MAL-003) are planned to monitor vaccine safety
      prior to and after implementation of the RTS,S/AS01 candidate malaria vaccine. EPI-MAL-002
      will take place before RTS,S is authorised and EPI-MAL-003 will start when RTS,S is
      registered and authorised in the country. A cross-sectional survey at peak transmission will
      provide by-site point estimates of Parasite prevalence (PP) and malaria control measure
      coverage in the areas participating in EPI-MAL-002/-003. EPI-MAL-006 will be conducted in
      advance of EPI-MAL-002/-003 in order to assess PP and malaria control measures to inform
      enrollment in these studies. The age group for enrollment (≥6 months - &lt;10 years) will
      permit analysis of PP according to the World Health Organization (WHO) definition (2-9
      years) and by the Joint Technical Expert Group (JTEG) suggested age (&lt;5 years).
