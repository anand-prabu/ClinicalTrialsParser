            "textblock": "Hypothesis:Sleep Disorders are very common during pregnancy but the their exact role in\n      causation of pregnancy related disorders is yet to be determined. OSA can complicate\n      pregnancy given the risk factors of weight gain, upper displacement of the diaphragm, and\n      hormonal-induced hyperaemia of the nasopharyngeal passages. SDB confers the risk of\n      hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and is associated with adverse maternal and foetal\n      outcomes.\n\n      The study would involve pregnant females which would be prospectively followed in pregnancy\n      and post partum to know the prevalence of sleep disorders in pregnancy. Diagnosis of sleep\n      disorders would be confirmed by overnight polysomnography and ambulatory blood pressure\n      monitoring. Pregnancy outcomes, both maternal and fetal would  be recorded and its relation\n      with sleep disorders in pregnancy would be analysed."

To know prevalence of various sleep disorders during pregnancy including restless leg\n           syndrome, symptomatic obstructive sleep apnea etc.\n\n        3. To study the effect of sleep disorders on maternal and fetal outcome\n\n        4. To study the relation of obstructive sleep apnea with pregnancy induced hypertension.\n\n      Material & Methods\n\n      Study Design: Longitudinal prospective case-control study\n\n        -  Consecutive patients undergoing antenatal check up at the Antenatal Clinic at AIIMS\n           hospital during will be evaluated using questionnaires for sleep quality. Preliminary\n           screening question for sleep disturbance in pregnancy to all patients\n\n        -  Questionnaires used: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (covers insomnia, RLS, snoring and\n           sleep related breathing disorders); Epworth Sleepiness Score (for Excessive daytime\n           sleepiness); Modified Wisconsin Score; Modified Berlin Questionnaires\n\n        -  To now association between Obstructive sleep apnea and pregnancy induced hypertension\n           patients who develop symptomatic OSA will be offered polysomnographic evaluation during\n           the second/third trimester.\n\n        -  An offer of similar services will be made to pregnant females who do not develop\n           pregnancy induced hypertension at a similar gestational age.\n\n      Case: patient with  OSA\n\n      Control: patients without OSA\n\n        -  We proposed to determine that what proportion of the cases were exposed to sleep\n           disorders and what proportion are not.\n\n        -  We also planned to determine what proportion of controls is exposed and what proportion\n           is not.\n\n      Cases and controls would be matched for age ,parity, BMI,previous h/o pre-eclampsia  in\n      first trimester.\n\n      Outcome parameters\n\n        1. Prevalence of various sleep disorders in pregnancy\n\n        2. Maternal outcome: Development of pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH), gestational\n           diabetes mellitus, complicated pregnancy requiring admission, preterm delivery,\n           ante-partum hemorrhage, delivery requiring intervention (Caesarian section,\n           forceps/ventouse application)\n\n        3. Fetal outcome: APGAR scores at 1 and 5 min, IUGR, IUD, low birth weight\n\n      Sample Size:\n\n      A sample of convenience of 200 patients (who respond to questionnaire) and satisfy inclusion\n      and exclusion criteria will be followed up prospectively to assess the effect of sleep\n      disorders on pregnancy outcome.As per estimates from literature sample size for case control\n      part would be 20 for cases and 40 controls.\n\n      Investigation specifically related to projects:\n\n        1.

The auto-intelligent inflation pressure\n                also reduces measurement time, promoting patient comfort by controlling cuff\n                inflation.\n\n        3.
