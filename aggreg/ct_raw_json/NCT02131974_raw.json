            "textblock": "The purpose of this research study is to help determine if the cuff of an endotracheal tube\n      ( ETT) ( also known as a breathing tube)can be seen by ultrasound and to determine if\n      visualization of this tube corresponds with correct tube depth. You are being asked to\n      participate because you will be undergoing a cardiac catherization procedure which will\n      involve endotracheal intubation.\n\n      Ultrasound is a safe technology that your doctor could possibly use to see the breathing\n      tube. Right now, x-rays, which come with their own risks, are being used for this purpose.\n      We are trying to see if we can avoid using x-rays.\n\n      This is a local study with 1 location. The study will enroll a total of 71 people. There is\n      no sponsor for this study."

To help us see the\n      breathing tube better, we will put some fluid in the cuff ( the balloon at the tip of the\n      breathing tube). The tube may be repositioned as needed based on the chest x-ray. The entire\n      procedure is estimated to take no more than 10 minutes."
