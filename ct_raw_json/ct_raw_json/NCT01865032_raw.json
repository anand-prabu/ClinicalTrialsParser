Subjects will be patients who present for\n      dermatology consultation with a primarily ulcerated lesion. After informed consent is\n      obtained and the subject is screened for eligibility, 2 diagnostic samples will be collected\n      from the subject's lesion in the following order: 1) one sample will be obtained with a\n      dental broach for use with the CL Detect\u2122 Rapid Test and 2) a second sample will be obtained\n      by scraping for use in the microscopic identification of amastigotes. Samples will be\n      analyzed by microscopy and CL Detect\u2122 Rapid Test. The CL Detect\u2122 Rapid Test will be\n      performed by different operators who are clinical staff members. These staff members,\n      blinded to each other's results, will evaluate the samples from each method independently.\n      Each of the 150 study subjects will be followed administratively to the point where a\n      diagnosis is established (if possible) for their tested lesion, even if that diagnosis is\n      not cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). If a specific diagnosis cannot be determined for a non-CL\n      lesion, the investigator will assign a \"likely etiology\" (eg, infectious, oncological,\n      immunological, vascular, or \"undetermined/other\" origin). Based on the diagnosis determined\n      for each lesion, subjects will be referred for appropriate treatment."
