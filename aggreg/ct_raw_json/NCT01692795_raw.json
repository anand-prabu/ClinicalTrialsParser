However, these medications do not prevent\n      cardiovascular events in all patients and there is now a body of research investigating the\n      effects of cardiovascular medications on outcomes in myocardial infarction (MI), including\n      clinical presentation, infarct size and post-MI mortality.  However, the independent effects\n      of cardiovascular drugs on post-MI all cause mortality are unclear, and there are\n      limitations to many of the published studies in terms of their cardiovascular drug exposure\n      data.  This project utilizes prospectively collected data on cardiovascular drug use, and\n      links to MI data from hospital and mortality records."
