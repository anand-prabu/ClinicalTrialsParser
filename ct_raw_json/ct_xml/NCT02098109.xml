      This study will compare the results of stem cell mobilization using drugs called filgrastim
      (Neupogen) and plerixafor with the results of stem cell mobilization using drugs called XM02
      filgrastim (Granix) and plerixafor.

      This study will compare the results of stem cell mobilization using drugs called filgrastim
      (Neupogen) and plerixafor with the results of stem cell mobilization using drugs called XM02
      filgrastim (Granix) and plerixafor.  The FDA has determined that Granix is biosimilar to
      Neupogen, which means that they are similar in terms of quality, safety, and efficacy;
      however, Granix has not been tested in the context of stem cell mobilization to see how its
      effectiveness compares to that of Neupogen

    <measure>Compare XM02 filgrastim and plerixafor to  filgrastim and plerixafor</measure>
    <time_frame>8 days</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample, as well as efficacy, complication, and loss to follow-up will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  The balance of demographic and baseline clinical characteristics between two groups will be compared using t-test, Mann-Whitney rank-sum test, or Chi-square test as appropriate.  Between-group difference in mean CD34+ counts will be compared using 2-factor ANOVA, including the status of randomization, type of disease, and the corresponding interaction. Appropriate data transformation will be performed to better satisfy the assumption of normal distribution. Note that for all the analyses to show bioequivalence, the significance will be set at a one-sided p-value of 0.2 or less.  Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator will be used to summarize time-to-event variables, and the between-group differences in Kaplan-Meier curves will be compared using log-rank tests.  Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models will also be used.</description>

    <description>Number and percentage of patients who experienced AEs for each system organ class and specific AE will be presented. Multiple instances of the AEs in each system organ class and multiple occurrences of the same AE are counted only once per patient (reported as the highest grade experienced).

    <description>Time to platelet engraftment is measured by determining the first of 3 consecutive measurements of platelet count ≥ 50,000/µl without platelet transfusion support for 7 days. Patients who do not have platelet engraftment by Day 100 post-infusion of mobilized PBSC product will be considered a platelet engraftment failure.</description>
