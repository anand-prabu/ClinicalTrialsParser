The goal is to discover\n      these mutations by using next-generation human genetics tools. These include high-throughput\n      sequencing and genotyping along with the necessary bioinformatics analyses that will lead to\n      the discovery of the causes of most inherited diseases in the region.The secondary objective\n      will be to build a comprehensive catalogue of genetic variation in the Arab world. This will\n      include all detected mutations, not only the subset that are causing disease (from primary\n      objective), but also known trait-altering mutations as well as general diversity on the DNA\n      level among human populations of this region. This catalogue can become a widely useful\n      resource for many projects down the road, as it relies on anonymizing individual samples and\n      instead displaying data in aggregate as the cohorts of collected samples grow over the\n      years."
