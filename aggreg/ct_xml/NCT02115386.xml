    <textblock>
      Primary Objective for this study is to evaluate changes in chronic low grade
      non-hematological adverse events experienced by patients who have been treated with at least
      6 months of imatinib and who have not responded to supportive measures, when they are
      switched to nilotinib (CTCAE grading system).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale for study was the fact that Nilotinib is approved for the treatment of chronic
      phase and accelerated phase Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia
      (CML) in adult patients resistant to or intolerant to prior therapy that included imatinib
      (400 mg BID), and for new diagnosed patients with Ph+ CML in CP (300 mg BID). But the
      majority of CML patients treated with imatinib experience adverse reactions at some time.
      The most frequently reported drug-related adverse reactions were edema, nausea and vomiting,
      muscle cramps, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea and rash. Although the majority of adverse
      events experienced on imatinib are mild to moderate in grade and most either resolve or
      diminish over time, low grade adverse events requiring chronic treatment do occur which may
      adversely impact a patient's quality of life. This study will examine changes in chronic low
      grade chronic adverse events, measured by CTCAE, when patients are switched from imatinib to
      nilotinib therapy. So, Primary Objective for this study is to evaluate changes in chronic
      low grade non-hematological adverse events experienced by patients who have been treated
      with at least 6 months of imatinib and who have not responded to supportive measures, when
      they are switched to nilotinib (CTCAE grading system). Primary endpoint is: Changes of
      non-hematological AE grade at 3 months after switch to nilotinib. Secondary Objectives are:
      Rate of CCyR after switch to nilotinib (both newly achieved (if absent at baseline) or
      maintained) at months 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 after switch to nilotinib; Rate of MMR at 1, 3,
      6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months after switch; Time to and duration of CCyR and MMR after switch
      until study end; Time to first documented and optimal improvement of the non-hematological
      adverse event(s) associated with imatinib; Overall nilotinib safety profile; QOL changes
      after switch to nilotinib and within the study period -  measure at baseline (for imatinib)
      and at 1, 3, 6,  12, and 24 months; Evaluation of patients' experience with switching from
      imatinib to nilotinib due to low-grade chronic toxicity (diary) Study Design: Open-label,
      single arm study assessing the changes in chronic low grade adverse events when CML-CP
      patients are switched from imatinib to nilotinib therapy. Patients must have been treated
      with starting imatinib dose of 400 mg and at least 300mg QD of imatinib for ≥ 6 months and
      experience ≤ Grade 2 adverse events which persist ≥ 2 months despite maximal supportive
      care. Patients have to be optimal responders to imatinib according to LeukemiaNet 2009
      criteria at the study entrance.

      Adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE guidelines at baseline and will be assessed
      throughout the trial at each visit. Patients will be treated with nilotinib 300mg BID on
      study and followed up to 2 years.

      Number of patients &amp; centers: 40 patients, 8 centers.
