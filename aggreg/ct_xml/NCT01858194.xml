  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite significant advances in the management of ventricular arrhythmias through the use of
      ICD therapy, AADs, and catheter-based ablation strategies, considerable challenges remain.
      The optimal method for the prevention of recurrent VT following catheter ablation remains
      unclear. RSDN  may be an effective tool for preventing ventricular arrhythmias, and
      associated ICD therapies, by  reducing central sympathetic tone, catecholamine levels, and
      the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system and promoting ventricular remodeling. Although
      RSDN has been shown to reduce the recurrence of VT in a case report of 2 patients suffering
      from electrical storm, to date no large prospective randomized study has evaluated the
      impact of RSDN in the prevention of recurrent VT in patients following catheter ablation of
      VT with ischemic or non-ischemic ventricular dysfunction. This study will specifically
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of adjunctive RSDN in the prevention of ICD therapy in
      patients with ischemic or non-ischemic  ventricular dysfunction who are to receive a
      catheter-based VT ablation.

      The goal of this trial is to test the impact of catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation
      (RSDN) as an adjunctive treatment for patients with either ischemic or non-ischemic
      cardiomyopathy undergoing catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT). The proposed
      study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized control trial. Patients undergoing VT
      ablation will be randomized to either VT ablation alone or VT ablation + RSDN.
