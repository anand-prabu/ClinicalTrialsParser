After each acupuncture treatment, the acupuncturist applies/reapplies\n      acupressure devices by inserting 2-6 smaller needles (studs) into the abdomen (which are\n      held in place with surgical tape) and taping tiny metal balls to 3 points in each ear.\n      Patients or caregivers are instructed to administer acupressure by pressing on the ear\n      points (metal balls) for 1-2 minutes per point and moving the semi-permanent abdominal\n      needles in small circular movements with the fingers, at a rate of 2-3 cycles per second,\n      for 1-2 minutes per point, upon waking in the morning and in the early afternoon. Patients\n      or caregivers are also instructed to stimulate a \"rescue point\" (the Shenmen auricular\n      point) if patients experience pain exacerbations at other times during the day. Patients who\n      respond well to acupuncture are offered further treatment.\n\n      Pain is assessed using the numerical rating scale on approximately days 1-4, 7, 11, and\n      14-17. Sedation is assessed using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) on approximately days 3\n      and 17. Analgesic medication use is assessed on approximately days 1-3 and 15-17.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-29 patients will be accrued for this study within\n      approximately 2 years."
