            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES:\n\n        -  Determine whether conventional or implant supported dental prostheses and current\n           surgical reconstructive procedures restore oral function and quality of life to\n           pre-cancer surgery levels in patients with early oral cancer.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients complete a series of objective and subjective functional tests,\n      questionnaires, and baseline examinations. Within 1-5 days, patients undergo the composite\n      resection, including reconstructive surgery for the mandibulectomy group. Patients in the\n      maxillectomy group receive an immediate maxillary surgical obturator. Approximately 6 weeks\n      after ablative surgery, some patients receive radiotherapy for 5-7 weeks.\n\n      Patients receive 2-4 implants at 12-16 weeks after completion of radiotherapy or 8-16 weeks\n      after ablative surgery. Patients then receive conventional dentures at 4-22 weeks after\n      implant surgery. Implants are exposed during 27-48 weeks after placement and abutments\n      connected for fabricating dental prostheses. Approximately 8 weeks are needed to fabricate\n      the implant supported prosthesis.\n\n      Patients complete quality of life and other questionnaires prior to and at 8-21 weeks after\n      surgery, 16 weeks after conventional denture insertion, and then 16 weeks after implant\n      supported prosthesis insertion.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months for at least 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 62 patients (22 requiring maxillectomy and 40 requiring\n      mandibulectomy) will be accrued for this study within 42 months."
