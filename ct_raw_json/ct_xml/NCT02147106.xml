  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NET) have a rare disease. Due to treating
      patients with a neuroendocrine tumor in 'NET knowledge centers'  patients often have to
      travel long distances for follow-up visits at the outpatient clinic. Patients whose medical
      condition allows videoconsultation could save time by replacing outpatient clinic visits
      through videoconsultation for receiving follow-up care. Therefore, in this study we aim to
      introduce videoconsultation as a alternative for follow-up outpatient clinic visits in NET
      patients.

      Objective: The primary objective is to assess if use of videoconsultation in follow-up care
      for NET patients is feasible. We hypothesize that videoconsultation is a suitable medium for
      providing follow-up care in NET patients. Secondary objectives are to explore the amount of
      time videoconsultation takes in comparison with outpatient clinic visits and the
      acceptability and satisfaction of physicians and patients with using videoconsultation in
      follow-up care.

      Study design: The present study is a single-centre prospective feasibility study.

      Study population: Adult NET patients under surveillance or treatment of the department
      Medical Oncology at the University Medical Centre Groningen (UMCG)  whose medical condition
      allows videoconsultation will be invited to participate.

      Intervention: Patient who give informed consent will participate in the study. Participants
      will receive follow-up care through videoconsultation instead of conventional visits at the
      outpatient clinic.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main endpoint is the feasibility of videoconsultation
      for follow-up care in NET patients.  We hypothesize that videoconsultation is a suitable
      medium for providing follow-up care.
