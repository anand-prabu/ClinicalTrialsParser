To identify, through both quantitative and qualitative methods, clinical correlates of\n      anxiety and points of intervention to reduce anxiety in patients with late-stage lung cancer\n      and their primary caregivers.\n\n      II. To apply these findings to develop a brief dyadic intervention based on Cognitive\n      Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to reduce anxiety in late-stage lung cancer patients and their\n      primary caregivers.\n\n      III. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the pilot intervention through number\n      of completed visits and assessment pre- and post- intervention.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Participants undergo cognitive behavioral therapy over 1 hour once weekly for a total of 6\n      sessions. Sessions are tailored to patient and caregiver cognitions and approach and\n      avoidance behaviors.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 1 week."
