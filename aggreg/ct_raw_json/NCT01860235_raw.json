Patients were randomized to a sequence of four anesthetics: 25 mg/g\n      lidocaine and 25 mg/g of 5% prilocaine (EMLA\u00ae), injectable 2% lidocaine, topical 2%\n      benzocaine, or placebo. Pain and discomfort were measured using a Visual Analogue Scale\n      (VAS) and Verbal Scale (VS). Patient satisfaction with anesthesia was also determined at the\n      end of each treatment session."
