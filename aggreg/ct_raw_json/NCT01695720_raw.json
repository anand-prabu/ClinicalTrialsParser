The study will compare VSI's accuracy to MRI's in diagnosing the same injuries.\n\n      The hypothesis is the VisionScope Imaging system will be able to provide direct\n      visualization and diagnostic images of inside the joint capsule space without fluid\n      distention in the knee.

This study will provide feedback on the ability of the VisionScope system to\n      potentially eliminate the need for MRI scans.  Additionally, a cost-analysis comparison\n      between the use of VSI vs. MRI for the diagnosis of orthopaedic knee injuries will be\n      conducted.
