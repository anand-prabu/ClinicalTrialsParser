Both groups will remain, overnight in the metabolic chamber and have the clamp procedure. Exercise training is exactly the same for both groups.\nThose who select the muscle biopsies will complete this test a week following the metabolic room calorimeter visit.\nThose who select the Non-Biopsy group, in lieu of the biopsy test, will complete an Activities of Daily Living (ADL) test that involves sub-maximal VO2 assessment. The participants will also be asked to where an accelerometer home for 4 consecutive days after the ADL test."

Secondary goals are to\n      evaluate exercise difficulty during moderate intensity exercise and high interval exercise\n      as well as difficulty of activities of daily living and free living physical activity\n      following rest, moderate intensity exercise and high interval exercise.\n\n      A secondary study is designed to evaluate potential mechanism.  Hypotheses are that changes\n      in muscle lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, fat and cellular insulin signals will be\n      increased following the high intensity interval exercise. In addition, these changes will be\n      related to changes in insulin sensitivity and increases in protein metabolism and muscle\n      damage."
