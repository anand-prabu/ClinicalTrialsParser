Post-delivery, oxytocin is commonly administered as an\n      IV bolus and/or infusion. No previous studies have accurately assessed differences in\n      oxytocin infusions after delivery in patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery. Thus\n      the study aim is to investigate which infusion rate can optimally provide adequate\n      maintenance of uterine tone during Cesarean delivery while being associated with minimal or\n      no maternal side-effects."
