            "textblock": "This research study is evaluating a drug called Palbociclib in combination with endocrine\n      therapy as a possible treatment for hormone receptor positive breast cancer.\n\n        -  Palbociclib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing. Palbociclib blocks\n           activity of two closely related enzymes (proteins that help chemical reactions in the\n           body occur), called Cyclin D Kinases 4 and 6 (CDK 4/6). These proteins are part of a\n           pathway, or a sequence of steps which is known to regulate cell growth. Laboratory\n           testing has suggested palbociclib may stop the growth of hormone receptor positive\n           breast cancer.\n\n        -  Endocrine therapy prevents breast cancer cell growth by blocking estrogen stimulation.\n           During this study endocrine therapy will either be tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor.\n           It is standard of care for premenopausal women to take tamoxifen and for postmenopausal\n           women to take either an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen after a diagnosis of hormone\n           receptor positive breast cancer."

These tests will be used to determine if the\n           participant is having any side effects related to the study drug.\n\n        -  Electrocardiograms (EKG): The participant will have an EKG performed on the first day\n           of the first three months of therapy. After that, the participant will have an EKG\n           every other month until the end of the first year of therapy.
