  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the study is to measure in the intact human heart, the alterations in
      gene expression over time that are associated with reverse remodeling in response to
      β-blockade. The second goal is to investigate the signaling mechanisms which in turn are
      responsible for these changes in gene expression, and the third goal is to determine the
      relationship between intrinsic systolic dysfunction and remodeling of the left ventricle.
      This will be accomplished by measuring ventricular size, function, and gene expression in
      myocardial tissue samples obtained by percutaneous biopsy prior to initiation of β-blockade
      and at 3 and 12 months after start of therapy. The specific Aims and Hypotheses to be tested
      are:

        1. Aim: Determine the changes in gene expression associated with changes in intrinsic
           systolic function and with functional decompensation in the intact, failing human
           heart.

           a. Hypothesis: Changes in the expression of select genes precede or accompany changes
           in left ventricular systolic function in humans with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy
           (IDC).

        2. Aim: Identify signaling mechanisms responsible for alterations in expression of key
           genes involved in mediation of ventricular hypertrophy or contractile dysfunction.

           a. Hypothesis: Myocardial-failure-associated regulation of select messenger ribonucleic
           acids and proteins are related to left ventricular wall stress and neurohormonal
           signaling.

        3. Aim: In the relationship between contractile dysfunction and dilatation/remodeling,
           determine the relationship between contractile dysfunction and structural remodeling.

           b. Hypothesis: the contractile dysfunction is primary and structural remodeling
           secondary.
