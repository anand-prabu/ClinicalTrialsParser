            "textblock": "Falling is an important problem among community-dwelling elderly. The number of falls and\n      concomitant health costs will rise within an aging population. Fall related injuries and\n      fear of falling decrease mobility and have a negative impact on social functioning, mood,\n      wellbeing and autonomy. Research from a medical perspective has concentrated on case finding\n      and fall prevention. Currently, insufficient possibilities are available for elderly and\n      caregiver to asses and improve their own mobility and fall risk. The Senior Step Study aims\n      to provide a tool for elderly to improve their self-management abilities in monitoring and\n      improving mobility and fall risk.\n\n      The researchers expect that elderly in the intervention group will be more aware of their\n      own mobility and fall risk, and will therefore experience more autonomy, better mental\n      wellbeing, and better quality of life. We expect this to reflect in less demands made on\n      healthcare by the elderly.\n\n      150 elderly living at home, in a home for the elderly, and elderly who regularly attend\n      activities in a community home, are asked to participate in the study. During the six months\n      of the study, subjects will receive weekly telephone calls from the computerized falls\n      telephone. The intervention group will measure their normal gait speed measured over 4\n      meters, using the mobility feedback device once a week, and use the feedback given by this\n      mobility feedback device to perform exercises from the instruction book. Activity diaries\n      allow them to register the type and duration of the exercises."
