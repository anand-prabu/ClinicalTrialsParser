Baseline evaluation of LVEF prior inhibitor of therapy\n\n        2. Serial assessment of LVEF using the same modality.\n\n      There is no clear international guidelines on the frequency and method of LVEF assessment.\n\n      Cardiac function is usually measured by using (ECHO) echo cardiography and multiple-gated\n      acquisition (MUGA) The patient should be assessed with the same techniques during treatment\n      to avoid stressing the myocardium by the use of exercise or ionotropic agent, before\n      measuring LVEF to prevent earlier evidence of cardiotoxicity. Changes in the early atrial\n      (E/A) filling ratio reflect ventricular compliance and may predict diastolic dysfunction and\n      so decline in LVEF.\n\n      Diastolic dysfunction seems to be predictive of cardiac morbidity and mortality.\n\n      Trials with adjuvant trastuzumab use the rules for stopping cardiotoxic agents.
