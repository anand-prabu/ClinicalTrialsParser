            "textblock": "Study Drug Administration:\n\n      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take LCL161 by mouth on\n      Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle, +/- 3 days.  You will fast for 2 hours before and 2\n      hours after taking LCL161.  This means you will have no food during this time.  You will be\n      able to have about 8 ounces of fluids such as water, milk, or non-citrus juices.\n\n      Each cycle is 28 days.\n\n      If you vomit a dose of LCL161, do not make up the dose.\n\n      During Cycle 1, you will take your dose of study drug at the clinic.  If your doctor thinks\n      it is needed, you will stay at the clinic for 8 hours after your first dose of study drug\n      and then for 4 hours after the next 3 weekly doses.\n\n      For cycles 2 and beyond, you will take the study drug at home.  You should bring any unused\n      study drug with you to each study visit.  It is very important that you take the study drug\n      just as the doctor tells you to.  Do not miss any tablets.\n\n      If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will be given standard drugs to help decrease the\n      risk of side effects.  You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are\n      given and their risks.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      On Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will have a physical exam.\n\n      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam\n\n        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, urine will be collected for routine tests.\n\n        -  You will complete the symptom questionnaires.\n\n      If your doctor agrees, beginning with Cycle 4, some of the Day 1 visits may take place at\n      your local doctor's office.   You will not have to fill out the questionnaires at your local\n      doctor's office.  The study staff will also call you about 1 time a month.  You will be\n      asked how you are feeling and about any side effects you may be having.  This phone call\n      should take about 10-15 minutes.  You will return to MD Anderson every 3 cycles (Cycles 6,\n      9, 12, and so on).\n\n      On Day 1 of Cycle 3 and then every 6 cycles (Cycles 9, 15, and so on), you will have a bone\n      marrow biopsy and/or aspirate to check the status of the disease and for cytogenetic\n      testing.\n\n      If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may be asked to return to the clinic more often.\n\n      Length of Treatment:\n\n      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best\n      interest.  You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if\n      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.\n\n      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up call.\n\n      End-of-Treatment Visit:\n\n      Within 7 days after you are finished taking the study drug:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n        -  You will complete the symptom questionnaires.\n\n      Follow-up Call:\n\n      About 30 days after the end-of-treatment visit, the study staff will call you to ask how you\n      are feeling and about any side effects you may be having.  This phone call should take about\n      10-15 minutes.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  LCL161 is not FDA approved or commercially available.\n      It is currently being used for research purposes only.  The study doctor can explain how the\n      study drug is designed to work.\n\n      Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study.  All will take part at MD Anderson."

Highly effective contraception\n             methods include: Total abstinence or Male partner or female sterilization or\n             Combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c, or b+c): a.

Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse while taking the drug and\n             for 3 months after stopping study drug and should not father a child in this period.\n             A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery\n             of the drug via seminal fluid."
