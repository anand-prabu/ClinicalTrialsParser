  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increased inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been recently
      implicated in migraine. Inflammation may be a key player in the pathophysiology of migraine
      by altering blood-brain barrier (BBB) function. As an inflammation induced MMP, MMP-9 is
      involved in both BBB disruption and neuropathic pain, and is largely derived by neutrophil
      degranulation during neutrophil-BBB interaction. The tetracycline group of antibiotics may
      suppress MMP production and neutrophil degranulation. This study aims to investigate known
      neuroinflammatory biomarkers with a focus on BBB breakdown during acute migraine attacks and
      assess marker responses to conventional treatment (triptans) and novel MMP targeted therapy
      (doxycycline). This pilot project data will supplement future projects investigating novel
      therapeutic strategies such as MMP inhibitors in both migraine acute treatment and
      prevention.
