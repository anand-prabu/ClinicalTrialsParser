  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mood journaling is a cornerstone of self-management in major depressive disorder (MDD).
      Research over the last decade has shown that electronic mood journals are superior to paper
      ones. One potential advantage of mental health telemetry (MHT), which use cell phones to
      collect mood journal data, is that electronic journal data can easily be converted into
      graphical records, allowing people living with MDD to readily spot trends, correlations, or
      patterns in ways that would be quite challenging using paper diaries. This information
      should make it easier to recognize and evaluate changes in mental health status -- the first
      two steps in the process of self-management. The investigators will develop and deploy a
      visualization module for patients with which to explore their own MHT data sets on the same
      cell phones which they record their journals, and test the investigators hypotheses that
      their enhanced MHT system will (i) improve patients' ability to self-manage MDD and (ii)
      enhance their quality-of-life.

      The study is a non-randomized, un-blinded, A-B-A' (modified single-subject withdrawal
      design, with user choice of treatment or withdrawal in the A' stage) study, to explore the
      utility of MHT as a tool for enhancing self-management and QoL for persons living with MDD.
      The aims of this study are to explore the impact of MHT on subjects' self-management and
      QoL, and to gauge participants' perceptions of MHT's utility.

    <description>Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (QLESQ) scores at the end of the treatment-as-usual (two months) and active treatment (four months) phases. We will control for severity of mood symptoms (using mental health telemetry (MHT) composite depression scores) as a covariate of the magnitude of change in QoL outcomes because we expect that some, but not all, of the variance in QoL outcomes will be accounted for in particular by the severity of depression.</description>

    <description>Patients will be given software for Mental Health Telemetry (MHT), which allows them to record symptom intensity, hospital / ER visits, life events, etc., and to visualize their MHT data.  Patients will be encouraged to make MHT entries once daily at a pre-determined time while in this arm, and will be prompted via text message by the MHT software to do so.</description>

    <description>Patients exiting the MHT arm will be given the choice to continue with MHT for a further two months or whether to resume TAU (i.e., no further use of MHT) for the remaining two months.</description>

    <intervention_name>MHT</intervention_name>
    <description>MHT and visualizer contains mood information about the patient themselves, which allows for self management of the mood disorder. Self-management interventions promote early recognition of mood episodes, medication adherence and self-management skills which have shown to improve outcomes in depression. MHT encourages patients to take an active role by engaging in mood journaling, while making this information available in explorable form to the patient and his / her team of clinicians.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        We will recruit (n=113) age- (within 5 years) and sex-matched patients with a Diagnostic
        and Statistical Manual, 4th Ed. (DSM-IV) diagnosis of MDD, confirmed using the MDD section
        of the MINI.  We will recruit in blocks of 20 to ensure age- and sex matching before
        recruiting the next block. All recruits will own or use a web-enabled cell phone.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  self-disclosed illiteracy;

          -  blindness;

          -  inability to be successfully trained in the use of MHT
