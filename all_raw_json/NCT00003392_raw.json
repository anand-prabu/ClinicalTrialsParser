Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of high-dose chemotherapy and peripheral\n      stem cell transplantation in treating patients with recurrent or refractory metastatic\n      breast cancer."

Determine the effects on 2 year progression-free survival of a regimen\n      consisting of cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and filgrastim (G-CSF) to mobilize peripheral\n      blood progenitor cells (PBPCs), followed by 2 courses of carboplatin and paclitaxel followed\n      by 1 course of melphalan, each supported with PBPCs and G-CSF, in patients with recurrent or\n      refractory, advanced breast cancer. II. Evaluate the feasibility of administering multiple\n      courses of high dose chemotherapy in an outpatient setting for these patients. III. Evaluate\n      the rate of complete response to the high dose therapy in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive mobilization therapy consisting of\n      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour followed by paclitaxel IV over 3 hours, then filgrastim\n      (G-CSF) beginning 24 hours following completion of paclitaxel and continuing through the\n      last day of leukapheresis. Leukapheresis continues until an adequate number of CD34+ cells\n      is collected. Following cell count recovery, patients receive 3 courses of high-dose\n      chemotherapy: 2 courses of paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over 1\n      hour, with the first course generally within 21 days after completion of leukapheresis and\n      the second course 21-35 days after the first; then 1 course of melphalan IV infused over 30\n      minutes 21-35 days after the previous carboplatin dose. Each course of chemotherapy is\n      followed 24-48 hours later by the infusion of G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood progenitor\n      cells and G-CSF. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 96 evaluable patients will be accrued for this study over 3\n      years."
