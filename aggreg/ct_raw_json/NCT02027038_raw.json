            "textblock": "The sacroiliac joint is among the most frequently involved anatomical structure in low back\n      pain. Pelvic belt anatomy makes the sacroiliac joint more vulnerable to be involved in\n      chronic painful conditions. However, the anatomical and functional correlate of sacroiliac\n      joint pain is yet undetermined. According to the guidelines of International Association for\n      the Study of Pain (IASP), painful conditions should primarily be managed conservatively.\n\n      However, existing studies fail providing sound evidence on the effects of conservative\n      devices to therapy sacroiliac joint pain. In the study, a total of 17 patients suffering\n      from sacroiliac joint pain and 17 controls were investigated by means of magnetic resonance\n      imaging, EMG, health surveys and ground reaction force measurements.\n\n      A pelvic compression belt was administered in two levels of compression and the\n      corresponding magnetic resonance imaging, EMG and ground reaction force data were measured."
