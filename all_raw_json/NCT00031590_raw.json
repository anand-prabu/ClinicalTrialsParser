Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing\n      or die. Combining low-dose radiation therapy with combination chemotherapy may be effective\n      in treating primitive neuroectodermal tumor and medulloblastoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying giving low-dose radiation therapy together with\n      combination chemotherapy after surgery to see how well it works in treating children with\n      newly diagnosed primitive neuroectodermal tumor or medulloblastoma."

Beginning 1\n           week after the initiation of radiotherapy, patients receive vincristine IV weekly for 6\n           weeks.\n\n        -  Maintenance chemotherapy: Beginning 4 weeks after the completion of induction\n           chemoradiotherapy, patients receive two 6-week courses of regimen A as outlined below\n           alternated with one 6-week course of regimen B as outlined below for a total of 9\n           courses (6 courses of regimen A and 3 courses of regimen B).\n\n             -  Regimen A: Patients receive oral lomustine and cisplatin IV over 8 hours on day 0\n                and vincristine IV on days 0, 7, and 14.\n\n             -  Regimen B: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days 0 and 1 and etoposide IV\n                on days 0 and 1 and then orally on days 14-34.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
