The\n      ketogenic diet is indicated for management of seizures in patients with seizure disorders.\n      In this study, the ketogenic diet will be used to prevent or minimize gastrointestinal\n      side-effects of miglustat, and improve response to miglustat therapy. Patients with\n      infantile and juvenile gangliosidoses commonly suffer from seizure disorders, and use of the\n      ketogenic diet in these patients may therefore also improve seizure management."

            "textblock": "The infantile and juvenile forms of GM1 and GM2 gangliosidoses are neurodegenerative\n      conditions that are lethal during childhood. There are no known effective therapies\n      available for treatment of infantile and juvenile gangliosidoses. Studies of monotherapy\n      with miglustat for treatment of these conditions have demonstrated safety, but have not\n      demonstrated notable clinical improvement. To date, combination therapy for the infantile\n      and juvenile gangliosidoses has not been explored. This study will evaluate a multi-targeted\n      combination therapy for treatment of the gangliosidoses, using FDA approved therapies that\n      have demonstrated safety in children. It is the aim of this study to learn if combination\n      therapy using the \"Syner-G\" regimen (that is, synergistic enteral regimen for treatment of\n      the gangliosidoses) will show significant increase in overall survival and clinical benefits\n      in neurodevelopmental abilities in children with gangliosidosis diseases.\n\n      This study is planned as a 5-year longitudinal treatment study. Subjects will be started on\n      treatment regimen when they are enrolled in the study. Data will be collected during yearly\n      evaluations and at completion of study. Investigators may choose to stop therapy at any time\n      as clinically indicated for individual patients.\n\n      The Ketogenic Diet is a special diet that contains higher amounts of fat and lower amounts\n      of carbohydrate compared an average diet. The purpose of this is to help the miglustat be\n      more effective in the central nervous system and to help reduce seizures. The goal is to\n      have 4 parts of fat for every 1 part of protein/carbohydrate. Each research subject's\n      caregiver will work with a ketogenic dietitian to help their child to achieve this diet\n      goal.\n\n      Miglustat will be used to reduce the amount of ganglioside accumulation in the child's\n      cells. Miglustat is not FDA approved for treatment of the gangliosidoses. It is FDA approved\n      for a different inherited metabolic disease called Gaucher disease type I. The dose of\n      miglustat will increase every 2 days until the child reaches a goal dose of 300 mg per day.\n      It will take approximately 13 weeks to reach the full dose of miglustat. This dose titration\n      process may take longer if the child needs more time to adjust to each dose level."
