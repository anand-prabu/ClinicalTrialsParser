Determine the percentage of these patients with stable disease at\n      16 weeks after starting treatment with this drug. III. Assess the safety and tolerability of\n      this drug in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive RPI.4610 subcutaneously daily.\n      Treatment continues for 16 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease may continue treatment after 16 weeks.\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study."
