Evidence exists that patients\n      are eager to play an active role in decisions concerning their health. Recent evidence from\n      research supports the benefit of decision aides for consumers, especially those that were\n      accurate and refined to the specific problems of each patient.  In our proposed randomized\n      controlled trial (RCT), one group of patients in the study will have the opportunity to\n      drive choices within their healthcare model; but only after receiving useful information on\n      what the consequences of their selections will be. Patients will receive decision making\n      information to assist in making an informed choice. The structured information will organize\n      known results from the research literature to assist patients in understanding the likely\n      outcome of their condition and what they need to adequately manage their own care. The\n      control group of patients will receive the Physical therapist-directed care model that is\n      presently used and has shown success. Patient outcomes will involve patient self report of\n      improvement and whether or not the patient pursued care for the same condition over a 1 year\n      period of time."

Physician consult is not normally provided as an option for the control group, unless evidence exists within the examination to suggest the need from a mutually agreed upon examination scheme including identification of red flags between the PT and physician.  In the current model, because most of patients seen are diagnosed with non-specific LBP and do not require imaging or prescriptive medications, a majority are treated actively by the physical therapists-only during the initial visit.",
