  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of a 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)
      and interferon, which is able to stimulate the immune system to kill cancer cells, will help
      to increase tumor shrinkage in previously-treated metastatic gastrointestinal, kidney, or
      lung Cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interferon with continuous infusion 5-FU regimens have shown response rates ranging from
      0-43% in various cancers.  Monthly bolus 5-FU + interferon-alfa-2b has not undergone formal
      phase II testing.  In a small pilot study, a 5 consecutive day schedule of 5-FU and
      interferon-alfa-2b resulted in the limiting toxicities of diarrhea and mucositis. A more
      limited schedule was recommended.  Therefore, it is reasonable to examine such a schedule.
      In the current study, 5-FU will be followed by interferon-alfa-2b daily for 3 days to
      attempt to benefit from both the biochemical and immunologic mechanisms described above.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically-proven, metastatic gastrointestinal, kidney, or
             lung cancer who have had disease progression on at least two prior systemic
             therapies.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2 and estimated survival of at least 3 months.

          -  Patients must be felt to have recovered from effects of prior therapy, such as past
             expected WBC nadir for chemotherapy (&gt; 2 weeks for most agents, &gt; 6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin-C)

          -  Patient consent must be obtained prior to entrance onto study.

          -  White blood count &gt; 3500/mm3; platelet count of at least 100,000/mm3; hemoglobin &gt;
             9.0 gm/dl; bilirubin, AST, ALT less than 3 times the upper limit of normal; serum
             creatinine &lt; 1.8.

          -  Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents are not permitted during the course of
             the study.  Patients must have received no corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             medications at least 2 weeks prior to entrance on-study.

          -  Patients with elevated temperatures &gt; 100.5 degrees F, must have sources of occult
             infection excluded.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and must take
             adequate precautions to prevent pregnancy during treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of significant cardiovascular disease including history of recent (&lt; 6
             months) myocardial infarction, uncompensated congestive heart failure, primary
             cardiac arrhythmias (not due to electrolyte disorder or drug toxicity, for example)
             beyond occasional PVC's, angina, or cerebrovascular accident.

          -  Prior history of psychiatric disorder that could be exacerbated by interferon therapy
             or which could preclude completion of this therapy.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to interferon alfa or fluoropyrimidines.

          -  History of severe debilitating pulmonary disease, such as chronic obstructive
             pulmonary disease requiring continuous oxygen therapy.

          -  History of autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppression.

          -  Documented inflammatory joint or systemic inflammatory disease (such as Lupus) which
             could be exacerbated by interferon therapy.
