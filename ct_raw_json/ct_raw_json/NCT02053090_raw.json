Participants will be informed that they should not start additional treatments until the end of the study and complementary and alternative treatments won't be covered until the last session. Participants will also receive a digital video disk (DVD) covering stretching appropriate for fibromyalgia patients and will be asked to incorporate the DVD over the next 10 weeks."
