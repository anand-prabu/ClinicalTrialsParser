  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip VISION (Pilot Study) is a Prospective Observational Cohort Study to evaluate the
      incidence of overall and cause-specific mortality among consecutive patients aged ≥ 18 years
      presenting with hip fracture to the Juravinski Hospital of the Hamilton Health Sciences.
      This pilot study will assess the feasibility of a larger prospective international cohort
      study. After eligibility has been confirmed and informed consent has been obtained,
      participants will be registered in the study. Troponin level, complete blood counts and
      serum creatinine level will be collected at day 1 through day 10 post admission. CAM
      instrument will be employed at admission and once daily post admission day 1 through day 10.
      FIM Instrument will be administered within 72 hours of admission to establish pre-fracture
      functional independence and disability. Patients will be contacted by research personnel by
      telephone 30 days after study registration.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients aged ≥ 18 years with hip fractures (i.e. fractures involving the subcapital,
             femoral neck, or intertrochanteric regions), treated either operatively or
             non-operatively

          2. Mechanism of injury consistent with either:

               1. A fall from a standing height or;

               2. Another mechanism of injury which, in the clinical judgment of an orthopedic
                  surgeon, would impart the same or less traumatic energy as a fall from a
                  standing height

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with fractures isolated to the proximal femoral shaft, with no involvement
             of the intertrochanteric, femoral neck, or subcapital region

          2. Patients with hip fractures resulting from high energy mechanisms, such as motor
             vehicle accidents or falls from a substantial height

          3. Patient who refuse 30-day or 6-month follow up

          4. Patients who refuse to consent either by themselves or through a substitute
             decision-maker (for patients unable to consent, we will use a deferred consent
             process, as described below).
