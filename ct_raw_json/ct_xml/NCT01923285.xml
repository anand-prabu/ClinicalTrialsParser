    <description>The AXIUM Neurostimulator System is an investigational spinal cord stimulation device that is designed to stimulate the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) of the spine located on the back surface of the spinal cord where nerves exit the backbone.  The device has 2 parts that are placed surgically (implanted) : 1) a pulse generator which is placed under the skin in the buttocks or abdomen, and 2) up to four wires (leads) that have one end attached to the pulse generator, and the other end secured to the tissue near the target treatment area.</description>

          3. Subject has chronic, intractable pain of the lower limb(s) for at least 6 months

          4. Subjects are diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and/or peripheral
             causalgia

          5. Subjects have a minimum VAS greater than or equal to 60 mm in the area of greatest
             pain in the lower limbs.

          6. Subject has failed to achieve adequate pain relief from at least 2 prior
             pharmacologic treatments from at least 2 different drugs classes

          7. Subject has had stable neurologic function in the past 30 days

          8. In the opinion of the Investigator, the subject is psychologically appropriate for
             the implantation of an active implantable medical device

          9. Subject is able to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Back pain is the greatest region of pain as measured on the baseline VAS.

          2. Female subject of childbearing potential is pregnant/nursing, plans to become
             pregnant or is unwilling to use approved birth control

          3. Subject has exhibited escalating or changing pain condition within the past 30 days
             as evidenced by Investigator examination

          4. Subject is currently involved in medically related litigation, including workers
             compensation

          5. Subject has had corticosteroid therapy at an intended site of stimulation within the
             past 30 days

          6. Subject's pain medication(s) dosage(s) are not stable for at least 30 days

          7. Subject has had radiofrequency treatment of an intended target DRG within the past 3
             months

          8. Subject has previously failed spinal cord stimulation therapy

          9. Subject currently has an active implantable device including ICD, pacemaker, spinal
             cord stimulator or intrathecal drug pump or subject requires magnetic resonance
             imaging (MRIs) or diathermy

         10. Subject has pain only within a cervical distribution

         11. Subject has cognitive, physical or sensory impairment that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may limit their ability  to operate the device

         12. Subject currently has an indwelling device that may pose an increased risk of
             infection

         13. Subject currently has an active systemic infection.

         14. Subject has, in the opinion of the investigator, a medical comorbidity that
             contraindicates placement of an active medical device

         15. Subject has participated in another clinical investigation within 30 days

         16. Subject has a coagulation disorder or uses anticoagulants that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, precludes participation

         17. Subject has been diagnosed with cancer in the past 2 years

         18. Imaging (MRI, CT, x-ray) findings within the last 12 months that, in the
             Investigator's opinion, contraindicates lead placement

         19. Subject is a prisoner
