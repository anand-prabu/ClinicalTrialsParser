    <textblock>
      Between 6% and 30% of people who harm themselves repeat this self-harm within the following
      12 months. The investigators know that people who harm themselves are much more likely to
      commit suicide, but the investigators have no clear evidence about the best way to reduce
      the likelihood of someone harming themselves again.

      Text messaging is now a common form of communication. Previous research has shown us that
      the investigators can use text messages for different types of health care interventions.
      Examples of this include reminding patients of medical appointments,  delivering test
      results, to check patient side effects following treatment and to reduce depressive symptoms
      in patients with depression and alcohol problems. The Samaritans have introduced interactive
      text messages (where you can have a conversation by text with their service) and have noted
      an increasing use of this contact with their service.

      This research study is taking place to find out if using supportive and interactive text
      messages can reduce further episodes of self-harm in patients who present to the Emergency
      Department (ED) with self-harm.

      The investigators hypothesize that supportive, informative and interactive text messages
      delivered to patients discharged from an ED after an episode of self-harm will significantly
      reduce the frequency and intensity of thoughts of self-harm and self-harming behaviour in
      patients compared with those receiving only follow-up treatment as usual. A secondary
      hypothesis is that patients receiving the text messages will report a favourable experience
      and an overall satisfaction with the system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Repetition of  self-harm is common, ranging from 6% to 30% in 12 months. Repetition is
      strongly associated with subsequent suicide and has important implications for healthcare
      resources. In every country including Ireland, fatal suicide attempts rank among the top ten
      causes of death for individual of all ages and one of the three leading causes of death in
      the 15 -35 years age group.

      Previous studies of interventions to reduce the repetition of self-harm in unselected
      patient groups have been unsuccessful in reducing the proportion of repeaters. These
      interventions have included the use of antidepressants, problem solving, intensive care with
      outreach, an emergency card, psychosocial crisis intervention, and guaranteed inpatient
      shelter in cases of emergency. In a study involving the use of low cost postcards after an
      episode of self-poisoning, although no significant difference in the proportion of
      individual patients who repeated self-harm were detected, there was a clinically and
      statistically significant reduction in the number of events per individual by about 50%.

      Only a few non-pharmacological interventions have been reported to be effective in reducing
      repetition in selected subsets of populations with  self-harm including; partial
      hospitalization, dialectical behaviour therapy and psychodynamic interpersonal therapy.
      These interventions are all resource intensive and therefore may only be applicable to
      carefully selected patients.

      Given the recent global financial crisis with consequent diminution of health care
      resources, interventions are needed that could be delivered economically to entire
      populations of patients who self-harm. In light of the growing interest in using text
      messages as an intervention in healthcare, the investigators will focus in this study on
      exploring the potential for using text messages to reduce repeat self-harm in patients
      presenting to the Emergency Department (ED).

      There is established research evidence for using text messages to remind patients of
      scheduled medical appointments, to coordinate medical staff,to deliver medical test results
      and to monitor patient side effects following treatment.

      In a review of the literature on the use of text messaging for clinical and healthy
      behaviour interventions, Wei et al. (2011) found that among 16 randomized controlled trials,
      10 reported significant improvement with interventions and six reported differences
      suggesting positive trends.  In one meta-analysis of four randomised trials of mobile
      phone-based interventions for smoking cessation, it was reported that text message
      interventions resulted in a significant increase in short-term self-reported quitting (RR of
      2.18, 95% CI 1.80 to 2.65). In the same review, when data from an internet and a mobile
      phone programme were pooled and meta-analysed, they found significant increases in both
      short-, and long-term, self-reported quitting (RR of 2.03, 95% Conficence Intervals (CI)=
      1.40 to 2.94).

      In a study of text message services based on qualitative interviews with 12 young people,
      the aim of which was to  provide young people with information on cannabis and help them to
      reduce their consumption of the drug, participants reported that they saw the messages as
      flexible and discrete, and as being personally meant for them. They paid more attention to
      the messages than they did to mass approaches such as public information broadcasts on TV.
      Along with other factors, the participants reported feeling motivated to decrease their
      level of cannabis abuse and to maintain a reduced level. .

      In  another  study, young adults in 3 urban EDs (n= 45; aged 18 to 24 years, 54% women) who
      were identified as hazardous drinkers by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification
      Test-Consumption Score were randomly assigned by the researchers to weekly text
      message-based feedback with goal setting (Intervention), weekly text message-based drinking
      assessments without feedback (Assessment), or to a control who received no text messages.
      At 3 months, they found that participants who were exposed to the text message-based
      intervention had 3.4 (Standard Deviation (SD)= 5.4) fewer heavy drinking days in the last
      month and 2.1 (SD 1.5) fewer drinks per drinking day when compared to baseline.

      In a recent randomised trial in Ireland of supportive text messages for patients with
      depression and comorbid alcohol use disorder, there was a trend towards finding a greater
      cumulative abstinence duration in the group that received twice daily supportive text
      messages compared to the control group who only received fortnightly tank you text messages:
      88.3 (SD=6.2) vs. 79.3 (SD=24.1), t=1.78, df=48, p=0.08. In this trial, after adjusting for
      baseline scores, patients in the supportive text message group also had significantly lower
      Beck's Depression Inventory Scores compared to the control groups; 8.5 (SD=8.0) vs. 16.7
      (SD=10.3) respectively, F (1, 49) = 9.54, p=0.003, Æžp2=0.17.

      In a study by Owens et al. (2010) to engage a group of self-harmers in the development of a
      text-messaging intervention to reduce repetition of self-harm, three broad categories of
      message emerged, namely, those that affirmed or validated emotions (e.g. &quot;it's ok to feel
      angry&quot;), those that prescribed actions, distractions or cognitive strategies (e.g. &quot;call
      Samaritans,&quot; &quot;have a warm bath&quot;,&quot; take it a minute at a time&quot;) and those that were
      interrogative or designed to initiate dialogue (e.g. &quot;do you want to talk?&quot;). They also
      found that the group were unable to reach an agreement on a set of messages that might work
      in all circumstances to reduce the urge to self-harm or to enable people to feel cared for,
      concluding instead that text messages may need to be individualised. A major limitation of
      this study was its small sample size of only 8 people. Furthermore, participants in this
      study only reported how they envisaged they would respond to text messages rather than how
      they actually responded to text messages which could vary significantly from what is
      reported.  In the recent randomised trial in Ireland of generic supportive text messages for
      patients with depression and comorbid alcohol use disorder,  20 of the 24 patients (83%)
      reported that the intervention had played a useful role in helping to improve their mental
      health.

      Recently, the Samaritans in Ireland introduce a limited interactive text message programme
      for patients who experience suicidal ideation. This service allows clients to receive
      support when in crisis via an interactive text messaging programme from a trained volunteer.

      After an extensive review of the literature using Google Scholar, MEDLINE, Pub Med, ERIC,
      Web of Science, Science Direct and PsychINFO, no published randomised trial was found on the
      use of text messages delivered via mobile phone as an intervention to address suicidal
      ideation and repeat self-harm in patients presenting with self-harm to the ED. Thus, the
      investigators seek to determine if text messaging is a useful and effective strategy to help
      reduce the frequency and intensity of thoughts of self-harm and depressive symptoms after
      patients are discharged from an ED following a presentation with self-harm.

      The investigators hypothesize that supportive, informative and interactive text messages
      delivered to patients discharged from an ED after an episode of self-harm will significantly
      reduce the frequency and intensity of thoughts of self-harm and self-harming behaviour in
      patients compared with those receiving only follow-up treatment as usual. A secondary
      hypothesis is that patients receiving the text messages will report a favourable experience
      and an overall satisfaction with the system.

Supportive text messages will mainly target relieving the patients of mood symptoms and providing them with strategies for dealing with suicidal thoughts while the informative ones will provide patients with a dedicated mobile phone number through which they can receive interactive support from the Samaritans. The text messages will encourage participants to text the Samaritans in times of crisis. Please see appendix I for examples of the relevant text messages.</description>
