      A Phase II, Open Label, Single-arm Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of AZD9291 in
      Patients with Locally Advanced/Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer whose Disease has
      Progressed with Previous Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Therapy
      and whose Tumours are Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutation and T790M Mutation Positive

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open label, single arm study assessing the safety and efficacy of
      AZD9291 (80 mg, orally, once daily) in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Epidermal
      Growth Factor Receptor mutation positive and T790M mutation positive NSCLC,who have
      progressed following prior therapy with an approved Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
      Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) agent. Patients must agree to provide a biopsy for
      central confirmation of T790M mutation status following confirmed disease progression on the
      most recent treatment regimen.  The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy
      of AZD9291 by assessment of Objective Response Rate according to RECIST 1.1 by an
      Independent Central Review.

             field of radiation within 4 weeks; current treatment with potent inhibitors of CYP2C8

          -  Unresolved toxicities from prior therapy.

          -  Unstable spinal cord compression/brain metastases.

          -  Severe/uncontrolled systemic diseases, including uncontrolled hypertension, bleeding
