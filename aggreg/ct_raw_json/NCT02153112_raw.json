The norovirus vaccine is being tested to assess different formulations of the\n      vaccine that will then be further developed. This study will look at the number of\n      antibodies to norovirus formed in children, toddlers and infants who are administered\n      different formulations of the norovirus vaccine.\n\n      The study will enroll approximately 1210 participants. Participants will be randomly\n      assigned (by chance) to one of eleven treatment groups\u2014which will remain undisclosed to the\n      participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need).\n\n      All participants in Cohort 1 will be vaccinated on Day 1 and Day 29 of the study, and all\n      participants in Cohort 2 will be vaccinated on Day 1, Day 56, and Day 112. All treatment\n      groups in Cohort 1 will receive either one dose of the norovirus vaccine, or two doses. One\n      treatment group in Cohort 2 will receive 2 doses of the norovirus vaccine, and the other\n      group will receive 3. In order to keep the treatment undisclosed to the participant and the\n      doctor in Cohort 1, those randomized to the one-dose groups will receive the norovirus\n      vaccine on Day 1, followed by a dose of placebo vaccine on Day 29. In order to keep the\n      treatment arms undisclosed to the participant and the doctor in Cohort 2, those randomized\n      to the two-dose groups will receive the norovirus vaccine on Day 1 and Day 56, followed by a\n      dose of placebo vaccine on Day 112. Placebo vaccine is saline solution. Participants will be\n      asked to record any symptoms that may be related to the vaccine or the injection site in a\n      diary card for 7 days after each vaccination.\n\n      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Finland, Panama, and Colombia. The overall time\n      to participate in this study is up to 393 days for participants in Cohort 1 and up to 477\n      Days for participants in Cohort 2. Participants in Cohort 1 will make 7 visits to the\n      clinic, and participants in Cohort 2 will make 11 visits to the clinic."
