The data collection form for\n      this study will extract data, which include basic demographic characteristics of the\n      patients (such as age and educational attainment), family history of prostate cancer, other\n      medical conditions, history of prior prostate screening/ consultation for Lower urinary\n      tract Symptoms or prostate disease. The International Prostate Symptom scores (IPSS)\n      collected will be stratified according to mild (1-7), moderate (8-19) and severe (20-35) and\n      the Filipino version Quality of Life (QoL) ratings will be stratified according to Grade 1,\n      grade 2 and grade 3. DRE findings including the approximation of prostate size and prostate\n      characteristic findings will be clustered to normal in size (20grams or less) versus\n      enlarged (>20grams or 2 fingerbreadths in width), nodular vs non-nodular, doughy or hard,\n      and tender versus non-tender.\n\n      Participants will be classified according to the following :\n\n        1. Target population for screening or not :\n\n           Target population for screening is defined as Filipino males aged 40 years or older,\n           who also had no previous consultation for Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) or\n           prostate cancer screening in the past 12 months\n\n        2. Case Finding for significant LUTS or prostate cancer or not :\n\n      Case of LUTS or prostate cancer is defined as Filipino males aged 40 years or older with\n      IPSS > 8, OR, has abnormal Digital rectal exam (DRE) finding, which is defined as nodular OR\n      hard OR tender. However, DRE finding of an enlarged prostate but non-nodular, doughy in\n      character and non-tender will not be considered as a case of LUTS or prostate cancer\n      suspect).\n\n      Confidentiality of all data will be assured. The case report forms/ data collection form for\n      this study will not contain any patient identifiers. All patient records will be coded in\n      the electronic database as serial number and PUA-designated Institutional code (i.e. SLMC\n      #0001). Only the investigators of this study and other authorized personnel from PUA will be\n      given access to the study data. The PUA survey forms will be secured, filed and only\n      accessed in PUA secretariat building. The electronic database coded with the data from the\n      data collection from of this study will be set with password, and only the study\n      investigators have access to the password."
