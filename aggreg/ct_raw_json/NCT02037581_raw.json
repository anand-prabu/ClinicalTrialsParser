            "textblock": "The trial is carried out at the Psychosis Center of the Department of Psychiatry and\n      Psychotherapy and the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the University\n      Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE), which has the responsibility to treat all Child,\n      adolescent and adult patients within its catchment area of approximately 300.000 habitants.\n\n      The IC model was implemented into a network of the Psychosis Center of the University\n      hospital (UKE), private psychiatrists and psychologists of the UKE catchment area and other\n      outpatient facilities. As such, following health care structures are part of the model and\n      could be used by each patients and its relatives according to need:\n\n      Specialized inpatient units with attached day-clinics for psychotic disorders; Acute\n      inpatient units of both Departments; Specialized psychosis outpatient center with a variety\n      of diagnosis-specific evidence-based individual- and group therapies, low-threshold offers\n      to promote day structure (e.g., cooking, sport or art groups), an early detection and\n      intervention service with a mobile early detection team with professionals from the child-\n      and youth and adult psychiatry, possibility of peer-to-peer and relatives-to-relatives\n      counseling, relative groups.\n\n      A multidisciplinary assertive community treatment (ACT) team, which was implemented\n      according to guidelines of the Assertive Community Treatment Association and according to\n      the Dartmouth Assertive Community Treatment Scale (DACTS). Compared to the traditional ACT\n      model there are two important differences: (1) While traditional ACT models have a\n      responsibility for patients with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) patients\n      independent from the underlying diagnosis, the present model solely focus on patients with\n      psychotic disorders; (2) The fidelity of the ACT team was further increased by composing a\n      team of highly educated psychosis experts (i.e. consultant psychiatrists, psychiatrists,\n      psychologists, nurses, social worker). Members of the ACT team received diagnosis-specific\n      training in pharmacotherapy, cognitive behavioral (CBT), dynamic, and/or family\n      psychotherapy.\n\n      A specialized day-clinic for first-episode psychosis patients in the age range of 15-29\n      years managed by the child- and youth and adult psychiatry; A working support outpatient\n      center with outpatient and day-clinic treatment facilities; 20 private psychiatrists\n      participate in the treatment network of the IC model (their duties and responsibilities are\n      described below).\n\n      Further participants of the network are: a psychiatric nursing service, a specialized\n      housing support service and a specialized psychosis living unit.\n\n      Within this network, the main responsibility for the individual patient and his relatives is\n      generally allocated according to need and preferences to two specific members of the ACT\n      team, of which one has to be a psychiatrist responsible for pharmacotherapy. However, when\n      pharmacotherapy is stable and adherence assured, private psychiatrists are allowed to take\n      over this responsibility. In this case, the specific IC contract with the private\n      psychiatrists includes several quality assurance guidelines.\n\n      Briefly, the staff/client caseload ratio of a single full time employed ACT team member is\n      1:25. In any case, the first responsibility of the network is a broad assessment of the\n      psychotic disorder, comorbid psychiatric and somatic disorders, traumatic events, previous\n      service engagement and medication adherence, social problems, etc. Thereby, a need-adapted\n      treatment plan will be developed together with the patient, relatives and other caregivers.\n      If the patient starts IC during inpatient, transition from in- to outpatient care will be\n      organized. Participant, relatives and other caregiver re-ceive two telephone numbers: one of\n      the ACT therapists for all contacts within office hours (Monday to Friday from 8 am to 6 pm)\n      and a 24 hours crisis number for all emergencies or questions outside office hours. The\n      primary ACT/private psychiatrists subteam is responsible for high-frequent face-to-face\n      treatment contacts fostering continuity of care, coordinating treatment and social support\n      (case management), promoting and ensuring service engagement and medication adherence, and\n      offering intensive need-adapted individual psychotherapy at the earliest possible time\n      point. Crisis intervention is offered at any time and is always conducted by two ACT members\n      of which one is the primary ACT therapist. Access to other need-adapted and\n      diagnosis-specific evidence-based interventions is organized within the specialized\n      psychosis outpatient center or the work support center, e.g. psychoeducation groups, social\n      skills training, meta-cognitive training, bipolar psychotherapy groups, etc. Further, all\n      low-threshold interventions in the outpatient center could be used at any time. Thereby\n      day-clinic equivalent program could be organized while being in outpatient status. As many\n      of these patients are at risk for service disengagement and medication non-adherence, a\n      strict 'no-drop-out' policy is implemented including all admissions out of the catchment\n      area.\n\n      Primary Outcome:\n\n      Rate of psychofunctional remission after 12 months of treatment in integrated care (ACT and\n      hometreatment) versus standard care (SC, historic control group) for the treatment of\n      adolescents and young adults with early psychosis (12-29 years)\n\n      Rationale:\n\n      The primary Outcome measure ist the number of patients with psychofunctional remission over\n      at least 6 months(t2 - t1). Definition of symptomatic remission is according to the\n      standardized remission criteria(siehe Andreasen et al. 2005). Functional remission is\n      assessed as GAF \u2265 60. Psychofunctional remission is given, if both criteria are fulfilled\n      through 6 months.\n\n      Secondary Outcomes:\n\n      Investigation of the effects of integrated care compared with standard care on:\n\n      A. Improvement of psychopathology, daily function and quality of life, B. Improevemnt of\n      service engagement, compliance and satisfaction with care, C. Increase of Quality Adusted\n      Life Years (QALY's) through 12 months of treatment.\n\n      D. Duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) and pathway of care"
