  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CCTG 595 is a controlled, open-label, two-arm, randomized (1:1) clinical demonstration
      project to determine if the use of a text-message based adherence intervention (iTAB)
      improves retention and adherence to PrEP compared to standard of care (SoC) PrEP delivery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 400 HIV-uninfected men who have sex with men (MSM)and male to female (M to F)
      transgender individuals with recent high-risk transmission behavior will be enrolled into
      the study. Each subject will be followed for up to 48 weeks after enrollment of the last
      subject. The primary endpoint will be measured at 48 weeks.

      All subjects will start PrEP with TDF + FTC fixed dose combination given once daily.
      Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to either the iTAB text messaging adherence reminder
      intervention with SoC or the SoC alone arm. Subjects placed into the iTAB intervention arm
      will receive a personalized, automated texting system to maintain adherence and retention.
      Both groups will receive access to PrEP in accordance with standardized comprehensive
      methods of prescribing, risk reduction counseling, adherence counseling, and clinical
      assessments that include safety monitoring, as well as HIV and STD screening.

      TDF 300 mg + FTC 200 mg fixed dose combination will be given orally once daily starting at
      the baseline visit (month 0) and continued throughout the study.

    <description>CCTG 595 will compare adherence to fixed dose TDF/FTC, between subjects randomized to receive SoC plus text message reminders versus SoC, when used for pre-exposure prophylaxis among MSM at high risk for HIV acquisition.
The primary outcome is defined as a composite endpoint of remaining on PrEP and having adherence &gt; 90% over 48 weeks of follow-up. The adherence endpoint will be derived from the 4 day ACTG adherence assessment from each of the visits from week 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48. 'Adherent' will be defined as self-reported TDF/ FTC adherence of 90% or greater (at least 18 of 20 days). If a subject misses an adherence assessment within the window of a scheduled visit or discontinues study prior to week 48, then the missed visits will be counted no adherence for the time of that visit. All randomized subjects that were dispensed PrEP at baseline will be included in the modified intent-to-treat analysis.</description>

    <description>This proposal will perform a study of potential methods to improve adherence and retention by evaluating standard procedures versus the use of the iTAB platform.
All subjects will receive SoC that will include health education, clinical assessments, laboratory safety monitoring, STI and HIV screening, HIV risk reduction counseling, assessment of psycho-social barriers, adherence counseling, and completion of a computer based survey.</description>

    <description>Subjects assigned to the iTAB intervention will receive daily dosing reminders that will be sent for the first 6 weeks and then continue with reminders for the duration of the study.
Subjects will have visits with the study coordinator to introduce the iTAB texting system.
Once the time is identified, the text reminder system is automated. Patients will confirm medication taking via text responses to the personalized reminders. If a participant does not respond on three consecutive occasions, a high alert message (chosen by the participant) will be sent. If the subject does not respond to this message, the study coordinator would initiate phone calls to contact the subject and explore barriers.</description>
