Based on the study results,\n      guidelines recommend that preemptive antiviral therapy should be maintained for at least 6\n      months. Nevertheless, many clinicians apply the preemptive antiviral drugs for 1~2 years or\n      longer after final chemotherapy without definite evidences, and this practice increases the\n      medical expenditure a lot. Therefore, the investigators are going to find out the proper and\n      safe duration of preemptive antiviral therapy which can be a good reference in the future\n      practice."

            "textblock": "HBV reactivation in cancer patients is important not only for directly affecting severe\n      hepatic failure but also for delaying of the further cancer treatments which may cause\n      reduction of overall survival. Thus the guidelines according to the previous studies and\n      other follow-up of randomized studies revealed that patients with positive HbsAg should be\n      administered with preemptive antiviral therapy at least 6 month or more.\n\n      However, ideal duration for preemptive antiviral therapy to suppress viral reactivation and\n      withdrawal hepatitis is not clearly identified at present time. It is because previous data\n      just dealt with the efficiency of preemptive antiviral therapy, but most of them did not\n      analyze the outcomes after withdrawal of antiviral therapy. Frequent late-onset reactivation\n      hepatitis in association with preemptive antiviral therapy is mainly due to drug-resistance\n      or post-withdrawal manifestation. Drug-resistance was mainly associated with lamivudine\n      which is now substituted by entecavir or tenofovir which produce lower incidence of\n      resistance (< 1.2% at 6 years). Therefore, the only issue at present is withdrawal hepatitis\n      which may be due to early cessation of the antiviral drug."
