  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is a common condition that causes the secretion from
      meibomian glands in the eyelids to become blocked. Normally, the secretion helps to maintain
      a healthy tear film. In MGD, the tear film becomes unstable and often causes dry eye
      symptoms. Treatments often involve gently warming the eyelids to melt this blockage which
      prevents tears from spreading over the eye. Although there has been some research on
      application of heat with warm moist flannels, the Eye Bags potentially offers a simpler and
      more effective method of applying heat to the eyelids. This study will test the efficiency
      of these eyelid warming devices over a period of two weeks use in one eye compared to the
      other non-treated eye.

      Study Design

      Contralateral treatment study Randomised eye treated with heated eyebag in the morning and
      evening each day as per manufacturer's instructions Other eye acts as control with room
      temperature eyebag overlaid in same manner as treatment eye Investigators masked SMS
      messaging twice a day for 14 days to remind patients to use eyebag and collect 0-10 comfort
      score
