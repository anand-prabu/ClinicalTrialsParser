The\n      effects of exercise on their cognition, quality of life and balance ability are also\n      assessed. We will also examine if BDNF polymorphisms modulate mood changes in response to\n      exercise intervention. Focus groups will be organised at the end to find out the\n      facilitators and barriers in taking up exercise. The findings may offer an avenue of\n      intervention by providing a low cost, relatively safe and effective treatment for dementia\n      caregivers, which may in turn benefit the persons with dementia."
