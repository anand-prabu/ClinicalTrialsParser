It's still not clear whether one can achieve such success by\n      devoting greater attention to psychosocial factors.\n\n      OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether an ambulant intervention program with a behavioral\n      therapy approach would exert a long-term effect on cBP. Specifically, the effect on patients\n      with pronounced fear avoidance behavior and/or with psychosocial limitations was addressed.\n\n      DESIGN: Prospective, randomized controlled trial\n\n      SETTINGS, INTERVENTION:  64 patients were assigned to intervention group (IG) and 57 to\n      control group (CG). All were examined, informed about cBP, and were encouraged to stay\n      active and perform exercises according to specific instructions provided in a neck- or\n      back-book. The IG received 9 units of physiotherapy and 2 units of occupational therapy,\n      conducted with a behavioral therapy approach. Efficacy of treatment was evaluated after 6\n      and 58 weeks.\n\n      MEASUREMENTS: Pain (VAS), quantity of painkillers consumed, sick leave days,\n      Oswestry-Disability-Index (ODI), SF-36, FABQ."
