Group behavioral treatment or 2. No treatment.  Group treatment\n      modalities have the potential to reach a larger population of older women with urinary\n      incontinence, not only in the traditional medical settings, but also in community settings.\n      The investigators hypothesize that group behavioral treatment will be more effective than no\n      treatment.  The investigators hypothesize that the group treatment will be cost-effective\n      compared to no treatment."
