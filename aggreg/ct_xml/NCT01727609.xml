  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Survival of preterm infants has increased greatly over the years, so a major aim now is to
      improve the long term outlook for these babies and to avoid serious complications. The way
      babies are fed in early life affects short and long-term health and survival.

      Because the bowels of preterm infants have not matured, they cannot digest large volumes of
      milk feeds straight away. Until the gut matures, nutrition is provided by intravenous drip
      while the amount of milk given is gradually increased over time. Increasing the amount of
      milk rapidly may increase the risk of gut complications. Increasing the amount of milk given
      more slowly means that intravenous nutrition is needed for longer; there is an associated
      risk of infection proportional to the time the intravenous line is present in the
      bloodstream of these infants. Despite the importance of milk feeding preterm infants, there
      have been few studies to inform how best to balance these risks, and what the best way to
      increase feeds in these infants is - this study sets out to address this missing
      information.

      This study will compare two different rates of increase of milk feeds, one 'fast' and one
      'slow', both within rates currently used in UK neonatal units with the aim to find out if
      either rate gives better outcomes for the infants. Investigators will measure a variety of
      outcomes, such as survival without disability, infection, bowel problems, growth and
      long-term physical and mental development, as well as the impact on families and the NHS,
      including costs.

      The study will be led by an established team of researchers who have run similar studies
      before, and will use an established network of neonatal units that have taken part in
      previous studies. Investigators are confident that there will be enough families wishing to
      take part in this study.
