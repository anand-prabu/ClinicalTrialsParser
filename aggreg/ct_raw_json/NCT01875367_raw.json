Following administration of these four cycles, the\n      patient will decide whether or not to continue with the subcutaneous formulation of\n      trastuzumab every 3 weeks until progression. Since the randomization in the study until the\n      start with subcutaneous trastuzumab, patients will receive a treatment cycle of intravenous\n      trastuzumab as usual.\n\n      Main objective: Proportion of patients indicate a preference for the use of subcutaneous vs\n      intravenous trastuzumab.\n\n      This principal primary objective will be analyzed with the answers to questionnaire of\n      experiences and preferences of the patients (Principal endpoint) The duration of the study\n      has been estimated after 34 months."
