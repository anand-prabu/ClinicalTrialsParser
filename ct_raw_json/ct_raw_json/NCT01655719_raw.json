Response will be evaluated per RECIST. Safety measure are outlined in the protocol including weekly weigh ins, calls, labs, exams, etc.\nPart 2: A secondary protocol is then available to subjects who complete the main initial study with less than complete response per RECIST. They can undergo a radioiodine scan to see if the treatment with pioglitazone has sensitized their disease to radioiodine. If it has - they can pursue the radioiodine treatment."

Pregnant women are excluded from this study because pioglitazone is a U.S. Food and\n             Drug Administration Pregnancy Category C drug.  Because there is an unknown but\n             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the\n             mother with pioglitazone, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is\n             treated with pioglitazone.\n\n          8. No concurrent radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be given to the patient during the\n             administration of the study drug.\n\n          9.

Use of rifampin (strong CYP2C8 inducer) within 14 days of study Day 1.\n\n         13. Other current malignancy than the disease under study.\n\n         14.
