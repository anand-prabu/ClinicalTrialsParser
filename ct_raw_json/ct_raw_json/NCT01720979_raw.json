            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the world leading cause of disability in children (Winslade,\n      1998), causing deficits in motor function, neurocognition and adaptive behaviour (Anderson,\n      2001). Literature shows that age at injury is inversely related to the magnitude of deficits\n      following TBI, highlighting the vulnerability of children for the effects of TBI.\n\n      The neurocognitive consequences of paediatric TBI have primarily been characterised by\n      impairments in speed of information processing, attentional functioning and learning\n      (Babikian & Asarnow, 2009; Catroppa & Anderson, 2009), interfering with typical\n      neurocognitive development. We aim at elucidating the effects of TBI on neurocognitive\n      function and investigate the relations between neurocognitive deficits, academic achievement\n      and emotional and behavioural function, in order to improve our understanding of the\n      post-injury functioning of children that have suffered TBI.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      Patients with TBI will be compared to a control group consisting of orthopedically injured\n      patients. Orthopaedic control (OC) groups offer a better comparison to TBI patients than\n      typically developing children by controlling for TBI risk factors related to neurocognition\n      (e.g. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, socio-economic status), hospitalisation and\n      the type of injuries other than brain injuries.\n\n      Measures:\n\n      Neurocognitive tests of attention and learning. Standardised parental and teacher reports of\n      behavioural regulation. Standardised tests of academic achievement. Standardised test of\n      orientation and amnesia."
