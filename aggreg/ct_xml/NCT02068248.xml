  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research over the past several decades have linked the intake of dietary fiber with lower
      blood cholesterol levels. The distinction between soluble and insoluble fiber fractions
      emerged shortly after and there is now a general consensus that soluble fiber possesses the
      capacity to lower cholesterol. Since the discovery of the cholesterol lowering effects of
      soluble dietary fiber, there has been much debate as to the degree of cholesterol reduction
      from these fibers. In order to handle the inconsistencies a full and systematic review of
      the published literature was conducted by Brown et. al (1999). Results from this
      meta-analysis, concluded that 'increasing soluble fiber can make only a small contribution
      to lowering cholesterol.'

      Research is constantly progressing and new research findings may not always be consistent
      with older data. For example, results from new research are now challenging the previously
      approved health claims for soy foods and fatty acids. This is a major public health concern
      because if clinical evidence is not reliable, it could lead to harm. Since the publication
      of the meta-analysis by Brown et. al (1999) over a decade ago, scientists have continued to
      research the effects of soluble fiber on cholesterol levels with new technology and trial
      designs, therefore it is crucial to revisit the question of whether soluble fibers are
      effects at lowering cholesterol. The purpose of the study is to statistically review the
      full body of literature on soluble fibers and cholesterol levels and determine whether
      results remain consistent with the previous conclusions Brown et. al.

      A meta-analysis will be performed to assess the link between soluble fibers and serum
      cholesterol levels. Nutritionists now consider fiber to be an integral part of diet and
      disease. Results from this meta-analysis help address the question of whether soluble fibers
      have a role lowering serum cholesterol levels.
