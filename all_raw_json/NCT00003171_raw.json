Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of bryostatin 1. III.\n      Determine the duration of response and survival of patients receiving this therapy.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a two stage study. Patients receive bryostatin 1 by continuous infusion\n      over 72 hours every 14 days for 4 cycles. Responding patients may continue treatment in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete response\n      receive 2 additional cycles. Patients with no response receive 4 additional cycles. Patients\n      are re-evaluated after every 4 cycles.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 14 to 27 patients will be accrued within 2 years into this 2 stage study."
