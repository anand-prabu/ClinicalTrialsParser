            "textblock": "Background\n\n      Intervention (performed by specialist palliative care teams): The structured approach\n      intervention is based on NCCN Practice Guidelines for Palliative Care, part of Gold Standard\n      Framework (GSF) and the WHO definition of Palliative Care. It supports the assessment of\n      areas and complexity of concerns from the patient perspective, determining priorities and\n      structures the support needed. SENS stands for: Symptom-management, instruction for self\n      administration of medication etc. End of life decision-making: explicit definition of own\n      goals and priorities; Network organization including anticipatory planning of emergency\n      situations Support of the carers: implementation of support systems for the caring family\n      members The standardized intervention (based on prepared educational tool kit including a\n      patient prompt sheet) is performed by a palliative care physician and nurse collaboratively\n      after randomization and consent. It is undertaken as a baseline assessment and at least\n      every second month until death. In addition, patients will receive usual oncology care\n      throughout the study period (see below).\n\n      Usual Oncology care (performed by oncological out- and inpatient clinics): Usual care\n      incorporates a routine assessment according to national protocols, which assesses overall\n      symptoms and current complaints from other domains. Participants assigned to usual care may\n      meet with the palliative care service on request according to established practice but\n      without following the SENS approach (subgroup analysis will be performed).\n\n      Main eligibility criteria\n\n      Patients >/= 18 years of age who signed informed consent with understanding of the study\n      procedures and the investigational nature of the study with one of the following cancer\n      types:\n\n        -  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of any stage, or\n\n        -  Metastatic and locally advanced colorectal cancer not suitable for surgery\n           (tumour-board  decision), or\n\n        -  Metastatic prostate cancer, refractory to androgen blockage, or\n\n        -  Advanced breast cancer with visceral and/or brain metastasis Exclusion criteria\n\n        -  Presence of delirium or dementia or other reason for lack of ability to give informed\n            consent\n\n        -  Inability to communicate adequately in German\n\n        -  Patient's lack of accountability, inability to appreciate the nature, meaning and\n           consequences of the study and to formulate his/her own wishes correspondingly\n\n      Outcomes Primary outcomes\n\n        -  Distress over six month as measured with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network\n           (NCCN)     Distress thermometer Secondary outcomes\n\n        -  Quality of life as measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General\n           (FACT-G)\n\n        -  Palliative Outcome Scale (POS)\n\n        -  Overall survival\n\n        -  Location of death\n\n        -  Health care utilization\n\n      Objective\n\n      The primary objective of the trial is to determine the effectiveness of early palliative\n      care structured by SENS (a systematic, problem-based assessment system) in addition to\n      standard oncology care compared with standard oncology care alone to relieve distress in\n      patients with advanced cancer at the end of life.\n\n      The secondary objectives are to determine whether the introduction of SENS improves quality\n      of life and prolongs overall survival in these patients, reduces health care costs and\n      medical resource utilization.\n\n      The primary objective of the nested qualitative study is to identify characteristics and\n      reasons for the added value as well as failure of a compulsory problem-based assessment\n      system (SENS) in advanced cancer patients.\n\n      Methods\n\n      Design Multicenter, two-arm, parallel-group, randomized-controlled trial\n\n      Experimental arm:\n\n      Palliative care with a structured approach (SENS model) based on the\n      bio-psycho-social-spiritual model of care.
