The estimated duration is approximately 10 days during which time the patient will remain at the clinical facility.  The maximum number of days that a patient may remain in confinement is expected to be between 11 to 17 days.\nPart B: Eligible patients from Part A may continue into Part B which will begin immediately after or within 2 weeks of the patient completing Part A (ie, when the patient has met the criteria to be discharged from the clinic). Patients will receive alisertib tablets administered orally at a dose of 50 mg twice daily for 7 days in 21-day cycles."
