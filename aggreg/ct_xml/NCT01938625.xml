      The purpose of the study is to evaluate effect of steady-state (when the amount of drug
      administered (in a given time period) is equal to the amount of drug eliminated in that same
      period) simeprevir and daclatasvir on the steady-state pharmacokinetics (what a medication
      does to the body) of cyclosporine and tacrolimus when administered as a combinational
      regimen in post-orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) participants with recurrent hepatitis
      C virus (HCV) genotype 1b infection and effectiveness of a 24-week treatment regimen
      containing simeprevir, daclatasvir, and ribavarin (RBV) with respect to the proportion of
      HCV genotype 1b infected post-OLT participants achieving sustained virologic response 12
      weeks after end of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) and multicenter
      (study conducted at multiple sites) study. This study will be conducted in 2 parts. Both the
      parts of the study will consist of screening phase (4 weeks), treatment period (24 weeks),
      and a post-treatment follow-up (24 weeks). A total of 40 participants will be enrolled in
      Part 1 and Part 2 of the study. A minimum of 9 participants should be on cyclosporine as
      stable immunosuppressant therapy and a minimum of 9 participants should be on tacrolimus as
      stable immunosuppressant therapy. In Part 1 of the study, participants with Metavir score of
      F1-F2, will receive a combination of study drugs - simeprevir, daclatasvir, and ribavirin
      for 24 weeks. In Part 2 of the study, participants with Metavir score F1-F4 will receive a
      dosing regimen of study drugs based on the data from Part 1 of the study. Safety evaluations
      will include assessments of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, urinalysis,
      electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination. The total study duration for each
      participant will be approximately 52 weeks.

          -  Screening HCV ribose nucleic acid level greater than 10,000 IU/mL

          -  HCV treatment-naïve participants must not have received post orthotopic liver
             transplant treatment with any approved or investigational drug for the treatment of
             HCV

          -  Receiving stable immunosuppressant therapy (ie, no change in dose in the last month)
             with cyclosporine or tacrolimus for more than 3 months prior to the screening visit

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of acute or chronic hepatic decompensation after the liver transplantation
             (including ascites, bleeding varices or hepatic encephalopathy)

          -  Any liver disease of non-HCV etiology, including current evidence of graft rejection
             except the presence of liver steatosis

          -  Any other clinically significant disease that in the opinion of the investigator
             would be exacerbated by the known effects of ribavirin

          -  Coinfection with HCV of another genotype than genotype 1b, HIV type 1 or 2 (positive
             HIV-1 or HIV-2 antibodies test at screening), and hepatitis B virus (hepatitis B
             surface antigen positive)

          -  Multi-organ transplant that included heart, lung, pancreas, or kidney
