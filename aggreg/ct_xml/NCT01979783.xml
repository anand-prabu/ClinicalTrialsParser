  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transversus abdominis (TrA) and lumbar multifidus (LM) muscle have been proposed to play key
      role in stability of the lumbosacral spine. The muscles' functional and/or structural
      deficits have been linked to the low back pain (LBP) syndrome. Evaluation of the transversus
      abdominis and lumbar multifidus muscles' function in clinical practice is scarce and not
      well defined due to number of reasons. Surface electromyography of TrA and LM muscles, as a
      method of examining muscles function, is not involved in clinical routine. Rehabilitative
      Ultrasound Imaging (RUSI) of the TrA and LM, apart from providing information about their
      morphology, could be helpful in assessing their function. Since concentric muscle
      contraction results in the shortening and thickening of the muscle, evaluation of the
      potential association between muscle's morphometry, assessed by the ultrasound,  and
      electromyography, may be of potential clinical interest. However, this potential
      relationship is context-dependant. Our aim was to establish the difference in the thickness
      change of the TrA and LM muscle during activation in subjects with and without low back
      pain, and to establish the possible correlation between electromyography and the thickness
      change of these muscles assessed by ultrasound in both groups of subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Low back pain, with or without radiculopathy, that lasted  for at least 12 weeks, caused
        by prolapsed intervertebral disc (PID), confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The exclusion criteria for all participants were pregnancy,diabetes
        mellitus,corticosteroids administrated in one months or less prior to enrollment, spinal
        fractures, surgery, infectious diseases, tumors, spina bifida, advanced forms of spinal
        deformity, hip diseases, and neuromuscular disorders. Additional exclusion criteria for
        LBP participants were self-reported pain levels of less than 3 on the Visual Analog Scale
        to account for patients commonly encountered in clinical practice, and inability to remain
        in prone and supine hook-lying positions for 10 minutes each in order to ensure
        compliance.
