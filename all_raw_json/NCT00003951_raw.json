Determine the time to tumor progression\n      in patients receiving this drug. III. Determine the survival at 6 and 12 months of patients\n      receiving this drug. IV. Evaluate the quantitative and qualitative toxicities of this\n      regimen in this patient population. V. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of this drug in this\n      patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive DX-8951f IV over 30 minutes daily for 5 days. Courses repeat every\n      21 days. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n      Patients are followed every 3 months until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study."
