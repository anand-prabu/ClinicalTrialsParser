Compare the efficacy of adjuvant systemic fluorouracil with intraperitoneal\n      mitomycin vs systemic fluorouracil alone in terms of survival in patients with peritoneal\n      cancer originating from the colorectum.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to\n      center and mode of surgery. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I:\n      Patients undergo complete resection of tumor on day 0. Patients then receive mitomycin\n      intraperitoneally (IP) over 23 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IP over 24 hours on days 2-5.\n      Patients then receive one of three systemic chemotherapy regimens for 6 months: Regimen I:\n      Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil IV over 22 hours on\n      days 1 and 2. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks. Regimen II: Patients receive fluorouracil IV\n      continuously for 7 weeks. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks. Regimen III: Leucovorin calcium\n      and fluorouracil are administered as per standard procedure. Arm II: Patients receive\n      treatment as in arm I but without early intraperitoneal chemotherapy. Patients are followed\n      every 3 months for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 90 patients (45 per arm) will be accrued for this study."
