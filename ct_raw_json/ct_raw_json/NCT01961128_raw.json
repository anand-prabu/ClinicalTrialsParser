The\n      investigators are interested in studying this because research shows that women who exercise\n      regularly are less likely to develop breast cancer, but there is not very much information\n      explaining how exercise could affect breast cells in a way to prevent cancer from occurring.\n      In this research study the investigators will use a research technique called breast random\n      fine needle aspiration (RPFNA) to test breast cells for their shape and how they look. The\n      investigators will look at breast cells before and after a participant takes part in an\n      exercise program to see if the investigators are able to see any changes in breast cells\n      that could have happened due to the exercise program. This research will help us to develop\n      larger projects to see if exercise programs could be helpful in preventing breast cancer."

The primary feasibility endpoint will be assessed by the number of women with pre- and post-exercise RPFNA samples with sufficient cells (> 500) for analysis.  We require evidence that at least 60% of participants could provide adequate samples order to declare success in this pilot study.  Therefore, if 10 of 12 enrolled women have RPFNA samples at both times with sufficient cells, the lower bound of the one-sided, 90% exact confidence interval will exceed 60% and the study will be considered feasible.",
