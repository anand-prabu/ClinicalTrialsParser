Studies have\n      indicated that an increased amount of stimulation from the pacemaker in the atria is\n      associated with an increased amount of AF.\n\n      The aim of the present study is to test the hypothesis that a reduction of stimulation from\n      the pacemaker in the atria, and reducing the minimal heart rate, increases the time to AF."
