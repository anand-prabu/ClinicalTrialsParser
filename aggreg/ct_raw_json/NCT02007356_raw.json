The Investigator will first generate and apply IFN-\u03b3 positive selected T-cells to recipients of HSCT with CMV, EBV or adenovirus as previously published. The Investigator aim is to include 6 patients from the University Hospital of Basel.\nWith confirmed safety the investigator will in the future perform an efficacy study and extend this treat-ment for other clinically relevant pathogens including human herpesvirus (HHV)-6, HHV-8, polyomaviruses JC and BK and fungi including Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans, to other immunosuppressed patients such as SOT recipients."
