  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of training on an eccentric-bicycle with
      those of training on a classical cycle among patients with cardio-respiratory disease. This
      study will therefore evaluate the efficacy of eccentric training on physical capacity and
      overall autonomy, and will analyse the adaptive mechanisms with regard to both adaptation to
      cardiac and muscular effort and tolerance.

      The research will take place in 3 phases:

      PHASE 1 (DURATION 6 MONTHS):

      30 healthy volunteers will be included to test tolerance to personalized exercise on an
      eccentric cycle ergometer.

      PHASE 2 (DURATION 6 MONTHS):

      30 patients suffering from cardio-respiratory disorders and chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease will be included to test the same protocol.

      PHASE 3 (DURATION 24 MONTHS):

      160 patients split into 2 parallel groups will be included: a group with conventional
      rehabilitation (group 2) and the other group with rehabilitation using an eccentric cycle
      ergometer (group 1).

             rheumatism).

          -  Patients who have taken part (within the previous 6 months) or a currently taking
             part in a rehabilitation program.
