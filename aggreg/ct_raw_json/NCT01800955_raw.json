The resistive capacitive diathermy is a medical device\n      supplying low (448 KHz) radiofrequencies with maximum output power of 200 W, used to reduce\n      pain and inflammation and allowing healing processes. The sham diathermy treatment is\n      administered with the device set on \"on\" but not active (not supplying energy). Each\n      subject, randomly assigned to either resistive capacitive diathermy treatment (group 1) or\n      sham-treatment (group 2) is submitted to a thirty minutes session, three times per week for\n      a total of ten sessions. The outcome measures are the WOMAC scale (Western Ontario and\n      McMaster Universities Arthritis Index) to assess pain and physical functioning, a visual\n      analogic scale (VAS) for pain, the femoral quadriceps strength (MRC = Medical Research\n      Council Scale). Outcome measures are administered at baseline (T0), at the end of the\n      treatment protocol (T1), at 1 month (T2) and 3 months (T3) after the end of treatment."
