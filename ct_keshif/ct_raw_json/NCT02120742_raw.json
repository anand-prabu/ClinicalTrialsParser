The SMS program, delivered by nonprofit\n      Amend, sends daily reminders to motorcycle drivers to remind them to wear their helmets.  In\n      this study, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to see if this\n      program leads to increased helmet use over time.  The investigators will recruit between\n      350-400 motorcycle drivers to receive the text program. The investigators will obtain each\n      of their cell phone numbers, and the participants will be split into three groups. The first\n      group will receive reminders framed as social norming (ie \"Most of your peers wear\n      helmets\").  The second group will receive reminders framed as fear appeals (ie \"Not wearing\n      your helmet increases your chance of dying in an accident\"). The third group will act as the\n      control and receive texts that relate to general road safety, but not helmet use.  All\n      groups will receive the same general road safety information being delivered to the control\n      arm. The purpose of sending different types of reminders is to assess which type of messages\n      are more likely to cause a motorcycle driver to regularly wear their helmet. The\n      investigators will survey the participants at the initiation of the study and after weeks 3\n      and 6 during the study, asking about their helmet use.  This will be a short survey, and any\n      personal information gathered during the study (ie, phone numbers), will be securely stored\n      so as to protect their privacy."
