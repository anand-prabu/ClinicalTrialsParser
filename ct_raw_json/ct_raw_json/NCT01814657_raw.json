            "textblock": "This study is for patients undergoing In Vitro Fertilization (IVF). The investigators are\n      studying the best way to control pain during the egg retrieval process. The egg retrieval\n      involves passing a needle under ultrasound guidance through the vagina into the ovaries to\n      remove eggs that are to be later fertilized. Patients often report this as very\n      uncomfortable.\n\n      Different fertility clinics across the country use different methods of pain control. All\n      clinics will use intravenous medication to control pain, while some may or may not use local\n      anaesthetic (freezing) in the vagina. Our goal is to find the best way to control pain.\n      Since local anaesthetic injection involves multiple needle punctures and may be painful, the\n      investigators are unsure if local anaesthetic is necessary in addition to the intravenous\n      pain medication.\n\n      The investigators will conduct a randomized trial where all patients will receive\n      intravenous pain medication, but some will receive local anaesthetic injection and some will\n      receive placebo injection. Patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire on their pain\n      experience after oocyte retrieval. The investigators will then analyze the data and\n      determine whether local anaesthetic actually improves pain when patients are already\n      receiving intravenous pain medications. Through our study, the investigators aim to improve\n      the pain experience of all women undergoing IVF in the future."

            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      A UK telephone survey (Bokhari, 1999) showed that during TUGOR, 48% of UK fertility centers\n      were using conscious sedation, 29% general anaesthesia, 12% conscious sedation with regional\n      anaesthesia (neuraxial block or PCB), and 2% regional anaesthesia alone.  A review article\n      (Blahos 2009) details the many different types of anaesthesia used during TUGOR.  These may\n      include combinations of the following: general anaesthesia, regional anaesthesia, local\n      anaesthesia, conscious sedation, and alternative methods of anaesthesia\n      (electro-acupuncture, patient controlled sedation). No recent studies were found detailing\n      the frequency of each of the various anaesthetic options in use at fertility centers across\n      North American.\n\n      A prospective, randomized, double-blind and placebo controlled study (Ng, 1999) showed that\n      paracervical block combined with conscious sedation was superior to conscious sedation\n      alone.  This study used a combination of drugs (mepiridine and diazepam) not used at our\n      center.  The use of fentanyl and midazolam was first described by Harrison in 1992 for\n      conscious sedation.  In 2001 Sephton et al published a cross over audit of patient\n      preferences comparing mepiridine, diazepam and promethazine to fentanyl and midazolam,\n      showing superiority of fentanyl and midazolam.  Midazolam has sedative and amnestic\n      properties, whereas diazepam has no amnestic properties.  The amnestic properties of\n      midazolam make it a superior medication for overall patient experience during TUGOR, as they\n      are less likely to recall potentially painful parts of their procedure. Midazolam has also\n      been shown to act synergistically with fentanyl, thereby decreasing not only the actual pain\n      recalled, but the actual pain experienced by patients.  Since the only randomized control\n      trial demonstrating the benefits of paracervical block was performed using mepiridine and\n      diazepam, we intend to repeat the study using the superior combination of fentanyl and\n      midazolam.\n\n      Study Rationale:\n\n      The oocyte retrieval may be the most painful part of fertility treatment.  Our goal is to\n      minimize patient discomfort and improve overall patient experience during fertility\n      treatments.  We do not know if PCB improves pain scores in the era of wider use of fentanyl\n      and midazolam for sedation.  Fertility centres may be subjecting their patients to a painful\n      PCB injection without proven benefit.  This study aims to assess whether a PCB in addition\n      to conscious sedation can be abandoned without impacting the patient's overall pain\n      experience.\n\n      Study Objective:\n\n      The objective is to compare whether conscious sedation alone is as effective as paracervical\n      block plus conscious sedation in controlling pain during oocyte retrieval\n\n      Study Question:\n\n      Is conscious sedation alone as effective as paracervical block plus conscious sedation in\n      controlling pain during oocyte retrieval?\n\n      Overview of the Trial Design This study is designed to be a placebo-controlled, randomised,\n      double blind trial to compare whether conscious sedation with a normal saline paracervical\n      block (placebo) is as effective as conscious sedation with a lidocaine paracervical block in\n      controlling pain during oocyte retrieval.  A total of 300 women will randomly be assigned in\n      a 1:1 ratio, after consenting to study participation.  Short-Form McGill Pain scores will be\n      assessed in study subjects.\n\n      Study Population:\n\n      Women presenting for oocyte retrieval after a cycle of IVF stimulation at the University of\n      Alberta Regional Fertility Centre\n\n      Study Design:\n\n      Women consenting to participate in the study will be randomly allocated to one of two\n      groups.  The control group will receive conscious sedation with a placebo (normal saline)\n      paracervical block (PCB).  The study group will receive conscious sedation with a local\n      anaesthetic (lidocaine 1%) PCB.  Computer generated randomisation will be used to determine\n      group allocation.  Group allocation will be concealed using opaque envelopes to ensure\n      blinding.  An OR nurse will prepare the PCB syringe with either lidocaine or normal saline\n      depending on the patient's allocation.  The contents of the PCB will remain blinded from the\n      physician performing the TUGOR and the patient.\n\n      The fertility centre's routine for TUGOR is as follows:  Initially conscious sedation is\n      administered by OR nursing staff according to the patient's weight (midazolam 1 - 2 mg and\n      fentanyl 50 - 75 ug IV).  This is followed by the PCB 5 minutes later.  Additional fentanyl\n      is administered throughout the procedure as required to ensure patient comfort.  The oocyte\n      retrieval proceeds once the PCB is completed.  Following the oocyte retrieval and when the\n      conscious sedation has worn off; the patient will be assessed before discharge.  Once the\n      discharge criteria have been met, the validated and standardized Short-Form McGill Pain\n      Questionnaire will be used to objectively measure the pain experienced during the TUGOR.\n      All study participants will be required to rate the pain experience during the procedure.\n      The attending nurse is required to record all adverse events from the procedure as part of\n      her clinical duties.  Embryology information, i.e. fertilization, embryo grading,\n      development and frozen rates will be recorded to assess whether PCB affects this aspect of\n      ART.  Additional information will be obtained by reviewing participants' clinic charts nine\n      months post-procedure to determine secondary outcomes, i.e. live birth rates.  Animal mouse\n      models in the past have shown local anaesthetic to adversely affect fertilization and embryo\n      development (Schnell, 1992).  No adverse effects on human embryos from lidocaine have ever\n      been demonstrated (Wikland 1990), however assessing embryo quality and birth outcomes has\n      been the standard when conducting studies assessing the use of PCB\n\n      Setting:\n\n      Academic referral fertility centre"
