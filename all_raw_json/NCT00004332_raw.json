Determine whether release of endogenous growth hormone (GH)-releasing\n      hormone is involved in GH responses to clonidine, pyridostigmine, levodopa, arginine,\n      GH-releasing peptide, insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and exercise in patients with\n      acromegaly.\n\n      II.

Tests are repeated with\n      normal saline as the control; the order of administration (control vs. pharmacologic\n      stimulation) is randomly assigned.\n\n      Patients receive GHRH-A (dose determined in volunteer study), thyrotropin-releasing hormone,\n      and growth-releasing hormone.\n\n      All stimulation tests follow an overnight fast."
