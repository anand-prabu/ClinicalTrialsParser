    <textblock>
      TARGIT-Boost is an international randomised clinical trial designed to test the hypothesis
      that the tumour bed boost delivered as a single dose of targeted intraoperative radiotherapy
      (TARGIT-B) is superior to the conventional course of external beam radiotherapy boost
      (EBRT-Boost), especially in women with high risk of local recurrence. It is a pragmatic
      trial in which each participating centre can use the local predefined inclusion/exclusion
      criteria for entry into the trial. Only centres with access to the Intrabeam® (Carl Zeiss)
      are eligible to enter patients into the trial.

      Eligible patients are those with a higher risk of local recurrence after breast conserving
      surgery.

      After giving consent patients are randomised to either TARGIT Boost or EBRT Boost. All
      patients will receive whole breast EBRT. They may receive any other adjuvant treatments as
      deemed necessary. The protocol recommends that patients be followed at six monthly intervals
      for three years and then annually.

      The primary endpoint is ipsilateral breast recurrence rate. Secondary endpoints are
      relapse-free survival, site of recurrence, overall survival (breast-cancer specific and
      non-breast cancer deaths) patient satisfaction and quality of life.

      DESIGN: A pragmatic multi-centre randomised clinical trial to test whether TARGeted
      Intraoperative radioTherapy as a tumour bed Boost (TARGIT-B) is superior in terms of local
      relapse within the treated breast compared with standard post-operative external beam
      radiotherapy boost in women undergoing breast conserving therapy who have a higher risk of
      local recurrence. Patients can be entered before the primary surgery or in a smaller
      proportion of cases, post-pathology. SETTING: Specialist breast units in UK, USA, Canada,
      Australia and Europe; 31 centres currently recruiting in the TARGIT-A trial and several are
      ready to join. TARGET POPULATION: Breast cancer patients suitable for breast conserving
      surgery, but with a high risk of local recurrence. Details of inclusion and exclusion are
      given in part 2. Briefly the patients should be either younger than 45 or if older, need to
      have certain pathological features that confer a high risk of local recurrence of breast
      cancer. HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES BEING ASSESSED. The TARGIT Technique: The Intrabeam® (Carl
      Zeiss, FDA approved and CE marked) is a miniature electron beam-driven source which provides
      a point source of low energy X-rays (50kV maximum) at the tip of a 3.2mm diameter tube. The
      radiation source is inserted into the tumour bed immediately after excision of the tumour
      and switched on for 20-35 minutes to provide intra-operative radiotherapy accurately
      targeted to the tissues that are at highest risk of local recurrence. The physics, dosimetry
      and early clinical applications of this soft x-ray device have been well studied. For use in
      the breast, the technique was first developed and piloted at University College London. The
      radiation source is surrounded by a spherical applicator, specially designed (and available
      in various sizes) to produce a uniform field of radiation at its surface, enabling delivery
      of an accurately calculated dose to a prescribed depth. It is inserted in the tumour bed and
      apposed to it with surgical sutures and/or other means. As the x-rays rapidly attenuate the
      dose to more distant tissues is reduced; this also allows it to be used in standard
      operating theatres. 20 Gy is delivered to the tumour bed surface in 20-35 minutes, after
      which the radiation is switched off, the applicator removed, and the wound closed in the
      normal way. This simple technique has potentially several advantages over convential
      external beam radiotherapy, interstitial implantation of radioactive wires or conformal
      external beam radiotherapy. The first pilot of twenty-five cases was at performed at UCL
      using TARGIT technique as a replacement for the boost dose of radiotherapy; full dose
      external beam treatment was subsequently given. The phase II study of 300 patients was
      published and recently updated with long term data along with favourable toxicity and
      cosmetic outcome results of individual cohorts. A mathematical model of TARGIT developed
      recently (funded by Cancer Research UK) suggests that it could be superior to conventional
      radiotherapy. Translational research has found that TARGIT impairs the
      surgical-trauma-stimulated proliferation and invasiveness of breast cancer cells. This
      effect of radiotherapy may act synergistically with its tumouricidal effect yielding a
      superior result.  MEASUREMENT OF COST AND OUTCOME: Patient assessments will be clinical
      examination (6 monthly x 3 years then yearly x 10 years) and mammography (yearly). with
      ulstrasound (if needed) . Primary outcome: histologically/cytologically proven local
      recurrence. Secondary: site of relapse in the breast, overall survival, local toxicity (RTOG
      and LENT SOMA criteria), cosmesis, quality of life, patient satisfaction and health
      economics. The cost and cost-effectiveness of TARGIT versus EBRT, both as boost, will be
      calculated from a NHS and personal social services (PSS) perspective. Costs directly
      incurred by patients will also be assesed, since EBRT as a boost is likely to impose
      additional time and travel expense to patients and families.

    <description>The primary patient reported outcome endpoint for quality of life will be the FACT-B+4 trial outcome index (TOI) score.

A change of at least 5 points in TOI is considered to be clinically relevant or a minimally important difference (Eton et al. 2004). Secondary endpoints will be: 1) the five item arm functioning subscale score (0-20) 2) The 40 item FACT B+4 score (0-160), which reflects global quality of life including social and emotional well-being.</description>
