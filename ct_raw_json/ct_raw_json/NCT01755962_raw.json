We are examining using randomized\n      control trials low vs. high-GL diet to determine if low-GL diets induce improvements in\n      endothelial function or monocyte inflammation.  Furthermore, resistance training is an\n      alternate form of exercise from conventional aerobic training. Resistance Training has the\n      potential to improve endothelial function or monocyte phenotype, but there is very little\n      data in this area.  We hypothesize that resistance training may augment the beneficial\n      effects of a low-GL diet in improving metabolic health."
