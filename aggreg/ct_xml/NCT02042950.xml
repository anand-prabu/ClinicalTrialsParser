      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if carfilzomib can help control
      relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).  The safety of this drug will also be
      studied.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible for this study, you will begin the first cycle of treatment
      with carfilzomib.  Each cycle is 28 days.

      On Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of Cycles 1-12:

      -You will receive carfilzomib by vein over 30 minutes.  The first 2 doses you receive may be
      lower than later doses.  This is to reduce the risk of an allergic reaction.

      On Days 1, 2, 15, and 16 of Cycles 13 and beyond:

      -You will receive carfilzomib by vein over 30 minutes.

      You should drink at least 6-8 cups (8 ounces each) of fluid per day starting 2 days before
      your first day of treatment and for as long as your doctor asks you to.  During Cycles 1 and
      2, you will receive fluids by vein before and after your dose of carfilzomib.

      Before you receive carfilzomib, you will be given standard drugs (such as allopurinol,
      dexamethasone, antibiotics, anti-fungals, and/or anti-virals) to help decrease the risk of
      side effects.  You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and
      their risks.

      When you receive the drugs during Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of Cycle 2, you will be monitored for
      side effects for 1 hour after you receive the study drug.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of all cycles:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have a neurological exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow biopsy and/or
           aspiration to check the status of the disease.

        -  If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1½ tablespoons) or
           urine pregnancy test.

      On Days 2, 9, and 16 of all cycles:

      -Your vital signs will be measured.

      On Days 8 and 15 of all cycles:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1½ tablespoons) or
           urine pregnancy test.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2, 4, 6, and so on up to Cycle 12, then every 3 cycles after that:

        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a CT scan, MRI, PET scan, and/or
           PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a gastrointestinal endoscopy or
           colonoscopy.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest.  You will no longer be able to take the drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the long term follow-up
      phone calls.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      Within about 30 days, after you finish taking the study drug you will return to the clinic
      for the following tests and procedures:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have a neurological exam.

        -  You will have an EKG to check your heart function.

        -  Blood (about 3-5 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status
           of the disease.

        -  You will have a CT scan and/or x-ray to check the status of the disease.

        -  You will have a PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow biopsy and/or
           aspiration

        -  If you doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a colonoscopy/gastrointestinal
           endoscopy.

        -  If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1½ tablespoons) or
           urine pregnancy test.

      Long Term Follow-Up:

      After your end-of-treatment visit, you will be called every 6 months for 1 year to see how
      you are doing and to find out about any other treatments you have received since you stopped
      study treatment.  These calls will take about 2-3 minutes.  In addition to the phone calls,
      your medical records may be reviewed as well.

      This is an investigational study.  Carfilzomib is FDA approved and commercially available
      for the treatment of certain types of multiple myeloma.  This drug is investigational for
      the treatment of MCL.

      Up to 60 participants will be enrolled on this study.  All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

             light-headedness, syncope).

         10. Use of any standard/experimental anti-lymphoma drug therapy, including steroids,
             within 3 weeks of initiation of the study or use of any experimental non-drug therapy
             (e.g. donor leukocyte/mononuclear cell infusions) within 56 days of initiation of the
             study drug treatment. Prior allogeneic SCT within 16 weeks or autologous SCT within 8
             weeks of initiation of therapy.

         11. Patients with New York Health Association (NYHA) Class III and IV heart failure,
             myocardial infarction in the preceding 6 months, and conduction abnormalities,
             including but not limited to atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular (AV) block block,
             QT prolongation, sick sinus syndrome, ventricular tachycardia, as these patients may
             be at greater risk for cardiac complication, per carfilzomib labeling.

         12. The patient has a prior or concurrent malignancy that in the opinion of the
             investigator, presents a greater risk to the patient's health and survival, than of
             the MCL, within the subsequent 6 months at the time of consent. Investigator
             discretion is allowed.

         13. Acute active infection requiring treatment (systemic antibiotics, antivirals, or
