    <textblock>
      The first step in treating patients with acute pancreatitis is to provide pain relief and
      intravenous fluids to keep them comfortable. As the pain subsides and patient starts to feel
      better food and fluids by mouth are restarted. This is done to rest the pancreas which is
      the organ that has been inflamed.

      In some patients when food by mouth restarts they have pain and as a consequence they have a
      longer stay in hospital. It is thought that patients who have little pain and are within 24
      hours of admission to hospital do well if they control their own food intake. This is in
      contrast to the usual treatment where the treating team advise when eating should restart.
