Investigate the safety of HMAF given to this patient\n      population.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene intravenously for 5 minutes every day\n      for 5 consecutive days. Treatment is repeated every 28 days in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed after every 2 treatment courses.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-19\n      months."
