      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of brentuximab vedotin when
      given together with gemcitabine hydrochloride and to see how well they work in treating
      younger patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies, such
      as brentuximab vedotin, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of
      cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry
      cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine
      hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving brentuximab vedotin together with
      gemcitabine hydrochloride may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose of
      brentuximab vedotin in combination with gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) administered
      every three weeks to children with relapsed or primary refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).

      II. To define and describe the toxicities of brentuximab vedotin in combination with
      gemcitabine administered on this schedule.

      III. To determine the complete response (CR) rate after treatment with four cycles of
      gemcitabine with brentuximab vedotin among patients with relapsed or refractory HL.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of brentuximab vedotin in combination with
      gemcitabine within the confines of a Phase 1 study.

      II. To describe the overall response rate (ORR) after 4 cycles of therapy among patients
      with relapsed or refractory HL.

      III. To describe the proportion of patients with HL able to mobilize an adequate yield of
      cluster of differentiation (CD) 34+ stem cells after gemcitabine with brentuximab vedotin.

      IV. To describe the relationship between disease response among patients with HL and changes
      in thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) during treatment, and to determine if
      specific micro ribonucleic acid (miRNA) profiles correlate with response to treatment.

      V. To describe the frequency of the Fc gamma receptor IIIa (FcγRIIIa)-158 valine
      (V)/phenylalanine (F) polymorphism among patients who experience pulmonary toxicity on this
      protocol.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of brentuximab vedotin.

      Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and
      gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 100 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for up to 16 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment patients are followed up at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48,
      and 60 months.
