The parameters which would be evaluated are consumption of\n      morphine, pain intensity and side effects.\n\n      The primary objective is to evaluate whether local infiltration analgesia (LIA) into the\n      operating field will reduce morphine consumption during the first 24 postoperative hours in\n      patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy (AH).\n\n      Secondary end-points are pain intensity, incidence of nausea and vomiting, sedation\n      intensity."
