After discharge, patients will be randomly assigned to one of two\n      groups: intervention group (community health center, primary care) or control group\n      (Community mental health centers of District Psychiatric Service, specialist care).\n\n      The project's primary objective is to investigate the effect of community services on\n      patients' functional capacity and user satisfaction after discharge. Secondly, the number of\n      treatment days and readmissions to mental health care will be examined. The project will\n      also compare costs of hospitalization, in psychiatric hospital and community health center\n      respectively. Data will be collected from community health records, medical records and\n      patient systems in psychiatric hospital, community mental health centers of District\n      Psychiatric Service (DPS) and questionnaires filled out by patients."
