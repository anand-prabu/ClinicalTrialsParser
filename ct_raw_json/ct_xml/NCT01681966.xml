  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LNP is new extended release (ER) oily solution formulation of ropivacaine that is intended
      for local infiltration into surgical wounds. The formulation is designed to slowly release
      the ropivacaine over 36-72 hours.  By providing local analgesia over a long time span, the
      need for systemic analgesics is expected to be reduced and hospital stays may be shortened.
      The purpose of this study is to determine the ease of usage and administration of LNP in the
      surgical setting, to follow the PK profile of LNP over 72 hours and evaluate the duration of
      analgesia witnessed in the surgical setting.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male subjects between 18-55 years of age who are scheduled to undergo herniorrhaphy
             surgery;

          2. Subjects are within ±15% of ideal body weight/height (based on frame size) as given
             by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Tables;

          3. Subjects are ASA Category I or II and in normal physical health (other than the need
             for the surgical procedure) as judged by physical and laboratory examinations and
             have a negative urine based screen for drugs of abuse;

          4. Subjects must agree to refrain from ingesting any analgesic medication for 2 days or
             5 half-lives of the drug prior to the study period;; refrain from using caffeine and
             alcohol on surgery day and during the study period; and use only the analgesic
             medication provided by the study team during the study period;

          5. The subject is capable of reading, comprehending, and signing the informed consent
             form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have surgical complications such as excessive blood loss;

          2. Subjects that are expected to use PCA to control the post-operative pain;

          3. Subjects with a history of melena or any significant hepatic, renal, endocrine,
             cardiac, neurological, psychiatric, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, hematologic, or
             metabolic disorders, including glaucoma, diabetes, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis;

          9. Subjects with a hematocrit level below the normal range on the screening laboratory
             examination;

         10. Subjects with any clinically significant abnormal lab result (as judged by the
             Principal Investigator);

         11. Subjects with any condition or history felt by the Investigator to place the subject
