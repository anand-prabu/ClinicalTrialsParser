      This study will evaluate the effect of OxyGenesys Dissolved Oxygen Dressing in wound
      complication rates of the nipple areolar complex after a nipple sparing mastectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will recruit women who are undergoing a bilateral mastectomy for either cancer or
      a positive BRCA gene.  Women will be randomized to a different treatment per breast.  One
      breast will receive the OxyGenesys dressing and the other will receive the standard gauze
      dressing.  The study will evaluate wound complication rates and compare the two treatments.
