  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of 12 weeks of exercise on cognition in
      patients with end stage renal disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with end stage renal disease have higher cognitive impairment than general
      population. They also have decreased physical and functional capacity. Exercise has shown to
      improve cognition in general population. This study will evaluate if exercise improves
      cognition in dialysis patients. It will also evaluate whether exercise affects performance
      in daily activities, mood or depression and inflammatory markers in the blood.
