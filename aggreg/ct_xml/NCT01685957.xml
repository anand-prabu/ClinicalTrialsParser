  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent decades have shown an alarming increase in obesity. Obesity is associated with high
      costs for both the individual and for society. It is therefore important to prevent and
      treat obesity. The investigators believe that if you add a self-help weightloss book and
      teach cooking skills to a standard dietary treatment, then it will result in greater weight
      loss than with dietary treatment alone. However, this has not yet been studied. Since it
      will require more resources, it is important to investigate whether it also works better
      before changing the current treatment.

      Hypothesis: Conventional dietary treatment supplemented with a self-help weightloss book and
      cooking classes are more effective than dietary treatment alone in changes in body weight
      and body composition in obese persons over a period of 12 months. There is no difference if
      the intervention are based on the national dietary guidelines or a relative low-gi and
      high-protein diet.

      Secondary to investigate the impact the interventions have; on diet quality and quantity, on
      markers of metabolic syndrome and on how many subjects complete the study.
