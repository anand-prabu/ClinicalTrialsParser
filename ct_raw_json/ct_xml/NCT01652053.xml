  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoints of the investigation will include assessment of the maintenance of
      disc height demonstrated by radiographic evidence based on plain radiographs and MRI and
      relief of pain as measured by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at six months post-surgery. It is
      anticipated that outcomes with the InterCushion Disc Nucleus Prosthesis (DNP) will be
      comparable to or better than the historical published results for discectomy alone.

      All patients will be followed for at least 24 months once enrolled in the study. Clinical
      evaluations will be conducted before surgery (baseline), intraoperative, 2 week (± 1 week),
      6 week (± 1 week), 3 months (± 2 weeks), 6 months (± 1 month), 12 months (± 2 months) and 24
      months (± 2 months).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has signed and dated a study specific informed consent form approved by the
             reviewing Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee.

          -  Patient is 21 to 60 years of age.

             occurred at the same time as the leg pain and is believed to be associated with the
             disc herniation will not disqualify the patient from participating in this study) and
             symptoms despite a minimum of six weeks of non-operative treatment.

          -  Patient X-ray, CT or MR evidence of a herniated disc at the affected level.

             point visual analog scale (VAS).

             scheduled clinical and radiographic evaluations and rehabilitation.

             radiographs

          -  Patient has previously undergone chemotherapy, immunosuppressive therapy or radiation
             to the local area.

          -  Patient has any known active malignancy.

          -  Patient has rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus, or other chronic,
             inflammatory autoimmune disorder.

          -  Patient has ankylosing spondylitis or other spondyloarthropathy.

          -  Patient has spondylolisthesis.

          -  Patient is pregnant or plans to become pregnant during the course of the study.

          -  Patient has other concurrent physical or mental conditions that are likely to affect
             their outcome.

          -  Patient has congenital stenosis

          -  Patient is diabetic.

          -  The patient has osteoporosis or severe osteopenia as determined by the Investigator.
             Females over 40 with bone density score less than -1. A clinical SCORE calculator may
             also be utilized for females over 40 years of age.

          -  Patient has significant facet disease.
