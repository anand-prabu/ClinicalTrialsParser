The i-gel is made of a soft, gel-like elastomer with a noninflatable\n      cuff. The air-Q is a new single-use device that may optimise the airway seal while reducing\n      the potential for postoperative complications such as sore throat. The overall structure of\n      the air-Q SP is identical to the original air-Q, except with regard to the inflatable cuff.\n      The aim of this randomized trial was to compare the clinical performance of the i-gel and\n      the air-Q SP."
