  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is: (1) to establish assessment techniques (in our laboratory) to
      identify the functional integrity of long spinal tracts associated with adaptive walking
      recovery post-spinal cord injury and (2) to preliminary investigate locomotor outcomes
      associated with an adaptive locomotor training approach post-spinal cord injury.

    <textblock>
      Eligible individuals without spinal cord injury that are enrolled in the study will
      participate for 1-2 days.  These individuals may undergo a variety of non-invasive
      neurophysiological tests which evaluate spinal reflexes and integrity of specific spinal
      pathways.  In addition, their movement may be assessed during walking on a treadmill and
      overground in a variety of different conditions (e.g. with mirrors, without mirrors, with
      obstacles, without obstacles).

      Eligible individuals with spinal cord injury that are enrolled in the study will undergo the
      same testing as described above for the healthy controls. In addition, a small subset of
      these individuals may receive locomotor training (3 weeks of basic locomotor training
      followed by 3 weeks of adaptive locomotor training, separated by a 3 week washout period).
      For the individuals receiving locomotor training, they will be tested before and after each
      3 week training session.

             rehabilitation, with diagnosis of first time motor iSCI (AIS C or D with upper motor
             neuron lesions at cervical or thoracic levels) (for individuals with SCI)

          -  medically stable condition with no changes in anti-spasticity meds

          -  ability to walk in the home and/or ambulate in the community using a single cane or
             crutch, bilateral canes or crutches, or no device

          -  walking speeds &gt; 0.3 m/sec, with deficit performance on the Dynamic Gait Index

          -  medically approved for participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  history of congenital SCI or other degenerative spinal disorders

          -  inappropriate or unsafe fit of the harness and/or joint contractures or severe
             spasticity that would prohibit the safe provision of training

          -  receipt of a therapeutic intervention or medication within the last 6 mos that would
             alter the nervous system's ability to respond to treatment (e.g. Botox injections)

          -  unable to safely receive transcranial magnetic stimulation due to positive history
             which prohibits its use
