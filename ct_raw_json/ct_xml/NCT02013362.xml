      Phase I portion:

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of pralatrexate with concurrent vitamin B12 and
      folic acid supplementation in Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL and to
      determine the recommended dosage. Also, to evaluate pharmacokinetics.

      Phase II portion:

      To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of the recommended dosage regimen
      determined in the phase I portion. The primary efficacy endpoint shall be objective response
      rate (ORR).

    <description>The ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). Response will be determined according to International Workshop Criteria (IWC). Assessments will be done at week 7 (end of Cycle 1), subsequently every 14 weeks (end of odd-numbered cycle).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Japanese patients at least 20 years of age.

          -  Patients histologically diagnosed with peripheral T-cell lymphoma by pathological
             diagnosis of biopsied lesion.

          -  Relapsed or refractory patients with a treatment history of at least one regimen.

          -  Patients with an enlarged lymph node or extranodal mass lesion clearly measurable in
             two perpendicular directions and greater than 1.5 cm in maximum diameter on computed
             tomography performed.

          -  Patients expected to survive for at least 3 months.

          -  ECOG PS 0-2.

          -  Patients with adequate hemopoietic efficacy, liver and kidney function.

          -  Patients from whom written consent has been obtained prior to study initiation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who received a chemotherapy agent or a high dose of a systemic
             adrenocorticosteroid within 21 days prior to initial administration of the study
             drug.

          -  Patients who received radiation therapy, phototherapy, or electron beam therapy
             within 21 days prior to initial administration of the study drug.

          -  Patients who received another study drug within 28 days prior to initial
             administration of the study drug.

          -  Patients who received antibody therapy within 100 days prior to initial
             administration of the study drug.

          -  Patients with a history of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Or
             patients with a history of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation within
             100 days prior to initial administration of the study drug.

          -  Patients with cerebral metastasis or central nervous system lesion or a past history.

          -  Patients with active multiple primary cancer. Or patients with a history of a
             malignant neoplasm other than peripheral T-cell lymphoma within the past 5 years.
