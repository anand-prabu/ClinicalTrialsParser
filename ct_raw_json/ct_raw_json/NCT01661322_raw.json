Existing prevention strategies (antithrombotic, lipid/blood pressure lowering,\n      endarterectomy) reduce, not abolish, further events. Dual antiplatelet therapy - aspirin &\n      clopidogrel (AC) for IHD, aspirin & dipyridamole (AD) for stroke, is superior to aspirin\n      monotherapy. The investigators hypothesise that triple antiplatelet therapy (ACD) will be\n      superior to AD in patients at high-risk of recurrence, providing bleeding does not become\n      excessive.\n\n      Design: TARDIS is a multicentre, parallel-group, prospective, randomised, open-label,\n      blinded-endpoint, controlled trial. In the start-up phase, the investigators will assess\n      over 3 years the safety, tolerability and feasibility of intensive therapy (ACD) versus\n      guideline therapy (AD) given for 1 month in 750 patients with acute stroke/TIA. The main\n      phase will then assess the safety and efficacy of ACD in up to 3500 patients. The primary\n      outcome is ordinal stroke (fatal/severe non-fatal/mild/TIA/none) at 90 days. Secondary\n      outcomes include death, MI, vascular events, function, bleeding, serious adverse events;\n      sub-studies will assess cerebral emboli and platelet function."

To assess the safety of short-term administration (1 month) of intensive antiplatelet\n           therapy versus guideline therapy in patients with very recent ischaemic stroke or TIA.\n\n        2. To further assess, in high risk patients with stroke/TIA, whether:\n\n      ii. it is feasible to administer intensive therapy acutely and is tolerable to take for 1\n      month, iii. intensive therapy is superior in respect of surrogate markers such as platelet\n      function.\n\n      iv. intensive therapy improves functional outcome"
