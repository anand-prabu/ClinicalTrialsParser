Data obtained from the samples will be used\n      to support premarket submissions/registrations for this GenMark product. Samples will be\n      aliquotted, characterized by comparator methods and banked until the instrument and assay\n      are available for testing.\n\n      Sample collection may be prospective or retrospective. Prospective collection will preserve\n      prevalence. Retrospective collection will be used to obtain sufficient numbers of certain\n      sample types such as where the organism of interest is of low prevalence. The Sponsor will\n      ensure that information identifying samples as prospectively or retrospectively collected is\n      documented."
