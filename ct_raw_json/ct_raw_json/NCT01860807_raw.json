The study hypotheses are that ibudilast will reduce\n      methamphetamine use and increase treatment retention more than placebo among patients\n      seeking treatment for methamphetamine dependence. As HIV infection is a common complication\n      of methamphetamine dependence, half of the participants will be HIV positive and the study\n      will assess whether ibudilast also improves HIV related outcomes (e.g. medication adherence,\n      CD4 count, risk behaviors)."

            "textblock": "Ibudilast (IBUD) is a macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and phosphodiesterase\n      (PDE)-4 and -10 inhibitor at peak clinical exposures (Rolan, Hutchinson et al. 2009) that\n      increases glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) expression (Mizuno, Kurotani et\n      al. 2004) and reduces microglial activation (Suzumura, Ito et al. 1999; Suzumura, Ito et al.\n      2003), including HIV-induced glial activation (Kiebala and Maggirwar 2011). IBUD\n      significantly reduces methamphetamine (MA) prime- and stress-induced reinstatement of MA\n      seeking in rats (Beardsley, Shelton et al. 2010) and has multiple effects that may make it\n      an effective treatment for MA dependence including amelioration of dopaminergic and\n      neuroinflammatory dysfunction. Multiple studies implicate glial cells in a variety of\n      neurodegenerative diseases (Hirsch and Hunot 2009; Sidoryk-Wegrzynowicz, Wegrzynowicz et al.\n      2011) including MA dependence and HIV infection (Nath 2010). Activated glial cells secrete\n      pro-inflammatory mediators (Minghetti, Ajmone-Cat et al. 2005) that may exacerbate\n      MA-induced dopaminergic dysfunction. Glial cells also produce neurotrophic factors,\n      including GDNF, which may ameliorate dopaminergic dysfunction (Pascual, Hidalgo-Figueroa et\n      al. 2008). Thus, IBUD may be an effective medication for MA dependence due to its modulation\n      of glial cell activation resulting in amelioration of dopaminergic and neurocognitive\n      dysfunction and improved treatment outcomes in MA dependence. IBUD may also have unique\n      effects in HIV positive MA users as it may additionally block the degradation of neuronal\n      integrity seen in HIV infection (Chana, Everall et al. 2006; Dash, Gorantla et al. 2011)."
