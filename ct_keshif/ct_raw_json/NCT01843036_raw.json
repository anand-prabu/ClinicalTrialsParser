Durham Connects is the first home-visiting program that is designed to prevent\n      child maltreatment and improve health and well-being outcomes in an entire community\n      population.\n\n      Program evaluation will test four hypotheses: 1) The program can be implemented with\n      population reach, fidelity to the manualized intervention protocol, and reliability in\n      assessment of family risk; 2) Random assignment to the Durham Connects program will be\n      associated with lower rates of child maltreatment and emergency department\n      maltreatment-related injuries, better pediatric care, better parental functioning, and\n      better child well-being than assignment as control; 2) Intervention effect sizes will be\n      larger for higher-risk groups; and 3) Community resource use and enhanced family functioning\n      will mediate the positive impact of Durham Connects on outcomes."

            "textblock": "The Durham Connects program is an innovative, community-based, universal nurse home-visiting\n      program that aims to lower the population rate of child maltreatment and improve child and\n      family health and well-being. The Durham Connects Program is implemented jointly by the\n      Durham County (North Carolina) Health Department, the Center for Child & Family Health, and\n      Duke University. It is designed to be brief and inexpensive per family so that communities\n      can afford its costs. Its goals are consistent with those of more intensive nurse\n      home-visiting programs: 1) to connect with the mother in order to enhance maternal skills\n      and self-efficacy; and 2) to connect the mother with needed community services such as\n      health care, child care, mental health care, and financial and social support; so that 3)\n      the mother can connect with her child.\n\n      From August 1, 2013, through June 30, 2014, all residential births in Durham County, North\n      Carolina (~2,950) will be randomly assigned according to birthdate, with odd-birth-dates\n      assigned to receive DC. Even-birth-dates will be assigned to receive services-as-usual and\n      serve as the randomized control group. Program implementation will be evaluated for all\n      odd-birth-date families.\n\n      Durham Connects begins with a visit during the birthing hospital stay, followed by 1-3 nurse\n      home visits between 4-12 weeks of infant age, and then a follow-up contact one month later.\n      During the visits, the nurse engages with the mother and completes a health and psychosocial\n      assessment, during which she systematically assesses risk and family needs in 12\n      empirically-derived areas of family functioning across 4 domains (i.e., healthcare,\n      parenting/childcare, family violence/safety, and maternal well-being). For each area found\n      to be at risk, the nurse intervenes directly to support the mother (mild risk) or connects\n      the mother with ongoing evidence-based interventions in the community (moderate or\n      significant risk). Although Durham Connects is implemented universally, it focuses on\n      triaging families according to assessed risk and then connecting them with ongoing\n      collaborating community resources that can \"carry the family's baton\" after the nurse\n      home-visitor leaves the family."
