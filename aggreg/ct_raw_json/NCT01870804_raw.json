Randomization will be performed on-admission by computerized open-label assignment\n      in blinded envelopes used in a consecutive fashion. All patients receive the standard\n      pre-procedural hydration. The primary end-point is the proportion of patients with an\n      increase in serum creatinine of \u2265 0.5 mg/dl or \u2265 25% above baseline within 72 hours after\n      contrast medium administration. The secondary end-points are persistent worsening of renal\n      damage and cumulative adverse clinical events at follow-up."
