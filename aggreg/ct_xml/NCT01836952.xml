  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary and oral hygiene habits are known to affect oral microorganisms and disease
      incidence, but most research has focused on preschool aged (2-4 yr old) children.  A recent
      experiment in our lab demonstrated a highly diverse oral microbiome in the saliva of infants
      without teeth (3-6 months old).  These data suggest that soft tissues in the mouth serve as
      a reservoir for pathogens and must be considered in oral health management.  The evolution
      of microorganisms that occurs between birth and tooth eruption has not been characterized
      and may have great implications as it pertains to oral disease later in life.  The
      investigators are interested in determining how dietary changes during this time affect oral
      microbiota.  Here, tongue and cheek swab samples will be collected from a small cohort of
      infants (n=20) at 4 time points: 1) within 5 days of age; 2)2 wk after infant formula
      feeding begins; 3) 2 wk after solid foods offered; and 4) 2 wk after breast-feeding ceases.
      At the same time, a survey and 3 day feeding diary of the infant's diet will be collected.
      In addition, a pregnancy survey and food frequency questionnaire will be administered at the
      time of recruitment.  Research staff will conduct a 10-minute interview at the first and
      last oral sample collection time.  These pilot data will provide important diet-oral microbe
      relationships in edentulous infants, allowing us to propose and test specific hypotheses
      pertaining to diet, oral microbes, and disease in young children.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women must deliver vaginally a full term baby (37 weeks or later). Women must have a
             healthy pregnancy without medical complications. Women must breastfeed their baby for
             a period of time after birth (greater than 1 week), followed by introduction of
             formula.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Women must not have smoked during their pregnancy,nor have any serious medical
             conditions during their pregnancy.

          -  Infants can not be born via cesarean section.

          -  In addition, the infant should not have any chronic medical conditions and not taking
             any regular medications.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  full term infant

          -  healthy infant
