  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies have investigated the effect of caffeine on athletic performance, but the
      findings have not been consistent. This is due, in part, to the differences in response that
      has been observed both within and between studies. Previous research in our lab has shown
      that genetic variations affecting caffeine metabolism modify the association between
      caffeine and heart disease. We hypothesize that the inconsistencies among studies relating
      caffeine and athletic performance may be due to genetic differences in caffeine metabolism
      or response. National and Varsity male athletes will take part in an intervention of
      caffeine versus placebo, using a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled design, which
      will test various exercise protocols (power, strength, anaerobic capacity, endurance) that
      are associated with performance across multiple sports. Saliva samples will be taken for DNA
      isolation and genotyping various polymorphisms related to caffeine metabolism.  Not only is
      the outcome of value to determine which genotypes (athletes) are likely to derive an
      ergogenic effect from caffeine in various sports, but also to identify athletes who may
      possess a genotype linked to adverse health effects associated with high caffeine intakes.

      Research Methods and Design

      Experimental Design:

      This randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled, within-subjects counter-measured study
      design will include 100 national or varsity-level male athletes from a variety of summer and
      winter Olympic sports. Females will not be included in this study because hormonal
      contraceptive use, which is common among female athletes, and the time of the menstrual
      cycle have a significant effect on caffeine metabolism and exercise test performance
      measures. Controlling for these factors would require a much larger pool of participants and
      require considerable resources and time. However, if the findings from the proposed research
      show promising results in men we would then aim to replicate those findings in female
      athletes.

      Participants will complete 4 visits (~120 min each) in the Human Physiology Research
      Laboratory in the Athletic Center building at the University of Toronto. All testing will
      take place between 8:00 AM and noon, and each condition will take place at the same time for
      each participant to avoid circadian variation. Participants will be instructed to maintain
      their regular diet (pre-testing meals will be replicated for all visits) and sleeping
      habits, avoid strenuous activity 48 hours before each visit, and abstain from caffeine one
      week prior to the first visit and for the duration of the data collection (4 weeks).

      Sample Size Calculation

      Parameters:

      Effect size = 0.25: Although a large effect size for the main treatment effect was found in
      previous research (0.38), it was decided that to be conservative, this trial would be
      powered to detect a small-medium effect size which is still of physiological importance.
      Additionally, we are interested in the effects between the two doses of caffeine which are
      assumed to be smaller than the main treatment effect. Therefore, a small-medium effect size
      was needed to ensure sufficient statistical power to make between-caffeine-effect
      conclusions for the time trial analysis. Finally, other parameters of assessment such as the
      Vertical Jump for power will likely have a smaller effects size than the time-trial as
      reported by Tucker et al. (2013) in a study on vertical jump performance in male basketball
      players. Therefore, a smaller effect size would be required to adequately power the study
      for all outcome measures (i.e. power, strength anaerobic, aerobic etc.)

        -  Alpha (error probability) = 0.025: In general, an alpha = 0.05 is the standard value to
           use for this parameter. However, in our study the participants will be enrolled in a
           number of independent trials, and therefore it was decided to use a lower alpha so as
           to take into account error that can arise from multiple comparisons such as by sport
           (power or endurance) plus genotype (risk or common variant).

        -  Power (1-Beta probability) = 0.8: The conventional value of 0.8 was used for power.

        -  Number of groups = 2: Number of stratifications required for genotype subgroup analysis

        -  Number of measurements = 4: The laboratory exercise tests

        -  Correlation among repeat measures = 0: Zero correlation between measurements was
           assumed.

        -  Sample Size = 74: Based on calculations 74 participants are required. We will recruit
           100 athletes in order to account for possible withdrawal of up to 25%, without
           potentially compromising the statistical significance of our results. In addition, if
           we choose to use multiple comparisons (genotype + sport) we would benefit from a larger
           sample to minimize the drop in effect size.

      Recruitment

      Recruitment will be carried out at the University of Toronto, Ryerson and York University
      campuses, the Canadian Sport Institute of Ontario, and at local running/triathlon clubs by
      flyers posted in appropriate locations. A standardized email with study and contact
      information will also be sent to head coaches and/or program directors of sports teams/clubs
      (at all locations listed above) with eligible athletes, who can then choose to make their
      athletes aware of the study.

      Parameters of Assessment

      Physiological data collected by two trained kinesiologists, a PhD level exercise
      physiologist, one student assistant and Nanci Guest, the graduate student.

      Anthropometric and Clinical Characteristics

        -  Resting systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure measurements, as well as
           pulse rate, will be taken twice, one minute apart. The mean of the two consecutive
           readings will be taken.

        -  Heart rate will be measured before all tests to ensure participant calmness and similar
           physiological state for all tests and test days.

        -  Heart rate will be monitored throughout the duration of the trials (Visit 2-4) by Polar
           Heart Rate Monitors (Polar Electro, Finland) and averaged over each segment of work
           during the exercise protocols, each minute of rest during the exercise protocol, and
           continuously throughout the recovery period.

        -  Height will be measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a wall-mounted stadiometer and body
           weight will be measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a digital scale with participant
           wearing light clothing and without shoes.

        -  Body weight value will be used to determine 2 and 4 mg per kilogram of body mass
           dosages for caffeine treatments (plus a placebo dose) that will be ingested in random
           order (derived by research assistant and blinded to all investigators) during visits 2,
           3 and 4, over the following three weeks.

        -  Body Composition will be assessed by skinfold thickness as measured by Harpenden
           skinfold calipers at 4 body sites (biceps, triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac). Body
           fat will then be estimated from validated equations and fat-free mass calculated.

      Exercise Tests

      Descriptive Characteristics

      Maximal Aerobic Capacity will be assessed by a VO2 max test on a cycle ergometer. This test
      is part of descriptive data and will be used to determine resistance set in the time trial
      test (75% peak power). Participants will undergo a graded exercise test on a Monarch cycle
      ergometer (Groningen, The Netherlands) until volitional fatigue. To determine maximal oxygen
      consumption (VO2Max), air samples will be analyzed for oxygen and carbon dioxide
      concentrations via an indirect open circuit spirometry system (Parvomedics, Metabolic Cart,
      Sandy, Utah). Subjects will be set up with a Polar Heart Rate monitor upon arrival and keep
      it on for the duration of the procedure (warm-up, test, and cool-down).

      Four main outcome measures (power, strength, anaerobic and aerobic capacity)

        -  Muscular Power will be assessed using the Vertical Jump Test (VJT) as described
           previously (5). Participants will complete two attempts at each of two vertical jump
           tests on a force plate (AMTI,Watertown, MA, USA).

             1. squat jump (SJ): from a squatting position (knee angle: 90° approximately) in
                which no preliminary counter movement is performed;

             2. counter-movement jump (CMJ): from an upright standing position with a preliminary
                 counter movement; There will be a 60 second rest period between jumps and the
                best score of two will be recorded.

        -  Strength (upper body) will be assessed using a Handgrip Dynamometer (Lafayette
           Instrument Company model 78010). The highest score after 3 trials will be recorded (in
           kg).

        -  Anaerobic Capacity will be assessed using the Wingate Anaerobic Test on a cycle
           ergometer (Ergomedic 849E, Monark, Sweden). Participants will cycle against a fixed
           resistance of 0.085kg / kg body mass. Three main measures will be recorded during the
           test:

             -  Peak power (PP): a measure of maximal anaerobic power, or the maximum power output
                reached for a 5-second period during the first 10 seconds of the test. PP will be
                recorded in Watts (W) and W/kg.

             -  Mean power (MP): a measure of anaerobic capacity, or the mean power output
                achieved during the 30-second test. MP will be recorded in W and W/kg.

             -  Fatigue Index (FI): a measure of the rate of power decrease, or the difference
                between the highest 5-second power output and the lowest 5-second power output,
                divided by elapsed time. FI will be recorded as a percentage.

        -  Endurance/Aerobic Capacity and power output will be assessed by a Cycling Time Trial
           (TT). Participants will be instructed to complete a 10 km TT, carried out on a cycle
           ergometer (Monarch Sports and Medical, Vansbro, Sweden), as quickly as possible with no
           temporal, verbal, of physiological feedback. Participants' inspired and expired gasses
           will be measured using a metabolic cart (Cortex, Leipzig, Germany). Time required to
           complete the test and average power output will be recorded on completion of each test.

      Additional Tests during Exercise Testing

        -  Blood Lactate Testing. Immediately after the Wingate test participants will have their
           finger pricked with a disposable lancet to puncture the skin and obtain a capillary
           blood sample for analysis with the Lactate Pro analyzer (LT-1710, Arkray Inc, Kyoto,
           Japan)

        -  Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) - The Borg scale for RPE will be used to assess
           subjects' perception of fatigue.

      Genotyping

      Saliva samples will be collected during Visit 1 of exercise testing using the Oragene-500
      kit for DNA isolation using standard procedures as described previously. Genotyping for
      candidate genes involved in caffeine metabolism or response will be conducted using the
      Sequenom MassArray platform.

      Dietary Intake Assessment

      Subjects will complete a 196-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire to
      determine habitual caffeine intake as well as other dietary factors. Dietary intake
      information will be used to identify potential effect modifiers such as usual caffeine
      consumption.

      Health, Lifestyle and Physical Activity Assessment

      The General health, lifestyle and physical activity questionnaire (GHLPA) will include
      detailed questions on caffeine (e.g. intake habits, withdrawal effects etc), previously used
      in our lab, combined with a validated habitual physical activity/sport history questionnaire
      previously used to assess sport/physical activity in athletes.

      Statistical Analysis

      Analyses will be carried out using SAS (Version 9.2, NC, USA, 2009) statistical software.

      Briefly, we will report descriptive data (height, weight, age, blood pressure, caffeine
      intake and habits, body fat %, VO2max, years in sport, training hours per week, dietary
      assessment data and other lifestyle measures) comparisons between genotype groups using
      independent t-tests. Potential differences in VO2max, 10 km time trial, anaerobic capacity,
      lactate threshold, power and strength and rate of perceived exertion will be assessed using
      repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) with treatment as a within participants
      factor and genotype as a between-participants factor. For all RMANOVA procedures, posthoc
      tests will be performed using independent and dependent t-tests with a Bonferroni correction
      such that P&lt; 0.05 will be required as the threshold for significance.

      Experimental Procedure

      Initial Screening - phone call or in-person visit

      Potential participants will verify their sports participation and ability to commit to four
      2-hour visits to the lab 7 days apart. Participants will be reminded of the importance of
      maintaining their regular diet and eating the same breakfast before each visit. The
      importance of the required caffeine abstinence, including any caffeine-containing
      supplements for 7 days prior to the first visit and the duration of the study (4 weeks) will
      be emphasized and reiterated. Participants will also provide a saliva sample that may be
      used to confirm caffeine abstinence by measuring salivary caffeine concentrations, which is
      a good marker of recent caffeine intake.

      Visit 1 (~90 min)

      The first visit to the laboratory will involve familiarization, and obtaining written
      informed consent from all participants after an explanation about the aims, benefits, and
      risks involved with the study. Participants will be informed that they are free to withdraw
      from the study at any time.

      Each subject will complete an &quot;exercise readiness&quot; questionnaire (PAR-Q; Physical Activity
      Readiness Questionnaire) have descriptive and anthropometric data collected, including date
      of birth, height, body mass, and blood pressure, and they will also provide a saliva sample
      for DNA isolation and genotyping. During this first visit, maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max;
      described below) will also be measured for descriptive baseline data, and to derive workload
      levels for experimental time trials on subsequent testing visits.

      Visit 2, 3 and 4 (~120 min)

      All three visits will be identical with the exception of the 20 min waiting period (then 10
      min pre-testing warm-up begins) for serum concentration of caffeine levels to reach peak
      levels, where the participant will complete a different questionnaire or sit quietly with
      their own activity.

      Upon arrival participants will have been randomly assigned (to maintain blinding) to ingest
      either the supplement at 2 or 4 mg of caffeine per kg body weight, or dextrose placebo
      (PLAC). Each participant will ingest the same number of capsules with identical color and
      size during each visit, whether it is 0, 2 or 4 mg/kg, in order to maintain double-blinding
      of treatment. Each subject will complete a questionnaire or sit quietly (e.g. reading, using
      e-devices etc.) while waiting for the first exercise test.

      Exercise test protocol will be identical for visits 2, 3 and 4. After 20 min, participants
      will warm-up for 10 min and then carry out 4 exercise tests (commencing at 30 min
      post-caffeine ingestion) to determine different measures of performance:

      i. Muscle power - Vertical Jump Test

      ii. Strength - Handgrip Dynamometer

      iii. Anaerobic Capacity - Wingate

      iv. Endurance/Aerobic Capacity (aerobic power) - 10 km Cycling Time Trial

      Participants may drink water ad libitum throughout the exercise tests.
