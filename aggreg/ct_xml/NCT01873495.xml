    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of omacetaxine for
      consolidation in patients age 60 and older with Myelogenous Leukemia(AML)in first complete
      remission following induction with cytarabine and daunorubicin. And to assess the safety and
      tolerability of omacetaxine for maintenance in patients age 60 and older with acute AML in
      first complete remission following 3 consolidation courses with omacetaxine.

          8. Patients with a history of carcinoma in remission, on no therapy or on hormonal
             therapy for the adjuvant treatment of breast carcinoma or prostate carcinoma are
             included in the study.

          9. Any cytotoxic chemotherapy to treat carcinoma or major surgery must have concluded
