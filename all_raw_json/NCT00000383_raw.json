In addition, the parents and the child will receive individual\n      therapy for 12 weeks. The child will be monitored to evaluate his/her response to therapy.\n      Assessments will take place before and just following treatment, and then 6 and 12 months\n      post-treatment.\n\n      A child may be eligible for this study if he/she:\n\n      Has been sexually abused, is suffering from PTSD as a result of the abuse, and is 8 to 14\n      years old."

Treatment is\n      monitored for compliance with the respective treatment models through intensive supervision,\n      audiotaping of sessions, rating of sessions with use of adherence checklists, and\n      independent blind rating of audiotapes.  Treatment outcome is evaluated through the use of\n      several self-, parent-, and teacher-report standardized instruments, administered at pre-\n      and post-treatment, and follow-up evaluations at 6 and 12 months. The project also assesses\n      differential treatment impact by gender and ethnicity, and attempts to evaluate the impact\n      of specific components of the treatment process in mediating treatment outcome.\n      Specifically, the project evaluates the differential effectiveness of the two treatment\n      modalities in improving the subject's abuse-related attributions and perceptions, parenting\n      practices, familial adaptability and cohesiveness, parent support, and parental emotional\n      reaction to the abuse, and the impact of improving these variables on treatment outcome."
