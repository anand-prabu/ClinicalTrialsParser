According to studies, low adherence to\n      treatment is directly related to knowledge and beliefs about ART.\n\n      Studies have shown the success of different interventions increasing adherence to ART, but\n      additional studies need to be carried out in order to determine the most effective\n      components of the interventions and the methods most suitable considering the local context,\n      that could be easily incorporated into the working routine of an medical institution\n      (clinic) with limited extra resources.\n\n      Primary locations to implement activities directed at improving treatment adherence are\n      medical institutions, i.e. the departments of infectious diseases where persons living with\n      HIV/AIDS receive their ART.\n\n      The aim of the study is to conduct a small-scale intervention (randomised controlled) study\n      implementing a brief adherence counseling targeting persons receiving ART."

The intervention targets: accurate information about ART (mechanisms of HIV and antiretrovirals) and the development of mental imagery around it; promotion of perceived sense of ease and efficacy in working the ART regimen into the context of one's daily life and circumstances that may challenge drug use persistence; identification and refinement of skills that promote ease of adhering to one's ART regimen across the diverse and challenging contexts.",
