  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: low vitamin D status is associated with increased insulin resistance and
      increased blood pressure.

      Approach: Multiple regression analysis of information extracted from a large database
      accumulated by a Canadian health foundation, specifically evaluating statistical
      associations between serum 25(OH)D levels and insulin responsiveness measures as well as
      blood pressure, after adjusting these variables for BMI, age, sex, and waist circumference.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data obtained from the entry records of 4,116 adult men and women in Calgary,Alberta
      previously enrolled in the Pure North S'Energy Foundation's health program.  Individuals
      with a clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or a HOMA-IR value above 16 were excluded.
      Standard statistical analyses carried out.  An association between 25(OH)D and the endpoints
      of interest was first  established. The residual values after adjusting HOMA-IR, serum
      insulin, QUICKI, and blood pressure for BMI, age, sex, and waist circumference were then
      regressed against serum 25(OH)D using 40-percentile data blocks, stepping upward from the
      lowest 25(OH)D values by 5 percentile increments through the 7th decile.  Regression
      coefficients are then computed for each data block and each outcome variable.  The location
      (along the 25(OF)D continuum) of the largest and most statistically significant coefficients
      is noted, and regions of null response noted as well.
