An Interim Analysis will be\n      conducted when 50% of patients have completed 24 weeks of therapy. The study treatment phase\n      will be 48 weeks with monthly visits for virologic virologic and safety monitoring. The\n      primary endpoint is change in HIV RNA from baseline to week to assess efficacy. Durability\n      of response will be assessed at 48 weeks."
