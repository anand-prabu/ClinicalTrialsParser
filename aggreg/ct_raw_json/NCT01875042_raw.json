            "textblock": "Background\n\n      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common arthritic condition, which is one of the leading\n      causes of disability in adults. Currently, no treatment can stop or reverse the progressive\n      joint degeneration caused by OA. Most clinical interventions aim to improve pain and\n      physical function. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is widely used in the\n      management of knee OA to relieve osteoarthritic pain and facilitate the performance of\n      therapeutic activities in order to maintain or improve physical function. Although its use\n      is widespread, the available evidence is of questionable quality. An adequately sized and\n      well conducted randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating the effectiveness and safety\n      of TENS as treatment modality for knee OA is warranted to assist clinicians and policy\n      makers to make decisions that are based on high-quality evidence, ultimately optimizing\n      delivery of health-care in knee OA.\n\n      Objective\n\n      To determine TENS safety and effectiveness on pain and physical function compared to sham\n      TENS in patients with knee OA.\n\n      Methods\n\n      Multi-center, randomized, double blind (patient and assessor), sham controlled clinical\n      trial using a parallel 2 group design. Patients will be randomly allocated to receive TENS\n      or sham TENS for 3 weeks. Informed consent of eligible patients will be obtained prior to\n      randomization. Patients will be assigned on a 1:1 basis to the TENS or sham TENS group.\n      Randomization will be centralized using randomization software and an electronic\n      randomization form, generated by the trial coordinating centre (CTU Bern). Patients will be\n      randomized once demographic data and selection criteria are completed by the recruiting\n      physician in an electronic form. Randomization will be stratified according to treatment\n      centre, TENS naivety and clinical severity."
