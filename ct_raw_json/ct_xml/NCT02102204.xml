  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single-arm, extension study in which subjects with secondary
      hyperparathyroidism currently receiving hemodialysis previously treated in AMG 20120231,
      20120334, or 20120359 will continue to be treated with velcalcetide.  The study will assess
      the long-term safety and tolerability of velcalcetide as well as measuring the intact
      parathyroid hormone (iPTH), total serum albumin corrected calcium (cCa), and serum
      phosphorous (P) values in these subjects during the course of their treatment.

    <description>Subjects will be administered IV velcalcetide at the end of their regular dialysis sessions on a thrice weekly (TIW) schedule. Dose titration of velcalcetide is at the discretion of the Investigator and will be based upon the values of the local laboratory iPTH and cCa, with the frequency of these draws at the discretion of the Investigator. Subjects entering from the open-label parent studies AMG 416 20120231 or 20120334 will receive a starting dose of velcalcetide identical to the last dose received in the parent study. Subjects entering from the randomized, double-blind parent Study 20120360, will receive a starting dose of 5 mg velcalcetide. All subjects will continue to receive velcalcetide until approximately 2.5 years after the first subject enrolls.</description>

             during dosing

          -  Subject has been prescribed cinacalcet by the primary nephrologist between the
