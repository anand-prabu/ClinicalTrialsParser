            "textblock": "Vitiligo is a chronic acquired disease characterized by well defined white macules and\n      patches affecting the skin and mucous membranes. Mucocutaneous lesions develop secondary to\n      selective destruction of melanocytes. It has a major psychosocial impact on affected\n      patients. The etiology of vitiligo is largely unknown but more likely to be multifactorial.\n      There are several theories on the pathogenesis of vitiligo including mainly the autoimmune,\n      neurohormonal, and autocytotoxic theories. The autoimmune hypothesis has the strongest\n      evidence with alteration mainly in the cellular immune response.\n\n      Diagnosis of vitiligo is usually made clinically. A skin biopsy is rarely needed for\n      diagnosis and typically shows absence of melanin in the epidermis with no or few\n      melanocytes. Perivascular inflammation has been found in approximately 92% of cases.\n      Spontaneous repigmentation is uncommon (seen in 10-20% of patients) in vitiliginous patches\n      but can occur. Repigmentation occurs usually in a perifollicular pattern, suggesting that\n      the hair follicle functions as a reservoir for melanocytes.\n\n      There are many treatment modalities available for vitiligo, however, none of them cure the\n      disease. These include different topical treatments, phototherapy, surgical therapy, and\n      depigmentation therapy. Topical corticosteroids (CS) are commonly used as a first-line\n      therapy for localized vitiligo. They are the most effective monotherapy for localized\n      vitiligo. Studies have shown an increase in inflammatory cells in vitiliginous skin, mainly\n      macrophages and T cells. Efficacy of CS in vitiligo is attributed to modulation of the\n      immune response, reduction of destruction of melanocytes, and induction of melanocyte\n      proliferation and melanin production. Treatment with intralesional corticosteroids (ILCS) is\n      commonly used in many dermatologic conditions. There are only a few studies published on the\n      use of ILCS in vitiligo. Triamcinolone acetonide (TA) is the most commonly used form of\n      ILCSs. It is characterized by low solubility, being slowly absorbed from the injection site,\n      prompting maximal local action, limiting diffusion and spread through tissue, and not giving\n      rise to systemic side effects if used in therapeutic doses. The concentration that is most\n      commonly used in dermatology is 2.5 mg/ml.\n\n      Side effects of intralesional TA (IL TA) include pain at the injection site, mild bleeding,\n      transient atrophy and telangiectasia, hypopigmentation, and hyperpigmentation. Infection is\n      uncommon but caution over bony prominences is recommended. It has been shown that TA at a\n      total dose of 20 mg does not result in adrenal suppression. Hypersensitivity reactions to TA\n      or the vehicle carboxymethylcellulose are extremely rare.\n\n      The investigators' hypothesis is that IL TA will induce significant skin pigmentation to\n      improve vitiligo. This due to the anti-inflammatory effect of IL TA. IL TA has been\n      successfully used in the treatment of many skin conditions with an autoimmune pathogenesis\n      including alopecia areata. The investigators plan on conducting a prospective double-blind\n      randomized clinical trial to assess efficacy and safety of IL TA in the treatment of\n      vitiligo.\n\n      Study Objectives\n\n        1. To evaluate the potential for IL TA to induce repigmentation within vitiligo patches.\n\n        2. To assess the side effect profile of IL TA when used in the treatment of vitiligo."
