Close-up intra-oral clinical photographs of each filling will be\n      made. An impression of the filling may be obtained.\n\n      The specific study aim of this 6-year recall of the patients treated in IRB Study #07-0673\n      is to evaluate the fillings placed according to the following characteristics:  Retention;\n      Color match; Cavosurface margin discoloration; Secondary caries; Anatomic form; Marginal\n      adaptation and/or integrity; Post-operative sensitivity."
