            "textblock": "About 35% of veterans are obese. The MOVE! program is a nation-wide 8-week program of group\n      classes nationally to help obese veterans lose weight. While the program is successful for\n      some veterans, about 75% of veterans are unable to lose \u22655% of their weight 24 weeks after\n      MOVE!  New methods are needed to help obese veterans seeking weight loss. Using personalized\n      genomic information dictating a specific diet, and information on exercise and eating\n      behaviors, may be one means to help promote weight loss. Just a single nucleotide change or\n      polymorphism (SNP) in a gene can increase a person's risk for obesity, or change their lipid\n      profile in response to the consumption of different macronutrients such as of fats or\n      carbohydrates. Over 54 genetic loci have been associated with obesity phenotypes and\n      clinical studies are now reporting associations between SNPs and/or functional alterations\n      of gene expression (epigenetics) and the ability to lose weight or not.  We will implement a\n      randomized clinical trial to test a set of genomic data called the FIT\u2122 test (Pathway\n      Genomics\u2122) containing information on SNPs that affect obesity risk, confer specific diet\n      recommendations, outline eating behaviors and suggest responses to various exercise\n      regimens. The overall goal of this project is to evaluate if this supplemental genetic\n      information with a genomically-derived diet built around packaged meals to improve\n      adherence, in parallel with the MOVE! program at the VA in San Diego, will promote weight\n      loss in more obese veterans than those receiving usual care and eating diets based around\n      packaged meals. Our primary hypotheses are that more obese veterans in the MOVE! program\n      will lose 5% of their weight if they receive personalized genomic information and a\n      genomically-derived diet built around packaged meals when compared to veterans in the same\n      program that receive usual care during MOVE! and packaged meals after 8 or 24 weeks. We also\n      hypothesize that more veterans in the genomic group that lose 5% weight loss at 8 weeks will\n      maintain this weight loss after 24 weeks compared to veterans in the usual care group."
