Determine the response rate of these patients treated with this regimen. III.\n      Assess the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on\n      days 1 and 8 and ISIS 2503 IV continuously on days 1-14. Treatment continues every 21 days\n      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every\n      3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-44 patients will be accrued within 10-22 months."
