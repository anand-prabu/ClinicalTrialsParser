Determine any preliminary antitumor\n      activity of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of GEM 231. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3\n      hours on day 1, immediately followed by GEM 231 over 2 hours on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, and\n      18. Treatment continues every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated with one of two doses of paclitaxel and\n      escalating doses of GEM 231 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is\n      defined as the dose at which no more than 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.\n      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 1 patient will be accrued per week for this study until the\n      maximum tolerated dose is reached."
