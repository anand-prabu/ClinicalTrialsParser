    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, parallel group, single and repeat dose pharmacokinetic (PK) study in
      healthy male and female subjects. This study will confirm the PK and safety profile in
      Chinese subjects. GSK1605786 is currently in clinical development for the treatment of
      Crohn's disease. Subjects will receive one of two GSK1605786 doses (500 mg once daily or
      500mg twice daily) within 30 minutes after a meal. The study will consist of single and
      repeat dose sessions, with pre-dose and serial PK samples taken up to 72-h post-dose.
