The McGrath Series 5 video laryngoscope can improve visualization\n      of the glottic structures one to two grades. Moreover unlike a classical laryngoscope with a\n      Macintosh blade, the McGrath provides a view of the glottis without requiring alignment of\n      the oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal axes. In this study, the investigators will use it to\n      compare the Cormack-Lehane score in sedation and anesthesia condition. It helps to know the\n      role of videolaryngoscope in predicting difficult intubation."
