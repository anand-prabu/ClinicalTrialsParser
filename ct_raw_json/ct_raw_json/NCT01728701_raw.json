The control groups 2 and 4 will receive ID injections with\n      normal saline (NS) on the same days.\n\n      Thirty-three days after the last dose of chloroquine, volunteers in groups 1 and 2 will have\n      controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) by the bites of five mosquitoes infected with\n      PfSPZ of the Pf NF54 strain.

Finally, 33 days after the last dose of chloroquine, volunteers in\n      groups 3 and 4 will have homologous Pf CHMI by the bites of five PfSPZ-infected mosquitoes.\n\n      After CHMI all volunteers will be treated with a curative regimen of Malarone\u00ae (each tablet\n      containing 250 mg atovaquone and 100 mg proguanil), either at the time of detection of blood\n      stage parasitemia or 21 days after exposure to PfSPZ-infected mosquitoes. Volunteers will be\n      checked for parasites by thick smear at least twice after treatment.\n\n      If one of the volunteers is not fit to participate in the study on day -1, an alternate\n      volunteer who passed screening will replace him or her.
