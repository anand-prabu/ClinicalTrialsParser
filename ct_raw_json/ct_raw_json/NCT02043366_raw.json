            "textblock": "There are a dramatically increasing number of evidences that administration of the potent,\n      ultra-short-acting opioid remifentanil seems to cause opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) more\n      frequently and predictably compared with the others, likely due to its rapid onset and\n      offset. Therefore, prophylaxis of remifentanil induced hyperalgesia is indispensable to\n      postoperative comfort and satisfaction.\n\n      There is no denying the fact that OIH is related to central glutaminergic system and\n      N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-activation induced central sensitization.\n      Prostaglandins can promote glutamate release from both astrocytes and spinal cord dorsal\n      horns with subsequent activation of the NMDA receptors, and flurbiprofen axetil, as\n      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), not only functionally antagonizes the NMDA\n      receptor activation via inhibition of prostaglandins, but also is a targeted drug which\n      gathers at the site of inflammation, thus greatly enhances the analgesic effect. While\n      butorphanol has both spinal analgesic and sedative functions because of predominantly\n      central \u03ba-receptor agonist activation, other advantages of butorphanol include few side\n      effects, very low addiction potential, and low toxicity on account of a partial\n      agonist-antagonist activity to \u03bc-receptor. Moreover, antihyperalgesic activity of \u03ba opioids\n      at the site of inflammation and sex differences in the potency of the antinociceptive\n      effects of \u03ba opioids have been reported in various acute pain models. The following study is\n      carried out to evaluate whether butorphanol combined with flurbiprofen axetil can be safely\n      and effectively applied to preventing postoperative hyperalgesia induced by remifentanil in\n      patients undergoing lower abdominal surgery."
