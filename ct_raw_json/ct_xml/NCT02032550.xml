  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a preference based decision aid to assess the
      treatment preferences of prostate cancer patients, and to analyze the interaction of
      treatment preferences, type of treatment received and their relationship with health related
      quality of life, satisfaction with care, decision regret, and psychological health of men
      with localized prostate cancer.

      The objective is to test the comparative effectiveness of a conjoint analysis decision aid
      intervention compared to usual care. The investigators will identify preferred attributes of
      prostate cancer treatments that will help in designing a conjoint analysis decision aid to
      help patients weigh treatment attributes. The investigators will employ values markers to
      represent clusters of values for particular aspects of treatments that are valued most by
      individual patients. The investigators will test if the concordance between values markers
      and treatment received is predictive of objective outcomes and subjective outcomes. The
      study hypothesis is that conjoint task may help in treatment choice and prostate cancer
      patients whose treatment is more concordant with their values markers will have improved
      outcomes.

    <description>The investigators will measure Satisfaction with Decision (SWD): The SWD scale measures satisfaction with healthcare decisions and Regret scale: Regret represents the unsettling feeling of having made a poor choice of treatment, persistent doubt, and a wish to change one's mind at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.</description>

    <description>Generic HRQoL data will be obtained using the Medical Outcome Study Short Form (SF-36) a multi-item scale that assesses eight health domains. Prostate specific health related quality of life data will be obtain using Expanded Prostate Cancer Index (EPIC). The EPIC is a 50-item expanded edition of the 20-item UCLA Prostate Cancer Index (PCI) and complements other instruments by measuring a broad spectrum of urinary, bowel, sexual and hormonal symptoms.  Measurements will be done at baseline, 3 month, 6 month, 12 month and 24 month of followup.</description>

    <description>The investigators will obtain PSA data at baseline, prior to treatment, and post treatment.  All cancer recurrence data will be obtained through medical chart review. The investigators will identify complications that occur during either index or subsequent hospital admissions within 60 days of treatment.</description>

    <description>The objective of the preference based decision aid is to assess the treatment preferences of prostate cancer patients. The investigators will analyze the association between preferences, treatment choice and objective and subjective outcomes. The preference based decision aid will lead to a values-based patient centered treatment decision making. This will ultimately improve clinical decision making, clinical policy process, enhance patient centered care and improve prostate cancer outcomes.</description>
