This study will require one\n      initial screening, one pre-study visit, two 6-hour study visits. The study will take 2-5\n      weeks per subject to complete.\n\n      The initial screening visit will provide subjects an Institutional Review Board approved\n      consent document and determine subject eligibility through BMI calculated from height and\n      weight measurements, vital signs, fasting blood glucose test (finger prick), lipid profiles\n      (3 ml blood sampling via a butterfly needle device) and completion of a questionnaire\n      related to general eating, health, and exercise habits.\n\n      If subjects are willing and eligible to participate, a 3-day food record (2 weekdays and 1\n      weekend day) will be instructed at the initial screening visit and collected at the\n      pre-study visit to assess subjects' usual dietary intake pattern. After reviewing food\n      records, subjects will be instructed to avoid any grapes, grape products, berries, berry\n      products throughout the study and strictly follow a limited polyphenolic diet for 3 days\n      prior to each 6-hr study visit, while maintaining their usual diet pattern and physical\n      activity. Prior to each study visit, subject will be advised to have the same or similar\n      dinner meal to control the second meal effect from food and beverage intake of the night\n      before each study visit.\n\n      Subjects will arrive at the center after ~10 hours overnight fasting, well hydrated and\n      rested. Each study visit will require blood draws throughout the visit. After pre-study\n      procedures (height, weight, waist circumferences, vital sign, and fasting blood glucose\n      test), a registered nurse will place a catheter in subject's arm for the purpose of multiple\n      blood sample collections and collect fasting blood sample. During each study visit, subject\n      will take one of the two capsules right after fasting blood draw), based on randomization\n      sequences (either 1 grape seed extract capsule or 1 placebo capsule). One hour after\n      administration of the assigned capsule, blood samples will be collected. And a standard high\n      carbohydrate and high fat breakfast meal will be served and subject will have blood draws at\n      designated time up to 5 hours."
