In addition, the effect of\n      polymorphisms in P-glycoprotein (a protein involved in the removal of daptomycin from the\n      body) on the blood levels of daptomycin will be evaluated. The hypotheses are that rifampin\n      will decrease the blood levels of daptomycin and that the effect will be greater for certain\n      P-glycoprotein polymorphisms."
