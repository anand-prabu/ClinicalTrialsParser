    <textblock>
      This randomized, active controlled, multicenter Phase III open-label study is designed to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of alectinib compared with critozinib treatment in patients
      with treatment-naive ALK-positive advanced NSCLC. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio
      to receive either alectinib, 600 mg orally twice daily (BID), or critozinib, 250 mg orally
      BID. Patients will receive treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity,
      consent withdrawal or death occurs. The study is expected to last approximately 42 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced or recurrent (Stage
             IIIB not amenable for multimodality treatment) or metastatic (Stage IV) NSCLC that is
             ALK-positive as assessed by the Ventana IHC test

          -  Age &gt;/= 18 years old

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

          -  ECOG PS of 0-2

          -  Patients had no prior systemic treatment for advanced or recurrent (Stage IIIB not
             amenable for multimodality treatment) or metastatic (Stage IV) NSCLC

          -  Adequate renal, hematologic and liver function

          -  Patients must have recovered from effects of any major surgery or significant
             traumatic injury at least 28 days before the first dose of study treatment

          -  Measurable disease (by RECIST v1.1) prior to the administration of study treatment

          -  Prior brain or leptomeningeal metastases allowed if asymptomatic and diagnosed
             incidentally at study baseline. If patients have neurological symptoms or signs due
             to CNS metastasis, patients need to complete whole brain radiation or gamma knife
             irradiation treatment at least 14 days before enrollment and be clinically stable

          -  Use of highly effective contraception as defined by the study protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a previous malignancy within the past 3 years are excluded (other than
             curatively treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin, early gastrointestinal (GI)
             cancer by endoscopic resection, in situ carcinoma of the cervix, or any cured cancer
             that is considered to have no impact on PFS and OS for the current NSCLC)

          -  National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE)
             (version 4.0) Grade 3 or higher toxicities due to any prior therapy (e.g.,
             radiotherapy) (excluding alopecia), which have not shown improvement and are strictly
             considered to interfere with current study medication

          -  Co-administration of anti-cancer therapies other than those administered in this
             study.

          -  Patients with baseline QTc &gt; 470 ms or patients with symptomatic bradycardia &lt; 45
             beats per minute.

          -  Receipt of strong/potent cytochrome P4503A inhibitors or inducers within 14 days
             prior to the first dose until the end of study treatment except for oral
             corticosteroids up to 20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day

          -  Receipt of any drug with potential QT interval prolonging effects within 14 days
             prior to the first dose until the end of study treatment

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women

          -  Any clinically significant disease or condition (or history of) that could interfere
             with, or for which the treatment might interfere with, the conduct of the study or
             the absorption of oral medications or that would, in the opinion of the Principal
             Investigator, pose an unacceptable risk to the patient in this study
