Xanthan gum is a\n      complex exopolysaccharide utilized as a food additive. Its chemical structure  shows a\n      capacity to react with ROS indicating a role as an anti-oxidative molecule.\n\n      In the present study aging patients with dry eye will be enrolled. Signs and symptoms of dry\n      eye as well as levels of oxidative stress in tear will be evaluated afte 30 days of\n      treatment with eye drops containing carboxymethylcellulose or xanthan gum."
