    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of flexibly dosed brexpiprazole
      monotherapy in the improvement of early-episode schizophrenia through the assessment of
      social functioning, efficacy, and tolerability.  Early-episode schizophrenia is defined as
      episodes occurring ≤ 5 years after the onset of the first episode.
