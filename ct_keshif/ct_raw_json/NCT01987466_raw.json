It includes hypoxic damage in brain, liver, kidney, heart and other\n      organ. In previous study more than one-third of patients resuscitation from out of hospital\n      cardiac arrest developed renal dysfunction. In acute kidney injury, NGAL is an earlier\n      marker compared with serum creatinine.\n\n      Cardiac arrest and severe asphyxia result in global brain ischemia. In previous study serum\n      NGAL correlated with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy in asphyxiated neonate.\n\n      This study was designed to assess serum NGAL level in postresuscitative patients  to\n      evaluate its relation to hypoxic brain injury severity, and its clinical utility for early\n      detection of acute kidney injury in these patients."
