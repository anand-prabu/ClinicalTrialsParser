No matter which  cohort\n      you are in, the type of chemotherapy you receive will depend on the standard of care for the\n      disease and what your doctor thinks is in your best interest.  You will sign a separate\n      consent form for chemotherapy that explains how the drug is given, as well as its risks and\n      benefits.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      Every 3 months (+/- 2 weeks) for 12 months:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and blood pressure.\n\n        -  Your performance status will be recorded.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n        -  You will complete the 3 questionnaires about your quality of life.\n\n        -  You will have an MRI or a CT scan to check the status of the disease.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You will be on study for up to 12 months.  You will no longer be able to take part in this\n      study if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to\n      follow study directions.\n\n      Your active participation on the study will be over after the end-of-treatment visit.\n\n      End-of-Treatment Visit:\n\n      The end-of-treatment visit will be the same as your 4th study visit.  Twelve (12) months\n      (+/- 4 weeks) after you began the study, the following tests and procedures will be\n      performed:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and blood pressure.\n\n        -  Your performance status will be recorded.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n        -  You will complete the questionnaires you completed at screening.\n\n        -  If one was not performed within 4 weeks before this visit, you will have an MRI or a CT\n           scan to check the status of the disease.\n\n      Long-Term Follow-Up:\n\n      After the end-of-treatment visit, you will be followed 1 time each year by checking your\n      medical record and seeing how you are doing.  If nothing is in your medical record, you will\n      be called and asked about how you are doing.  This call should last about 5-10 minutes.\n\n      This is an investigational study.\n\n      Up to 30 patients take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."

Women of childbearing potential must have a\n             negative Beta-HCG serum pregnancy test and agree to refrain from breast-feeding, as\n             specified in the informed consent given the unknown risk of teratogenicity of agents\n             in the study.

Prior treatment with systemic chemotherapy for metastatic appendiceal cancer (prior\n             intraperitoneal chemotherapy is allowed).\n\n          2. Concurrent uncontrolled medical illness that is deemed by the investigator to have\n             potential to interfere with the delivery of chemotherapy for a six month time period.\n\n          3.
