      In this research study, the investigators are assessing the feasibility of providing
      extraorally delivered low level light therapy LLLT for the prevention of oropharyngeal
      mucositis OM in children undergoing myeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation  HCT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single treatment arm clinical pilot study evaluating the feasibility
      of extraorally delivered low level light therapy (LLLT) for the prevention of oropharyngeal
      mucositis (OM) in pediatric patients undergoing myeloablative hematopoietic cell
      transplantation (HCT). Participants will be treated daily (including weekends and holidays)
      beginning on the first day of HCT conditioning and continuing through day +20 or hospital
      discharge if prior to day +20. Subjects will undergo formal mucositis and toxicity
      assessments at baseline and daily from day -1 through day +20, with a final assessment on
      the last day of treatment. There will be no further treatments or assessments beyond day
      +20. The study will enroll a total of twelve evaluable patients

    <measure>The ability to maneuver and provide a new treatment for mucositis using (extraoral) LLLT</measure>
    <time_frame>20 Days</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Several measures will be collected to evaluate the overall feasibility of providing daily extraoral LLLT for children undergoing HSCT including:
Accessibility and maneuverability of the LLLT device (transportation from storage site to hospital room, device weight)
Administration of LLLT (device settings, positioning of device, delivery of therapy)
Patient tolerability (level of comfort during treatments, compliance with daily therapy
Proportion of days with therapy administered, as evidence by data submitted (goal is ≥75%)
Ability to enroll at least 5 patients within the first 3 months (this pertains to the feasibility of study conduct, and not to the feasibility of the therapeutic approach)</description>

    <description>To address secondary the investigators, will calculate the following proportion: (number of times patients refused to complete one or both questionnaires) / (number of questionnaire completion timepoints), and place a 95% confidence interval on the proportion.</description>
