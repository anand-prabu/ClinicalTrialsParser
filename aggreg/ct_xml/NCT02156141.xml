  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We want investigate if high intensity training can increase daily functionality without
      causing muscle damage in patients Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy . We want to study if
      there is a difference in effect with supervised and unsupervised training. Furthermore we
      want to study if a supervised training program will motivate participants to continue
      training by the end of the program.
