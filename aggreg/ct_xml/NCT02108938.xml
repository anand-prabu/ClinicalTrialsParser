  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aims for this research are to 1) characterize brain changes in patients with CD
      compared to age and gender-matched controls and 2) relate these brain changes to measures of
      disease activity and pain severity.

    <description>Because of the relatively large number of predictor variables in relation to the potential number of subjects, these analyses will be considered exploratory and aimed at generating hypotheses. Future studies with a larger number of subjects can be focused on hypothesis-driven questions and in developing diagnostic brain-based biomarkers and determining whether novel treatments aimed at the brain-gut axis may alter disease activity and pain perception in this patient population.</description>

        Patients 18 years of age or older diagnosed with CD, as determined by endoscopy or
        radiographic imaging, will be targeted for enrollment.   Patients with CD in symptomatic
        remission as defined by a Harvey-Bradshaw score of 3, will be eligible.

          -  A diagnosis of Crohn's disease by endoscopy or radiographic imaging

          -  Must have Crohn's disease in symptomatic remission as defined by a Harvey-Bradshaw
             score of 3

          -  No contraindications to MRI per UWHC screening form
