            "textblock": "The importance of good nutrition and food security among people living with HIV infection\n      (PLHIV) is widely recognized. In resource-constrained settings, food insecurity is\n      increasingly recognized as an important barrier to retention in care and adherence to\n      antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, there are few studies demonstrating that food and\n      nutrition assistance programs can improve HIV-related outcomes. This study will address this\n      gap by comparing the effectiveness of three models for short-term support for PLHIV. Food\n      insecure women and men on ART will be randomized into one of three groups: 1) nutrition\n      assessment and counseling (NAC) alone, 2) NAC plus food assistance, or 3) NAC plus cash\n      transfers. The investigators will compare the effect of the three approaches on ART\n      adherence and retention in care after 6 and 12 months of follow-up. The investigators\n      hypothesize that NAC plus short-term support in the form of food or cash assistance will\n      result in better adherence to ART and retention in care than NAC alone, and that the effects\n      of NAC plus food assistance will be the same as NAC plus cash assistance. The results from\n      the study will provide evidence about which assistance modalities for PLHIV work best to\n      improve ART adherence and retention in care, and under what conditions. This study will be\n      conducted in Shinyanga Region, Tanzania, where approximately 17 percent of households have\n      poor or borderline food consumption and 7.4 percent of people are living with HIV infection."

Food assistance will be a standard\n      food ration consisting of maize flour, groundnuts, and beans.

Participants will receive\n      the monthly food ration or cash transfer for up to six months if they continue to receive\n      monthly HIV care (the standard of care).
