            "textblock": "Abstract of Research Proposal Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been proved to be a curative\n      treatment with minimal invasiveness and high efficacy for small hepatocellular carcinoma\n      (HCC) that is generally defined as maximal diameter no larger than 3cm. RFA can achieve a\n      rate of complete necrosis as 80-100% in small HCC. However, the rate will drop to 71% in HCC\n      of 3.1-5cm and 25% for HCC larger than 5cm\u3002This is due to the relative hypervascularity for\n      the bigger tumor and it will induce heat sink that leading to less effect of ablation.\n      Therefore, transcatheter chemoembolization (TACE) before RFA may reduce the vascularity and\n      enhance the effect of subsequent RFA. Moreover, pre-RF TACE will reduce the tumor size and\n      the subsequent RFA will be more effective than RFA alone. In retrospective studies, Kitamoto\n      M et al showed that tumor necrosis diameter was larger in TACE and RFA combination therapies\n      compared to RFA mono-therapy; Yamakado K et al showed that TACE and RFA combination\n      therapies in HCC (maximal diameter up to 12 cm) achieved 100% complete necrosis, 0% local\n      recurrence rate and 93% of 2-year survival rate. Nevertheless, only one randomized trial in\n      intermediate size HCC (3-5cm in diameter) showed that TACE and RFA combination therapies\n      achieved a significant higher rate of complete necrosis, technique success, fewer treatment\n      sessions to achieve complete necrosis and lower local recurrence but non-significant\n      difference in 3-year survival rate. Therefore, based on the limited studies, combine TACE\n      and RFA may achieve better effects than RFA mono-therapy in HCC larger than 3cm. However,\n      repeat TACE may induce some complications such as HBV reactivation, hepatitis or even liver\n      decompensation. Moreover, novel RFA using simultaneous multiple RFA probes with switching RF\n      controller may achieve a better effects and shorter ablation time than sequential RFA with\n      single electrode. Thus, is it still necessary using TACE and RFA combination therapies for\n      HCC >3cm when application of novel switching RF controller? The aim of the current study is\n      to conduct a RCT comparing combine TACE and RFA compared to RFA mono-therapy by using\n      simultaneous multiple electrodes and switching RF controller in uni-lobar HCC of 3.1-7cm.\n      The rate of complete necrosis, technique success, sessions to achieve CN, local tumor\n      progression, survival rate and major complications will be analyzed. Investigators cannot\n      expect which one is better, safer before the achievement of the study."

The rate of complete necrosis (CN), technique\n      success, sessions to achieve CN, local tumor progression, survival rate and major\n      complications will be analyzed.\n\n      Background:\n\n      HCC is 4th mostly common malignancy worldwide and the leading cause of cancer-death in\n      Taiwan.\n\n      Surveillance programs can detect HCC at early stage. Surgical resection, liver\n      transplantation and local ablation are currently considered as curative treatment modalities\n      for early stage HCC. However, only 10-30% of early stage HCC is suitable for resection due\n      to poor liver reserve, co-morbidity and shortage of liver donor. Therefore, local ablation\n      plays an important role in the treatment of unresectable or resectable early-stage HCC.\n      Among the various local ablative modalities, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been proved\n      to be a curative treatment with minimal invasiveness and high efficacy for small HCC that is\n      generally defined as maximal diameter no larger than 3cm.  RFA can achieve a rate of\n      complete necrosis as 80-100% in small HCC. However, the rate will drop to 71% in HCC of\n      3.1-5cm and 25% for HCC > 5cm\u3002 The difference is due to the relative hypervascularity for\n      the bigger tumor and it will induce heat sink that leading to less effect of ablation.\n      Therefore, transcatheter chemoembolization (TACE) before RFA may reduce the vascularity and\n      enhance the effect of subsequent RFA. Moreover, pre-RF TACE will reduce the tumor size and\n      the subsequent RFA to unembolized viable tumor will be more effective than RFA alone.  In\n      retrospective studies, Kitamoto M et al showed that tumor necrosis diameter was larger in\n      combine TACE and RFA compared to RFA monotherapy;  Yamakado K et al showed that combine TACE\n      and RFA in HCC (maximal diameter up to 12 cm) achieved 100% complete necrosis, 0% local\n      recurrence rate and 93% of 2-year survival rate.

Therefore, based on the limited\n      studies, combine TACE and RFA may achieve better effects than RFA mono-therapy in HCC larger\n      than 3cm.
