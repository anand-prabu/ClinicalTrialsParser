No intrasubject dose escalation will\n      be allowed.  An MTD expansion cohort of up to 12 evaluable subjects may also be enrolled in\n      order to better define the safety, tolerability and activity of the study treatment.\n\n      Safety and tolerability will be assessed by the incidence and severity of adverse events as\n      determined by NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.03).\n\n      The antitumor activity of study treatment will be assessed according to standard response\n      criteria as appropriate for each individual subject's tumor type (e.g., Revised Response\n      Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma and the International Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple\n      Myeloma).\n\n      Exploratory biological markers of activity will be assessed in PBMC, plasma and tissue\n      specimens (hair follicle, skin, tumor and bone marrow samples, where available)."
