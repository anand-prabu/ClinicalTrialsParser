            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Depressed people appear to have problems regulating levels of a brain chemical called\n      glutamate    than people who are not depressed. The drug diazoxide may help regulate\n      glutamate levels in people with depression. Researchers want to know if it can rapidly\n      improve depression symptoms. This would help many people with depression, because most\n      medications take a long time to work.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To see if diazoxide can quickly improve depressive symptoms in people with\n      treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD).\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Adults 18 to 65 years old with MDD, who are currently depressed without psychotic\n      features.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be hospitalized for the entire study, 11   13 weeks. They may be\n           allowed short leaves. Participants will be interviewed many times during the study.\n           They will also fill out questionnaires.\n\n        -  Phase I will last about 4 weeks.\n\n      < TAB> - Participants will be screened with lab tests, and psychiatric and medical history\n      and exams.\n\n      < TAB>  - Participants will slowly go off current medications. They will be drug-free for 2\n      weeks.\n\n        -  Phase II will last about 8 to 9 weeks.\n\n        -  Participants will be monitored, answer questions, and give blood samples. They will\n           drink a glucose drink, give saliva samples, and have scans of their brains taken.\n\n        -  Participants will take the study drug daily by mouth for one 3-week session.\n\n        -  They will take a placebo daily by mouth for the other 3-week session.\n\n        -  There will be a drug-free period of 14 to 21 days between sessions."

            "textblock": "Objective:\n\n      To date, available pharmacological treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD) have\n      proven to be only modestly effective during the acute phase. We have been systematically\n      testing different glutamatergic modulators in patients with mood disorders in order to\n      develop improved therapeutics. A recent report found that the (beta)-lactam antibiotic\n      ceftriaxone increased glutamate uptake by increasing GLT1(EAAT2) function, and had\n      antidepressant-like effects in animal models. Using the learned helpless model of depression\n      we developed outbred lines, defined a new anatomy of helplessness, and determined that\n      synaptic loss due to excess extracellular glutamate appears to be involved in the\n      pathophysiology of helplessness; these animals show a 40% decrease in EAAT2 astrocytic\n      transporter expression. Together, these data suggest that astrocytic glutamate reuptake\n      systems may be central in the pathophysiology and treatment of depression, and that agents\n      that directly increase astrocytic glutamate uptake may represent a novel class of\n      antidepressants.\n\n      With this protocol, we propose to test a specific, new mechanism that uses diazoxide to\n      chronically increase the expression of the glutamate transporter EAAT2, resulting in removal\n      of glutamate from the synaptic cleft. Diazoxide enhances glutamate uptake in glia by\n      activating ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels.  We expect that this effect will reduce\n      excessive glutamate transmission and be associated with acute antidepressant effects. The\n      model presented here is a clinically testable one. If successful, it may lead to the\n      development of a group of novel pharmacological treatments for major depression.\n\n      Study Population:\n\n      24 individuals with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder.\n\n      Design:\n\n      Male and female patients, ages 18 to 65 years, with a diagnosis of MDD, currently in an\n      episode of major depression, will be recruited for this study. This study will consist of\n      the double-blind crossover administration of either diazoxide (200-400 mg/day given orally)\n      or placebo. The study will assess the efficacy of 3 weeks of a glutamate transporter\n      enhancer (diazoxide, 200-400 mg/day given orally) compared with placebo in improving overall\n      depressive symptomatology in patients with treatment-resistant MDD. Other aims of the study\n      include: 1) determining whether changes in brain neurochemicals (glutamate) correlate with\n      antidepressant response (decrease in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total\n      scores) to diazoxide in patients with treatment-resistant MDD, and 2) examine other\n      biomarkers of response.\n\n      Outcome Measures:\n\n      Primary: MADRS total score. Secondary outcome measures: Proportion of subjects achieving\n      remission (MADRS less than or equal to 10) and response (less than or equal to 50% reduction\n      from baseline in MADRS total score); change from baseline in Beck Depression Inventory\n      (BDI), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS),\n      Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) total\n      scores."
