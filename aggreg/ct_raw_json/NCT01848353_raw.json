The Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma\n      has several excellent, but underutilized wellness facilities in their Health Services Area\n      in rural Southeast Oklahoma, a low socioeconomic region.  It has been established that\n      exercise lowers diabetes risk, and many obese, insulin resistant American Indian youth who\n      live in this region would benefit from an increase in regular exercise.  The challenge is to\n      modify behavior so that routine exercise is established and maintained.  The proposed study\n      will test whether monetary incentives can elicit greater frequency and duration of exercise\n      in American Indian youth when transportation and access barriers are reduced."
