  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coumadin drug-drug interactions (DDI) are frequent. Patients in permanent use of coumadin
      are advised to avoid traditional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs to avoid risk of
      bleeding. New selctive cyclooxygesase 2 inhibitors arisen as potential option for treating
      pain and inflamation in these patients once interactions with coumadin are supposed to be
      lower. The CI(R)CA study was made to evaluate in a prospective fashion the occurrence of DDI
      with new cyclooxygenase antiinflammatory drugs and coumadin when compared to acetaminophen
      and placebo.

      The CI(R)CA study included patient diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome in permanent use
      of coumadin. Eligible patients were invited to use in a prospective cross-over mode two
      weeks of celecoxib, rofecoxib, acetaminophen and placebo with two weeks of wash out between
      drugs. Their international normalized ratio (INR) were measured before and during the use of
      each study drug. The interaction with coumadin was evaluated according to increases or
      decreases on the INR after each medication.
