There are several drugs\n      to control hypertension, but the only consistently beneficial treatment to reduce apneas is\n      continuous positive airway pressure. The demonstration that one drug could improve sleep\n      apnea and hypertension would support a novel approach in the treatment of both diseases. The\n      role of fluid retention in sleep apnea is known for several decades. The role of diuretics\n      is well established in hypertension but was never appropriately tested in sleep apnea.\n      Besides to test the efficacy of these drugs, this study will help to understand the\n      mechanisms that link hypertension and sleep apnea and its treatment."
