The three intravenous\n      drugs are taken in tandem 4 times in a 28-day cycle.  The MAD of BTH1704 (BTH, 3 dose\n      levels) in combination with gemcitabine (Gem) and Imprime PGG (I) will be determined using a\n      standard \"3+3\" design. Treatment continues until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity,\n      physician discretion, or patient refusal."
