            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      Our Fogarty \"Brain Disorders\" R21 study findings demonstrated that attention and working\n      memory deficits persist in one out of four children with cerebral malaria (CM) (Boivin et\n      al., 2007; John, Bangirana et al., 2008).  Uganda has one of the highest incidences of\n      malaria worldwide (~480/1000) with about 10% of these incidents becoming severe and over 90%\n      of such cases occurring in children (Snow, Guerra, Noor, Myint, & Hay, 2005).  This results\n      in an estimated 80 thousand new cases each year of Ugandan children with mild to severe\n      neurocognitive impairment from this disease.  Such impairment will likely compromise their\n      school performance, impede their activities of daily living, and lessen their future\n      economic opportunities.\n\n      There is no known treatment intervention during acute illness to prevent CM brain-injury\n      effects (Abubakar et al., 2007).  Nor are neurocognitive rehabilitative treatment programs\n      available in low-resource settings for affected children.  However, we have successfully\n      piloted a computerized cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CCRT) intervention to specifically\n      improve attention, visual-spatial learning, and psychosocial adjustment (domains shown most\n      affected by CM in our previous studies) with school-age Ugandan CM survivors (Bangirana,\n      Giordani et al., 2009).  This evidence justifies an R01 for further study.\n\n      The present application proposes a randomized control trial (RCT) to further establish that\n      CCRT can improve attention, working memory, aspects of executive functioning, and\n      psychosocial adjustment in pediatric CM survivors.  Such programs are already being used\n      extensively with children with developmental disabilities (e.g., Attention Deficit\n      Hyperactivity Disorder, learning disorders) and brain injury in high-income countries.  The\n      evidence from RCT studies for these interventions is strong enough to warrant the evaluation\n      of CCRT for at-risk African children (Bangirana, Idro, John, & Boivin, 2006; Boivin &\n      Giordani, 2009).  CCRT could also then be extended to a variety of other infectious diseases\n      causing brain injury and persisting neurocognitive deficits to children in this setting\n      (e.g., HIV, schistosomiasis, meningitis, encephalitis, and neurocysticercosis).\n\n      Objectives:\n\n        1. To evaluate the effectiveness of CCRT in improving neuropsychological performance and\n           psychiatric outcomes in Ugandan children who survive severe malaria.\n\n        2. To evaluate whether severity of malaria illness (e.g., immunological brain\n           inflammation, EEG abnormalities) is predictive of neuropsychological benefit from CCRT.\n\n        3. METHODS\n\n      Study design:\n\n      Randomized controlled trial\n\n      Study Population:\n\n      Our proposed study groups of children aged 5 to 12 years will consist of 150 children with\n      severe malaria (either cerebral malaria or severe malaria anemia). From the homes of these\n      severe malaria children, we will also recruit 1 sibling (or neighbor child) 5 to 12 years of\n      age without a history of cerebral malaria or other known infectious disease that could cause\n      brain injury (Community Controls from Home: CC children N = 150)."
