  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current standard treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer (clinical stage II or III)
      is preoperative radiation with chemotherapy (CRT) followed by surgery. But this approach can
      be suboptimal for patients with high risk features (more deeply-seated tumor or many
      regional lymph nodes involved)that are associated with recurrence. This study test a
      hypothesis that CRT followed by chemotherapy before surgery can improve efficacy of
      preoperative treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Downstaging rate with CRT using fluoropyrimidine monotherapy is usually 30-40%.In
      MRI-defined high-risk patients, downstaging rate with conventional fluoropyrimidine-based
      monotherapy with radiation has not been shown. We assume that the downstaging rate of
      chemoradiation arm (control arm) would be 30%, and that addition of CapOx after CRT
      (experimental arm) may increase downstaging rate 30% to 50%. A sample size of 52 patients
      per group is needed have 85% power to detect downstaging rate = 50% as compared to 30% with
      type I error rate of 15%. We will perform one interim futility analysis when half of the
      patients are recruited and evaluated for the primary endpoint. O'Brien-Fleming boundary will
      be considered. Therefore, when 26 patients per arm are evaluated, the interim futility
      analysis will be performed, and when the Z score at the interim is less than -0.09192
      (one-sided p-value greater than 0.5366192), the study will be stopped for futility.
      Considering 5% follow-up loss, a sample size of 55 per arm (a total of 110 patients) will be
      studied.
