            "textblock": "Hepatitis C (HCV) is a chronic viral illness leading to progressive liver damage that has\n      emerged as a major public health issue in the United States. While HCV affects all\n      population groups, individuals with a history of intravenous drug use form the largest known\n      risk group. Between 90 and 100 percent of long term intravenous drug use will eventually\n      test positive for HCV, and there is substantial risk that even short term experimentation\n      will result in infection. Studies suggest that HCV will be the major cause of cirrhosis and\n      liver cancer in the next century. Currently, approved therapy includes recombinant\n      interferons, which lead to sustained remission in a minority of patients. However, patients\n      abusing other substances, including alcohol, are not eligible for interferon therapy. The\n      need for investigation into other potential therapies is clear. Current practice patterns in\n      the Far East include the use of traditional herbal remedies for symptomatic chronic viral\n      hepatitis. This study is intended to examine the effect of commonly used herbal remedies for\n      the treatment of symptomatic HCV."
