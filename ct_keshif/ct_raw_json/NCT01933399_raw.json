The inextensible LSO has\n      been shown to increase stiffness of the trunk in individuals while wearing it.  The\n      hypothesis is that the group wearing the inextensible LSO will have improved outcomes over\n      the other two groups (standard care or standard care plus the extensible LSO)."
