      Background: the risk for rehospitalisation is very high after hospitalisation for acute
      heart failure. Aim: evaluate the benefit of a consultation with a cardiologist, including
      echocardiography and education of the patient, between 7 and 15 days after discharge, in
      high risk patients, identified with BNP or incomplete therapy. Parallel randomised study.
      The main endpoint is the number of day alive out of hospital during the 6 months post
      discharge; statistics intention to treat comparison of the number of days alive out of
      hospital in the group with consultation compared with the group without consultation.
      Recruitment 2 years and 6 months, follow-up 6 months. Patients included have been
      hospitalised in hospital BICHAT 75018 Paris, France. Financing is by the ministry of health
      (PHRQHOS)
