In previous work, a mixed source of protein has been\n      used, mainly from meat (beef, chicken, fish). These types of diets have been criticised\n      because of the potential negative side effects, including our own work on gut health. It\n      might be that alternative vegetable sources of protein could fulfil the diet remit, to be\n      satiating and yet still allow weight loss, and maintain a healthy gut.\n\n      Design -within subject, randomised cross-over design after day 3. Each subject acts as their\n      own control and will receive each treatment. 18-20 subjects to participate.\n\n      Length of time - Conduct the two nutritional interventions over a period of 14 days, in\n      order to reduce effects due to an acute change in nutritional intake.\n\n      PROTOCOL Days 1- 3 - Normal Protein Maintenance diet (NP- MTD, 3 days)\n\n        1. st ARM Days 4-17 - randomised to High Protein-Weight loss-Meat (HP-Soya,14 days),\n\n        2. nd ARM Days 18-31 - randomised to High Protein-Weight loss-Soya (HP-meat,14 days),"

It is of interest from both a scientific and\n      public health point of view whether meat and vegetarian sources of protein similarly impact\n      on motivation to eat.\n\n      The diets for this study:\n\n        -  The maintenance diet (MTD) (day 1 - 3) will consist of 15% protein, 30% fat and 55%\n           carbohydrate fed to 1.5 x RMR (resting metabolic rate)\n\n        -  The high protein (HP) weight loss diet will be fed to 100% resting metabolic rate (RMR)\n           on a 5 day rotation menu, fed as three meals a day, 30% protein, 30% fat and 40%\n           carbohydrate; the meat version will be based on chicken and beef meat; the soya version\n           based on soya protein or soya-tvp (textured vegetable protein).\n\n      Soya protein is now widely available as milk (ALPRO), margarine (PURE), enhanced bread\n      (BURGEN), sausages (GRANOSE), bacon (GRANOSE), burgers (GRANOSE), mince (GRANOSE), powered\n      isolate, cheese, cream (SOYA DREAM), yoghurt (ALPRO), chicken-style fillets (GRASSINGTONS)."
