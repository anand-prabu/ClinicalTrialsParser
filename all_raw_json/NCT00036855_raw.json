Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan\n      (IDEC-Y2B8) when preceded by rituximab in children with recurrent or refractory\n      CD20-positive lymphoma for which no autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation\n      (AuPBSCT) is planned. (Group A) If the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in group A is purely\n      hematological, determine the MTD of IDEC-Y2B8 when combined with rituximab, AuPBSCT, and\n      filgrastim (G-CSF) in a second group of children with recurrent or refractory CD20-positive\n      lymphoma. (Group B) II. Determine the DLT of rituximab and IDEC-Y2B8 in these patients. III.\n      Determine the dosimetry of indium In 111 ibritumomab tiuxetan preceded by rituximab in these\n      patients.\n\n      IV. Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of rituximab and IDEC-Y2B8 in these\n      patients.\n\n      V. Assess the immune cell depletion (B-cell and T-cell) and recovery in patients treated\n      with this regimen.\n\n      VI. Determine the human anti-mouse antibody response in patients treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan\n      (IDEC-Y2B8). Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.\n\n      GROUP A (no planned peripheral blood stem cell [PBSC] support): Patients receive rituximab\n      IV over 4-6 hours followed by indium In 111 ibritumomab tiuxetan (IDEC-In2B8) IV over 10\n      minutes on day 0 and undergo whole body imaging. Patients may then receive rituximab IV over\n      4-6 hours followed by IDEC-Y2B8 IV over 10 minutes on day 7.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients in each subgroup (A1, A2, and A3) receive escalating doses of\n      IDEC-Y2B8 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined (subgroup A1 closed as of\n      10/8/04). The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).\n\n      Some patients receive autologous PBSC IV over 30-60 minutes on day 35.\n\n      GROUP B (planned PBSC support): Patients receive rituximab, IDEC-In2B8, and IDEC-Y2B8 as in\n      group A. Patients also receive autologous PBSC IV over 30-60 minutes on day 21 and\n      filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 22 and continuing until blood counts\n      recover or day 35.\n\n      If the DLT in group A is purely hematological, cohorts of 3-6 patients in group B receive\n      escalating doses of IDEC-Y2B8 until the MTD is determined. The MTD is defined as in group A.\n\n      Patients in both groups are followed at days 63, 90, 180, 365, and then annually thereafter."
