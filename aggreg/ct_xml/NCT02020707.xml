      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized
      nanoparticle formulation and bevacizumab in treating patients with stage IV melanoma that
      cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel
      albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or
      carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle
      formulation and bevacizumab many kill more tumor cells.

               -  Urine dipstick for proteinuria &lt; 2+ (patients discovered to have &gt;= 2+
