            "textblock": "The effectiveness of colonoscopy in reducing colorectal cancer mortality relies on the\n      detection and removal of neoplastic polyps. Because the risk of prevalent cancer and of\n      transition to cancer increases with polyp size, effective and safe resection of large polyps\n      is particularly important. Large polyps \u226520mm are removed by so-called endoscopic mucosal\n      resection (EMR) using electrocautery snares. Resection of these large polyps is associated\n      with a risk of severe complications that may require hospitalization and additional\n      interventions. The most common risk is delayed bleeding which is observed in approximately\n      2-9% of patients. A recent retrospective study suggests that closure of the large mucosal\n      defect after resection may decrease the risk of delayed bleeding. However, significant\n      uncertainty remains about the polypectomy techniques to optimizing resection and minimizing\n      risk. Important aspects that may affect risk include clipping of the mucosal defect and\n      electrocautery setting."
