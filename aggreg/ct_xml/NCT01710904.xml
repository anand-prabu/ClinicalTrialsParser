  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-interventional, observational study is set up on request of the Belgian
      reimbursement authorities and evaluates the efficacy of Targinact with regard to pain relief
      and constipation in daily clinical practice in Belgium compared to the previous analgesic
      treatment with prolonged release oxycodone. Only patients eligible for Targinact®
      reimbursement in Belgium are included.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are treated with Targinact® according to daily clinical practice during at least 12
      weeks and are monitored during study 3 visits. Parameters assessed are pain relief,
      constipation, use of laxatives, use of analgesic rescue medication, use of concomitant
      medication, quality of life and safety of Targinact® treatment. These parameters, except for
      safety assessment, are compared between Targinact® treatment and previous analgesic
      treatment with prolonged release oxycodone.
