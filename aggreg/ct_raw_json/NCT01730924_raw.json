The aim of this\n      approach is to cause electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins.  The purpose of this study\n      is to evaluate whether the information which can be derived from the latest catheter\n      technologies - on the degree of contact force between the catheter and the heart - affects\n      the time to perform the procedure, or the outcomes as a result of it.  Patients undergoing\n      pulmonary vein isolation will be randomised to having their procedure performed with the\n      contact force information available to the operator, or not available.  The time taken to\n      achieve pulmonary vein isolation is the primary end-point of the study."
