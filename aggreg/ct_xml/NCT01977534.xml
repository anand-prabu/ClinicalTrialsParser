      ABSORB UK registry is a prospective, single arm, post-market registry designed to:

        -  Provide ongoing post-market surveillance for documentation of safety and clinical
           outcomes of the Absorb Everolimus Eluting BVS System in daily percutaneous coronary
           intervention (PCI) practice per Instructions for Use (IFU, on-label use).

        -  Collect additional information (e.g. acute success) to evaluate handling and
           implantation of Absorb BVS by physicians under a wide range of commercial use
           conditions and following routine clinical practice.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The inclusion criteria must follow the most recent IFU which may include but are not
        limited to the following:

          -  Patient must be at least 18 years of age at the time of signing the Informed Consent
             Form

          -  Patient is to be treated for de novo lesions located in previously untreated vessels.

          -  Patient must agree to undergo all required follow-up visits and data collection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The exclusion criteria must follow the most recent IFU which may include but are not
        limited to the following:

          -  Inability to obtain a signed informed consent from potential patient.

          -  Patient belongs to a vulnerable population (per investigator's judgment, this also
             includes people with a direct link (hierarchical or financial benefit) to the
             registry Doctor or the registry Sponsor).
