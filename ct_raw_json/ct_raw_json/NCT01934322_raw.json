They report more chronic medical conditions, have a higher\n      mortality rate and consume more healthcare resources.\n\n      In the literature, interventions aimed at improving the management of ED-FU have\n      demonstrated several positive outcomes, but there are still some knowledge gaps.\n\n      The proposed project tests the hypotheses that case management intervention as compared with\n      standard emergency care\n\n        -  is a more efficient use of healthcare resources and reduces ED attendance,\n\n        -  is cost-saving and\n\n        -  improves quality of life,\n\n        -  altogether leading to favorable cost-utility ratio."
