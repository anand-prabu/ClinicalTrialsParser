      Enrolled subjects undergo tissue labeling to evaluate the rate of collagen synthesis in
      tissue treated with the Ulthera® System compared to control tissue.

      This study is a prospective, single-center, blinded, non-randomized clinical trial.  Two
      subjects who have chosen to have a surgical facelift procedure and agree to drink heavy
      water for tissue labeling, will be enrolled.  Subjects will consume heavy water and collect
      saliva specimens over the course of the study period, following a specific heavy water
      labeling protocol.  Two weeks after starting the heavy water protocol, subjects will return
      to the study site to receive one Ultherapy™ treatment to the pre-auricular region on one
      side of the face.  The contra-lateral pre-auricular region will serve as a control.
      Following Ultherapy™ treatment, subjects will continue to follow the heavy water protocol
      for 4 more weeks.  Subjects will then return to the study site to undergo resection of the
      treated and control tissue for analysis during their planned rhytidectomy procedure.
      Subjects will send in saliva samples on a weekly basis to allow for confirmation that they
      are drinking the heavy water.
