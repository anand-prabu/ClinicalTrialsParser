To provide anticipatory guidance for parents to decrease parental stress and improve\n      parental experience and preparedness, thus involving the parent as a partner in caring for\n      their child.\n\n      We hypothesize that this additional tool will improve parental satisfaction in regards to\n      being prepared for their child's heart surgery."

Secondary endpoints\n      are Percentage of families that would recommend the STAGES-booklet as routine pre-operative\n      educational tool, as well as Family Stress score during each stage as outlined in the\n      STAGES-booklet\n\n      The Study period either 1 year or once 100 participants enrolled have completed their\n      post-operative survey\n\n      Methods Group allocation: The first 50 families will be assigned to the STAGES-post group,\n      and the last 50 to the STAGES-pre group. In both groups participants will be blinded to\n      their timing of exposure to the intervention. This randomization in an attempt to minimize\n      educator bias of possibly giving the STAGES-post group information pertaining to the\n      intervention proposed.\n\n      Time points: Routinely after the cardiologist informs families that their child has a\n      cardiac condition needing intervention, the Variety Children's Heart Centre clinical\n      resource nurses, meet with families to help them navigate through upcoming events, do\n      pre-operative counselling and supply them with educational material. At this point parents\n      will be asked in a sensitive manner, whether they would consent to taking part in this study\n      (see consent form). The first 50 will be informed that they will receive a booklet (not\n      disclosing the STAGES-booklet) post-operatively to evaluate and a survey to complete\n      post-operatively. The subsequent 50 families will be given the STAGES-booklet (not\n      disclosing that STAGES is the interventional tool being investigated) together with the\n      other routine educational material, and be counselled according to the STAGES-philosophy.\n      Before leaving the province for cardiac surgery, the RN's will in addition to logistical\n      matters, repeat the STAGES-booklet review and teaching with the STAGES-pre group.During the\n      routine post-operative visit at 6-12 weeks, families will be warned that their visit will be\n      approximately 20-30 minutes longer to complete the post-operative evaluation-survey. The\n      STAGES-post group will be given the STAGES-booklet and informed of the STAGES-philosophy\n      before completing the post-operative survey.In both groups, parents will receive condition\n      specific teaching that is part of routine care currently.\n\n      Data collection : Surveys will contain only the family's study number in order to remain\n      anonymous. Data will be analyzed collectively at the end of the study.\n\n      Survey responses will be aggregated and appropriate statistical analysis performed by the\n      CHARM statistician.\n\n      Expected outcomes:Mean Family satisfaction scores will be 10-20% higher, and mean emotional\n      stress scores  10-20% lower in the STAGES-pre group compared to the STAGES-post group. More\n      than 80% of families in each group will recommend the STAGES-booklet and/or philosophy to be\n      used as a routine pre-operative tool.\n\n      Results will be published in a respectable influential journal, submitted to national and\n      international conferences, with the goal to promote the use of STAGES, across Canada and\n      internationally."
