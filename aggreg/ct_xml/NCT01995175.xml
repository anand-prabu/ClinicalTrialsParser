  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the incidence and associated healthcare utilization
      of RSV-associated, suspected LRTI in a general population of infants from birth up to 2
      years of age, and also to assess the accuracy of a newly developed LRTI case definition and
      severity scale compared to two existing definitions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      New born infants from various countries over the world will be followed up for up to two
      years for the occurrence of Lower Respiratory Tract Infections. Through active and passive
      surveillance, any suspected case will be identified, assessed during an examination visit
      and followed up until completion through a diary card. Full symptomology will be assessed
      during the examination visit. The disease course and all healthcare utilization will be
      subsequently collected through a two-week diary card and contact with ay healthcare
      providers involved in management of the disease. RSV detection will occur through
      quantitative PCR of collected nasal swabs. A baseline cord blood serum sample of all
      subjects and a follow-up blood serum sample from a sub-cohort will also be collected to
      assess antibody levels at various points in time and in relation to risk of RSV LRTI.
