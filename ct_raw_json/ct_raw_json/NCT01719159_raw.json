One specific feature of long-standing MS is that\n      inflammatory cells accumulate in the central nervous system(CNS) compartment in the\n      subarachnoid and perivascular spaces and may therefore be hard to reach via standard drug\n      delivery through systemic administration. Administration of substances via the Intrathecal\n      (IT) route, however, have shown to efficiently distribute in the subarachnoid spaces and may\n      therefore be an attractive route of drug delivery"
