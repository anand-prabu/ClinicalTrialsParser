Unfortunately, despite\n      conventional medical treatment, some diabetic patients do not seem to be able to reach\n      desirable metabolic control. This is a double-blinded, randomized study investigating the\n      effects of triclosan containing toothpaste (commercial name: Colgate Total) on the response\n      to periodontal treatment in type II diabetic patients with periodontal disease. The\n      investigators believe that using triclosan containing toothpaste during periodontal\n      treatment will decrease the local inflammatory response and that this reduction will improve\n      periodontal status and metabolic control."

Research studies have shown that\n      controlling inflammation of the gums can improve the level of metabolic control (i.e. blood\n      glucose levels) in patients with diabetes. However, it is still not clear which periodontal\n      treatment approach would best maintain the control of inflammation of diabetic patients.\n      Triclosan has anti-plaque and anti-inflammatory properties and decreases gum inflammation.\n      The purpose of this study is to 1) determine the effects of triclosan containing toothpaste\n      on gum inflammation in type II diabetic patients with periodontal disease, and 2) to\n      evaluate whether type II diabetic patients will show improvement in periodontal status and\n      blood glucose following periodontal treatment with and without the use of a triclosan\n      containing toothpaste.\n\n      Patients with type II diabetes that meet the study criteria will be randomly assigned either\n      triclosan containing toothpaste or placebo toothpaste. Dental cleanings and oral exams will\n      be performed at baseline, 6 weeks, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, and samples will be collected at\n      baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. Samples that may be collected include blood, plaque, gingival\n      crevicular fluid, saliva and plaque. Women may also be asked to complete a pregnancy test.\n      Photographs and x-rays of the patients mouth/teeth may be taken, but is not a requirement.\n\n      The samples collected will be used to assess the effect of triclosan containing toothpaste\n      on glycemic control and local and systemic inflammatory mediators during the course of\n      periodontal treatment."
