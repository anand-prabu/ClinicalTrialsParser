      This study is an open-label, multi-site study, divided into two phases.  The total number of
      subjects for phase one is 200. The duration of this phase of the study is approximately four
      weeks. The primary objective is to assess what percentage of lapsed contact wearers, who
      have discontinued use of their contact lenses for greater than six months can be
      successfully re-fit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject must read, understand , and sign the Statement of Informed Consent and
             receive a fully executed copy of the form.

          2. The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in
             this clinical protocol.

          3. The subject must be interested in wearing contact lenses.

          4. The subject must be at least 18 years old or less than 40 years of age at the time of
             consent.

          5. The subject's vertexed spherical cylindrical refraction must result in a contact lens
             prescription for each eye that is available in the investigator's choice of study
             contact lens material(s).

          6. The subject must have best corrected visual acuity of 20/30 or better in each eye.

          7. The subject must require visual correction in both eyes.

          8. The subject must be a lapsed wearer (defined as, any non-contact lens wearer
             requiring optical correction who has been previously fitted in and has previously
             purchased contact lenses but has since discontinued contact lens wear for any reason
             more than 6 months prior to the time of consent).

          9. The subject must have normal eyes (i.e., no ocular medications or infections of any
             type).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently pregnant or lactating (subjects who become pregnant during the study will
             be discontinued).

          2. Any ocular or systemic allergies or diseases that may interfere with contact lens
             wear.

          3. Any systemic disease, autoimmune disease, or use of medication, which may interfere
             with contact lens wear.

          4. Entropion, ectropion, extrusions, chalazia, recurrent styes, glaucoma, history of
             recurrent corneal erosions, aphakia, or moderate or above corneal distortion.

          5. Any previous, or planned, ocular or intraocular surgery (e.g., radial keratotomy,
             PRK, LASIK, etc.)

          6. Any grade 3 or greater slit lamp findings (e.g., edema, corneal neovascularization,
             corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival injection) on the FDA
             classification scale, any previous history or signs of a contact lens related corneal
             inflammatory event (e.g., past peripheral ulcer or round peripheral scar), or any
             other ocular abnormality tha may contraindicate contact lens wear.

          7. Any ocular infection.

          8. Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact
             lens wear.

          9. Participation in any contact lens or lens care trial within one year prior to study
             enrollment.

         10. History of binocular vision abnormality or strabismus.

         11. Any infectious disease (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis) or contagious
             immunosuppressive disease (e.g., HIV), by self report.

         12. Employee of the investigational clinic (i.e., Investigator, Coordinator, or
             Technician).
