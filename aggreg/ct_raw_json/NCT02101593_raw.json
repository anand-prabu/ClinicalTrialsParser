HCC tissue either from an archived specimen or from a new biopsy of sufficient amount\n             and quality should be available for IHC determination of ASS status, and other\n             biomarkers, to be performed retrospectively. Subjects with no tissue available would\n             require a biopsy.\n\n          3. No prior treatment with systemic chemotherapy (except as noted in exclusion criteria\n             # 10).\n\n          4. Measurable disease using RECIST 1.1 criteria (Appendix A). At least 1 measurable\n             lesion must be present. Subjects who have received local-regional therapy such as\n             (but not limited to) chemoembolization, embolization, cryoablation, hepatic artery\n             therapy, percutaneous ethanol injection, radiation therapy, radiofrequency ablation\n             or surgery are eligible, provided that they have either a target lesion which has not\n             been treated with local therapy and/or the target lesion(s) within the field of the\n             local regional therapy has shown an increase of \u2265 20% in size. Local-regional therapy\n             must be completed at least 4 weeks prior to the baseline CT scan. Local therapies\n             including chemoembolization do not count as prior systemic therapy.\n\n          5. Cirrhotic status of Child-Pugh grade A. Child-Pugh status should be determined based\n             on clinical findings and laboratory data during the screening period (Appendix B).\n             Subjects on anti-coagulants are to receive 1 point for their INR status, as they are\n             presumed to have a <1.7 baseline PT/INR.\n\n          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1 (Appendix C).\n\n          7. Expected survival of at least 3 months.\n\n          8. Age \u2265 18 years.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Candidate for potential curative therapies (i.e., resection or transplantation).\n\n          2. Prior allograft transplantation including liver transplantation.\n\n          3. Serious infection requiring treatment with systemically administered antibiotics at\n             the time of study entrance, or an infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy\n             within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment..\n\n          4. Pregnancy or lactation.\n\n          5. Expected non-compliance.\n\n          6. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active\n             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III\n             or IV; Appendix D), unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric\n             illness or social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n\n          7. Subjects who have not fully recovered from toxicities associated with previous HCC\n             loco-regional therapies.\n\n          8. Subjects with history of another primary cancer, with the exception of: a) curatively\n             resected non-melanoma skin cancer; b) curatively treated cervical carcinoma in situ;\n             or c) other primary solid tumor with no known active disease present in the opinion\n             of the investigator will not affect patient outcome in the setting of current HCC\n             diagnosis."
