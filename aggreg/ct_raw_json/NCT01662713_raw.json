OFDI was designed to see microscopic details\n      of your skin without needing to use any invasive techniques such as surgery or biopsy."

            "textblock": "Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most common cancer in the United States, with more\n      than 750,000 diagnosed patients treated every year. Its prevalence and incidence have\n      significantly increased over the past two decades and it has been estimated that 20% of all\n      Americans will develop this type of cancer during their lifetime (Neville et al., 2007).\n      Biopsy and surgical resection of NMSC can result in tissue mutilation and scaring.\n      Therefore, there is a need for new imaging technologies that can be used to non-invasively\n      guide biopsy and surgery.\n\n      Optical Frequency Domain Imaging (OFDI) is a second-generation imaging implementation of\n      optical coherence tomography (OCT) developed at the Wellman Center.  OFDI provides\n      high-resolution three-dimensional imaging in tissue.  It uses an interferometric\n      depth-sectioning technique and employs a near-infrared light source.  Through analysis of\n      phase information in the recorded signal.  OFDI can detect blood vessels within tissues and\n      tumors.  Importantly, OFDI-based vascular imaging can be performed without the need for\n      exogenous contrast agents, making it relatively easy to deploy in clinical settings."
