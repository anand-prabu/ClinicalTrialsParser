Participants will be enrolled from the Johns Hopkins\n      HIV (Moore) Clinic and the resources of the Johns Hopkins Adult Outpatient General Clinical\n      Research Center (GCRC) and pilot project funding from the Lung Cancer SPORE will be utilized\n      to fund the costs of the CT scans.  An interdisciplinary team with expertise in\n      HIV-associated malignancy, CT screening, lung cancer surgery, HIV infection, epidemiology\n      and biostatistics has been assembled to test the hypothesis by accomplishing the following\n      Specific Aims:"
