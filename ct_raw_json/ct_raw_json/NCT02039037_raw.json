The\n      primary clinical outcomes will be pain, assessed with the numerical pain scale and McGill\n      Pain Questionnaire and disability assessed with Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire.\n      Secondary outcomes will be measured with global perception scale of global perceived effect,\n      quality of life using the Short-Form Health Survey questionnaire (SF-36), Beck Depression\n      (Beck Depression Inventory BDI), Flexibility, kinesiophobia  and through bank Wells. The\n      groups will be treated with two weekly sessions lasting about an hour, 6 weeks, totaling 12\n      sessions. The outcomes will be achieved in the final and initial ratings after six months of\n      treatment completion. Data will be collected by a blinded examiner who also has made the\n      allocation of patients to groups."
