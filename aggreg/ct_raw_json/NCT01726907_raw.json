            "textblock": "Traditional transcervical incision of the upper neck is a safe and effective approach for\n      resection of the submandibular gland (SMG). However, external scar at the highly visible\n      area may be a burden for the patients and sometimes may lead to disfiguring hypertrophic\n      scar or keloid. Recently, the investigators reported our surgical technique of\n      'endoscope-assisted' and 'robot-assisted' SMG resection, which was feasible and showed\n      excellent cosmetic outcomes since the scar was hidden by the auricle and hair. In our\n      previous feasibility study of robot-assisted SMG resection, the investigators proposed that\n      robot-assisted technique may overcome the limitations of endoscopic instruments with rigid\n      and straight nature without articulation and surgical view of two-dimension. In addition,\n      the ergonomically designed operating system was more convenient for the surgeon considering\n      the frequent collision of the endoscopic instruments and reversed hand-eye coordination in\n      endoscope-assisted surgery. However, clinical trial comparing the surgical outcomes of the\n      two techniques has not been reported in the literature.\n\n      In this study, the investigators made a prospective comparative study of robot-assisted\n      versus endoscope-assisted SMG resection to determine whether robot-assisted technique has\n      benefits regarding early surgical outcomes."

The da Vinci surgical system (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) including a 30\u00b0 dual channel endoscopic arm and two instrument arms was introduced. The SMG was retracted using the 5-mm Maryland forceps on the left and the dissection was conducted using a 5-mm spatula monopolar cautery or a Harmonic curved shears on the right. A Yankauer suction handled by a bed-side assistant could be used for counter traction of the gland which facilitated the dissection procedure.",

The dissection plane between the capsule of the SMG was conducted under magnified endoscopic view using the the blade of the Harmonic scalpel and the endoscopic dissector. Routine identification of the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve was unnecessary in SMG resection, since the dissection plane was always deep to the middle layer of the deep cervical fascia which includes the fascia of the gland. The Wharton's duct, facial artery and vein were ligated using the Harmonic scalpel or vascular clip.",
