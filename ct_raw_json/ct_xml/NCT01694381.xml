  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (pro-urokinase) is a highly effective
      thrombolytic drug.  At pharmacologic concentrations however, pro-urokinase is converted to
      urokinase - a non specific thrombolytic, limiting its therapeutic use. Mutant pro-urokinase
      (M5) is more stable and its conversion to urokinase is inhibited by C1-inhibitor.

      The primary objectives of the study are:

        -  To assess the overall safety and tolerability related to systemic plasminogen
           activation of single doses of M5 over a wide dose range (study part I).

        -  To assess the effect of single doses of C1-inhibitor on the overall safety and
           tolerability of single doses of M5 and its effect on M5-induced coagulation changes
           (study part II).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be male, aged between 18 and 35 years inclusive, and with a body weight of at least
             60 kg and a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 25 kg/m2 inclusive.

          -  Be without clinical significant abnormalities according to the investigator's
             judgment, based on a detailed medical history, a complete physical examination
             (including vital signs), a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram, urinalysis, and
             routine clinical laboratory tests.

          -  Have endogenous C1-inhibitor, Î±2-antiplasmin, fibrinogen, and plasminogen levels
             within the laboratory's reference range.

          -  Have a negative serology for HIV, HBsAg, and HCV.

          -  Have a negative test for alcohol and drugs of abuse at screening and on study day -1.

          -  Be capable of understanding and willing to comply with the conditions and
             restrictions of the protocol.

          -  Have read, understood and provided written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a known or suspected inherited, congenital, or acquired disease or condition that
             affects the haemostatic or coagulation pathways or that is associated with an
             increased bleeding tendency.

          -  Has a reasonable chance of developing a clinically significant bleeding event or a
             bleeding event that may go undetected for a considerable amount of time during the
             study, for example:

          -  Has undergone major (internal) surgery or trauma within the last three months of the
             anticipated dosing day;

          -  Has an intestinal or cerebral vascular malformation;

          -  Has participated in high impact contact sports, such as kick-boxing, within two weeks
             of the anticipated dosing day.

          -  Has received any systemically absorbed drug or substance (including prescription,
             over-the-counter, or alternative remedies) that is not permitted by this protocol
             prior to dosing without undergoing a wash-out period of at least seven times the
             elimination half-life of the product. For aspirin or other products inhibiting
             thrombocyte-aggregation the wash-out period must not be less than 28 days.

          -  Has smoked tobacco in any form within three months of dosing, or has ever smoked more
             than five cigarettes per day (or equivalent) on average.

          -  Has received blood or plasma derivatives in the year preceding the administration
             day.

          -  Has lost blood or plasma outside the limits of the local blood donation service (i.c.
             Sanquin) three months prior to dosing.

          -  Has a known hypersensitivity to any of the investigational material or related
             compounds.

          -  Has a history of severe hypersensitivity or of an allergy with severe reactions.

          -  Has a history of substance abuse, including caffeine, tobacco, and alcohol.

          -  Has a condition or demonstrates an attitude that in the opinion of the investigator
             might jeopardise the subject's health or well-being, or the scientific integrity of
             the study results.

          -  Is mentally or legally incapacitated to provide informed consent.
