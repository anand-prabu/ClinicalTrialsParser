  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study investigating the relationship between vitamin D and peripheral
      neuropathy (PN) among multiple myeloma (MM) patients treated with either bortezomib or
      thalidomide. The study consists of a screening period of up to 14 days, followed by a single
      assessment visit to evaluate vitamin D levels, incidence and severity of PN, neuropathic
      pain, and markers of depression.  Patient charts will also be utilized to assess the
      frequency of skeletal-related events.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 10% of myeloma patients present at diagnosis with clinical neuropathy although
      studies reveal as many as 1/3 may have abnormal electrophysiological examinations.  Baseline
      neuropathic abnormal findings are exacerbated by many myeloma treatments, especially
      bortezomib, thalidomide, and to a lesser extent lenalidomide. Several studies suggest that
      vitamin D supplementation may help reduce the symptoms of neuropathy.In this prospective
      study, we will investigate the relationship between vitamin D and PN among MM patients
      treated with either bortezomib or thalidomide. The study consists of a screening period of
      up to 14 days, followed by a single assessment visit to evaluate vitamin D levels, incidence
      and severity of PN, neuropathic pain, and markers of depression.  Patient charts will also
      be utilized to assess the frequency of skeletal-related events.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure
             not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn
             by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

          -  Prior diagnosis of multiple myeloma based on standard criteria (Durie 1986)

          -  Received consecutive, prior treatment for MM with a regimen consisting of at least 16
             consecutive weeks of bortezomib or 16 consecutive weeks of thalidomide prior to the
             Day of Assessment

          -  The 16 weeks of consecutive treatment must have included at least one of the
             following doses and schedules:

               -  Bortezomib: ≥ 1.0 mg/m² dosed four times per each 4-week period

               -  Thalidomide: ≥ 50 mg/day dosed daily

          -  The qualifying regimen may include both bortezomib and thalidomide. However, the
             above inclusion requirements need only be satisfied by either one of the agents.

          -  Age ≥18 years at the time of signing the informed consent form

          -  Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Plasma cell dyscrasia with polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal
             protein (M-protein) and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome (Bardwick 1980)

          -  Plasma cell leukemia

          -  Primary amyloidosis

          -  Vitamin D level assessment occurring within the 12 months preceding the Day of
             Assessment

          -  Vitamin D non-dietary oral supplementation &gt; 1200 IU per day for &gt; 30 total days
             within the 12 month period preceding the Day of Assessment

          -  Serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in this
             clinical study.

          -  Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that
             would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form

          -  Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the
             subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds
             the ability to interpret data from the study.
