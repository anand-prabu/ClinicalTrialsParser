      PROSPER (Patient-centered Research into Outcomes Stroke patients Prefer and Effectiveness
      Research) is a three year research project to create a national, sustainable model to
      improve decision-making and patient-centered stroke outcomes through comparative
      effectiveness research.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to address existing evidence gaps and develop the requested data on the range of
      clinical outcomes that may be experienced by stroke survivors. To achieve these goals, we
      will link the nation's largest stroke registry, the American Heart Association (AHA) Get
      With The Guidelines-Stroke program and nationwide Medicare claims data, coupled with
      telephone interviews for longitudinal treatment and downstream patient-reported outcomes.

      Design &amp; Procedures:

      Retrospective:  Using GWTG-Stroke database and its associated 1900 hospitals, we will
      conduct several comparative research protocols prioritized by stroke survivor focus groups
      and surveys. GWTG-Stroke registry clinical data linked with Medicare claims will be used for
      analysis of effectiveness and safety of post-stroke therapies on long-term clinical outcomes
      (n= 450,000). Outcomes of interest include:

      &quot;Home-time&quot; (days alive and at home) Death Stroke/TIA readmission All-cause readmission
      Cardiovascular readmission Bleeding readmission

      Prospective:

      We will use the existing AVAIL registry combined with an additional 2000 stroke survivors
      for a combined cohort of over 5000 patients to obtain detailed information on
      patient-reported outcomes. The AVAIL Registry (IRB # Pro00012243) collected data from 3000
      stroke survivors between 2006 and 2008.  We plan to use these data to supplement our
      prospective PROSPER study.  The PROSPER study will enroll a minimum of 2,000 subjects to
      augment  the data collected from the AVAIL study. Consented patients from at least 75 sites
      will complete interviews at 3 and 6 months after discharge.  We anticipate that the PROSPER
      questionnaire will include the following tools: Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Patient Health
      Questionnaire (PHQ8), modified Rankin scale (mRS), Barthel Index, EuroQOL (EQ-5D),
      Stroke-specific quality of life (SSQOL-12) and Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily
      Living (IADL).  Sites will consent interested patients and have them complete a patient
      contact information form which includes, name, address, phone numbers, email address, etc.
      Outcomes of interest include:  : Post-stroke fatigue, Depression, Chronic pain, Medication
      intolerance, Modified Rankin scale (mRS), EuroQOL and Stroke-specific quality of life.

    <description>Will be analyzed using the Cox proportional hazard model. Based on the models, the Wald's tests will be used to test the significance of the treatment effects. After fitting models, the marginal residuals from the model will be used to test the goodness-of-fit of the proportional hazards model, with special attention to the proportionality assumption.  When this assumption is not supported by the data, possible treatment and time interactions and other possible time-dependent covariates will be used to account for this non-proportionality. The resulting p-values that are less than 5% will be considered evidence of significant marginal differences across the cohorts.</description>
