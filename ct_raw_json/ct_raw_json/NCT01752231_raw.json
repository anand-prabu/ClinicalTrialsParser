Optimize and develop functional DCE-MRI pulse sequences, which involve the injection of\n      MRI-visible contrast agents, for imaging in the head/neck, abdominal and pelvic regions.\n\n      II. Determine the ideal radiofrequency (RF) coil setup to maximize signal to noise ratio of\n      the optimized pulse sequences.\n\n      III. Distill the findings of specific aims 1 and 2 into streamlined protocols that can be\n      used in subsequent studies for cancer phenotyping and treatment monitoring in a quantitative\n      manner.\n\n      IV. To establish a virtual reference image repository for future studies.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients undergo DCE-MRI over approximately 30-60 minutes consisting of an\n      anatomical scout image to localize the region of interest, a set of pre-injection scans to\n      calibrate the dynamic image set, a dynamic image set during which contrast agent will be\n      injected, and a set of post-injection scans to calibrate the DCE-MRI database."
