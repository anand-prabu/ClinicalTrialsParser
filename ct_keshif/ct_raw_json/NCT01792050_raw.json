            "textblock": "It is estimated that 232,340 US women will be diagnosed with and 40,030 women will die of\n      breast cancer in 2013. Metastatic breast cancer is a terminal condition and treatments are\n      palliative in nature. The median survival for patients with metastatic breast cancer is\n      approximately 2.5 years. The standard therapies currently in use include anti-estrogen\n      therapies (anastrazole, letrozole, fulvestrant, tamoxifen), chemotherapy agents (taxanes,\n      capecitabine, navelbine, gemcitabine, eribulin, ixabepilone), targeted therapies\n      (trastuzumab, lapatinib), and supportive care agents (zolendronic acid, denosumab). While\n      breast cancer typically responds well to treatment, the response is transient and their\n      disease becomes more refractory with continued therapy. Also, quality of life is a\n      significant issue for these patients as many of these therapies are associated with\n      significant side effects. Well tolerated, novel agents which improve the efficacy of\n      existing chemotherapy agents would prove quite useful in managing metastatic breast cancer.\n\n      Preclinical data derived from MMTV-Neu mice with autochthonous tumors studied the\n      interaction between indoximod and various chemotherapeutic agents. Mice with 5-10mm tumors\n      were enrolled into control and treatment groups. Mice were treated with indoximod alone,\n      chemotherapy alone (paclitaxel, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and others), and the\n      combination of indoximod and chemotherapy. treatment with indoximod or paclitaxel alone\n      caused retardation of tumor growth in this model but no regressions were seen. the\n      combination of indoximod plus paclitaxel caused 30% tumor regression and histologically\n      there was significantly enhanced tumor cell death with the combination versus either agent\n      alone. This synergism was abrogated when the mice underwent CD4+ T cell depletion prior to\n      treatment with the combination, suggesting the immune response played a role in the observed\n      effect. Based on this data and other reports suggesting systemic immunomodulating drugs like\n      indoximod can synergize with chemotherapy agents such as taxanes, the decision was made to\n      devise this combination of therapy of docetaxel with indoximod in metastatic breast cancer."

Those with previously treated inactive brain metastases with no\n             evidence of active disease documented on brain MRI at least 4 weeks after radiation\n             and off all steroids may be eligible.\n\n          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic\n             composition to docetaxel or tryptophan containing substances.

Because there is an unknown but potential\n             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with\n             1-Methyl-D-tryptophan, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated\n             with 1-Methyl-D-tryptophan. Also, docetaxel is a category D cytotoxic agent and is\n             not administered to pregnant females.\n\n          -  Known HIV-positive patients and those with other acquired/inherited\n             immunodeficiencies are ineligible due to the possibility of affecting the response to\n             indoximod and the higher risk of active opportunistic infections.\n\n          -  Patients with more than one active malignancy at the time of enrollment.\n\n          -  Patients who have received any prior experimental active immunotherapy consisting of\n             targeted monoclonal antibodies (ipilimumab) or pharmaceutical compounds are excluded.\n\n          -  Patients with any active autoimmune disease (i.e. psoriasis, extensive atopic\n             dermatitis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), multiple sclerosis (M.S.),\n             uveitis, vasculitis), chronic inflammatory condition, or any condition requiring\n             concurrent use of any systemic immunosuppressants or steroids for any reason would be\n             excluded from the study. Any patient with an allo-transplant of any kind would be\n             excluded as well. This would include those with a xenograft heart valve to avoid the\n             potential risk of any immune reaction causing valvular degeneration.\n             Mild-intermittent asthma requiring only occasional beta-agonist inhaler use or mild\n             localized eczema will not be excluded."
