The wrist portion of a size 6.5 surgical glove was fixed to the outer ring of the wound retractor. A 12-mm trocar was inserted through a small hole made in one of the fingertips of the glove and advanced into the abdominal cavity. Two additional holes for the accessory channels were made in another fingertip of the glove, and two conventional 5-mm trocars were inserted through the holes."

            "textblock": "Minimally invasive surgery has become the standard treatment for many gynecologic disease\n      processes. In the last decade, numerous studies have demonstrated that laparoscopic\n      approaches to various gynecologic oncology conditions-particularly for early-stage\n      endometrial and cervical cancers as well as select pelvic masses-is feasible and results in\n      shorter hospital stays, improved quality of life and comparable surgical and oncologic\n      outcomes to abdominal staging.For instance, the typical gynecologic robotic surgical\n      procedure will require Two to three 5-mm ports and one 12-mm laparoscopic ports. Recently,\n      an even less invasive alternative to conventional laparoscopy surgery has been developed:\n      laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS), also known as single-port surgery. Single port\n      laparoscopy is an attempt to further enhance the cosmetic benefits of minimally invasive\n      surgery while minimizing the potential morbidity associated with multiple incisions.\n      Preliminary advances in LESS as applied to urologic and gastrointestinal surgery demonstrate\n      that the techniques are feasible provided that both optimal surgical technical expertise\n      with advanced skills and optimal instrumentation are available. Recently, several\n      publication showed the single port laparoscopic surgery is feasibility in gynecologic\n      surgery including oophorectomy, cystecomty, and myomecomty.  To our knowledge, the sample\n      size of recent publication about single port surgery including cystectomy and myomecomty is\n      small. Furthermore, these studies lack the comparison of single port and convectional\n      laparoscopic surgery. Base on our recent study demonstrated that either the single-port or\n      the conventional approach can be used for LAVH, but the single-port LAVH technique yielded\n      less postoperative pain (Chen et al., Obestet Gynecol, 2011). The purpose of this study was\n      to assess the feasibility of single port laparoscopic surgery in the treatment of benign\n      gynecologic disease."
