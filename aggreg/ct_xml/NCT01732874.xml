  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out whether preterm infants are receiving
      enough of the essential and long chain fatty acids important for brain development and
      immune function. Our current intravenous (IV) fats do not contain the long chain fatty acids
      and different milk sources have different compositions.  We would like to evaluate lactating
      mothers dietary intake and breastmilk level of fatty acid status by doing an analysis of
      their blood and breastmilk samples after they have been supplemented with a currently used
      fatty acid supplement (DHA- Martek Biosciences, now known as DSM Nutritional Lipid) The DHA
      supplement is available over the counter.

      The information learned from this research study may benefit other mothers and babies in the
      future.  The information could help make sure premature babies are receiving the right
      nutrients they need for appropriate growth and development.

    <textblock>
      We designed a prospective, randomized trial to test the hypotheses that DHA supplementation
      to human milk providers will increase DHA concentration in milk and infant blood levels; and
      that infants receiving milk from DHA-supplemented providers will be receiving a more
      appropriate enteral intake to better mimic intrauterine accretion.  In addition, we
      hypothesize that pro-inflammatory cytokines will be reduced in the mothers and infants
      receiving the higher DHA diet.
