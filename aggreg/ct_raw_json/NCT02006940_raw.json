This method has been developed that special miniprobe can be passed\n      into the distal airway via the working channel of the bronchoscope and provide so called\n      \"optical biopsy\". The method is based on the natural autofluorescence of pulmonary\n      structures, detecting the elastin scaffold of central and peripheral airways, the structure\n      of alveoli, blood vessels and alveolar macrophages. Taking into account the fact that in\n      vivo endomicroscopy of distal airways is a novel diagnostic technique it needs correlating\n      the obtained data at certain disease with the reference methods for the challenges of our\n      current understanding of interpreting endomicroscopic images. We choose high resolution\n      computed tomography and morphology as such reference methods."

Radiologic signs e.g. low-density areas and consolidation areas will be assessed in Hounsfield Units. Other radiologic signs e.g. ground-glass opacity, crazy paving patterns etc. will be measured by 6-point scale, the same as for pCLE images.
