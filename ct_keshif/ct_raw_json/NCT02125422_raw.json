This neuromodulation technique is probably a tool in the prevention in\n      episodic and chronic migraine.\n\n      The aim of the study is to study short and long term effect of tDCS over pain treshold,\n      contact heat evoked potentials, blink reflex and visual evoked potentials in healthy\n      volunteers."
