      The purpose of this study is to describe patterns in disease management  and to describe
      clinical outcomes, as well as to identify factors influencing physician treatment decisions
      including reason(s) for treatment choices and trigger(s) for treatment changes and to
      document healthcare resource utilization used to manage treatment-related complications.
