            "textblock": "Endothelial dysfunction has been defined as disturbed endothelium-dependent relaxation of\n      resistance vessels, and breakdown of the vascular endothelial barrier, anti-adhesive and\n      anti-thrombotic functions. As the latter two features are difficult to assess in intact\n      human subjects, endothelium-dependent vasodilation has emerged as the principle test with\n      which to demonstrate the presence of endothelial dysfunction in experimental and clinical\n      settings. In previous studies we have shown that healthy current cigarette smokers with\n      normal spirometry have a blunted endothelium-dependent vasodilation (endothelial function)\n      in the systemic circulation to the airway (1-4). In the same studies, we also showed that a\n      4-week treatment with an inhaled glucocorticosteroid (ICS) restored normal endothelial\n      function in the airway of these subjects. While the exact mechanism of the ICS effect on\n      airway vascular function remains unknown, these findings suggested that cigarette smoking\n      causes steroid-sensitive vascular inflammation in the airway, possibly as a precursor of\n      global vascular disease (4). Thus, there seems to be an abnormal regulation of vascular\n      function in the absence of detectable abnormalities in airway function as assessed by\n      spirometry in healthy smokers, possibly as an early sign of cigarette smoke-induced airway\n      injury.\n\n      Is it possible that cigarette smoking causes endothelial dysfunction in the pulmonary\n      circulation as well, as an early manifestation of cigarette-smoke induced lung parenchymal\n      damage before it is detectable by pulmonary function abnormalities? To our knowledge, no in\n      vivo studies of endothelial function in the pulmonary circulation have been conducted in\n      healthy smokers to date. However, investigators have reported endothelium-dependent\n      relaxation responses of pulmonary arterial rings obtained from humans during resectional\n      lung surgery, especially in patients with COPD and pulmonary hypertension, and found\n      attenuated relaxation responses in them when compared to individuals without lung disease\n      (5-8). A decreased expression of endothelial NOS seems to have a major role in the blunted\n      pulmonary endothelium-dependent vasodilator responses in these patients. Similar changes\n      have been reported in smokers without lung disease (9). This suggests that healthy smokers\n      could have pulmonary vascular endothelial dysfunction similarly to airway vascular\n      endothelial dysfunction, and that treatment with an ICS could restore normal endothelial\n      function in the pulmonary circulation as well.\n\n      Endothelial function can be assessed by the vasodilator response to pharmacologic agents\n      known to cause endothelium-dependent vascular smooth muscle relaxation. \u03b22-adrenergic\n      agonists relax vascular smooth muscle through this mechanism. We have previously\n      investigated endothelial function in the airway by measuring airway blood flow (Qaw)\n      responses to inhaled albuterol (1). Similarly, pulmonary vascular endothelial function could\n      be studied by measuring pulmonary hemodynamic responses to inhaled albuterol using\n      echocardiography. Echocardiographic responses to \u03b22-adrenergic agonists have been carried in\n      patients with COPD,  showing an increase in cardiac output and a decrease in systolic\n      pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppas) after terbutaline, formoterol and salmeterol\n      administration (10,11).\n\n      Previous comparative cardiac function studies have shown no differences between healthy\n      smokers and non-smokers using echocardiography (12), but pulmonary vascular endothelial\n      function thus far has not been investigated.\n\n      Hemodynamic responses to \u03b22-adrenergic agonists are mediated primarily by effects on\n      vascular tone, not through direct effects on the heart (13). We therefore believe that\n      inhaled albuterol-induced changes in echocardiographically measured CO and Ppas would\n      reflect pulmonary vascular endothelial function.\n\n      The purposes of the present proposal are to 1) compare inhaled albuterol-induced changes in\n      Qaw, and in CO and Ppas in healthy current smokers and lifetime non-smokers as an index of\n      endothelial function in the airway and pulmonary circulations, 2) compare the results\n      between smokers and non-smokers, and 3) determine the effect of a 4-week treatment with an\n      ICS on albuterol responsiveness of Qaw and the echocardiographic parameters. With this\n      protocol we will test the hypotheses that a) there is a correlation between airway and\n      pulmonary vascular endothelial function within the current smoker and non-smoker groups, and\n      b) ICS treatment improves airway and pulmonary vascular endothelial function in the current\n      smoker group."
