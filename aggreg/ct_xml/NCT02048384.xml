    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b, multi-center, open label, randomized study to evaluate the safety and
      feasibility of administering metformin with or without rapamycin after disease stabilization
      on chemotherapy in subjects with metastatic PDA.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with metastatic PDA who have received FOLFIRINOX or a gemcitabine-containing
      regimen and have achieved stable disease or better will be enrolled onto this study.
      Subjects should have had at least 6 months of chemotherapy and decline continuation of
      chemotherapy and should have stable disease or better on 2 scans taken at least 6 weeks
      apart.  If applicable, subjects should also have a stable or declining CA19-9.

      Twenty-two subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to metformin (Arm A) or metformin +
      rapamycin (Arm B).  Subjects will be stratified according to their prior chemotherapy
      regimen:  FOLFIRINOX or a gemcitabine-containing regimen.

      Treatments will be administered orally on a 28 day cycle.  Metformin will be administered
      850mg twice daily and rapamycin will be administered 4mg daily.

    <description>To determine the safety and feasibility of administering metformin with or without rapamycin in subjects with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) after disease stabilization on chemotherapy.
This is an exploratory study designed to assess the safety and feasibility of the use of maintenance therapy in the first line treatment of subjects with metastatic pancreatic cancer.  The study will be continuously monitoring for adverse events in each arm.  If the unacceptable toxicity events appear to be higher than 30%, we will temporarily halt the study pending dose modification. Specifically, we will apply Bayesian toxicity monitoring.   In determining feasibility of enrolling patients onto a maintenance study, if less than 6 patients are enrolled in the first 12 months investigators will re-evaluate the strategy.  Feasibility will also be assessed by the ability for the study to complete enrollment within 24 months after the first subject is enrolled.</description>
