An\n      improvement in oxygenation can be obtained by an increase in positive end-expiratory\n      pressure (PEEP).\n\n      In critically ill patients with ARDS, lung imaging is been held by the use of chest\n      radiography and the \"gold standard\" technique, Computed Tomography (CT).\n\n      We designed an observational study in which we included patients under mechanical\n      ventilation admitted in our ICU. In all patients PEEP changes were applied and lung\n      sonography was performed."
