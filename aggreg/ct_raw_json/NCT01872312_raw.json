An air leak\n      present on postoperative day 7 is considered prolonged unless present only during forced\n      exhalation or cough. An air leak present on day 5 should be considered for treatment if it\n      is: 1) continuous, 2) present during normal inhalation phase of inspiration, or 3) present\n      upon normal expiration and accompanied by subcutaneous emphysema or respiratory compromise.\n      IBV Valve System use is limited to 6 weeks per prolonged air leak."
