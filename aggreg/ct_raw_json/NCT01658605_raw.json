            "textblock": "GSK1605786 is an oral antagonist specific for the chemokine receptor CCR9 in development for\n      treatment of small bowel and colonic Crohn's disease (CD). The purpose of this Phase II\n      proof of concept study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of GSK1605786 (500 mg twice\n      daily) administered orally for 16 weeks for the treatment of patients with active ulcerative\n      colitis (UC). A key secondary objective is to understand the mechanism by which GSK1605786\n      is acting and to this end samples will be collected to confirm the degree of inhibition of\n      CCR9 on T lymphocytes in the blood of patients, and to explore the relationship between\n      concentration of drug and changes in lymphocyte and antigen presenting cell populations in\n      the peripheral circulation and in the colon. Patients recruited at specified investigational\n      sites will be invited to participate in an optional sub-study to explore the effects of\n      GSK1605786 on trafficking of technetium labelled T cells using Single Photon Emission\n      Computerized Tomography (SPECT). Specifically, the technique will be used to follow\n      trafficking to large intestine and thymus and findings linked to pharmacokinetics of\n      GSK1605786, receptor occupancy and clinical efficacy outcomes"
