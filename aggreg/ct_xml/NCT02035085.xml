  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Six female patients (&gt;18 years of age, pre-menopausal) who have had loco-regional
      (lumpectomy and radiation) therapy for breast carcinoma and have been at least one-year
      disease free will undergo liposuction, the autologous SVF cell fraction will be isolated and
      labeled with CS-1000 in the operating room without entering cell culture, which will then be
      returned to the patient at the site of breast grafting. Patients will receive a
      pre-screening MRI . Patients will have an MRI scans over a period of 1 month at Johns
      Hopkins.  Follow-up MRIs  at 6,12, and 18 months will also be performed. Only at Johns
      Hopkins with fluorine being done as part of this investigational study.  By performing
      fluorine MRI and quantification of 19F signal, we hypothesize that the engraftment of
      transplanted cells can be tracked in ways not possible before, using the total fluorine
      signal as surrogate marker for cell persistence and survival. We expect that a clinically
      successful outcome (maintenance of breast contour and volume) will be positively correlated
      with cell survival. The outcome of this study may pave the way for using 19F MRI cell
      tracking as a new tool for stem cell therapy in a variety of clinical applications.
