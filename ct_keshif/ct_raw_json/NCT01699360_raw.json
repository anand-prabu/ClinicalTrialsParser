The need for frequent and\n      specific monitoring of drug concentrations remains essential, since the therapeutic dosing\n      and pharmacokinetics show great variability among recipients. However, this may be time and\n      cost consuming. Indeed, cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, and sirolimus are all metabolized by\n      CYP3A, consisting with the metabolic characteristic of endogenous cortisol and cortisone.\n      Hence, the present study is designed to determine if the endogenous cortisol and cortisone\n      metabolism can be used as an noninvasive probe for immunosuppressants pharmacokinetics in\n      Chinese renal transplant recipients."
