Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to\n      give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase III trial to study the effectiveness of melphalan followed by peripheral stem\n      cell transplantation in treating patients who have multiple myeloma."

At 36-48 hours following completion of melphalan, patients\n      receive infusion of PBSC followed by G-CSF subcutaneously daily until blood counts recover.\n\n      At 3 months to 5 years following high dose therapy and PBSC infusion, patients with evidence\n      of disease progression receive an additional treatment with high dose melphalan followed by\n      PBSC infusion as in the first course.\n\n      Patients are followed at 30-45 days, 6 months, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60-120 patients will be accrued for this study over 5 years."
