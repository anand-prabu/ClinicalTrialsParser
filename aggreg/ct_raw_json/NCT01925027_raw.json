All\n      patients will be treated with the Nano+ Polymer-free Sirolimus Coronary Stent System. All\n      patients will undergo angiographic (QCA) investigation at baseline (pre- and post-procedure)\n      and at 3 months follow-up. All patients will undergo OCT investigation at 3 months\n      follow-up. OCT investigation will be performed at 6 months follow-up in those patients where\n      the OCT criteria (coverage and stent apposition) were not met at 3 months OCT. Off-line OCT\n      and angiographic data analysis will be undertaken by an independent core laboratory\n      (Cardialysis BV, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) blinded to clinical and procedural\n      characteristics of the patients and according to pre-set Standard Operating Procedures. All\n      patients will be evaluated clinically at 3, 4, 5 months (for patients with 6 months OCT\n      follow-up evaluation will be at 8 months) and at 1 and 2 years. Clinical data will be\n      adjudicated by an independent Clinical Event Committee. An independent Data Safety and\n      Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor the individual and collective safety of the patients in\n      the study on an ongoing basis. This is a hypothesis generating study, because no evidence\n      about the expected magnitude of the effect is available at present. Data generated from this\n      study will be compared (historical control) against historical figures of other drug eluting\n      stents available at Cardialysis, for published data."
