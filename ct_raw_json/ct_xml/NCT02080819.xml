      This project proposes to investigate the role of brain connectivity in the mechanism of
      treatment response to dopaminergic medications in cocaine dependence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will use stochastic DCM, which is a recent DCM extension that takes into
      account hidden fluctuations in neuronal and vascular responses, and thus is especially
      suited for investigating effects of disease or drugs. In addition, this project will use
      nonlinear DCM, a DCM extension that can measure gating effects by striatum on
      cortico-cortical pathways. The overall aims of this project are: (1) To conduct functional
      magnetic resonance imaging-based DCM studies of working memory and impulsivity in order to
      determine the effective (directional) connectivity between PFC and striatum in
      treatment-seeking Cocaine Dependent (CD) subjects compared to non-drug using controls. We
      hypothesize that DLPFC causally affects ventral striatum in CDs, and that the strength of
      this connection is lower in CDs compared to controls. (2) To determine whether the
      pretreatment gating effect by the dorsal striatum, as a reflection of pretreatment
      hypodopaminergic state associated with chronic compulsive drug use, predicts the treatment
      response to dopaminergic pharmacotherapy in CDs. We hypothesize that lower pretreatment
      gating by the dorsal striatum on prefrontal-parietal effective connectivity predicts greater
      8-week improvement from treatment of CDs with DA enhancing medications (combined with
      cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT]), but not from treatment with placebo (combined with
      CBT).
