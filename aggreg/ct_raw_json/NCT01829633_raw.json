Some patients also completed a shoulder score. All\n      study patients will now be reexamined, 8 to 10 years after they were diagnosed.\n      Reexamination includes history taking, clinical examination, completion of three shoulder\n      scores (two shoulder specific scores, one general health score), Sonography and MRI.\n      Findings of interest are\n\n        -  the number of relapses during follow-up,\n\n        -  the need for surgical treatment during follow-up,\n\n        -  the deterioration of tear anatomy (tear size, muscle atrophy, fatty degeneration)\n           during follow-up\n\n        -  the actual clinical shoulder condition (as given by shoulder scores) at reexamination.\n\n      Study purpose: We want to assess the anatomic and clinical long-term results of\n      physiotherapy for potentially repairable rotator cuff tears. We want to find out if tear\n      anatomy of unrepaired rotator cuff tears deteriorates over time and if such a deterioration\n      is associated with a development of more serious degrees of symptoms."
