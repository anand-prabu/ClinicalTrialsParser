      The purpose of this study is to identify genetic changes that can interact with
      environmental factors to influence people's susceptibility to disease and responses to
      medical treatments. Therefore, we would like to study the genetic materials from you as part
      of the study. We will compare the DNA sequence from people with certain clinical features
      (observable characteristics, determined by both genes and environment) and/or treatment
      responses to the DNA from people without those clinical features and/or medication treatment
      responses to find the DNA sequence differences that exist. By combining this information
      with information from your medical records, it may be possible to identify the genetic
      changes that influence people's responses to different medical treatments. This project
      could lead to more knowledge about why certain people respond differently to a treatment.
      With such knowledge, future treatments potentially could become customized to a patient's
      unique genetic make-up.

      You will be one of participants enrolled in this research.
