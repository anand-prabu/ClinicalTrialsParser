  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present proposal investigates the role of the cholinergic system (the neurotransmitter
      acetylcholine) in improving vision and visual attention. Vision results from a complex
      processing of particular stimuli of the visual field. Attention enhances and prolongs the
      neural representations of visual input in the visual cortex. It has recently been shown that
      attention in the visual cortex depends on cholinergic mechanisms. The action of
      acetylcholine in the visual cortex consists in enhancement of the responsiveness to
      thalamocortical inputs, depression of local neuronal connections or extrastriate feedback
      projections and induction of gamma synchronisation. The investigators hypothesize that these
      effects are associated with long-term changes in functional connectivity in the visual
      cortex, visual attention and visual learning (improvement of the visual capacities).

      In the present proposal, the investigators will test whether the administration of donepezil
      (Aricept, 5mg), a drug that increases the level of acetylcholine in the brain, will enhances
      the perceptual-cognitive abilities of young adult subjects.  Perceptual-cognitive
      performance will be assessed in a multiple object tracking (MOT) task in a 3D automatic
      virtual environment. MOT is a task where observers are asked to maintain attentional focus
      on a limited number of preselected subgroup of elements in a dynamic scene. Multifocal
      attentional mechanisms are necessary to process the information. The task will be tested
      five time at one week interval to test whether donepezil and training improved the task
      performance of the subject, i.e. lead to perceptual learning. This study could help
      establish an intervention procedure to improve visual performance of subjects that need it.

      Stages of a given perceptual-cognitive task (from Faubert and Sidebottom, Journal of
      Clinical Sport Psychology, 2012, 6, 85-102):

        1. a predetermined number of spheres (typically eight) are presented in a 3D dimensional
           virtual volumetric cube space. The spheres are typically all identical.

        2. a subset of spheres (typically four) is indexed via highlighting for a brief period of
           1 s.

        3. the spheres return to their original color and start moving within the restricted 3D
           virtual space. During this movement, the spheres can collide and consequently suddenly
           change direction, and they can cross over others, thus occluding their view.

        4. the spheres stop moving after a predetermined time, and the observer has to identify
           the spheres that were initially indexed with halos. The subject is then given feedback
           on the response by having the spheres identified by revealing the appropriate indexed
           stimuli.

      The main task starts at a given speed, and if all four spheres are not correctly identified,
      the next trial will be slower. If the four spheres are correctly identified, then the next
      trial will be faster. Trials are repeated like this following a staircase procedure, and
      ultimately, a speed threshold is established.
