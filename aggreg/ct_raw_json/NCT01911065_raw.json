Volunteers in\n      this cohort will be identical twins and non-twins  40-49 years of age and will not be\n      vaccinated with the licensed zoster vaccine. (Zostavax vaccine is approved only for\n      individuals who are 50 years and above)\n\n      In the second cohort (vaccination study), healthy identical twin and non-twins who are 50\n      and above will be vaccinated with the licensed zoster vaccine, Zostavax. We will compare\n      age-related and inherited vaccine responses focusing on factors that control the initiation\n      of the T-cell immune response and T cell signatures at peak response that correlate with T\n      cell memory development and antibody production. To assess VZV viremia, we will test for VZV\n      by PCR at  5 study time points."
