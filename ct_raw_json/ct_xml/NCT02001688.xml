        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients between 18 and 65 years of age (inclusive).

          -  Able and willing to sign informed consent.

          -  Males, and non-pregnant, non-lactating females whose screening pregnancy test is
             negative and who are using contraceptive methods deemed reliable by the investigator
             or who are post-menopausal or surgically sterilized.

          -  Diagnosis of alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency [only individuals with a ZZ or Z null
             classification].

          -  FEV1 (forced expiratory volume at one second) â‰¥ 50% of predicted post bronchodilator

          -  No respiratory exacerbations within 6 weeks of baseline. Subjects can be re-screened
             if exacerbations exist at the time of enrollment.

          -  No signs of chronic or acute Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C or HIV infection (negative
             serologies for HIV and viral hepatitis).  Positive serologies due to hepatitis
             immunizations are acceptable.

          -  No significant abnormalities in serum hematology, serum chemistry, serum inflammatory
             / immunogenic markers and urinalysis.

          -  No significant abnormalities in ECG.

          -  Not on intravenous augmentation therapy for at least 8 weeks prior to initial dosing
             with study drug/placebo and willing to forego intravenous augmentation therapy for
             the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant intercurrent illnesses (except for respiratory or liver
             disease secondary to AAT deficiency), including: cardiac, hepatic, renal, endocrine,
             neurological, hematological, neoplastic, immunological, skeletal or other) that in
             the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with the safety, compliance or other
             aspects of this study. Patients with well-controlled, chronic diseases could possibly
             be included after consultation with the treating physician and the sponsor.

          -  History of life threatening allergy, anaphylactic reaction, or systemic response to
             human plasma derived products.

          -  History of life threatening transfusion reactions.

          -  History of lung transplant.

          -  Current or previous (up to 8 weeks from baseline) use of AAT augmentation therapy or
             by any other route

          -  Current use of oral or parenteral glucocorticoids in doses exceeding 10mg of
             prednisone daily or equivalent generics (substance and dose).

          -  Any lung surgery within the past two years.

          -  On any thoracic surgery waiting list.

          -  Active smoking during the last 12 months from screening date.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation.

          -  Woman of child-bearing potential not taking adequate contraception deemed reliable by
             the investigator.

          -  Presence of psychiatric/ mental disorder or any other medical disorder which might
             impair the patient's ability to give informed consent or to comply with the
             requirements of the study protocol.

          -  Evidence of alcohol abuse or history of alcohol abuse or illegal and/or legally
             prescribed drugs.

          -  IgA (immunoglobulin A) Deficiency.

          -  Inability to undergo bronchoscopy.

          -  Allergy to lidocaine or any other medicines used in the bronchoscopy process

          -  Exacerbation of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) in the previous 6 weeks.

          -  Participation in another clinical trial within 30 days prior to baseline visit.

          -  Inability to attend scheduled clinic visits and/or comply with the study protocol.

          -  Any other factor that, in the opinion of the investigator, would prevent the patient
             form complying with the requirements of the protocol.
