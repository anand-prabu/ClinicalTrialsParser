  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a non-randomized, consecutive enrollment, 10-year follow-up study of patients who are
      treated with the Ascension速 HRA.  Its purpose is to measure and document the outcomes
      associated with implanting the Ascension HRA prosthesis.  Patients will be periodically
      assessed to collect data related to safety and effectiveness endpoints at the following
      intervals: preoperative, surgery/immediate post-op, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 year, 5
      year, and 10 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At each assessment interval, information on complications and adverse events will be
      collected.  In addition, shoulder joint range of motion will be collected, and implants will
      be evaluated radiographically to determine joint position and assess implant with regards to
      radiolucencies, subsidence and subluxation (migration).  Patient satisfaction with regard to
      the effect of the implant on shoulder function, joint pain, and overall satisfaction will be
      assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS).  Furthermore, if there are any implant revisions
      during the 10-year follow-up for any of the patients enrolled in the study, the implant
      and/or surrounding tissue will be harvested if possible and submitted for histopathological
      examination.
