An average follow up duration of at least\n      12 months will be considered. Clinical outcomes will be assessed using the visual analog\n      scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Neck Disability Index (NDI). Pre-operative\n      scores will be compared to the latest follow-up scores. A board certified Neuro-radiologist\n      will assess the fusion rate. Fusion will be determined by the presence of bony bridging on 2\n      consecutive sections in at least 2 planes on computed tomographic imaging.\n\n      SECONDARY ENDPOINTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS The purpose of this study is to evaluate the level\n      of clinical and radiographic improvement in patients implanted with Silicate-Substituted\n      Calcium Phosphate (Si-CaP) as a bone graft substitute material for spinal fusions. More\n      comprehensive long term studies will be able to provide compelling evidence for the efficacy\n      of Si-CaP in terms of resulting in satisfactory fusion. They can more strongly support the\n      previously published data implying that Si-CaP can be utilized as an alternative to\n      autogenous bone graft in spinal arthrodesis procedures."
