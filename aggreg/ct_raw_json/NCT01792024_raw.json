To evaluate oncologic efficacy at 12 months following treatment based on biopsy of the\n      treatment zone.\n\n      II. To determine treatment-related safety and toxicity. III. To longitudinally assess\n      urinary and sexual function in the year following treatment.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients undergo MR-guided LITT.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, and 12 months."
