Though safety and efficacy have been\n      established world wide, only about 1 % of women have been reported to use this method.  Its\n      use is limited by bleeding pattern changes which result in requests for early removal, most\n      commonly within the first 8 months of use.\n\n      Women ages 18-51 years, choosing ESI  and who meet eligibility criteria, will be offered\n      enrollment in the study at the time of ESI insertion. Every effort will be made to insert\n      Implanon on the same day as consent unless medically contraindicated. Prospective diaries\n      will be completed starting on the date of ESI insertion.  All participants will be contacted\n      by study personnel 13 weeks after enrollment and queried as to the presence of unacceptable\n      bleeding.  Bleeding concerns will be objectively assessed using a modification of the\n      Pictorial Blood Loss Assessment Chart (PBLAC).\n\n      Participants initiating contact with bleeding concerns at any time after 13 weeks post-ESI\n      insertion will be offered treatment randomization at the time of contact.  The basis for\n      randomized treatment will be whether the bleeding is considered \"unacceptable\" to the\n      participant.  This is inherently subjective, but constitutes the basis for most removal\n      requests.  Participants that report unacceptable bleeding at 13 weeks post-ESI insertion,\n      and those who call with bleeding concerns anytime after 13 weeks post-ESI insertion, will be\n      randomized into one of two groups, Doxycycline or matching placebo.\n\n      Participants that do not report unacceptable bleeding will continue to complete diaries and\n      may be eligible for randomized treatment if unacceptable bleeding develops."
