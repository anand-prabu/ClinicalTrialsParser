Approximately 32 subjects will be assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups\n      (itraconazole or rifampin) in equal numbers, with approximately 16 subjects per group. In\n      Part B, the effects of steady-state dosing of E2609 on the PK of digoxin will be assessed in\n      approximately 18 subjects. In Part C, the effects of donepezil administered in combination\n      with, or 2 hours after, E2609 dosing on the PK of E2609 and metabolites, will be assessed in\n      approximately 24 subjects."
