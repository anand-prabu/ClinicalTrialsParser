      Purpose: To improve the diagnosis and assessment of severity of acute alcoholic hepatitis
      Participants: Patients admitted to one of ten centers with acute alcoholic hepatitis
      Procedures (methods): Consecutive patients admitted with acute alcoholic hepatitis will be
      enrolled in an NIH U01 study of acute alcoholic hepatitis where liver tissue, blood and
      stool will be collected to discover and validate factors associated with diagnosis, severity
      of disease and survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of new targeted therapies for alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is one of the more
      urgent needs in clinical hepatology. To reach this goal, large multidisciplinary networks
      are required. The proposed initiative &quot;Integrated Approaches for Identifying Molecular
      Targets in Alcoholic Hepatitis&quot; (InTeam) will coordinate a multidisciplinary group composed
      of clinicians, physician-scientists, basic scientists and bioinformatics experts. The
      overarching hypothesis of InTeam is that the most rational way to provide a useful framework
      for future clinical trials in (AH) consists of the (i) determination of key drivers of the
      disease process, (ii) classification of molecular profiles and subtypes of AH, and (iii)
      identification of &quot;druggable&quot; targets based on both key drivers and molecular
      classification. Moreover, mouse models for AH are lacking making it impossible to evaluate
      promising targets in preclinical mouse studies in a meaningful manner. For this purpose,
      InTeam will integrate data obtained from molecular pathology studies in human AH and
      functional studies of key pathways in animal models. The proposed InTeam consortium includes
      three research projects, ten clinical centers, a Human Biorepository and a Mouse Models
      Core. The Human Biorepository Core will generate the to-date largest collection of samples
      from patients with AH from 10 academic liver centers and a comprehensive database that will
      serve as a basis for the proposed translational studies and be a valuable asset for the
      broader scientific community. The Mouse Models core will conduct murine studies after
      establishing and evaluating mouse models of AH based on the pathophysiology and molecular
      drivers of human AH determined by this consortium.

        Patients with an episode of alcoholic hepatitis fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be
        eligible to participate in the study. Those patients who meet one or more exclusion
        criteria will not be included. We will prospectively include patients with the following
        inclusion criteria

    </study_pop>
    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients â‰¥18 and &lt;70 years of age.

          -  Active alcohol abuse defined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
             Mental Disorders IV (DSM IV) and excessive alcohol consumption prior to admission (&gt;
             60 g per day for men and&gt; 40 g per day for women).

          -  Moderate elevation of aminotransferases (usually less than 300 U / L) with a
             characteristic pattern of AST/ ALT ratio of 2:1.

          -  Elevated serum GGT and bilirubin levels.

          -  Absence of prior autoimmune liver disease (ANA&lt;1/80, SMA&lt;1/80, LKM1 neg, AMA neg).

          -  Absence of hepatitis B and C and HIV infection (anti-HCV, surface HBV antigen and
             anti-HIV neg).

          -  Patients with decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis will be suitable for inclusion (eg,
             acute gastrointestinal bleeding, acute renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy and
             bacterial infections).

          -  Because there are no non-diagnostic tools to diagnose alcoholic hepatitis,
             histological confirmation is required in all patients (preferably through a
             transjugular biopsy): alcoholic hepatitis will be diagnosed on the presence of the
             following histologic features:

          -  Steatosis (either macro or microvesicular).

          -  Hepatocellular damage (eg, hepatocyte ballooning and presence of Mallory-Denk
             bodies).

          -  Inflammatory infiltrate (predominantly polymorphonuclear cells).

          -  Pericellular or sinusoidal fibrosis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hepatocellular carcinoma.

          -  Complete portal vein thrombosis.

          -  Advanced or terminal extrahepatic diseases (eg heart failure, advanced lung diseases,
             advanced oncologic diseases).

          -  Lack of consent to participate in the study.

          -  Pregnancy.
