In\n      addition, journal case reports may only describe serious side-effects of toxicity such as\n      abnormal heart rhythms whilst more subtle clinical signs are rarely reported.\n\n      The investigators would like to study whether or not toxic levels may be approached in some\n      patients or whether more subtle toxicity symptoms and signs are missed. For example,\n      irregular heartbeat, low blood pressure or confusion/agitation.\n\n      Therefore, the investigators intend to study ropivacaine blood levels in patients receiving\n      a total hip replacement in the Golden Jubilee National Hospital. A series of timed samples\n      will be taken during the perioperative period. The anaesthesia and surgery will be performed\n      as routine and no new treatment will be involved. Patient demographics, ropivacaine blood\n      levels and clinical observations following LA administration will be collected."
