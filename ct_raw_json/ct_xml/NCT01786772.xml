      To determine changes in quadriceps muscle function following the application of ice and
      compression to the knee.

    <textblock>
      Novel rehabilitation methods, that specifically target decreased muscle activation due to
      joint pathology prior to strength training, have elicited greater improvements in muscle
      function and self-reported disability compared to traditional therapies. Preliminary
      evidence suggests applying cryotherapy to a joint prior to exercise can increase quadriceps
      activation. It is unknown if applying cryotherapy and intermittent pneumatic compression can
      also increase quadriceps force output and voluntary activation. The purpose of this study is
      to determine changes in quadriceps force output and voluntary activation following the
      application of cryotherapy and compression. The investigators hypothesize there will be an
      increase in quadriceps force output and voluntary activation following the application of
      cryotherapy and compression.

    <description>Quadriceps activation will be estimated by utilizing the burst-superimposition technique on a maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) and during a resting condition. The burst-superimposition technique provides the muscle with a percutaneous stimulus to recruit any remaining muscle fibers which have not been stimulated.</description>

    <description>Cryotherapy and intermittent pneumatic compression will be applied to the knee joint using a recirculating compression unit and knee sleeve. This unit will recirculate water which is between 1-3째 C. Circumferential intermittent pneumatic compression to the knee joint (5 to 50 mm Hg) will be applied in conjunction with cryotherapy. The duration of intervention will be 20 minutes.</description>
