            "textblock": "Corneal astigmatism after cataract surgery represents a considerable obstacle in the visual\n      rehabilitation of patients. Up-to-date astigmatic keratotomy represents a standardized and\n      effective procedure that allows decreasing of naturally occurring and surgically induced\n      astigmatism. The shape and architecture of the Arcuate Incisions are pre-calculated based on\n      a particular chosen nomogram. The different parameters of the Arcuate Incisions as radius,\n      opening and position angle and cutting depth can be achieved precisely by the laser\n      technology.\n\n      The laser-assisted Cataract surgery and the Arcuate Incisions are performed by means of a\n      femtosecond laser (VICTUS\u2122 FEMTOSECOND LASER PLATFORM\u00ae, Technolas Perfect Vision GmbH,\n      Munich, Germany) which is in the presented study under investigation and is already\n      CE-approved.\n\n      For this open, prospective data collection several selection criteria have been defined in\n      order to obtain a data set of  minimal 43 eyes and maximal 50 eyes. Depending on whether\n      they will be treated unilateral or bilateral the number of subjects enrolled within this\n      study sums up to 22-50 patients. The data is gathered in the Castrop-Rauxel Augenklinik and\n      only from one experienced surgeon."
