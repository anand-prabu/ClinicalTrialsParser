            "textblock": "Colonoscopy is the gold standard in the diagnosis of colorectal disease. The success of\n      colonoscopy depends on high-quality bowel preparation by patients. Inadequate bowel\n      cleansing reduces the cecal intubation rate, and the polyp detection rate (PDR). It also\n      increases costs, mostly due to repeated procedures. The quality of bowel cleansing has\n      remained suboptimal even though numerous different products and regimens have been tested\n      and compared in no fewer than six meta-analyses. Therefore, a completely different approach\n      to improve bowel cleansing is welcome.\n\n      Here the investigators assume that instant messaging program (Wechat) delivery the detail\n      and FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) of bowel preparation instructions would improve the\n      quality of the bowel preparation. The Wechat program has some advantages, 1. Wechat supports\n      over 400 million users, nearly half of the mobile subscribers population in China; 2. Wechat\n      provided a real time communications including voice messages, pictures and text exchange\n      timely; 3.Compare with telephone, Wechat is economical of both time and money; 4. Compare\n      with bowel preparation instructional software and litera or cartoon educational booklet,\n      Wechat is more interactive and responsive."
