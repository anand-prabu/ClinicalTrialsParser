    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the appearance and behavior of
      benign-looking adnexal masses.

        -  Benign-looking means that when viewed here by ultrasound it has the appearance of
           looking not harmful or not malignant.

        -  Adnexal refers to the 'adnexa', the space in the female pelvis on either side of the
           uterus (or where the uterus used to be if you previously had a hysterectomy). The
           adnexa includes, but is not limited to, the ovaries and the fallopian tubes.

        -  Masses refers to a variety of structures, including but not limited to:

             -  ovarian cysts that are fluid filled sacs within or attached to an ovary

             -  ovarian tumors that can be solid tissue or a combination of cysts and solid tissue

             -  hydrosalpinges that are fluid collections in the fallopian tube

      Many women have what appear to be benign adnexal masses.  Many times, removal of the masses
      with surgery is not necessary.  Often surgery is performed unnecessarily, for fear that
      these masses could be cancer.  There is not much information available for doctors to know
      how and when to follow these masses, or which ones will become cancer.

      This study will combine information from centers all around the world regarding the behavior
      of all types of benign adnexal masses.  The aim of this study is to develop decision tools
      for doctors to know the best way to treat these masses in order to improve the detection of
      ovarian cancer while at the same time reduce the number of unnecessary operations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any woman at least 18 years old with an adnexal mass.

          -  Any mass with benign ultrasound morphology may be suitable for conservative
             management.

          -  Pregnant patients can be included, but their data will be analysed separately.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cysts that are deemed to be clearly physiological and less than 3 cm in maximum
             diameter are not eligible for inclusion.

          -  Any cyst with features of malignancy is excluded from the  conservative management

          -  The denial or withdrawal of oral informed consent
