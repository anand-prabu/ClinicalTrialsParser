      Background:

      - The Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating (FLASHE) Survey is designed to look at
      health-related topics. It is being developed for the Department of Health and Human
      Services. Researchers want to see how easy or difficult the FLASHE survey questions are to
      understand and answer. They will interview parents and teenagers to test the survey
      questions.

      Objectives:

      - To test the FLASHE survey questions on teenagers and their parents.

      Eligibility:

        -  Adolescents between 11 and 18 years of age.

        -  Parents of the participating adolescents.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have a one-on-one interview to test the survey questions. The
           interview will last up to an hour and a half. Participants will be allowed to skip any
           questions that they do not wish to answer.

        -  Participants will receive financial compensation for their time.

      The National Cancer Institute   s (NCI) Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences
      (DCCPS), Behavioral Research Program (BRP) proposes conducting formative research as an
      integral part of the development of a new data collection instrument, the Family Life,
      Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating (FLASHE) survey. Specifically, NCI proposes conducting
      cognitive testing with the objective of identifying potential sources of measurement or
      response errors within the questionnaires. Many of the questions are new questions that have
      not been previously tested, or previously-used questions that have never been used with a
      teenage population.

        -  INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The DCCPS contractor, Westat, will be conducting the study. Participants for the cognitive
        interviews will be recruited from the general population, and will include dyads of a
        parent or caregiver, and his/her teenage child between the ages of 11 and 18. Neither the
        contractor who will be coordinating the research (Westat) or NCI employees will be
        eligible to participate in the cognitive interviews. Westat will recruit respondents using
        a variety of methods including use of Westat   s current database of potential
        participants and advertising on CraigsList in the local DC area under the Jobs postings
        within the subheading Et Cetera. Westat's digital media team will reach out to 100 local
        DC area (including lower Pennsylvania) publishers such as mommy and papi bloggers, health
        websites, giveaway publishers, and Facebook and Twitter users.
