We investigate the\n      association between CETP activities and the severity of atherosclerosis assessed by\n      intima-media thickness (IMT) and compare the atherogenic change between in subjects with\n      high HDL-C level, low HDL-C level, high CETP activities and low CETP activities by examining\n      the morbidity rate of atherogenic diseases, the rate of ischemic electrocardiography(ECG)\n      change, Calc Score of artery from chest X-ray, Ankle Brachial Index/Pulse Wave Velocity and\n      various serum atherogenic markers. And we also examine the correlation between normal lipid\n      profile and concentration, activity and function of surface lipoprotein in subjects with\n      variety of lipoprotein levels, including patients with hyper-LDL-cholesterolemia,\n      hyper-HDL-cholesterolemia with low or no CETP activity, patients with high level of remnant\n      cholesterol or hyperlipoproteinemia of apolipoprotein(Apo)B-48."
