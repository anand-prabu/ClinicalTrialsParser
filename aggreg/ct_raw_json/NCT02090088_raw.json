With respect to fetal outcome, it is\n      important to evaluate the spectrum of outcomes that may be relevant to a medication exposure\n      during pregnancy, and these include both easily recognizable defects that are visible at\n      birth, as well as more subtle or delayed defects that may not be readily identifiable\n      without special expertise and observation beyond the newborn period."

The\n             date of conception will be defined as fourteen days prior to the next expected\n             menstrual period for women who report a regular menstrual cycle. If the date of the\n             first day of the LMP is unclear, or if the estimated date of conception as determined\n             by a first-trimester ultrasound differs by more than one week from the date as\n             determined by the first day of LMP, the first-trimester ultrasound-derived date will\n             be used to estimate the timing of exposure to Nplate\u00ae, as well as timing of\n             enrollment. If neither a clear date of the first day of the LMP nor a first-trimester\n             ultrasound is available, the estimated date of conception for purposes of enrollment\n             will be determined by best estimate of the woman's prenatal care provider.\n\n          -  Agree to enroll at any time from the estimated date of conception up to any date\n             before the date of delivery or end of the pregnancy and who have not already had\n             prenatal diagnosis of any major structural birth defect in the current pregnancy\n             prior to enrollment.\n\n          -  Agree to provide consent for participation in the registry including follow-up\n             interviews.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Subjects will be ineligible for study participation if any of the following apply:\n\n          -  Exposure to Nplate\u00ae did not occur during pregnancy.\n\n          -  Prior knowledge of prenatal diagnosis of a birth defect.
