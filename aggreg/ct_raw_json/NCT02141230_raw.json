            "textblock": "Following results from the first survey that forms part of the EU RMP for Alli\u00ae (RMP survey\n      1; WEUSRTP3350), several amendments to the information included on the pack carton for Alli\u00ae\n      (orlistat 60 mg) were recommended. The main finding from RMP survey 1 was that a large\n      proportion of Alli\u00ae users had a body mass index (BMI) less than (<)28 kg/m2 .  (Note: the\n      European indication for Alli\u00ae  is adults 18 years and older with a BMI<28 kg/m2.) The\n      proportion of respondents overall who reported possible contraindications to Alli\u00ae use was\n      relatively low. The following changes to the pack labeling were agreed and have been\n      implemented: : (1) a statement, highlighting the product is only for those with a BMI of 28\n      or above was added to the front of the pack;  (2) wording of the BMI statement on the back\n      of the pack was strengthened; (3) contraindications were highlighted in bold text; (4) the\n      statement that Alli\u00ae is not for use by those under 18 years of age was modified for clarity.\n      In addition, a pharmacy reminder card was made available to retail pharmacists to improve\n      awareness of the prescribing information for Alli\u00ae.  The survey will assess whether\n      compliance with the authorized indication and contraindications among purchasers of Alli\u00ae\n      has been improved after one year of marketing the revised pack labeling."
