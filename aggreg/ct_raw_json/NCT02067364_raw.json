Our\n      Aim I product work will yield a clinic-ready prototype which adheres well to human skin,\n      conforms to the curve surface of the clavicle and provides a safe level of skin cooling over\n      an extended period of time. Many of the clinical uses of CRT will involve patient movement -\n      standing up to investigate suspected overdrainage, or the simple fidgeting of children\n      undergoing monitoring.  The Aim II Fit and Function testing will most importantly identify\n      movement-related product performance issues.  If we can identify the causes of \"signal\n      noise\", we can modify our sensor design to make it less susceptible to \"motion artifacts\".\n\n      Additionally testing will identify age/size specific issues - is the sensor small enough for\n      use on younger children, does the looser skin of older adults generate move motion artifacts\n      in the signal.\n\n      These studies will include 10 pediatric and 10 adult asymptomatic patients who are willing\n      to undergo CRT ShuntCheck testing over a one hour period.  Test results will not be used to\n      guide patient care and testing will not interfere with or delay any other patient testing or\n      care."
