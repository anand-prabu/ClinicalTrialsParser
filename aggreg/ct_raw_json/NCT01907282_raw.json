            "textblock": "The goal of this research is to conduct a multisite randomized trial to determine the\n      efficacy of a 6-month Family-Focused Treatment (FFT) in comparison with Enhanced Care (EC),\n      a treatment-as-usual intervention, in reducing symptoms, enhancing functional outcomes, and\n      preventing or delaying the onset of full psychosis in youth aged 12-35 years who meet\n      criteria for a prodromal risk syndrome according to the Structured Interview for Prodromal\n      Syndromes (SIPS). Our primary, secondary, and tertiary hypotheses, respectively, are that\n      at-risk probands will respond better to FFT than EC at 6- and 12-month follow-ups, in terms\n      of symptom trajectories (SIPS scores), social/family functioning, and first onset of full\n      psychosis. Subjects will be drawn from the participants in a prospective, longitudinal study\n      elucidating predictors and mechanisms of conversion to psychosis (North American Prodrome\n      Longitudinal Study, or NAPLS), on which the sites collaborate. Subjects will be interviewed\n      every 6 months for 1 year to assess positive and negative symptoms, academic and social\n      functioning, family functioning, and conversion to psychosis.\n\n      Recent progress in risk ascertainment methodology has enabled reliable identification of\n      persons with prodromal or \"clinical high-risk\" syndromes, 35% of whom develop psychosis\n      within 2 and \u00bd years. This paradigm provides an opportunity for developing and testing\n      interventions in the prodromal phase, before the onset of full psychosis and accumulation of\n      substantial functional disability. Psychosocial interventions appear to be well suited to\n      address issues of motivational deficits and functional disability in the psychosis prodrome.\n      Given our present state of knowledge regarding the mechanisms of psychosis onset, and given\n      that initial studies of antipsychotic drugs in prodromal patients have produced discouraging\n      results in terms of prevention, a short term reduction in symptom severity and functional\n      disability may represent a more achievable target than a reduction in psychosis incidence.\n      We have developed and piloted a version of FFT for clinical high risk youth (FFT-CHR)\n      consisting of psychoeducation, communication training, and problem-solving skills training.\n      In randomized trials, adults and adolescents with bipolar disorder and children at-risk for\n      bipolar disorder undergoing FFT improved symptomatically and functionally compared to\n      patients in brief psychoeducational control conditions. Further, an open trial of family\n      psychoeducation for youth at risk for psychosis demonstrated symptomatic and functional\n      improvements relative to baseline scores. However, no randomized controlled study has\n      examined the efficacy of FFT for reducing symptoms or functional disability in youth at risk\n      for psychosis.\n\n      In view of the improvements in quality of life and the reductions in costs of care that have\n      occurred with preventive approaches to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain forms\n      of cancer, the field of psychiatry is in need of a major commitment to an early\n      detection/prevention framework for its most debilitating syndromes - the psychotic\n      disorders. The prodromal risk syndrome criteria have resulted in clinical algorithms that\n      are highly effective in predicting onset of full psychosis. However, such knowledge will be\n      of limited utility if we lack the means of intervening in the pre-onset phase in a way that\n      either reduces the likelihood of progression to full psychosis, the accumulation of\n      functional disability, or both. There are currently no cost-effective, evidence-based\n      psychosocial approaches to psychosis prevention. Preventing the neurotoxic effects of early\n      episodes, before these illnesses become chronic, and minimizing the psychosocial sequelae of\n      early episodes, may do much to prevent the long-term disability caused by psychosis and\n      thereby have a major impact on public health. Our study will take the critical next step by\n      performing an initial efficacy test of a highly promising family-focused intervention\n      designed to stabilize symptoms and improve social and role functioning in at risk youth."
