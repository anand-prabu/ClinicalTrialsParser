  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Silicosis is a chronic and incurable occupational disease that can progress independent of
      the end of exposure. Recent works suggest that the Forced Oscillation Technique (FOT) may
      help to improve our understanding of the changes in lung mechanics, as well as in the
      detection of these changes.

      Objectives: Analyze the effects of airway obstruction in silicosis on the respiratory
      impedance and evaluated the diagnostic use of the FOT in these patients. For this, the
      investigators used spirometry to classify airway obstruction, which resulted in four
      categories: control, patients with normal exam, mild obstruction, and moderate-to-severe
      obstruction. Resistive data were interpreted using the zero-intercept resistance (R0), the
      resistance at 4 Hz (Rrs4) and the mean resistance (Rm). The investigators also analyzed the
      mean reactance (Xm) and the dynamic compliance (Crs,dyn). The total mechanical load was
      evaluated using the absolute value of the respiratory impedance (Z4Hz). The diagnostic
      potential was evaluated by investigating the area under the receiver operating
      characteristic curve (AUC).

        The control group will consist of healthy subjects, nonsmokers, who had no episode of
        respiratory infection thirty days before the examinations.

        The group with diagnosis of silicosis was established based on a history of substantial
        exposure to silica dusts and compatible radiological features, together with exclusion of
        other competing diagnoses.
