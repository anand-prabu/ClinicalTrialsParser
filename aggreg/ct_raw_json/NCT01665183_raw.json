ADI has been formulated with polyethylene glycol, and has\n      been used to treat patients that have cancers that require arginine. In this study, ADI will\n      be combined with the well known chemotherapy cisplatin, and the safety and potential\n      efficacy of this combination will be explored in patients with cancers that require\n      arginine."

Histologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced solid tumor (dose escalation\n             component) or metastatic melanoma (uveal or cutaneous) (doses escalation and MTD\n             expansion components) or platinum-resistant (tumor progression within ~ 6 months\n             after the completion of platinum-based therapy) ovarian carcinoma (high-grade serous,\n             endometrial or poorly differentiated endometroid) that is ASS deficient by IHC\n             (defined as <25 % cells ASS positive; see Table 1.4.1 for further details).\n\n          2. Unresectable disease or patient refused surgery.\n\n          3. Progressive disease if treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery or\n             immuno-therapy. If prior radiation was given, the measurable disease should be\n             outside the radiation port.\n\n          4. Measurable disease as assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria (Appendix A).\n\n          5. Age \u2265 18 years.\n\n          6. ECOG performance status of 0 - 1.\n\n          7. No prior systemic therapy, immunotherapy, investigational agent, or radiation therapy\n             within the last 4 weeks.\n\n          8. Fully recovered from any prior surgery and no major surgery within 4 weeks of\n             initiating treatment. Surgery for placement of vascular access devices is acceptable.\n\n          9. Female subjects and male subjects must be asked to use appropriate contraception for\n             both the male and female for the duration of the study. Subjects must agree to use\n             two forms of contraception or agree to refrain from intercourse for the duration of\n             the study. Females must not be pregnant at the start of the study, and a serum human\n             chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) pregnancy test must be negative before entry into the\n             study. If positive HCG pregnancy test, further evaluation to rule out pregnancy must\n             be performed according to GCP before this patient is claimed eligible.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Serious infection requiring treatment with systemically administered antibiotics at\n             the time of study entrance, or an infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy\n             within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n\n          2. Pregnancy or lactation.\n\n          3. Expected non-compliance.\n\n          4. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active\n             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III\n             or IV),  cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness, social situations that would\n             limit compliance with study requirements.\n\n          5. Subjects who have had any anticancer treatment prior to entering the study and have\n             not recovered to baseline (except alopecia) or \u2264 Grade 1 AEs, or deemed irreversible\n             from the effects of prior cancer therapy. AEs > Grade 1 that are not considered a\n             safety risk by the Sponsor and investigator may be allowed upon agreement with both.\n\n          6. Subjects with history of another primary cancer, including co-existent second\n             malignancy, with the exception of: a) curatively resected non-melanoma skin cancer;\n             b) curatively treated cervical carcinoma in situ; or c) other primary solid tumor\n             with no known active disease present in the opinion of the investigator will not\n             affect patient outcome in the setting of current cancer diagnosis.\n\n          7. Subjects who had been treated with ADI-PEG 20 previously."
