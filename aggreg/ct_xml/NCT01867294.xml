  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well giving spironolactone works in preventing
      rash in patients with advanced cancer receiving panitumumab and cetuximab. Spironolactone
      may prevent endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor-induced skin rash.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine feasibility of the administration of topical spironolactone versus placebo
      in this patient population. (Study I) II. To further explore the efficacy of the topical
      spironolactone to prevent/attenuate rash from EGFR inhibitors. (Study II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore efficacy of the spironolactone versus placebo. (Study I) II. To describe the
      efficacy of a Modified Preemptive Therapy Regimen intervention. (Study II) III. To explore
      the adverse event profile of spironolactone and the Modified Preemptive Therapy Regimen
      intervention. (Study II) IV. To explore patient reported outcomes of patients using
      spironolactone and a Modified Preemptive Therapy Regimen intervention. (Study II) V. To
      explore long term (8 week) effect of the 4 week treatment of spironolactone and a Modified
      Preemptive Therapy Regimen intervention on EFGR induced rash. (Study II)

      OUTLINE:

      STUDY I: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients apply spironolactone topically to face twice daily (BID) for 4 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients apply placebo topically to face BID for 4 weeks.

      STUDY II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients apply spironolactone topically to face and body BID for 4 weeks

      ARM II: Patients undergo modified preemptive therapy regimen consisting of skin moisturizer
      topically BID, sunscreen topically before going outside, hydrocortisone topically once daily
      (QD), and doxycycline orally (PO) BID for 4 weeks.

    <description>The primary analysis will be descriptive in nature, and will involve an intent-to-treat analysis at the end of week 4. Patients will be categorized dichotomously according to healthcare provider reported grade 2 or worse rash. The absence of any grade 2 or worse rash will be a success and the existence of any such rash will be a failure. Patients who do not complete the 4 week treatment will be considered a failure. Point estimates and 95% confidence limits will be calculated.</description>

    <description>Patients will be dichotomously categorized as a success if no rash is reported and a failure if rash exists at the end of 4 weeks. Frequency statistics will be employed to determine the percent of patients receiving efficacious treatment. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. The success rate will be used to further determine whether to proceed to Stage 2.</description>
