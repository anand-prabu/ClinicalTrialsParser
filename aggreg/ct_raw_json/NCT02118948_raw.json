            "textblock": "The purpose of the proposed research is to pilot test an innovative, theoretically-guided\n      sexual risk reduction intervention for women with a history of abuse. T intervention builds\n      on previous findings suggesting that it is important to address the psychological\n      consequences of abuse, as well as the typical antecedents of sexual risk behavior. To inform\n      intervention development, women who reported a history of abuse were recruited to\n      participate in key informant interviews. Based on interview findings and guided by theory\n      and empirical precedent, a novel sexual risk reduction intervention was developed and\n      refined. The intervention will be pilot tested with 80 women recruited from a\n      publicly-funded clinic who report a history of abuse and current sexual risk behavior. These\n      women will complete a computerized survey to assess abuse, adult sexual risk behavior,\n      HIV-related information, safer sex motivation, behavioral skills, interpersonal trust,\n      guilt, and powerlessness. Behavioral skills will also be assessed through role-plays and\n      simulation scenarios. Women will be randomly assigned to the novel intervention or to a\n      structurally equivalent intervention focused only on the psychological antecedents of sexual\n      risk behavior. Three months after intervention completion, women will return to complete\n      computerized interviews and behavioral skills assessments. The long-term goal of this\n      research is to develop a feasible and effective sexual risk reduction intervention for women\n      who have a history of abuse."
