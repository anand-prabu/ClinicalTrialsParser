The\n      investigators postulate that high efficacy statin could have superior effect on modification\n      of neointimal pattern, compared with lower efficacy statin. Our main hypothesis is that\n      Atorvastatin 40mg, high efficacy statin might have superior effect on modification of\n      neointimal pattern evaluated by serially followed OCT, compared with pravastatin 20mg in\n      patients with DES implantation."
