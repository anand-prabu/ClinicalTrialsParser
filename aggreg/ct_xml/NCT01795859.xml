      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study designed to
      evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of SD-809 ER for the treatment of chorea
      associated with Huntington's Disease.  Approximately 90 subjects will be randomized (1:1)
      into the study, with approximately 45 subjects receiving SD-809 ER and 45 subjects receiving
      placebo.  The study will be conducted at approximately 30 centers in the U.S. and Canada.
