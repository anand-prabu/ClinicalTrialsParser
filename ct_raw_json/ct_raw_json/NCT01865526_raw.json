In fact, a reduced  protein intake\n      decreases load on remaining nephrons, reduces signs and symptoms of uraemia, lessens the\n      accumulation of waste metabolic products and oxidant stress, improves insulin-resistance and\n      lipid profile, ameliorates proteinuria, additives effects of angiotensin-converting-enzyme\n      inhibitors, and decreases likelihood of patients death or delays initiation of dialysis by\n      40%.\n\n      Dietary adjustments in subjects with chronic renal failure are complex because multiple\n      nutrient modifications are required and changes in lifestyle must be maintained for years.\n      Furthermore, low-protein diet is considered tedious, unpalatable and difficult to achieve.\n      This has an obvious negative influence on the quality of life of patients and makes their\n      adherence to the new therapeutic prescriptions more difficult. In fact, the difficulty to\n      reach patients' compliance is well known. There is ample evidence  that poor adherence is\n      considered a critical barrier to treatment success and remains one of the leading challenges\n      to healthcare professionals. Few data are available in clinical practice concerning the\n      patients' compliance to low protein diet. A dietary interview method is a validated\n      instrument to evaluate the practice and routines related to the assessment of nutrient\n      intake in nondialyzed CKD patients and to obtain the patients' compliance. However, the\n      interview requires the presence of a dedicated dietitian and a lot of his time.\n\n      For these reasons, and because of the absence of dedicated dietitians in many nephrology\n      centres, it is usual practice to give standard low protein diets to CKD patients not on\n      dialysis.\n\n      Aim of this study was to verify if few simple tips were able to reduce protein, phosphate\n      and sodium intake in patients with CKD, as compared to the practice of giving a low protein\n      diet elaborated by a renal dietitian."
