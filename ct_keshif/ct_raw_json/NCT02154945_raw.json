Refractive Change:  progesterone-mediated changes in fluid content partially accounts\n           for refractive change of lens and cornea; myopic shift of less than  1 D was observed\n           in  in 15% of participating pregnant women\n\n        2. Night vision decreased mainly with low serum vitamin A levels in pregnant women.\n\n        3. Fall of the IOP in second half of pregnancy (about 10% drop)\n\n        4. Corneal changes (increased thickness; decreased sensitivity) = contact lens intolerance\n\n      The retina and optic nerve are considered part of central nervous system, the retina and\n      choroid are highly vascularized.  Due to changes in CSF and brain volume, vascular and fluid\n      changes all over the pregnant woman's body we expect to find changes in RNFL and macular\n      thickness during pregnancy."
