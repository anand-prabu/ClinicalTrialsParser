Treatment repeats every 28 days in\n      the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine and bryostatin 1 until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at\n      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxic effects.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 2-3 patients per month will be accrued for this study."
