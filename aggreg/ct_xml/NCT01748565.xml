    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify biological markers that might predict premature
      infants who are at a higher risk for developing BPD, and to correlate the presence of these
      markers with infant symptoms and lung function in the first year after discharge from the
      hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common form of lung injury that can be triggered by
      premature birth and the unavoidable exposures to treatments regularly used for premature
      infants,including mechanical ventilation and oxygen as well as conditions that occur
      frequently among premature infants including infection. Almost all infants who are born
      prematurely are exposed to either mechanical ventilation, extra oxygen, and many will
      develop at least one infection; however, not all premature infants will develop BPD. There
      is currently no way to identify those infants who are at risk for developing BPD, nor are
      there prognostic or diagnostic tests to determine the severity of lung disease in the first
      year after discharge from the hospital.

      The application of UPLC-tandem mass spectrometry for quantification of urinary biomarkers of
      oxidative stress is an important technical innovation that will permit sensitive and
      reproducible analyses of urinary biomarkers with minimal sample preparation to better define
      disease phenotypes. Establishing a direct correlation between biomarkers of oxidative stress
      and GRP will accelerate investigation into the mechanisms leading to chronic pediatric lung
      disease and childhood origins of pulmonary disease.
