The purpose of this current study is how it affects people's visual\n      function and activities of daily living and to collect additional data on Argus II users in\n      order to monitor the System's safety. In addition, data about the long-term reliability of\n      the System will be gathered.\n\n      The Argus II retinal implant will be surgical implanted into patients who are blind but the\n      surgical procedure is not a part of this observational study. Our hypothesis is that the\n      visual results in our hands will be comparable to those reported in the FDA study. We will\n      use the results of this study to plan future enhancements to the service and to explore the\n      use of the device for other blinding conditions."
