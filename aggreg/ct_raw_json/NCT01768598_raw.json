This\n      study aims to determine why this is the case by identifying risk factors for wrist\n      fractures. The increase in fracture during childhood and adolescence may be associated with\n      1) risk-taking behaviour in boys, 2) obesity trends in boys during childhood and\n      adolescence, and/or 3) impaired acquisition of bone strength during childhood and\n      adolescence. Importantly from a knowledge translation perspective, modifiable factors such\n      as behaviour, dietary habits or physical activity in boys may predict fracture.\n\n      The investigators will measure 400 children (100 girls and 100 boys who have sustained a\n      fracture; 100 same age and sex friends) across 4 years of growth. This study will assess\n      risk behaviours, diet, physical activity, motor proficiency (i.e., balance and\n      coordination), fat and muscle mass and bone strength to determine if there are, 1)\n      differences in whether all or some of these factors predict fractures in boys compared with\n      girls and, 2) whether these factors track forward similarly in boys compared with girls as\n      children advance through the growth spurt."
