Determine the one year survival and complete response rate of patients\n      treated with doxorubicin HCl liposome/cyclophosphamide/vincristine/prednisone (Doxil-CVP)\n      for AIDS-related lymphoma. II. Evaluate the toxicity of a combination chemotherapy regimen,\n      Doxil-CVP, in this patient population. III. Evaluate the progression free and overall\n      survival after treatment with Doxil-CVP in this patient population. IV. Evaluate the effects\n      of treatment with Doxil-CVP on plasma viral mRNA levels, CD4+ lymphocyte count, and the\n      incidences and types of opportunistic infections in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease characteristics. All patients receive\n      a 30 minute infusion of doxorubicin HCl liposome IV, cyclophosphamide IV, and vincristine IV\n      on day 1. Patients also receive oral prednisone on days 1-5. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is\n      administered subcutaneously starting on day 6 and continues until the absolute neutrophil\n      count is at least 10,000/mm3. Treatment courses are repeated every 21 days. Patients with\n      lymphomatous bone marrow involvement and/or category J lymphoma receive cytarabine and\n      methotrexate intrathecally weekly for 4 weeks. Patients with lymphomatous meningitis receive\n      whole brain irradiation and an alternating intrathecal chemotherapy regimen. A minimum of 4\n      and a maximum of 8 courses are administered. Patients are removed from the study for\n      progressive disease, stable disease after 4 courses, a life threatening infection that would\n      delay treatment for more than 6 weeks, or any delay, except due to neutropenia, in\n      chemotherapy treatment for more than 6 weeks. Patients who achieve a complete response\n      receive an additional 2 courses of therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2\n      years, every 6 months for 3 years, and annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 38 patients will be accrued for this study."
