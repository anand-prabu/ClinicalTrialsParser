Patients are stratified according to risk score (low\n      risk vs high risk).\n\n      Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV 5 days a week on weeks 1-2. Treatment repeats every 4\n      weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n      Patients with stable disease or better may receive additional courses of treatment. Patients\n      who achieve a complete remission (CR) should receive 2 additional courses of treatment after\n      documentation of CR.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 8 weeks during study, and then at 4 weeks\n      after study completion.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, every 3 months until completion of study treatment, and\n      then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-110 patients (15-55 per stratum) will be accrued for this\n      study."
