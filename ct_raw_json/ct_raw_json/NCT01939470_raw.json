These\n      estimates are based primarily on Caucasian populations with limited information in Native\n      Americans. Native American women may be considered high risk for osteoporosis due to\n      lifestyle factors in conjunction with the incidence of diabetes. The objectives of this\n      study are to: 1) determine the prevalence of osteopenia/osteoporosis in Native American\n      female volunteers, aged 50+ years, who are eligible for health care through Indian Health\n      Services; 2) to evaluate their rate of bone loss, 3) to assess the relationship between\n      lifestyle factors, inflammatory mediators, and select endocrine parameters on osteoporosis\n      risk; and 4) determine the barriers to treatment. Native American women aged, 50+ years, who\n      are eligible for services through Indian Health Services in the Oklahoma City (OKC) Area\n      will be recruited. Participants will undergo a baseline osteoporosis risk assessment, i.e.\n      medical history, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans, dietary and physical activity\n      assessment, and optional blood draw, and then encouraged to return to their primary care\n      physician for counsel and/or treatment. Serum markers of bone metabolism, endocrine\n      parameters (e.g. vitamin D metabolites) and inflammatory molecules will be assessed for\n      participants that consent to the blood draw. All participants will receive educational\n      information related to osteoporosis risk and prevention, and follow-up visits scheduled at\n      the end of Year 1 and Year 2. Data will be analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and\n      logistical regression with the \u03b1 set at 0.05 for statistical significance."
