    <textblock>
      The objective of this study will be to investigate the safety and tolerability of olaparib
      tablet when given orally to Japanese patients with advanced solid malignancies.  In
      addition, the pharmacokinetic profile, MTD (if possible) and efficacy of olaparib will be
      investigated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects diagnosed with advanced solid malignancies who are refractory to standard
             therapies or for which no standard therapy exists.

          -  Subjects who have overall good overall general condition.

          -  Subjects who agree to hospitalisation from starting olaparib to multiple dose period
             at day 15.

          -  Evidence of non-childbearing status for women of childbearing potential, or
             postmenopausal status.

          -  Subjects who have at least one lesion (measurable and/or non-measurable) that can be
             accurately assessed by CT/MRI at baseline and follow up visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who received any previous treatment with a PARP (poly adenosine
             diphosphate-ribose polymerase) inhibitor, including olaparib.

          -  Subjects receiving inhibitors of CYP3A4 (cytochrome P450 3A4).

          -  Subjects with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases.

          -  Subjects with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia.

          -  Subjects with a known hypersensitivity to olaparib or any of the excipients of the
             product.
