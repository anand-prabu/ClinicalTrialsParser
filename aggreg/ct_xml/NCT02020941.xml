      This phase II trial studies how well carfilzomib works in treating patients with multiple
      myeloma in first relapse or refractory to first-line therapy. Carfilzomib may stop the
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the overall response rate of carfilzomib after 8 cycles of treatment in
      patients with first-relapsed myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the overall response rate to single agent carfilzomib after 4 cycles of
      treatment.

      II. To assess progression-free survival (PFS). III. To assess time to progression (TTP). IV.
      To assess duration of response (DOR). V. To assess toxicities.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the effect of carfilzomib alone or in combination with dexamethasone on the
      following biologic end points and their correlation with response: measurements of bone
      remodeling (sodium fluoride F 18 positron emission tomography [PET], serum markers of bone
      remodeling and the bone marrow osteoblastic and osteoclastic differentiation and function)
      with the measurement of disease response and proteasome activity in the bone marrow
      microenvironment.

      II. To describe recapture of response after progression in the maintenance phase.

      OUTLINE:

      TREATMENT PHASE (COURSES 1-8): Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over 30
      minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 8 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving less than
      partial response (PR) also receive dexamethasone orally (PO) or IV weekly in courses 4-8.

      MAINTENANCE PHASE (COURSES 9-14): Patients receive carfilzomib IV over 30 minutes on days 1,
      2, 15, and 16. Patients who received dexamethasone in the Treatment Phase continue to
      receive dexamethasone PO or IV weekly. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months.

          -  Multiple myeloma (MM) in first relapse or refractory to first line therapy; the
             previous line of therapy should include either an immunomodulatory agent or a
             proteasome inhibitor

               -  Refractory disease is defined as =&lt; 25% response or progression during therapy
                  or within 60 days after completion

                    -  Induction chemotherapy for peripheral-blood stem cell harvest followed by

                       induction regimen

                    -  Planned maintenance therapy after stem cell transplantation or other
                       induction therapy is not considered a separate line of therapy, as long as
                       there is no evidence of progression in the time between the induction or
                       transplantation and the initiation of maintenance therapy

                    -  Two ASCTs within 6 months of each other is considered as one line unless

                    -  If the same regimen is repeated after a 6-month interval, they are
                       considered to be two separate therapeutic lines

                    -  If cyclophosphamide is used for reasons other than planned stem cell
                       mobilization, its use is considered to be a separate line of therapy

                    -  If a regimen was stopped for more than 2 months, its re-initiation is
                       counted as another line of therapy
