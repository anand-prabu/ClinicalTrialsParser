These will be taken by the\n      anesthetists.\n\n      After the surgery:\n\n      Holter ECG will be set up for 7 days of continuous recording. Each patient will fill in an\n      observation notebook. The biological samples will be analysed immediately and the biological\n      data obtained will be recorded in the observation notebook."
