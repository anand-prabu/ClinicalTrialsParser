Blood samples are obtained from both the patient and the\n      sibling (and both living parents, if available).\n\n      The blood samples are genotyped using approximately 300 micro-satellite markers flanking 100\n      candidate genes previously implicated in genetic risk for cancer. Certain loci are a\n      priority due to their association with HRAS1: BRCA1 and all known mismatch repair loci;\n      other repair genes, such as ATM; the Bloom's syndrome locus; and the XRCC group. Other genes\n      are also mapped.\n\n      Patients do not receive the results of the genetic testing and the results do not influence\n      the type and duration of treatment.\n\n      Patients only are followed annually.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 1,000 patient-sibling pairs for breast cancer.\n      After 18 months, another 1,000 patient-sibling pairs will be accrued for breast cancer.\n      Therefore, up to 2,000 patient-sibling pairs will be accrued over 5 years. (Feasibility of\n      accruing pairs for lung, colon, and prostate cancer is being assessed.)"
