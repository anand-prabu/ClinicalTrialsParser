  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this First Time in Patient study is to obtain initial information on the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical efficacy of repeat daily
      administration of danirixin in subjects with symptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD) having mild to moderate airflow limitation and are at high risk for future
      COPD exacerbations.

      The study will be conducted in two parts.  Part A will be a two week open label, single arm
      study in patients with COPD to obtain pharmacokinetic data and safety information of repeat
      dosing of danirixin in the population of interest.  Approximately 10 subjects will be
      enrolled in Part A of the study.  Progression to and dose selection for Part B will occur
      following review of the data collected in Part A. Part B will be a 52-week, randomized,
      double-blind (sponsor unblind), placebo-controlled on top of standard of care, parallel
      group study. Part B will evaluate several clinical efficacy assessments related to
      exacerbations and respiratory symptoms.  Approximately 100 subjects will be enrolled with a
      target of 80 subjects completing 52 weeks of danirixin administration.
