It is hypothesized that daily\n      avoidance inclinations will significantly moderate the effect of daily approach inclinations\n      on drinking behaviors, and that significant increases in avoidance inclinations will be\n      observed prior to treatment entry, followed by significant decreases in approach\n      inclinations during treatment."
