The initial goal of this study was to define the toxicity of interleukin-1\n      administered for 7 days prior to ICE chemotherapy.  A total of 22 patients have been treated\n      with IL-1 and ICE and results showed a more rapid engraftment (4.5 days) with IL-1.  A\n      second cohort of 18 patients also received G-CSF and engraftment was further shortened in\n      some subgroups.  Overall, the median time to engraftment was 16 days with both IL-1 and\n      G-CSF.  Accrual will continue to further define the toxicity and efficacy of this regimen."
