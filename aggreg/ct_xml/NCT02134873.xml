  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies show that babies in hospital undergo an average of 4 to 5 painful procedures,
      such as heel lances, every day. Sucrose (sugar water) has been shown to be effective for
      reducing babies' pain during painful procedures. Unfortunately, sucrose is not used as often
      as it could be to reduce babies' pain. This may be due to lack of certainty about the least
      effective amount of sucrose to use and concerns about the long-term effects of repeated use
      of sucrose on infant development. Factors within the hospital units where babies receive
      care may also influence caregivers' decisions to use sucrose. In this research the
      investigators will conduct two main studies. In the first study the investigators will
      determine the lowest amount of sucrose needed to manage babies.

    <description>Sucrose will be administered by a research nurse experienced in neonatal intensive care using a standardized procedure and timing consistent with policies in the participating units, including: (a) administering sucrose 2 minutes prior to the heel lance to ensure peak effects; (b) giving the total volume of sucrose drop by drop via syringe on the anterior surface of the tongue, as tolerated, over a period of up to 1 minute to allow for individual infant swallowing rates and to ensure analgesic effects are sustained during the heel lance procedure; and (c) offering a pacifier for non-nutritive sucking (NNS) immediately following sucrose administration.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Infants 24 to 42 weeks gestational age (GA) at birth, admitted to the Neonatal
             Intensive Care Unit (NICU), and scheduled to receive a heel lance will be eligible.
             Parents will be approached for participation within the first 2 weeks of the infant's
             life.  Infants will be eligible for Trial 1, the non-opioid trial, if they have not
             received any opioids within 24 hours prior to the heel lance. Infants will be
             eligible for Trial 2, the opioid trial, if they are currently receiving an opioid
             infusion. Furthermore, observation of the procedures will be timed to ensure that no
             additional sucrose doses are provided within the previous 4 hours.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Infants will be excluded if they have a contraindication for sucrose administration
             (e.g., unable to swallow, pharmacologically muscle relaxed, or heavily sedated) due
             to safety concerns and/or inability to assess pain accurately (e.g., unable to
             clearly view the infant's face).
