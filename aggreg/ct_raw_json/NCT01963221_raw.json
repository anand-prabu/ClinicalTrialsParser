            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between thoracic aortic\n      inflammation and arterial stiffness in elderly patients.\n\n      Vascular-aging is accompanied by a gradual remodeling affecting both cardiac and arterial\n      walls. Arterial hypertension, an established cardiovascular risk factor, has been suggested\n      to exert pro-inflammatory actions threw several biological mediators enhancing arterial\n      stiffness. Both effects of aging and hypertension are associated with higher levels of\n      arterial stiffness, but their respective role is not well established in the pathophysiology\n      of arterial stiffening.\n\n      Few data are available neither on the real anatomic aortic impact of aging and hypertension\n      on aortic compliance and ventricular function and its relationship to arterial stiffness\n      assessed by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, nor on the reliability of cine phase\n      contrast magnetic resonance imaging arterial stiffness measurements.\n\n      Recent studies using positron emission tomography imaging (PET) with 18 F fluorodeoxyglucose\n      (FDG) has been advocated as a means of measuring arterial wall inflammation in various\n      population referred for oncology staging. FDG uptake is correlated with the number of\n      cardiovascular risk factors and even the risk of future cardiovascular events. This method,\n      combined with X-ray computed tomography (CT), has also demonstrated that aortic\n      calcifications quantified by CT and local signs of inflammation detected by FDG uptake\n      contribute to arterial stiffness. A strong relationship between large vessels stiffening\n      assessed by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity measurement, aortic calcifications\n      quantified by CT and inflammation evaluated by FDG uptake has been demonstrated.\n\n      Therefore, in the current study, we use FDG PET associated to CT to characterize aortic\n      inflammation and aortic calcifications coupled to pulse wave velocity measurement and\n      cardiac function in elderly individuals.\n\n      In fact, if vascular aging promoting a local inflammatory process is a risk factor for\n      cardiovascular disease, then vascular changes assessed by non-invasive vascular imaging\n      (MRI,FDG PET) could represent a potential target for treatment and prevention Thirty\n      individuals \u2265 65 years of age were examined, 15 hypertensive subjects and 15 controls. Pulse\n      wave velocity, a surrogate for aortic stiffness, was measured both by cine phase contrast\n      magnetic resonance imaging and applanation tonometry. Brachial pulse pressure, carotid\n      calculated pulse pressure and pulse pressure amplification (brachial to carotid ratio),\n      predictors of cardiovascular mortality were also quantified. Thoracic aorta local\n      inflammation and calcification were measured by 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission\n      tomography/computed tomography imaging. Moreover, biomarkers of low grade inflammation\n      (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin 6 were also determined)."

Time intervals were determined by subtracting the delays, which were measured at each site between the R waves of ECG and the onset of the pulse waves and while averaging results from ten consecutive beats. Arterial length was defined as the distance from the suprasternal notch to the femoral radial minus the distance from the carotid artery to the suprasternal notch. Central systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures were estimated by recording the carotid pulse wave velocity.",

Aortic activity was quantified using a conventional method on consecutive slices, which were orientated perpendicular to the aorta like described in previous publication. Region of interest (ROI) were drawn around the aorta on each trans-axial slice, allowing mean (SUVmean) and maximal aortic SUV (SUVmax) to be determined on every slice.  These values were averaged to determine SUVmean and SUVmax for the ascending aorta, the aortic arch and the descending aorta.\nAll PET scans were analyzed independently by two trained observers (VR, PM).",
