As part of this\n      expansion, CMS mandated that a national registry be formed to compile data on Medicare\n      patients implanted with primary prevention ICDs to confirm the appropriateness of ICD\n      utilization in this patient population.\n\n      Responding to this mandate, a collaborative effort of the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS)and the\n      American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), utilizing the expertise of the National\n      Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR\u00ae), developed the ICD Registry\u2122. Enrollment opened on June\n      1, 2005. CMS selected the NCDR ICD Registry as the mandated national registry in October\n      2005."
