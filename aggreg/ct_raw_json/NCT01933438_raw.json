            "textblock": "The brachial plexus is a group of 5 nerves from the spinal cord that provide the movement\n      and sensation of an upper extremity. In some difficult deliveries, traction on the shoulder\n      may lead to damage to the brachial plexus and will result in an arm that is paralyzed. This\n      is called 'birth related brachial plexus injury' (BRBPI). This may occur in up to 1/1000\n      births and the nerves may be injured minimally to severely. About 2/3 of children with this\n      injury will recover to quite functional levels simply by maintaining looseness of joints\n      while their nerves slowly heal. Some children have nerve injuries severe enough that they\n      require surgical reconstruction with nerve grafts and nerve transfers to achieve even\n      adequate function. Even in children with otherwise \"good\" recovery, the motions of external\n      rotation of the shoulder and supination of the forearm are weaker, later to recover, and\n      often incomplete.  More importantly, lack of full motion leads to long term changes in the\n      structure, growth, and posture of the shoulder requiring further musculoskeletal surgery, or\n      a child with permanent deformity or disability.\n\n      Any gains in active and passive range of motion during the first year of life may improve\n      these long-term shoulder outcomes. The investigators have instituted a program of early\n      passive repositioning mostly using a custom Sup-ER (Supination and External Rotation) splint\n      during early growth and development to improve arm position and range of motion where ER and\n      Sup are weak. In compliant patients in a pilot study, the speed and strength of recovery of\n      ER and Supination are improved compared to historical controls. It is a novel splint and\n      protocol designed by the investigators. This study is a randomized controlled trial to\n      evaluate the use of the Sup-ER protocol in multiple centres over a two year period by\n      assessing the arm function at common time points in recovery.  The subjects are randomized\n      to the Sup-ER protocol or the currently accepted standard treatment."
