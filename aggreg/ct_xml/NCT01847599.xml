      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the implementation of an
      educational program on adherence to capecitabine alone or in combination to lapatinib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      200 subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria treated by capecitabine +/-
      lapatinib, will be enrolled into the study. Adherence to treatment of all subjects will be
      assessed during a first adherence evaluation period of 3 cycles in order to identify
      patients who need educational intervention(non adherent patients). Only nonadherent patients
      (adherence rate &lt; 80%) will receive an education intervention. During the educational
      program, the efficacy of the implementation of an educational program on adherence to
      capecitabine alone or in combination to lapatinib will be evaluated for the 6 subsequent
      cycles.
