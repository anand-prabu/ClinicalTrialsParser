Under direct visualization, 50mL (of the 100mL) will be infused over the esophageal hiatus. The remaining 50mL will be infused throughout the abdomen. The infusion line will then be flushed with 30mL of Normal Saline to ensure the entire treatment dose is delivered, and no Ropivacaine remains in the tubing.
