Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)\n      of vinorelbine given on a weekly schedule combined with standard whole pelvic radiation\n      therapy. III. Access the toxic effects of paclitaxel given weekly in combination with the\n      regimen determined to be the MTD of vinorelbine. IV. Determine the MTD of paclitaxel given\n      weekly in combination with the regimen determined to be the MTD of vinorelbine.\n\n      OUTLINE: Part I: Vinorelbine IV bolus is administered over 8-10 minutes on day 1 prior to\n      radiation therapy. Whole pelvic radiation treatment is given on days 1-5 followed by 2 days\n      of rest. The treatment volume encompasses all suspected pelvic disease with a minimum of 1\n      cm margin. Cycles repeat weekly. Dose of vinorelbine is escalated in cohorts of at least 3\n      patients until maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. Part II: Paclitaxel is infused\n      over 1 hour immediately following vinorelbine at the MTD, as determined in part I. Dose of\n      paclitaxel is escalated in cohorts of at least 3 patients until the MTD is determined. At\n      least 6 patients are treated at the MTD for both parts I and II of the study. Patients are\n      followed for late and chronic toxicities.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Projected accrual is 12 patients per year for approximately 3 years."
