Determine the toxicities associated with a 4-hour infusion of antitransferrin\n      receptor antibodies with one antibody administered by itself for 1 hour before the second\n      antibody infusion is started. II. Determine the pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibodies\n      E2.3 and A27.15.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalating study. Patients receive antitransferrin antibody A27.15\n      IV over 4 hours. One hour after the initiation of the A27.15 infusion, infusion of antibody\n      E2-3 is added by IV piggy back. In the absence of antimouse antibodies and toxic effects,\n      treatment continues once every 4 weeks in patients achieving minimal, partial, or complete\n      remission. Treatment ceases in patients experiencing stable or progressive disease. In the\n      absence of dose limiting toxicity in the first 3 patients treated, subsequent cohorts of 6\n      patients each receive escalating doses of antitransferrin antibodies E2.3 and A27.15 on the\n      same dose schedule. If dose limiting toxicity occurs in 2 of 6 patients at a given dose\n      level, then dose escalation ceases and the next lower dose is declared the MTD. Patients are\n      followed for 3 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 18-27 patients within 2 years."
