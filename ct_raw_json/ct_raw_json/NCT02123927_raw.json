This study\n      will look at lab results and side effects in people who took TAK-438. This study consisted\n      of 2 sequential studies: a single rising dose study (Steps 1 to 7) and a food-effect study\n      (Steps 8 and 9).\n\n      The study population for Steps 1 to 7 consisted of 12 participants; with 9 participants\n      randomized to receive a single dose of TAK-438, and 3 participants to receive placebo.\n      Participants in Steps 1 to 7 received a single dose of study drug after a 10-hour fast. The\n      starting dose was 1 mg followed by administrations of 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 120 mg. Steps 8\n      and 9 consisted of 12 participants in a 2-sequence, 2-period crossover design. Four\n      participants were to receive a single dose of TAK-438 and 2 participants were to receive a\n      single dose of placebo on Day 1, in the fasted state, and 4 participants were to receive a\n      single dose of TAK-438 and 2 participants were to receive a single dose of placebo on Day 1\n      in the fed state, followed by a second single dose of TAK-438 or placebo in the alternative\n      fed state after a 13 day minimum washout period.  Participants in Steps 8 randomized to\n      receive TAK-438 will receive 10 mg and participants in Step 9 will receive 40 mg.\n\n      This single-centre trial was conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this\n      study was up to 32 days depending on the Step assignment. Participants made 3 to 5 visits to\n      the clinic, including one or two 8-day periods of confinement to the clinic, also depending\n      on Step assignment. All participants made a final visit 15 days after last dose of study\n      drug for a follow-up assessment."
