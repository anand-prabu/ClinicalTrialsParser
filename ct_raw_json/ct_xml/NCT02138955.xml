  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center in patient/outpatient, uncontrolled dose escalating study in cancer
      patients to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of body
      surface area adjusted doses of liposomal curcumin administered intravenously as an 8 hour
      infusion once weekly for 8 weeks.

    <description>The primary objectives of this study are to determine in cancer patients the safety profile of increasing doses of intravenous liposomal curcumin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. This will be done by assessing clinical chemistry, hematology, EKGs and urine analyses, signs and physical symptoms of adverse events.</description>
