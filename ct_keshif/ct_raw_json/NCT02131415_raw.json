Study assessments and\n      administration of questionnaires will take place during the patient regular assessments or\n      injection visits that are part of routine care. The main objective of the study is to\n      describe the impact of treatment with Abilify Maintena\u2122 on global functional status."

For all patients that will be included in the\n                study, the decision to initiate treatment with Abilify Maintena\u2122 must have been\n                reached prior to and independently of enrolling the patient in the study.\n\n             -  Any treatment is to be prescribed according to the recommendations given in the\n                approved Canadian Product Monograph.\n\n        -  Study Sites\n\n           - Up to 30 sites planned in Canada: Patients will be recruited by community or hospital\n           based psychiatrists. A random representative sample of Canadian psychiatrists will be\n           identified as the sampled population of physicians that will be invited to participate\n           in the study and will undergo a feasibility assessment. Those that satisfy the\n           feasibility assessment, have adequate volume of patients and are willing to participate\n           in the study will be enrolled.\n\n        -  Data Collection and Handling\n\n           - All patient data will be collected by the site investigator or designated staff and\n           will be entered in an electronic data capture (EDC) system that will be developed for\n           the study. Patient questionnaires will be completed during the visit using paper-based\n           surveys. The questionnaire data will be transcribed into the study database by the CRO\n           personnel using a double data entry system. There will be no patient identifying\n           information recorded in any of the study data collection forms or databases. All\n           patients will be identified using encrypted random study ID numbers. Data monitoring\n           and source verification will be conducted on a sample of patients. Auditing of patient\n           qualification will also be conducted on a sample of patients within each site.\n\n        -  Missing data handling\n\n           - There will be no imputation for missing data. General linear models with repeated\n           measures and mixed effects will be used to compensate for unequal follow up intervals\n           and missing data points. All analyses will be conducted on observed cases.\n\n        -  Safety analyses - The safety population will comprise all patients included in the\n           study that have had at least one treatment with Abilify Maintena\u2122. Adverse events will\n           be described with the MedDRA dictionary of terms classified by preferred term and\n           system - organ class."
