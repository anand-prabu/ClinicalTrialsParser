Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of\n      cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Chemotherapy\n      also kills healthy infection-fighting cells, increasing the risk of infection. The infusion\n      of laboratory-grown cord blood cells may be able to replace blood-forming cells that were\n      destroyed by chemotherapy. This may decrease the risk of infection following chemotherapy,\n      and allow for more chemotherapy to be given so that more cancer cells are killed."
