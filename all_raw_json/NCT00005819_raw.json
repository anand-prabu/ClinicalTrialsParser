Patients receive paclitaxel IV\n      over 3 hours and cisplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 7. Courses repeat every 21 days in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of paclitaxel and cisplatin until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at\n      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is\n      determined, additional patients are accrued to receive paclitaxel and cisplatin at the\n      recommended phase II dose.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-24\n      months."
