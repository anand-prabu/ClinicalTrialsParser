Ectopic intracellular lipid\n           accumulation and impaired glycogen metabolism in skeletal muscle and liver and are\n           closely associated with metabolic impairment in insulin resistant subjects and patients\n           with diabetes mellitus. Recent evidence suggests that increased myocardial lipid\n           accumulation might contribute to the development of myocardial dysfunction by direct\n           toxic effects (lipotoxicity). However, the association between intracellular lipid\n           accumulation and (myocardial) functional impairment is likely more complex than\n           originally imagined. Recent studies suggest that not fat per se, but the content of\n           saturated or unsaturated fatty acids might predict the development of cardiac steatosis\n           and myocardial dysfunction.\n\n           In addition carbohydrates stored as glycogen in muscle cells serve as readily available\n           energy supply for contracting muscle. Skeletal muscle and hepatic glycogen metabolism\n           is impaired in patients with diabetes mellitus. Data from animal experiments suggest a\n           relevant role of myocardial glycogen stores in ischemic preconditioning. Due to\n           methodological limitations so far data on myocardial glycogen stores and myocardial\n           lipid composition in humans are missing.\n\n        2. Heterozygote inherited inactivating mutations in Calcium Sensing Receptor (CaSR)-gene\n           leads to familiar hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH), specified by mildly elevated\n           plasma Ca and parathyroid hormone concentrations, whereas urine Ca excretion is\n           inadequately low. However, in addition to the parathyroid gland CaSR is expressed in\n           various tissues including the endocrine pancreas and the heart. So far it is unknown\n           whether the endocrine function of the pancreas or myocardial morphology and/or function\n           is altered in patients with FHH.\n\n      Hypothesis:\n\n      In addition to total ectopic lipid deposition in the myocardium, myocardial lipid\n      composition, i.e. the relative abundance of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, and\n      impaired myocardial glycogen metabolism may play an important role in the development\n      cardiac lipotoxicity leading to diabetic cardiomyopathy.\n\n      Pancreatic endocrine function and myocardial morphology and function is altered in patients\n      with heterozygote inactivating mutations of the CaSR-gene / FHH.\n\n      Aims:\n\n        -  Metabolic virtual biopsy of the myocardium for identification of specific patterns of\n           intracellular lipid composition and myocardial glycogen metabolism as possible critical\n           determinants of metabolic cardiomyopathy\n\n        -  Characterization of the metabolic interplay between the myocardium, skeletal muscle,\n           liver and adipose tissues in different stages of development of type 2 diabetes\n           compared to patients with calcium sensing receptor mutation\n\n      Methods:\n\n        -  1H/13C  magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and imaging (MRI) for measurements of\n           myocardial, skeletal and liver lipid and glycogen content, abdominal adipose tissue\n           distribution and composition and myocardial functional parameters\n\n        -  Mixed meal tolerance tests to trace the postprandial partitioning of substrates between\n           insulin sensitive tissues (myocardium, skeletal muscle, liver, adipose tissue).\n\n        -  Hyperinsulinemic-hyperglycemic glucose clamp (HHC) with enrichment of the infused\n           glucose with the stable isotope [1-13C]glucose to trace the incorporation of\n           circulating glucose into myocardial glycogen\n\n      in healthy insulin sensitive volunteers, prediabetic insulin resistant volunteers with\n      impaired glucose tolerance, healthy subjects, patients suffering from type 2 diabetes\n      mellitus and patients with heterozygote mutation in calcium sensing receptor.\n\n      Relevance:\n\n      Despite intensive treatment of cardiovascular risk factors, heart diseases are still the\n      main cause of death in diabetic patients.

The volume of the interest (VOI; approx. 6 - 8 cm3) will be placed over the interventricular septum. . An additional spectrum without water suppression (NS= 2x 4) will be used as internal reference. The spectra will be processed offline using AMARES time domain line fitting as implemented jMRUI software package. The myocardial lipid content will be determined from processed spectra as a ratio of the intensities of CH2 (1.25 ppm) and CH3 (0.8-0.9 ppm) group resonances to the intensity of the water resonance from non-water suppressed spectra of the same VOI.",
