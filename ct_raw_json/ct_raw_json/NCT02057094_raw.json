            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the physiological consequences of extreme military\n      training and determine whether protein supplementation enhances recovery by promoting gains\n      in lean body mass.  This study will be conducted at the US Marine Survive, Evade, Resist,\n      Escape (SERE) school at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.\n\n      SERE school may be an ideal setting to assess nutritional interventions that promote\n      recovery from severe military operational stress, and identify innate or experiential\n      variables that may lead to increased levels of resilience in Warfighters.  Our laboratory\n      has recently demonstrated the detrimental effects and stressful nature of SERE.  Heart rates\n      and stress-related hormones increased dramatically, with concomitant reductions in\n      circulating anabolic hormones. Additionally, SERE causes significant weight loss (15-20\n      lbs), which probably included lean body mass.  The effects of severe operational stress\n      induced by SERE, particularly the loss of lean mass, may degrade physical performance,\n      increase injury risk, and compromise military readiness.  Under controlled laboratory\n      conditions, consuming high protein diets or supplemental high-quality protein promotes\n      muscle protein retention, enhances muscle protein synthesis, and protects lean body mass in\n      response to stress.  Whether consuming supplemental protein promotes lean mass recovery and\n      physiological resilience following a 'real-world' military stress has not been determined.\n      Further, the level of supplemental protein necessary to optimize recovery from extreme\n      military operational stress has not been elucidated.\n\n      Up to 90 US Marines will be enrolled in a 46-day double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.\n      Using complex body composition measurements, kinetic modeling of human metabolism, blood\n      sampling and cognitive and nutrition questionnaires, the consequences of SERE and the\n      efficacy of protein recovery nutrition on lean mass accretion and Warfighter resilience will\n      be assessed.\n\n      We hypothesize that consuming a specially formulated, high-quality supplemental protein\n      ration item will speed recovery of lean body mass, physiological, and psychological\n      resilience following extreme military operational stress."
