            "textblock": "Background: Gulf War Illness (GWI) results in tremendous impact to quality of life. Symptoms\n      of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and fatigue are the first (47%) and third (41%) most common\n      symptoms of patients with GWI, respectively. These symptoms are biologically characterized\n      by a milieu of elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines; to date, the profile of these\n      cytokines in serum and nasal secretions is incompletely understood and has not been assessed\n      in response to therapy. Nasal irrigation (NI) is a therapy which bathes the nasal cavity\n      with a solution (liquid). There are two promising forms of NI; saline NI (S-NI) is\n      hypothesized to improve sinus symptoms by thinning and clearing mucus and inflammatory\n      mediators, decreasing mucosal edema and improving ciliary function. Xylitol NI (X-NI) has\n      been shown to change the salinity of the mucosal surface resulting in enhanced antimicrobial\n      properties. Although NI is an evidence-based adjunctive therapy for CRS and has been\n      reported to be effective for CRS and fatigue, it has not been assessed in a GWI population.\n\n      Specific Aims, Hypotheses and Study Design: The specific aims of this proposal are to\n      determine whether routine care plus S-NI, or X-NI, compared to routine care alone, result in\n      improved health-related quality of life (HRQoL), are cost-effective and decrease\n      proinflammatory bias in subjects with GWI who suffer from CRS and fatigue.\n\n      Consistent with our specific aims, we will test the following hypotheses: In an RCT setting,\n      at 26 weeks post-enrollment, adults with GWI and symptoms of CRI and fatigue, treated with\n      routine care plus S-NI or X-NI, compared to those treated with routine care alone, will\n      demonstrate:\n\n      H1: improved HRQoL: a) sinus-disease specific HRQoL as evaluated by the validated\n      Sinonasal Outcomes Test (SNOT-20) questionnaire (primary outcome measure); b)\n      fatigue-specific HRQoL as assessed by the validated questionnaire, the Multidimensional\n      Fatigue Inventory (MFI); and c) overall HRQoL as assessed by the validated questionnaire the\n        Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form-36 (SF-36; mental and physical health domains)\n      augmented with 18 sleep- and breathing related questions.\n\n      H.2: greater cost-effectiveness as measured by the average cost of the intervention divided\n      by the average effectiveness (as assessed by a improvement in SNOT-20 scores), and reported\n      as the \"dollars spent per subject restored to health.\"\n\n      H.3: improved treatment satisfaction as assessed by a single-item treatment satisfaction\n      score and a qualitative exit interview.\n\n      H.4: improved proinflammatory bias: a) reduced activation and dysregulation of\n      proinflammatory pathways as determined by a reduction in URI-specific inflammatory cytokines\n      in serum and nasal secretions; and b) improved serum-based complete blood count,\n      sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein, or nasal swab-based neutrophil or eosinophil\n      counts.\n\n      Study Design: 26 week duration of follow-up, 3-arm RCT (N=75). All groups will utilize\n      routine care for their GWI and symptoms of CRS and fatigue. Groups 1 and 2 will in addition\n      add S-NI or X-NI twice daily to their routine care, respectively. Group 3 will continue to\n      use routine care with no other additions (control group); control group participants will be\n      offered NI training and related materials (xylitol or saline per subject preference) after\n      they complete their 26-week follow-up period.\n\n      Impact: Positive findings would suggest a number of important effects:\n\n        -  Statistically positive results on HRQoL outcome measures would suggest that NI can\n           provide effective adjunctive therapy for CRS and fatigue in adults with GWI, improving\n           health of affected patients and potentially providing gains to society through reduced\n           health care utilization and absenteeism related costs.\n\n        -  Positive biomarker findings would contribute to our better understanding of the\n           etiology of CRS and fatigue in the GWI population and of possible biological pathways\n           underlying the NI efficacy.\n\n        -  The finding that either form of NI is cost effective would provide economic\n           justification for its clinical use."
