  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to explore the safety and tolerability of BI 853520
      monotherapy and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for Japanese and Taiwanese
      patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumours.

      Secondary objective is collection of preliminary data on anti-tumour efficacy
