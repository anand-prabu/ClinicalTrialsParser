  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate an extended-release formulation of onapristone in female patients
      with progesterone receptor (PR) positive cancers such as endometrial, ovarian, breast cancer
      or uterine sarcoma, and permit comparison to an immediate-release tablet formulation of
      onapristone. Tumor blocks will be reviewed in order to determine the relationship of the
      activated form of the PR (APR) to preliminary anti-tumor  activity, with the eventual
      objective of developing a companion diagnostic, which could permit enrichment of the
      responder population in patients with PR-positive tumors. Patients will be treated until
      occurrence of an intolerable safety issue, treatment failure, if patient elects to withdraw,
      or for non-compliance with either protocol specified evaluations or onapristone treatment.
      An additional cohort of patients will be included at the recommended phase 2 dose to gain
      additional understanding of the onapristone safety profile and potential anti-tumor
      activity.
