        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must have a solid tumor type likely to over-express Epidermal Growth Factor
             Receptor (EGFR) (Phase 1)

          2. Subjects have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0-2

          3. Subjects have available tumor tissue

          4. Subjects have adequate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic function as follows: Bone
             marrow:  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;/= 1,500/mm3 Platelets &gt;/= 100,000/mm3;
             Hemoglobin &gt;/= 9.0 g/dL Renal function:  Serum creatinine &lt;/= 1.5 times the upper
             limit of the institution's normal range Hepatic function:  Bilirubin, aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;/= 1.5 times the upper
             limit of the institution's normal range.  Subjects with liver metastasis may have an
             AST and ALT of &lt;/= 5.0 x the upper limit of normal.

          5. Subjects in the Phase 2 portion must have squamous cell Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
             (NSCLC)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject has uncontrolled metastases to the central nervous system (CNS).
             Subjects with brain metastases are eligible provided they have shown clinical and
             radiographic stable disease for at least 28 days after definitive therapy and have
             not received prior whole brain radiation (Phase 1 only).

          2. The subject has received anticancer therapy including chemotherapy, immunotherapy,
             radiotherapy, hormonal, biologic, or any investigational therapy within a period of
             28 days prior to the first dose of ABT-414.

          3. The subject has unresolved clinically significant toxicities from prior anticancer
             therapy, defined as any Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade
             2 or higher.

          4. The subject had had major surgery within 28 days prior to the first dose of ABT-414.

          5. The subject has a history of immunologic reaction to any Immunoglobulin G (IgG)
             containing agent.

          6. Phase 2 portion only: The subject has previous or concurrent cancer that is distinct
             in primary site or histology from NSCLC, except cervical carcinoma in situ,
             non-melanoma carcinoma of the skin or in situ carcinoma of the bladder.  Any cancer
             curatively treated greater than 3 years prior to entry is permitted.
