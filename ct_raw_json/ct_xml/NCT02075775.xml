  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will be a multi-center, prospective longitudinal cohort for all patients
      undergoing primary shoulder instability surgery, excluding isolated SLAP repairs. We will be
      looking for risk factors for recurrent instability, revision surgery, and poor outcomes.
      Patients will be asked to complete the RAND-36, ASES, Shoulder Activity, EQ-5D and WOSI
      outcome measures, as well as demographic and socioeconomic information. Surgeons will
      complete a form after surgery with information on radiographic findings, physical exam,
      surgical findings, and the repair. The subject questionnaires will be completed over a
      series of timepoints and the subject's information from the subjects' electronic medical
      record will be abstracted for research data at various timepoints as well. Patients will
      wear a sling post-operatively, and follow standardized rehabilitation protocols, including
      physical therapy.

      Participants will complete the MOON Shoulder Instability patient form to document shoulder
      function and overall health status. The questionnaire will take 20-30 minutes to complete.
      The patient questionnaire will be completed once in the clinic before surgery and then will
      be mailed to them at 2 years, 6 years, 10 years and 20 years after surgery. An additional
      pre-surgical questionnaire will be completed on-line and will become part of the
      participant's UIHC electronic medical record. This is the standard of care for all shoulder
      instability patients in the Sports Medicine Clinic, regardless of study participation.
      Reviewing the noted pre-surgical questionnaire will be a review of data collected as part of
      clinical activity and is not considered a research-initiated data collection. Study-specific
      information, such as follow-up contact information, will be collected at this time. The
      follow-up questionnaires will be mailed to participants with a postage-paid return envelope
      by the coordinating center at University of Iowa. The coordinating center will also call
      participants prior to mailing follow-up questionnaires to confirm that the mailing
      information is correct and to ascertain whether the participant has had any subsequent
      shoulder surgery. At the two, six, ten, and twenty year time-points the participant's local
      medical record will be queried to identify any subsequent shoulder surgery occurring at the
      University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics. Physicians will complete an initial evaluation form
      detailing range of motion and radiologic imaging information when the patient is indicated
      for surgery. They will complete an in depth evaluation form detailing specific pathologies
      of the shoulder and any operative findings at the time of surgery. Finally at the 4-6 month
      time point following surgery the physician will complete a clinical follow up form on range
      of motion and shoulder function.

      Additionally, for recruitment purposes, we will need to obtain potential subjects'
      demographic data, as well as any information related to the diagnosis and treatment of their
      shoulder instability, from their medical record. This information will be obtained from
      potential subjects' medical records prior to consent has been given. We will review
      subjects' medical record at each of the follow-up timepoints (4-6 months, and 2, 6, 10, and
      20 years) for updated demographic information, as well as information related specifically
      to their diagnosis of shoulder instability. This may include information about the initial
      surgery, as well as subsequent shoulder surgeries, complications, additional treatment and
      physical therapy notes, x-rays or other images, and outcome measures for pain and
      functionality.
