  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      You are invited to participate in a research study at the VA Connecticut Healthcare System
      (West Haven campus) that examines whether a medication called galantamine can improve your
      learning and memory, and also help you to quit smoking. You have been invited to participate
      because you currently smoke cigarettes, and want to quit smoking. If you are eligible and
      agree to be in the study, your participation will last for approximately 8 weeks. To
      determine if galantamine (8 or 16 mg) is superior to placebo a) in reducing smoking
      self-administration in a human laboratory model and b) improving abstinence rates at the end
      of 4 weeks of treatment.

      We propose a double-blind, placebo-controlled, outpatient study with a between-groups
      design. Seventy-two male and female smokers will be randomly assigned to one of the 3
      treatment conditions: GAL (8 or 16 mg/day) or placebo. The dose of GAL will be gradually
      increased to the target doses over a 2-week period (Table 2). During Week 3, following
      overnight abstinence from smoking, participants will present for a laboratory Test Session
      in which they will have the option of cigarette self-administration. After this Test Session
      is completed, smokers will be maintained on their randomized medication condition for an
      additional 4-week period. Smokers will establish a quit date at the beginning of this
      Treatment Phase, and will receive brief weekly behavioral treatment for the 4 weeks of this
      phase. Additionally, at the beginning of Week 3, participants will be given a PDA that will
      administer EMA assessments. The study medication will be tapered after the end of Week 4 of
      the Treatment Phase. Participants will be contacted by phone at one week, and one month,
      after treatment termination to inquire about any adverse events and about their recent
      smoking status.
