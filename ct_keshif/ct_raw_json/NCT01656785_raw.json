            "textblock": "Integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 is an important member of this receptor family and expressed preferentially on\n      regenerative vascular endothelial cells, but not or very low on the quiescent vessel cells\n      and other normal cells. The \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin is a key mediator of angiogenesis and thus may be\n      an important diagnostic and therapeutic target associated with cerebrovascular repair\n      processes after stroke.\n\n      The tri-peptide sequence of arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) can specifically bind to\n      the integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 receptor. Accordingly, a variety of radiolabeled RGD-based peptides have\n      been developed for non-invasive imaging of integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 expression via positron emission\n      tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to monitor the\n      angiogenesis in clinical Oncology and Cardiology. In Neurology, angiogenesis imaging based\n      on integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 receptor has not been found in clinical trials, but preclinical animal\n      studies showed it had great potential for clinical translation. Recently, series of RGD\n      dimeric peptides with PEG linkers have been studied. The new types of RGD peptides showed\n      much higher in vitro integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 binding affinity than the single RGD tri-peptide\n      sequence. As a representative, 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 could be easily prepared and exhibited\n      excellent in vivo behavior in animal models and also tumor or myocardial infarction\n      patients. No adverse reactions are observed in animal models or patients to date.\n\n      For the further interests in clinical translation of 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2, an open-label brain\n      PET/CT study was designed to investigate diagnostic performance of 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 in\n      stroke patients in convalescence. A single dose of nearly 111 MBq 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 ( \u2264 40 \u00b5g\n      BNOTA-PRGD2) will be intravenously injected into the patients. Visual and semiquantitative\n      method will be used to assess the PET/CT images. Changes of brain 18F-FDG PET/CT, enhanced\n      brain MRI or CT, and any adverse events will be collected from the patients."
