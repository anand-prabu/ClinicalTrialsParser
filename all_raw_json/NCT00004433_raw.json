Evaluate the presumed mechanism of action of low dose pergolide to act acutely through\n      the dopaminergic autoreceptor or postsynaptically at D2 sites in children 7 to 17 with\n      tourette syndrome (GTS).\n\n      II.  Compare tolerability and safety of pergolide in these patients to standard neuroleptic\n      therapy via naturalist assessment after 3-6 months of treatment using matched historical\n      controls on neuroleptics.\n\n      III.  Determine efficacy of pergolide for tic control in these patients."

Part II patients are randomized to receive either low or high dose\n      pergolide for 4 weeks.\n\n      Part III patients are randomized to first receive either pergolide or placebo by oral fixed\n      doses twice daily followed by flexible clinically adjusted dosing for the next 3 weeks after\n      a 2-week placebo run-in.  Patients then cross over to receive the other treatment after\n      another 2 weeks of placebo run-in.  Total treatment duration is 16 weeks.\n\n      Patients are followed at 6 months."
