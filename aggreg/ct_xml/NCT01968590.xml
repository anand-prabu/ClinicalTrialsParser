  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is conducted by one of 4 locations; University of British Columbia
      (Vancouver, CA), University of Utah (Salt Lake City, UT, USA), University of Cincinnati
      (Cincinnati, OH, USA), and University of Hamburg (Hamburg, Germany).

      Adults with NF1 have a higher risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis, a condition of low bone
      density that can lead to fragile bones and bone breakage.

      People with NF1 also have lower vitamin D levels than unaffected individuals.  Vitamin D is
      important for normal bone health, but studies to improve bone health by vitamin D
      supplementation in people with NF1 have not been tried.

      The purpose of this study is to treat adults with NF1 who have insufficient serum vitamin D
      levels with 2 different doses of vitamin D supplementation to determine if vitamin D
      supplementation ameliorates the usual loss of bone mineral density over 2 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with NF1 and vitamin D insufficiency will be supplemented with 2 different doses
      of cholecalciferol (vitamin D) to see if their loss of bone mineral density is lessened over
      time. It is important to study vitamins as carefully as one would study medications, even
      though vitamins are generally safer than medications. For this reason, a carefully
      controlled trial of two doses of vitamin D will be performed over a 2-year period. It will
      include controlled doses and safety checks for participants' health to be sure that the
      vitamin D supplementation is safe for people with NF1.

      Two different doses of cholecalciferol, either 600 IU or 4,000 IU (IU means &quot;International
      Units&quot; a standard measure of the strength of the dose), will be used for supplementation.
      The trial is &quot;double blind&quot;.  This means that neither participant nor investigator team know
      which dose an individual participant might be randomized to receive until after the trial
      ends. In an emergency, however, the investigator can find out.

      Participants will be randomized to one or the other dose, and each participant will be
      provided a bottle of liquid called &quot;D-drops&quot; with a dropper that automatically drops out a
      measured amount when the bottle is turned upside down.  Each bottle lasts 6 months and will
      be resupplied at the mid-year evaluation.

      Both doses of vitamin D, 600 IU and 4,000 IU, have been approved in the general population;
      however, it is possible that the bodies of people with NF1 handle vitamin D differently.
      Therefore, safety measures are assessed during this trial. Any new medical issues or
      concerns throughout the 2-year period will need to be recorded and assessed with the study
      team.

      The primary measure of this study is bone mineral density obtained by bone densitometry
      (DXA) using low-dose xrays. Bone mineral density will be tested at the beginning and the end
      of the trial focusing on density of bones in the hip and spine. Secondary measures of this
      trial include questionnaires that measure diet, activity level, quality of life, and history
      of bone fractures.

      When someone is insufficient in serum vitamin D and supplementation is recommended, it is
      also supplemented with calcium. Therefore, participants will be given a calcium supplement
      of 400 mg elemental calcium per day. A diary to keep daily track of vitamin D and calcium
      supplementation and documentation of fractures, should they occur, is provided.
