This tracer is given using a special pump called an 'elution system'\n      which is considered investigational.  This means the device is not yet approved by Health\n      Canada for general use, but it has been approved for use in this study. It has been used\n      routinely in this hospital since 2010.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to confirm proper operation of the pump. It may also help\n      identify areas for future improvement. The study data may be used for safety reporting to\n      the Ministry of Health or to Health Canada. The study will enroll 2,400 patients in 6\n      hospitals across Canada. The University of Ottawa Heart Institute (UOHI) will enroll up to\n      1,200 patients."

The V3 elution system is more highly automated, therefore\n      requiring fewer manual performance checks.\n\n      Hypotheses:\n\n        1. Performance: system operation using constant-activity infusion is adequate to achieve:\n\n             1. elution activity (82Rb) bias < 5% (V2 and V3)\n\n             2. elution activity (82Rb) imprecision < 5% (V2 and V3)\n\n             3. elution time interval (30 s) bias < 5% (V2 only)\n\n             4. elution success-rate reliability > 98% (failure-rate < 2%) (V2 and V3)\n\n        2. Daily Quality Assurance: testing procedures are adequate to document:\n\n             1. Automated generator yield (82Rb) imprecision < 10% (V2 only)\n\n             2. Automated generator breakthrough (82Sr, 85Sr) imprecision < 10% (V2 and V3)\n\n             3. Manual generator yield (82Rb) imprecision < 10% (V2 only)\n\n             4. Manual generator breakthrough (82Sr, 85Sr) imprecision < 10% (V2 only)\n\n        3. Monthly Quality Assurance: testing procedures are adequate to document:\n\n             1. Dose calibrator non-linearity < 1%  (V2 and V3)\n\n             2. Dose calibrator constancy > 99% (instability < 1%) (V2 only)\n\n             3. Dose calibrator bias < 10%  (V2 only)\n\n             4. Peristaltic pump calibration bias < 10% (V2 only) 2.2 Secondary Objectives: To\n                evaluate the user documentation and training reliability for:\n\n        4. Installation of the Ruby-Fill generator and Ruby-Set tubing  (V2 and V3)\n\n        5. Trouble-shooting and repair of system errors (e.g. high-pressure)  (V2 and V3) 2.3\n           Tertiary Objective: To evaluate patient demographics or health status effects on system\n           performance"
