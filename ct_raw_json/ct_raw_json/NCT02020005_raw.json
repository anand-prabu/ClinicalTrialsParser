The six nicotine replacement products being tested are non-flavored 2mg nicotine gum, non-flavored 4mg nicotine gum, mint-flavored 2mg nicotine gum, mint-flavored 4mg nicotine gum, non-flavored nicotine inhaler and mint-flavored inhaler. The order in which the subjects test these products will be randomized and subjects will be blinded to the nicotine content of the product but will be instructed about the flavor of the product."

At the end of the 2 weeks of sampling, subjects will select a\n      product to use during the following 2-week smoking cessation phase.  This 2-week abstinence\n      phase is followed by one week of abrupt withdrawal of the product.  This study design was\n      successfully used in a study we conducted that examined the smokers' preference for a\n      variety or oral tobacco products."
