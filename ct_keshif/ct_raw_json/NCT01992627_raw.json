Parameters to\n      be evaluated are tenderness, pain upon active resistive motion and DASH scores. After every\n      treatment session of HILTERAPIA HIRO 3.O, these said parameters will be recorded initially\n      on the first treatment, one week after the initial treatment, two weeks after the initial\n      treatment and four weeks after the initial treatment. Patient is advised to follow-up on the\n      6th and 12 month post initial HILTERAPIA HIRO 3.O treatment for the reevaluation of the\n      parameters. Tenderness is described as pain upon palpation and is further categorized into,\n      0= no tenderness, 1 = mild tenderness, 2 = tenderness evident on facial expression and 3 =\n      patient screams upon palpation. Pain is also noted upon active resistive motion of\n      extension/flexion, supination/pronation. Classification includes; 0 = no pain and 1 = mild\n      pain with full power, 2 = severe pain with full power, and 3 = muscle weakness with pain.\n      And for functional scoring will be using the DASH which is a multidimensional disease\n      specific, brief, self-administered measure of symptoms and functional status among subjects\n      with upper limb disorders. The DASH consists of a 30-item questionnaire with 5 response\n      options for each item with a scale ranging from 0, which indicates \"least disability,\" to\n      100, which indicates \"most disability.\" A change in 12.7 DASH score points is considered to\n      represent clinically significant functional improvement."
