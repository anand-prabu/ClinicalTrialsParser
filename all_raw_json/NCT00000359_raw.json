These procedures involve exercises and head manipulations. Vertigo\n      intensity and frequency, the presence/absence of slow-phase eye movements, the degree of\n      dizziness handicap and acts of daily living (ADL) were assessed. The study also ascertained\n      the effects of co-morbid conditions on the response to treatment. While BPPV  is a common\n      and significant public health problem that has been recognized for several decades, this is\n      the first systematic study of the relative treatment efficacy of different physical\n      treatment modalities for this disorder."
