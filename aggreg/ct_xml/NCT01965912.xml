        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female outpatients, 4 to 5 years of age (greater than or equal to 4 and less
             than 6) at the time of informed consent form signature by parent(s) or guardian(s)

          -  Confirmed clinical and biochemical diagnosis of PKU, including at least two separate
             blood phenylalanine levels greater than or equal to 400 micromole per liter (mcmol/L)

          -  Defined pre-Kuvan®/-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) dietary phenylalanine tolerance
             consistent with the diagnosis of PKU

          -  Responsive to Kuvan®/BH4:

               -  For subjects currently treated with Kuvan®/BH4 at Screening: subject is a
                  responder as per Investigator judgment based on documented effect of Kuvan®/BH4
                  on phenylalanine levels and/or phenylalanine tolerance

               -  For subjects not treated with Kuvan®/BH4 at Screening: a response test has been
                  performed during Screening or is available from the subject's medical records
                  and satisfies the 3 following criteria: a decrease in blood phenylalanine levels
                  of at least 30 percent was observed after at least 24 hours with a dose of at
                  least 10 mg/kg/day

          -  Intelligence Quotient (IQ) greater than or equal to 70, as assessed with the Wechsler
             Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI)-III, 2nd part

          -  Good adherence with dietary treatment (including prescribed dietary phenylalanine
             restriction and prescribed amounts of phenylalanine-free protein supplements and
             low-phenylalanine foods), as assessed by the Investigator

          -  Well-controlled phenylalanine levels, as assessed by a minimum of 75 percent of
             phenylalanine levels within the target recommended in each centre during the previous
             3 months

          -  Low phenylalanine diet started within the first 3 weeks of life

          -  Parent(s) or guardian(s) willing to comply with all study procedures, maintain strict
             adherence with the diet, and willing and able to provide written, signed informed
             consent before any trial-related activities are carried out, as well as ability of
             child to comply with trial procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known hypersensitivity to Kuvan® or its excipients

          -  Known hypersensitivity to other approved or non-approved formulations of BH4

          -  Previous diagnosis of BH4 deficiency

          -  Current use of methotrexate, trimethoprim or other dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors

          -  Current use of medications that are known to affect nitric oxide synthesis,
             metabolism or action

          -  Current use of experimental or unregistered drugs (other than sapropterin/BH4) that
             may affect the study outcomes or use of such agents within 30 days prior to Screening

          -  Concurrent use of levodopa

          -  Concurrent disease or condition that would induce repeatedly catabolic situations, or
             interfere with the trial participation, diet, or NC development, as assessed by the
             Investigator

          -  Any condition that, in the view of the Investigator, renders the subject at high risk
             for failure to comply with treatment or to complete the trial

          -  Participation in a clinical trial investigating any other agent than Kuvan® within
             the past 30 days
