It is conceptually rooted in an interpersonal model of depression that focuses on how stress in interpersonal relationships is often related to the onset or maintenance of depressive symptoms.  In keeping with adult and adolescent models of IPT, FB-IPT focuses on improving the interpersonal functioning of individuals as a means to improve their depressive symptoms.  FB-IPT addresses two domains of interpersonal impairment in depressed preadolescents, parent-child conflict and interpersonal avoidance, and focuses on family relationships, the primary context for children's social and emotional development."

CCT is a manualized treatment for children between the ages of 8-14 based on a Rogerian counseling model.  In that model, changes in children's mood and behavior are initiated through their experience of a therapeutic relationship marked by unconditional positive regard, empathic understanding, and therapeutic genuineness."

Forty-five\n      preadolescent children (ages 8-12) diagnosed with a depressive disorder will be randomized\n      to receive a 14-week course of FB-IPT or Client Centered Therapy (CCT), a supportive\n      nondirective psychotherapy that closely approximates treatment at usual in community mental\n      health clinics. In addition to assessing the feasibility and acceptability of randomization\n      and each of the treatment conditions, this project will evaluate the effects of FB-IPT and\n      CCT across multiple domains, including symptomatology and psychosocial functioning.\n      Preadolescents will be assessed prior to treatment, during treatment (Weeks 3, 7, 11), one\n      week post-treatment, and at 3 and 6 months post-treatment to compare changes in depressive\n      symptoms, global, social, and family functioning. Data on psychosocial risk factors\n      associated with onset and recurrence of preadolescent depression will be collected prior to\n      treatment and at specified intervals post-treatment in order to conduct exploratory analyses\n      on correlates of positive and negative treatment outcomes for Family Based IPT. This data\n      will be used to generate future hypotheses about potential mediators and moderators that\n      will be incorporated into an R01 application for an efficacy study of Family Based IPT."
