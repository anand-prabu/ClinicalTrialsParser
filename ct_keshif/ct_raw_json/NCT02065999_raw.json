To correlate the presence and frequency of baseline resistance-associated variants with\n           the response to therapy with DAA-based triple therapy regimens for HCV.\n\n        4. To identify predictors of emergent DAA resistance and treatment failure during therapy\n           with DAA-based combination strategies, including virological, clinical and\n           immunological factors.\n\n        5. To characterize the natural history of HCV resistance associated variants that are\n           selected during antiviral therapy after the withdrawal of treatment.\n\n        6. To establish a cohort of DAA-treatment failure patients suitable for re-treatment\n           studies.\n\n        7. To establish a tissue repository of serum and PBMCs from well-characterized patients\n           treated with DAA-based triple therapy to allow future examination of the role of  other\n           variables that may potentially impact on the outcomes of DAA based therapy and\n           development of RAVs."
