    <textblock>
      Multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group exploratory study to explore the effects
      of azilsartan (Azirva), compared with telmisartan, on insulin resistance in patients with
      essential hypertension complicated by type 2 diabetes mellitus
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the present study is to explore the effects of azilsartan 20 mg,
      compared with telmisartan 40 mg, once daily orally for 12 weeks on insulin resistance in
      patients with essential hypertension complicated by type 2 diabetes mellitus.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The participant was given the diagnosis of grade I or II essential hypertension and
             was judged by the principal investigator or investigator that they can be
             appropriately treated with azilsartan 20 mg and telmisartan 40 mg.

          2. Sitting systolic blood pressure of ≥ 130 mmHg and &lt; 180 mmHg or sitting diastolic
             blood pressure of ≥ 80 mmHg and &lt; 110 mmHg at the start of the treatment period (Week
             0) Sitting blood pressure will be measured until 2 consecutive stable measurements
             are obtained (i.e., the difference between 2 measurements: diastolic blood pressure
             of &lt;5 mmHg and systolic blood pressure of &lt; 10 mmHg) after resting in a sitting
             position for at least 5 minutes. The average value of the last 2 measurements will be
             recorded (the first the decimal place is rounded off).

          3. Type 2 diabetes mellitus

          4. HbA1c (NGSP (National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program) value) of &lt; 8.4%

             nadir) during 3 months before informed consent

          5. No change in diet/exercise therapy during the 3 months before the informed consent in

             hypertension.

          2. Grade II essential hypertension (i.e., sitting systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mmHg or
