By identifying genes that increase or decrease the risk\n      of OCD, researchers can better understand how the condition develops and ultimately improve\n      treatment for people with OCD.\n\n      OCD is a severe, familial condition that affects approximately 2% of the population. The way\n      OCD is inherited is not clearly understood, but researchers believe it is complex and\n      involves multiple genes. This study will detect and localize genes that increase or decrease\n      susceptibility to OCD. The data collected from this study will be combined with data from\n      other research studies to determine gene linkage and association."

The mode of inheritance is poorly\n      understood but is likely complex, involving multiple loci of small to major effect.  Since\n      1995, the NIMH-IRP has been active in a multi-center family study of OCD, led by Dr. Gerald\n      Nestadt of Johns Hopkins University, which was approved via a competitive NIMH extramural\n      application (MH 502140).  An expanded consortium of sites (including new sites at Brown and\n      Harvard Universities) anticipates adding 300 new affected sib-pair families over the next\n      three years.  This sample will be used for linkage and association analyses.  Data will be\n      shared within this consortium of investigators studying OCD, and will eventually be combined\n      with data obtained from a second consortium."
