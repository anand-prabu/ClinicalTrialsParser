Participants will be asked to attend four morning study\n      visits after overnight smoking abstinence. Standardized questionnaires will be used to\n      assess changes under each condition, allowing for the investigation of the efficacy of\n      e-Cigarettes in reducing craving by replacing the behavioral component of smoking with\n      minimal risk of adverse effects."

            "textblock": "Many addiction models postulate stimuli to be linked with nicotine intake and reward after\n      prolonged use. As such, smoking becomes more heavily based in habit, initiated by cues.\n      Craving has been found to be a crucial component of continued smoking and relapse in\n      response to various environmental and behavioral cues. Electronic Cigarettes (e-Cigarettes)\n      are new smoking products emerging in consumer markets that often mimic conventional tobacco\n      cigarettes. E-Cigarettes commonly include a cartridge, a heating element, a puff sensor, and\n      a battery. When a user draws on the device, the heating element is activated and the\n      cartridge fluid is vaporized. Users then inhale the aerosol containing droplets of the\n      vaporized fluid. This study will empirically assess the efficacy of e-Cigarettes in\n      alleviating craving by replacing the behavioral component of smoking. Using standardized\n      questionnaires, intra-subject changes in cue- and withdrawal-induced craving after smoking\n      an e-Cigarette without nicotine will be compared with that after either smoking a\n      conventional cigarette, an e-Cigarette with nicotine, or taking a 4mg lozenge."
