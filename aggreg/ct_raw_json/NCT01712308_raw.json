The injections will be given in the upper arm, abdomen, or thigh.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      On Day 1 of every cycle:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs\n           (blood pressure, breathing rate, temperature, and heart rate).\n\n        -  Your spleen and/or liver will be measured by feeling your abdomen.\n\n        -  You will be asked about any drugs you are taking and about recent blood transfusions\n           you may have had.\n\n        -  You will also be asked about any new side effects or medical conditions you may have\n           experienced.\n\n        -  Your performance status will be recorded.\n\n        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests\n\n        -  Urine will be collected for kidney function tests.\n\n      Weekly during Cycle 1-5 only:\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n        -  You will have vital signs measured on Day 1 of Week 3 (around Day 15 of Cycle 1).\n\n      On Day 1 of Cycle 6, and then every 6-12 cycles after that if the disease responds to\n      treatment, a bone marrow biopsy will be performed to check the status of the disease.\n\n      On Day 1 of Cycles 1-5, 7, 9, and 11, then every 6 cycles after that:\n\n      -Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for antibody testing and pharmacokinetic (PK)\n      testing.  Antibodies are created by the immune system and may attack foreign cells or\n      substances, such as the study drug.  PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the\n      body at different time points.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best\n      interest.  You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if\n      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.\n\n      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.\n\n      End-of-Treatment Visit:\n\n      After your last dose of study drug, you will have an end-of-study visit and the following\n      tests and procedures will be performed:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs\n           (blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, and temperature) and  your spleen and/or\n           liver will be measured by feeling your abdomen.\n\n        -  Your performance status will be recorded.\n\n        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests.\n\n        -  You will be asked about any drugs you are taking and about recent blood transfusions\n           you may have had.\n\n        -  You will also be asked about any new side effects or medical conditions you may have\n           experienced.\n\n      Follow-up Visit:\n\n      About 1 month after your last dose of study drug, you will receive a telephone call from\n      someone on the study team.  You will be asked about any drugs you are taking, any recent\n      blood transfusions you may have had, any new side effects or medical conditions you may have\n      experienced.  This phone call should last about 10 minutes.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Sotatercept is not FDA approved or commercially\n      available.  It is currently being used for research purposes only.\n\n      Up to 50 patients will take part in this study.  All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."
