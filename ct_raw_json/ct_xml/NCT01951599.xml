        Inclusion Criteria:

        1, Body mass index between 19 and 30 kg/m2 and weight at least 50 kg and no more than 100
        kg. 2, Volunteers must be willing to use a condom, unless their partners are
        postmenopausal, surgically sterile, or using an effective hormonal method of contraception
        or intrauterine coil. 3. In addition, volunteers must agree to continue to take similar
        contraceptive precautions until 4 months after the last dose of AZD9291.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any clinically relevant abnormalities in physical examination, vital signs,
             hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis  or ECG at baseline in the opinion of the
             Investigator.

          2. Volunteers who have received live or live-attenuated vaccine in the 2 weeks prior to
             dosing.

          3. History of severe allergy/hypersensitivity or or ongoing allergy/hypersensitivity, as
             judged by the Investigator, or history of hypersensitivity to AZD9291, its
             excipients, or drugs with a similar chemical structure or class.
