            "textblock": "Tracheal intubation (placement of a breathing tube below the vocal cords into the trachea)\n      is an essential skill for the anesthesia provider. Training on the use of new technology\n      (i.e., procedural training), including video/optical laryngoscopy (e.g., the Airtraq Avant,\n      Glidescope, and similar devices) usually occurs under the tutelage of learned practitioners,\n      while caring for actual patients in the operating room, not during didactic sessions in a\n      classroom. Although the use of airway trainers (manikins) has led to improved clinical\n      learning curves for the use of some airway devices, it is not known if training on the use\n      of the Airtraq Avant and Wireless Monitor System under simulated difficult airway conditions\n      (c-collar and swollen tongue) will improve the learning curve of using the device/system\n      clinically in in patients with at least one predictor of difficult intubation.\n\n      The specific aim of this study is to compare the clinical learning curve, characterized by\n      procedure times and first attempt success rates on successive uses, of using the Airtraq\n      Avant and Wireless Monitor System in patients with at least one predictor for diffcult\n      intubation between anesthesia providers who receive preclinical airway manikin training\n      under simulated difficult airway conditions (c-collar and swollen tongue) and those who do\n      not.  The subjects of this study are anesthesia providers enrolled in the study.\n\n      Secondary specific aims include assessing the impact of preclinical airway manikin training\n      under simulated difficult airway conditions on glottic view grade, glottic view attainment\n      maneuvers, ease of Airtraq Avant insertion, ease of tracheal tube insertion, mechanisms of\n      tracheal tube insertion impediment, and perceived overall clinical usefulness in airways\n      with predictors of difficult intubation."
