Combining chemotherapy with bone marrow transplantation may\n      allow doctors to give higher doses of chemotherapy and kill more cancer cells. It is not yet\n      known whether chemotherapy is more effective with or without bone marrow transplantation for\n      acute myeloid leukemia.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of chemotherapy with or\n      without bone marrow transplantation in treating children who have acute myeloid leukemia."

Patients are first randomized to one of two induction\n      treatment arms.\n\n        -  Induction Arm I: Patients receive 2 courses of cytarabine IV push every 12 hours on\n           days 1-10 or 1-8 (20 or 16 doses); daunorubicin IV over 6 hours on days 1, 3, and 5;\n           and etoposide IV over 4 hours on days 1-5 (5 doses).\n\n        -  Induction Arm II: Patients receive 2 courses of mitoxantrone IV over 6 hours on days 1,\n           3, and 5; cytarabine IV push every 12 hours on days 1-10 or 1-8 (20 or 16 doses); and\n           etoposide IV over 4 hours on days 1-5 (5 doses).\n\n      Patients with no CNS disease at diagnosis receive 3 courses of triple intrathecal therapy\n      (methotrexate, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone), one after each of the first 3 courses of\n      chemotherapy. Patients with CNS disease receive at least 6 courses of intrathecal therapy (2\n      courses per week), then monthly courses until the final course of chemotherapy is complete.\n\n      Patients in complete response after induction course 2 continue on this study. Patients not\n      in complete response after induction course 2 are taken off study and are eligible for the\n      current Medical Research Council (MRC) refractory/relapse study or another therapy.\n\n      Course 3: All patients continuing on this study receive amsacrine IV over 1 hour daily on\n      days 1-5, cytarabine continuous IV infusion daily on days 1-5, and etoposide IV over 4 hours\n      on days 1-5 as course 3. After course 3, patients are assigned to two risk groups: good risk\n      patients, and standard and poor risk patients.\n\n      Standard and poor risk patients with no matched sibling donor and good risk patients are\n      then further randomized to consolidation in arms I or II.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive mitoxantrone IV over 6 hours on days 1-5 and cytarabine IV over\n           2 hours every 12 hours on days 1-3 (4 courses of chemotherapy total).\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours on days 1, 2, 8, and\n           9, and asparaginase subcutaneous infusion 3 hours after completion of the last\n           cytarabine doses on days 2 and 9, followed by a course of mitoxantrone and cytarabine\n           as in arm I (5 courses of chemotherapy total).\n\n      Standard and poor risk children with matched sibling donor are randomized to arms III or IV.\n\n        -  Arm III: Patients receive no consolidation treatment (3 courses of chemotherapy total)\n           plus bone marrow transplantation.\n\n        -  Arm IV: Patients receive cytarabine and asparaginase as in arm II (4 courses of\n           chemotherapy total) plus bone marrow transplantation.\n\n      Patients are followed for at least 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 2,000 patients will be accrued into this study over 5\n      years."
