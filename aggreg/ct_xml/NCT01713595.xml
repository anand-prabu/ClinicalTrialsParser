  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if an inhaled hypertonic saline solution has any effect on lung function in
      patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertonic Saline (HS) aerosols have proven efficacious mucolytics in patient with cystic
      fibrosis and are well tolerated in that population. Safety concerns in mechanically
      ventilated patients with ARDS center primarily on HS's effects on lung water distribution
      (intra vs. extra alveolar) and on airway reactivity. For that reason we plan a small
      feasibility trial with narrowly focused physiologic endpoints, namely to measure the effects
      of a single 5ml dose of 7% Saline aerosol on blood gas tensions, hemodynamics and the static
      and dynamic properties of the relaxed respiratory system. This narrowly scoped study is to
      lay the foundation for a larger multicenter intervention trial.
