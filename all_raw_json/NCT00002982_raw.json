Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow doctors to give\n      higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy together\n      with peripheral stem cell transplantation works in treating older patients with refractory\n      or relapsed intermediate-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."

Each cycle is given at least 14 days apart. Patients receive etoposide IV\n      on days 1 through 3. Carboplatin and ifosfamide with mercaptoethane sulfonate is given IV\n      over 24 hours on day 2.\n\n      During cycles 1 and 2, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) SC every 6 hours beginning on day\n      1 and continuing until the desired absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is attained.\n\n      Patients receive at least 24 hours of rest before PBPC infusion on day 0.\n\n      Following cycle 3, G-CSF is given SC beginning on day 6 and continuing until completion of\n      PBPC collection. However, bone marrow will be harvested if an insufficient number of stem\n      cells are collected after 5 leukaphereses.\n\n      Patients with residual disease limited to 2 sites receive radiation therapy twice a day\n      within 2 weeks prior to high dose BEAM chemotherapy with carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine,\n      and melphalan.\n\n      Patients receive carmustine IV on day -7. Etoposide and cytarabine are given IV every 12\n      hours on days -6 through -3. Melphalan is given IV on day -2.\n\n      G-CSF is administered every 12 hours beginning on day 1 and continuing until the desired ANC\n      is attained. If ANC is attenuated on day 21, patients undergo a repeat bone marrow biopsy\n      and receive filgrastim SC.\n\n      Patients are followed for 2 years posttransplant, then for 3 to 5 years at 4 month intervals\n      and every 6 months following the fifth posttransplant.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 30 patients for the duration of 2 years."
