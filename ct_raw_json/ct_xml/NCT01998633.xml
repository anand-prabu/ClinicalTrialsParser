  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HLH, HLH-related disorders, Chronic Granulomatous (CGD), HIGM1, Immune dysregulation,
      polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, and X-linked inheritance (IPEX) and severe LAD-I represent
      primary immune disorders that are typically fatal without Hematopoietic Cell Transplant
      (HCT).  However, transplant is often complicated by inflammation, infection and other
      co-morbidities.  In addition, these disorders have been shown to be cured with partial
      chimerism, making them an ideal target for the use of reduced intensity approaches, where a
      portion of patients may not achieve full donor chimerism, but instead achieve stable mixed
      chimerism.  Reduced-intensity conditioning strategies have demonstrated improved survival
      with decreased Treatment Related Mortality (TRM) in institutional series for patients with
      HLH (Cooper et al., 2006; Marsh et al., 2010; Marsh et al., 2011).  However, graft loss and
      unstable chimerism remain challenges.  An institutional case series from Cincinnati
      Children's Hospital demonstrated full or high-level chimerism and improved durable
      engraftment using intermediate (Day -14) timing alemtuzumab (Marsh et al., 2013b).  This
      study aims to test the efficacy of the Intermediate RIC strategy in a prospective
      multi-center study including HLH as well as other primary immunodeficiencies where
      allogeneic transplant with RIC has been shown to be feasible and stable chimerism is
      curative.

      The primary goal of this Phase II clinical trial is to determine the one-year overall
      survival of patients treated for immune deficiencies including HLH, HLH-like disorders, CGD,
      HIGM1, IPEX syndrome, and severe LAD-I with Matched Related Donor (MRD)/MUD bone marrow
      transplant using a reduced-intensity conditioning strategy including intermediate-timing of
      alemtuzumab.  The donor choice is an unaffected related bone marrow donor who is a 6/6 match
      at HLA-A, -B (intermediate or higher resolution) and -DRB1 (at high resolution using
      DNA-based typing) OR a 7/8 or 8/8 match for HLA-A, -B, -C and -DRB1 (at high resolution
      using DNA-based typing), OR an unrelated bone marrow donor who is a 7/8 or 8/8 match at
      HLA-A, -B, -C and -DRB1 (at high resolution using DNA-based typing).  The transplant
      conditioning regimen will include fludarabine, melphalan, and alemtuzumab starting at Day
      -14 (Flu/Mel/Alem).  Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) prophylaxis will consist of
      cyclosporine and corticosteroids through engraftment.  Post-transplant supportive care will
      include infection surveillance and prophylaxis, and disease-specific supportive care.

    <description>Systemic HLH Reactivation: Post-transplant HLH reactivation is defined by clinical and lab evidence of pathologic inflammation (persistent fever, progressive cytopenias, rising ferritin and soluble IL2Rα, decreasing fibrinogen, hepatosplenomegaly, end-organ damage) not attributable to other causes.
CNS HLH Reactivation: Reactivation of CNS inflammation in patients with HLH may present with or without altered mental status and is defined by pleocytosis in CSF or an MRI consistent with CNS inflammation not attributable to other causes.
To assess the incidence of reactivation, cumulative incidence curves will be computed along with a 95% confidence interval. Death prior to reactivation will be considered as a competing risk.  Death due to reactivation will be noted.</description>

        -C, and -DRB1 (at high resolution using DNA-based typing). Unrelated donors must be a 7/8
        or 8/8 match at HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 (at high resolution using DNA-based typing). Only
        bone marrow stem cells are allowed.

        5 Patient must have adequate organ function as measured by:

          1. Cardiac: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt; 40%; or LV shortening fraction
             (LVSF) &gt; 26% by echocardiogram.

          2. Renal: Calculated or radioisotope Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt; 50 mL/min/1.73m2

          3. Hepatic: Adequate liver function: serum conjugated (direct) bilirubin &lt; 2x upper
             limit of normal for age as per local laboratory (with the exceptions of isolated
             hyperbilirubinemia due to Gilbert's syndrome, or hyperbilirubinemia as the result of
             liver inflammation in the setting of persistent, active HLH); Alanine
             Aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 10x upper limit of

               2. Uncontrolled bacterial, viral or fungal infection (currently taking medication
                  and with progression or no clinical improvement) at time of enrollment.  We

                  initiating transplant therapy, but other patients should have no uncontrolled
                  bacterial, viral or fungal infections at the time of enrollment.
