Giving babies more blood\n      before cutting the umbilical cord by delayed cord clamping or umbilical cord milking has\n      been shown to reduce the risk of bleeding in the brain. This may be related to improving\n      perfusion to the brain.  However, some studies suggest that delayed cord clamping may not\n      increase hemoglobin or blood volume in babies delivered by cesarean section. Milking the\n      umbilical cord may give more blood in babies delivered by Cesarean Section may improve\n      perfusion and reduce bleeding in the brain."
