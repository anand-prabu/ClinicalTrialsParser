The collection procedure will be\n           terminated after collection of one RBC unit.  The maximum target red cell volume will\n           be selected based on the donor predonation weight as specified in the nomogram included\n           in the  MCS\u00ae+ 8150 operation manual.\n\n        -  The RBC units will be stored for 42 days at 1\u00b0 to 6\u00b0C.\n\n        -  Upon collection and at 42 days after collection, the RBC units will be weighed and\n           tested for hematology parameters (white blood cell count, red blood cell count,\n           residual white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, mean\n           corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin\n           concentration, red blood cell distribution width, and supernatant hemoglobin) and\n           chemistry parameters (pH, potassium, glucose, lactate, and ATP).\n\n        -  Acceptance criteria for this study are as follows:\n\n             1. Hemolysis of less than or equal to 1% at 42 days of storage\n\n             2. Maximum absolute red cell volume is less than or equal to the programmed absolute\n                RBC target volume + 15%\n\n             3. Minimum absolute red cell volume is greater than or equal to the programmed\n                absolute RBC target volume - 15%\n\n        -  After collection of sixty (60) evaluable RBC units, the study will be  considered\n           supportive of the intended use noted above if zero (0) units fail the acceptance\n           criteria.\n\n        -  If one (1) unit fails acceptance criteria after collection of sixty (60) evaluable RBC\n           units, an additional seventy one (71) units will be collected.\n\n        -  The study will be considered supportive of the intended use noted above if not more\n           than one (1) total unit out of 131 evaluable units fails the acceptance criteria.\n\n        -  If a total of two (2) units fail acceptance criteria, the study will not be  considered\n           supportive of the intended use noted above."
