Participants will remove the Cervical Cap from the Sheath of the\n      Conceptacle and discard the Sheath.  Participants will then load the Cervical Cap into the\n      Applicator for insertion, placement and deployment of the device.  Participants will wash\n      the applicator with soap and water and place it in the double zip lock bags.  During the\n      time the cervical cap is inserted, normal activity will be recommended with the exception of\n      having intercourse.  The female participants will leave the conception cap inserted for a\n      period of time between 4 and 12 hours, return to the investigator's office for examination,\n      remove the Cervical Cap, and undergo a follow up pelvic examination.  Participants will be\n      asked to complete the study and the questionnaire within 3 days of receiving the study\n      packet.  As a result, this study could take up to 4 days to complete per enrolled couple."
