            "textblock": "Cryolipolysis with Zeltiq CoolSculpting device is a novel method of non-invasive fat\n      removal.  The technique works by application of cold plates to the skin surface for a single\n      cooling cycle lasting 60 minutes, after which a cold-induced inflammatory panniculitis leads\n      to selective loss of fat.  There is no histologic evidence of necrotic or inflammatory\n      damage to skin or nerves, however a single small human study has reported prolonged\n      temporary altered sensation (hypoesthesia) in the area of cryolipolysis procedure.  This\n      hypoesthesia seen in about 2/3 of patients, is completely reversible, lasts up to 8 weeks\n      after treatment, and suggests that cooling under these conditions can temporarily alter\n      sensory nerve function.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to further characterize the reversible cutaneous sensory\n      function alteration after cryolipolysis with Zeltiq CoolSculpting device.  Using multiple\n      modalities of sensory nerve function we hope to elucidate the details of cryolipolysis\n      induced sensory nerve alteration."
