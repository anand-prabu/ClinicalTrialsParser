Most studies have shown that the attire\n      influences their feelings trust and confidence regarding their care.  In most countries the\n      preference is for formal attire.  In other places a more casual attire is generally\n      accepted.  Israel is a country where casual dress is acceptable in most settings.  Israeli\n      physician's dress code has been discussed in the past, but  has never been systematically\n      studied.  The aim of this study is to systematically examine the attitudes of parents of\n      children who have been admitted to the pediatric ward towards physicians' attire."
