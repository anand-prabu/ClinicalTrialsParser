Although we usually perform 2 to 4 passes\n      (number of times the doctor biopsies the mass), at this time we do not know the ideal number\n      of passes needed to obtain adequate amount of tissue for making a diagnosis. The purpose of\n      this study is to compare the amount of tissue obtained with 2 passes versus 4 passes."

This translates to\n      less need for repeat procedures (due to nondiagnostic index procedure due to inadequate FNA\n      passes), prompt treatment to patients and better use of health care resources. Therefore, we\n      will be comparing 2 versus 4 FNA passes to determine which number of FNA pases will yield an\n      adequate diagnostic cell block.\n\n      Secondary Aims:\n\n      To compare the rate of complications when performing 2 versus 4 EUS-FNA passes of solid\n      pancreatic mass lesions.\n\n      Secondary Research Hypothesis:\n\n      EUS-guided FNA is a safe procedure with a complication rate of < 1%. By performing more\n      (four) NA passes one is likely to yield a better quality cell block while at the same time\n      without compromising patient safety."
