            "textblock": "Surgery and Study Drug Administration:\n\n      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study,  abdominal surgery will\n      be performed to try to remove as many tumors as possible. The abdominal surgery is not being\n      performed specifically for this research study and would be performed even if participant\n      did not take part in this study.  Participant will be given a separate consent form to sign\n      that explains the details and risks of surgery in more detail.\n\n      During surgery, the abdomen will be temporarily closed. Then the abdominal wash will begin.\n      During the \"abdominal wash,\" heated oxaliplatin will be delivered through plastic tubing\n      that is connected to a pump into the abdomen. The pump pushes the heated oxaliplatin into\n      the abdomen and then pulls it out and recirculates the oxaliplatin. The skin of the abdomen\n      is temporarily closed during the abdominal wash. The surgeon will also \"wash\" over the\n      closed area of the surgical site. A pump will be used to pump heated oxaliplatin in and out\n      of the abdomen over 90 minutes while the surgeon gently presses on the abdominal wall so the\n      oxaliplatin reaches all areas in the abdomen. After 90 minutes, the oxaliplatin is removed\n      and the abdomen will be \"washed\" with saline and all fluid will be removed before the\n      surgeon permanently closes the abdomen with 3 layers of stitches.\n\n      Two (2) pea-sized tissue samples (tumor and normal abdominal tissue), 2 tablespoons of blood\n      will be sent to the laboratory of Dr. Scott Kopetz for tissue evaluation and extraction of\n      RNA (genetic material). One (1) tumor sample will be removed before the procedure and the\n      other sample will be removed at the end of the procedure. The samples will be examined under\n      a microscope and DNA (the genetic material in cells) will be removed to look for any changes\n      to the DNA. The results of these tests will not be shared with participant, nor will they be\n      used for any decisions regarding participant's treatment.\n\n      There is a chance that the surgeon may decide during the surgery that the abdominal wash\n      will not be performed, for example if the disease has spread to or attached to certain\n      organs.  If this occurs, participant's doctor will discuss other treatment options with\n      them.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      On Day 1 after surgery:\n\n        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. PK testing\n           measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points.\n\n        -  Participant will have a physical exam.\n\n      On Days 2-5, 11, 14, and 30 after surgery:\n\n        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n        -  Participant will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  On Day 30 only, participant will have a hearing test.\n\n      Three (3) and 6 months after surgery:\n\n        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n        -  Participant will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  Participant will have a CT scan or MRI to check the status of the disease.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      Participant will remain on study for up to 6 months.  Participant will be taken off study if\n      the disease gets worse.\n\n      If the study doctor learns that the disease has come back or gotten worse at the 6 month\n      follow-up visit, participant may be eligible for a re-perfusion, which is a repeat of the\n      surgery and study drug administration.  If participant is eligible for a re-perfusion, their\n      participation on this study will end and they will be given a new consent form to sign in\n      order to be re-enrolled back onto this study.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Oxaliplatin is FDA approved and commercially available\n      for the treatment of advanced bladder cancer, metastatic testicular cancer, metastatic\n      ovarian cancer, hepatoblastoma, neuroblastoma, metastatic appendiceal cancer, and abdominal\n      mesothelioma.  The use of heated oxaliplatin given intra-abdominally in pediatric patients\n      with colon cancer is investigational.  The study doctor can explain how the study drug is\n      designed to work.\n\n      Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson."
