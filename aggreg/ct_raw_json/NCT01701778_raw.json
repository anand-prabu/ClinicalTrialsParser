Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane via a facemask,\n      followed by placement of a laryngeal mask airway. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane\n      2-3% in oxygen-air.Then,caudal block was applied. Patients were randomly assigned in three\n      groups. Group Cau-DEX (n = 30): Caudal Levobupivacaine 0.25% 1ml/kg plus dexmedetomidine\n      1\u00b5g/kg and 10 ml normal saline i.v.;Group IV-DEX(n = 30): Levobupivacaine 0.25% 1ml/kg and\n      dexmedetomidine 1\u00b5g/kg(10 ml)i.v.;Group Placebo(n = 30): Levobupivacaine 0.25% and 10 ml\n      normal saline intravenous."
