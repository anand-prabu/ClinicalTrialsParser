The\n      investigators will be comparing the therapeutic effects of two different higher brightnesses\n      of ultra violet light on a riboflavin treated eye.  One light will be twice as bright as the\n      other and the exposure time of these brighter lights to deliver equivalent energy to the\n      cornea will be reduced from the standard 30 minutes to 10 and 5 minutes.  Riboflavin is\n      vitamin B12 and the investigators are trying to determine if they can get an identical\n      clinical effect when they use the brighter treatment lights for shorter times.  The\n      investigators will also monitor the clinical effect and the status of the cornea to see if\n      additional risks are associated with the brighter light."
