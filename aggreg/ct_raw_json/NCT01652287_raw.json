            "textblock": "The investigators believe a readily available drink containing a high dose of probiotics has\n      the potential to improve compliance through many of these mechanisms. This product also has\n      the potential to positively impact the health of children and adults around the world, as\n      yogurt will likely be more appealing to both children and their parents for long term\n      consumption than pharmaceutical-like preparations. In addition to the benefits associated\n      with the consumption of probiotics, there is an increased health benefit from consuming\n      yogurt, a nutrient dense food.\n\n      More specifically, the rationale for this Phase I study is to determine safety of this\n      yogurt drink and comply with FDA recommendations pertaining to an Investigational New Drug\n      application. The investigators hypothesize that BB-12 is safe in generally healthy children\n      ages 1-5 years."

            "textblock": "Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in sufficient amounts, may\n      improve health. A common use for probiotics is in addressing gastrointestinal issues, such\n      as antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). As an alternative to supplements, probiotics are\n      also included as ingredients in fermented dairy products to produce functional foods, which\n      are foods providing health benefits beyond their nutritional value. Yogurt, for example, is\n      a fermented milk product often considered a functional food. One of the most commonly used\n      probiotics is Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis (BB-12).\n\n      Our Primary Aim in Years 1-2 is to conduct a pediatric randomized controlled study to\n      establish the safety of BB-12 fortified yogurt in children. Our Secondary Aims are to\n      examine the fecal microbiota of children prior to, during and following consumption of\n      probiotics. This study will evaluate whether a well-defined, probiotic-containing yogurt can\n      safely be used as an effective delivery vehicle for probiotics. This study is important to\n      help advance probiotic research forward in a systematic, well-accepted manner. Our long-term\n      goal is to create yogurt with sufficient probiotic dosages to positively impact many\n      different aspects of childhood and adult health."
