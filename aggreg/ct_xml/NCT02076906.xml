    <textblock>
      Magnetic Resonance (MR)-guided high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an innovative
      technique that allows for non-invasive thermal ablation of tissue.  Advantages over
      conventional local tumor control such as surgery, radiation, or radiofrequency are that
      MR-HIFU is completely non-invasive, non-ionizing, and enables ablation of large tumor
      volumes with avoidance of adjacent tissue injury.  This study will evaluate the safety and
      feasibility of MR-HIFU ablative therapy in children with refractory or relapsed solid tumors
      that are located in bone or soft tissue in close proximity to bone.  Children ≤ 21 years of
      age with refractory or relapsed solid tumors with measurable target lesions that are located
      in bone or soft tissue in close proximity to bone are eligible.  Tolerability will be
      defined during the 28 days following MR-HIFU ablation.  Patients will continue to be
      followed for tumor response and secondary outcomes for up to one year post ablation
      treatment.
