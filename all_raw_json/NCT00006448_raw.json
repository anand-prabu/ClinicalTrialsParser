This double-masked randomized trial to evaluate the utility\n      of a combination of psychological intervention and physical therapy in order to improve pain\n      reduction, increase physical functioning and quality of life for patients with pain\n      associated with spinal cord injuries or amputations will compare the effect of a 6 week\n      program of physical therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy with methadone to one without\n      methadone (n = 400). Secondary outcomes are to evaluate the maintenance of effects of the\n      combined intervention and to evaluate the usefulness of a course of opioid therapy compared\n      to active placebo medication.  Based on the sample size, all measures have greater than 0.7\n      power to detect major within group differences at posttreatment, 6-month follow-up, and\n      12-month follow-up (taking into account a 15% attrition rate, alpha .05).  Patients who\n      qualify for this study will receive a comprehensive medical and physical therapy evaluation\n      at baseline.  Outcome will be assessed by the physician, psychiatrist and physical therapist\n      who are all masked both to the treatment condition and therapy.  Pain is assessed through\n      self-report (measures include pain inventories) and clinical interview."
