  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      3rd line standard treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) harboring
      K-ras wild type consists of anti-EGFR treatment with either cetuximab or panitumumab. This
      type of treatment has a modest but significant beneficial activity in this patient group
      with improved progression-free and overall survival. Although it is well known that patients
      with advanced CRC harboring a K-Ras mutation will not respond to anti-EGFR treatment, it is
      not understood why patients with K-Ras wild type CRC do not all benefit from this type of
      therapy. In order to optimize treatment of these patients as well as health care costs, it
      is extremely important to identify those patients who will respond to treatment with an EGFR
      inhibitor at an early stage.

      The investigators hypothesize that the differences in response to treatment with cetuximab
      are due to variability in the pharmacokinetics and -dynamics of the antibody. Thus, the
      investigators hypothesize that patients who do not respond to anti-EGFR treatment, have
      insufficient drug levels in tumor tissue. The investigators hypothesize that this is due to
      pharmacodynamic processes such as sequestration of cetuximab in the liver which expresses
      high levels of EGF receptor.

      With the introduction of immuno-positron emission tomography (PET), an attractive novel
      option to visualize molecular interactions has been developed using the combination of PET
      with labeled mAbs. Cetuximab labeled with zirconium-89 (89Zr) has been successfully
      generated (GMP) and is available for this study. Previous studies have shown excellent
      stability of this compound and 89Zr is shown to be safe in humans. The investigators will
      use 89Zr-cetuximab to demonstrate tumor targeting by imaging and explore the relation of
      uptake with treatment response. With this approach the investigators hope to achieve a
      better understanding of the mechanisms of action of this therapeutic mAb in metastasized CRC
      and eventually develop strategies that may improve efficacy of cetuximab treatment.

    <description>Patients will be treated with cetuximab. For pharmacodynamic purposes PET-imaging with 89Zr-labelled cetuximab will be performed. In addition, two [18F-]-FDG PET-CT will be performed to explore early response. Patients will undergo blood sampling and two skin biopsies for pharmacodynamic purposes of 89Zr-labelled cetuximab and kinase activity profiles, respectively.</description>

             Oral birth control methods alone will not be considered adequate on this study,
             because of the potential pharmacokinetic interaction between study drug and oral

          -  Substance abuse, medical, psychological or social conditions that may interfere with
             the subject's participation in the study or evaluation of the study results.
