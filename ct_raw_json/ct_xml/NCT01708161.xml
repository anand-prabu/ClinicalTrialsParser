  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, phase Ib/II study. The aim of the phase Ib part is to
      estimate the MTD(s) and/or identify the recommended phase II dose(s) (RP2Ds) for the
      combination of BYL719 and AMG 479 (ganitumab), followed by the phase II part to assess the
      clinical efficacy and to further assess the safety of the combination in selected patient
      populations. Patients will be treated until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity
      develops, or withdrawal of informed consent, whichever occurs first. All patients will be
      followed up.  At a minimum, patients must complete the safety follow-up assessments 30 days
      after the last dose of the study treatment.

      This is a multi-center, open-label, phase Ib/II study. The aim of the phase Ib part is to
      estimate the MTD(s) and/or identify the recommended phase II dose(s) (RP2Ds) for the
      combination of BYL719 and AMG 479 (ganitumab), followed by the phase II part to assess the
      clinical efficacy and to further assess the safety of the combination in selected patient
      populations. The dose escalation part of the study will be guided by a Bayesian Logistic
      Regression Model (BLRM).

      Once MTD/RP2D has been determined, patients will be enrolled in two Phase II arms. Patients
      with PIK3CA mutated or amplified hormone receptor positive breast carcinoma will be enrolled
      in Arm 1; patients with PIK3CA mutated or amplified ovarian carcinoma will be enrolled in
      Arm 2. Patients will be treated until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity
      develops, or withdrawal of informed consent, whichever occurs first. All patients will be
      followed up.  At a minimum, patients must complete the safety follow-up assessments 30 days
      after the last dose of the study treatment. In addition, patients who have not progressed at
      the time of discontinuation of study treatment should have radiological follow-up for the
      disease status and phase II patients will be followed for survival.
