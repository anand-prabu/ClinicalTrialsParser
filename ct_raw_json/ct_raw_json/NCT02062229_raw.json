It is becoming a social challenge because it is responsible for\n      personal and interpersonal discomfort and anxiety. A major obstacle to meaningful study of\n      the epidemiology of male infertility is the difficulty in accurate diagnosis of the presence\n      or absence of a problem. Traditionally, the diagnosis of male infertility is facilitated by\n      the conventional assessment  of the semen profile - constructed according to recognized\n      guidelines (i.e. WHO) and including pH, cell count and motility - but no specific biomarkers\n      are available.\n\n      We sought to determine the oxysterol and fatty acid lipidome with the ai of finding a lipid\n      biomarker useful for the diagnosis of male infertility."
