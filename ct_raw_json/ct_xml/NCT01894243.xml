    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part study in patients with advanced solid tumours.  Part A will investigate the
      PK of olaparib in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment compared to patients
      with normal hepatic function; Part B will allow patients with mild or moderate hepatic
      impairment or normal hepatic function continued access to olaparib after the PK phase and
      will provide additional safety data.
