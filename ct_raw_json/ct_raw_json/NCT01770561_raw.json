Descriptive statistics will be used to assess non-inferiority of the\n      Integrated sensor and infusion sets sensors compare to control Enlite sensors.\n\n      Insulin delivery functionality will be evaluated based on BG profiles obtained during\n      peri-prandial periods during which BG measurements will be performed at 15, 20, 30 min\n      intervals according to a SMBG schedule.  Post-prandial pharmacodynamic profiles will be\n      analyzed to demonstrate the effect of insulin delivered using the Integrated sensor and\n      infusion set.  Specifically, rise in glucose levels followed by their fall will be used as\n      an indication that insulin was delivered and absorbed. Post-prandial BG areas under the\n      curve (AUC), Tmax (time to maximum rise of BG), and Cmax (maximum post-prandial BG) values\n      will be calculated for each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) consumed during both\n      inpatient days and compared.  Intra - and inter-subject mean values and standard deviations\n      will be calculated.  Paired and unpaired T-tests will be used to evaluate statistical\n      significance.\n\n      Longevity of device performance will be assessed by comparing the listed parameters obtained\n      during two inpatient days."
