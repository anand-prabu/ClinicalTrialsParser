  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent pain is a major challenge for patients who undergo hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HSCT) and is related to more fatigue, more physical disability, poorer quality
      of life, and poorer medical adherence. There is a need to examine strategies for managing
      pain in HSCT patients that can complement existing analgesic regimens. Strong evidence
      suggests that cognitive and behavioral factors play an important role in HSCT patients'
      ability to manage their pain. The investigator has found that HSCT patients having low
      levels of confidence (i.e., self-efficacy) in their ability to control pain and high use of
      maladaptive coping strategies (i.e., pain catastrophizing) experience increased pain and
      disability. A psychosocial intervention that modifies patients' cognitive and behavioral
      pain coping strategies may benefit HSCT patients. Protocols, particularly Pain Coping Skills
      Training (PCST), have been developed for reducing pain and improving quality of life in
      patients with persistent pain. However, HSCT patients with persistent pain face a number of
      unique challenges that must be considered when applying a PCST protocol. The investigator
      proposes to develop and test a Mobile Health Pain Coping Skills (mPCST) protocol for HSCT
      patients with persistent pain to meet the challenges of HSCT patients with pain as they
      transition from hospital based care to their home environment. The first aim of this study
      is to use an iterative development model to design a mPCST intervention protocol for HSCT
      patients that targets increasing self-efficacy for pain control and decreasing pain
      catastrophizing. The study team will use focus groups with patients and HSCT providers to
      guide development along with user testing with HSCT patients having pain. The second aim of
      this study is to use a small randomized controlled trial to examine the feasibility,
      acceptability, and engagement in the developed mPCST protocol. The third aim is to obtain an
      estimate of the effect size of the developed mPCST protocol on decreased pain, pain
      disability, physical disability, and adherence to post-transplant lifestyle recommendations
      impacted by pain when compared to a standard care control condition. Proposed innovative
      features of the mPCST protocol that will be developed include: extensive input from PCST and
      HSCT experts and HSCT patients with pain; an initial session prior to discharge with
      subsequent sessions occurring at home via video-conferencing; incorporation of strategies to
      decrease the impact of pain on adherence to critical post-transplant lifestyle
      recommendations; a real-time daily assessment system with subsequent tailored feedback. If
      the developed mPCST protocol demonstrates feasibility, acceptability, engagement, and
      promising effect sizes to influence pain and other indices of quality of life, a larger NIH
      grant will be sought to examine this protocol in a larger sample of patients, test the
      protocol against an active treatment, and investigate a broader array of outcomes (e.g.,
      medication adherence). This mPCST protocol could also be examined in other patient
      populations with pain facing similar challenges (e.g., live far from medical center, travel
      limitations).
