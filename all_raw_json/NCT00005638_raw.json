Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy plus radiation therapy in\n      treating patients who have advanced cancer of the esophagus."

Following 2 weeks of rest, patients\n      begin chemoradiation. Patients receive cisplatin and irinotecan as above on days 1, 8, 22,\n      and 29 and radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 5-6 weeks.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose limiting toxicities.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for this study."
