  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy is the leading cause of physical disability among children. Manual dexterity
      and upper limbs functionality is limited between these children. The purpose of this study
      is to stablish a specific profile of school children with cerebral palsy based on the upper
      limbs assessment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the rates of perinatal and infant mortality have declined toward the end of the last
      century,the rate of cerebral palsy has remained at 2 to 2.5 per 1,000 live births. A high
      percentage of children with cerebral palsy have difficulty keeping up with the handwriting
      demands at school. The neurological impairments in children with cerebral palsy frequently
      limit the functionality of these children taken in to account the upper limbs variables. It
      should be interesting to describe a clinical profile based on this assessment.

    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>This inventory assess the key functional capabilities and performance in children between six months to seven years old. Three subscales are observed: self-care, mobility and social function. It helps you to identify areas of new functional intervention. Also, it is used to identify functional deficits.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Upper limbs functionality</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>The functionality is measured using the Abilhand-kids questionnaire. This questionnaire was designed to cover the widest range of children's manual activities including both unimanual and bimanual activities. For each question, the children and their parents were asked to provide their perceived difficulty to perform the activity on a three-level scale: impossible (0), difficult (1), or easy (2).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Manual dexterity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Manual dexterity is measured using the 9-hole peg test. This is a brief, standardized, quantitative test of upper extremity function. Both the dominant and non-dominant hands are tested twice. The patient is seated at a table with a small container holding nine pegs. The patient picks up the nine pegs one at a time as quickly as possible, puts them in the nine holes, and, once they are in the holes, removes them again as quickly as possible one at a time, replacing them into the shallow container. The time is recorded.</description>

    <measure>Executive function</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>The executive function is measured using the Porteus Maze Test. It consists of a series of mazes graded in difficulty and standardized for application to children from three years old.</description>

    <measure>Handwriting assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>The handwriting ability is measured with the Handwriting without tears method. It is used to assess memory, letter size,space and movement control.</description>

    <measure>Range of motion</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>The range of motion in upper limbs is measured with a standard goniometer at different levels: elbow, wrist and fingers.</description>

    <measure>Upper limbs strength</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>The strength is evaluated using a digital dynamometer. The strength is measured in Newtons.</description>
