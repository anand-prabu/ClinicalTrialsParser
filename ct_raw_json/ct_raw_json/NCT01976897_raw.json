Before each measurement, the sensor mat is calibrated from 10 to 220 mm Hg, according to the manufacturer's recommendations.\nThe sheet of pressure sensors is disposed on the dedicated bed. The patient is then asked to take his/her usual position in the supine position and a latency of 5 minutes is observed. The recording time pressure is then performed for 90 seconds in the optical observing time to adapt to changes in media.",
