    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate noninferiority (a new treatment is equivalent to
      standard treatment) in terms of the percentage of patients who have plasma human
      immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels less than 400 copies per
      mL after 48 weeks of randomized treatment with tenofovir disoproxil
      fumarate/emtricitabine/rilpivirine (TDF/FTC/RPV) versus TDF/FTC/efavirenz (TDF/FTC/EFV).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 48-week, multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites), multinational (conducted
      at different countries), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention),
      randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance) study to assess whether tenofovir
      disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine/rilpivirine (TDF/FTC/RPV) shows noninferior response rates
      of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) ribonucleic acid (RNA) suppression less than
      400 copies per mL, compared with TDF/FTC/efavirenz (TDF/FTC/EFV). The study consists of 3
      phases including, the screening phase (of 6 weeks), treatment phase (of 48 weeks), and
      follow up phase (of 30 to 35 days after the last dose of study medication). During the 48
      weeks treatment phase, patients currently with HIV-1 RNA suppression less than 50 copies per
      mL on their first-line antiretroviral regimen, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, in 2
      groups, ie, Group 1 (treatment group) and Group 2 (control group). Both these groups will
      receive a fixed dose combination (FDC) regimen (ie, FDC tablet: one tablet per day) of
      either TDF/FTC/RPV in Group 1 or TDF/FTC/EFV in Group 2. Patients will return for study
      visits at Week 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 during the treatment period, and then every 24 weeks
      thereafter during the extended treatment period until the last patient has his or her Week
      48 (or treatment discontinuation) visit. Safety evaluations for adverse events, clinical
      laboratory (central and local) tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical
      examination will be performed throughout the study. The treatment duration for each patient
      will be expected to be between 48 and 108 weeks.
