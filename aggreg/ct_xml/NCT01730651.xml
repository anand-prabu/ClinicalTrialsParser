        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients (who have been adequately clinically staged) with primary, untreated,
             histologically confirmed carcinoma of the uterine cervix (including clear cell and
             small cell carcinoma), with metastatic lymphadenopathies (any of pelvis or PAN &gt;1.5
             cm in short diameter, with/without biopsy proven inguinal lymph node [ING])

          2. Patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0, 1, 2

          3. Patients with adequate bone marrow function: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater
             than or equal to 1,500/mcl, platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcl at the
             beginning.

          4. Patients with adequate renal function: creatinine equal to or less than 2.0 mg%.

          5. Patients who have signed an approved informed consent and authorization

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with recurrent LN(s) which was(were) previously irradiated.

          2. Patients who have diagnosis of other malignance tumors except papillary or follicular
              thyroid cancer or skin cancer

          3. Patients with metastatic lymphadenopathies other than pelvis, PAN, ING (e.g.
             supraclavicular or mediastinal metastatic lymphadenopathy)

          4. Patients with distant organ metastasis (e.g. bone, lung, brain…)
