      This study is a 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double blind, parallel group,
      placebo-controlled study.

      The purpose of this study is to replicate the therapeutic benefit of UMEC/VI 62.5/25
      microgram (mcg) on health-related quality of life as reflected by St. George's Respiratory
      Questionnaire (SGRQ) scores and symptoms as reflected by rescue medication use observed in
      the 6 month placebo controlled study (DB2113373). Lung function will be assessed as it
      provides an objective measure to support the subjective patient reported outcomes of SGRQ
      and rescue medication use. The study is intended to provide additional evidence to support
      the use of UMEC/VI for the maintenance treatment of COPD Approximately 496 subjects will be
      randomized from approximately 62 centers in order to ensure 422 subjects complete 12 weeks
      of treatment. Eligible subjects will be randomized to UMEC/VI 62.5/25mcg or placebo in a 1:1
      ratio. All treatments will be administered once-daily in the morning via a Dry Powder
      Inhaler (DPI).

      There will be a total of 5 clinic visits. The total duration of study participation will be
      approximately 15 weeks.  All subjects will be provided with albuterol/salbutamol to use as
      needed for the relief of COPD symptoms throughout the run-in and double-blind treatment
      periods.

    <description>The SGRQ is a disease-specific questionnaire, self-completed by subjects and used widely to measure the impact of respiratory disease and its treatment on the subject's health-related quality of life. The SGRQ total score on Day 84 will be analysed using a Mixed Models Repeated Measures (MMRM analysis), including SGRQ scores recorded at Days 28, 56 and 84. The SGRQ total score will be used to evaluate the effect of UMEC/VI on health-related quality of life as compared to placebo in subjects with COPD</description>

             Non-child bearing potential (i.e. physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant,
             including any female who is post-menopausal or surgically sterile). Surgically
             sterile females are defined as those with a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral
             oophorectomy or tubal ligation. Post-menopausal females are defined as being
             amenorrhoeic for greater than 1 year with an appropriate clinical profile (For

             therapy; or child bearing potential, has a negative pregnancy test at screening, and
             agrees to one of the following acceptable contraceptive methods used consistently and
             correctly (i.e. in accordance with the approved product label, if appropriate, and
             the instructions of the physician for the duration of the study screening to
             follow-up contact): abstinence; oral contraceptive (either combined or progestogen
             alone); injectable progestogen; implants of levonorgestrel; estrogenic vaginal ring;

             partner sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia) prior to the
             female subject's entry into the study (this male is the sole partner for that
             subject); and double barrier method: condom and an occlusive cap (diaphragm or
             cervical/vault caps) with a vaginal spermicidal agent
             (foam/gel/film/cream/suppository).

          -  Diagnosis:  An established clinical history of COPD in accordance with the definition
             by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society.

          -  Smoking History:  Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of cigarette
             smoking of &gt;=10 pack-years [number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per day /
             20) x number of years smoked (e.g. 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years, or 10
             cigarettes per day for 20 years both equal 10 pack-years)].  Former smokers are
             defined as those who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1.
             Pipe and/or cigar use cannot be used to calculate pack-year history.

          -  Severity of Disease:  A pre and post-albuterol/salbutamol FEV1/ Forced Vital Capacity
             (FVC) ratio of &lt;0.70 and a post-albuterol/salbutamol FEV1 of &lt;=70% of predicted
             normal values calculated using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
             (NHANES) III reference equations at Visit 1.

          -  Dyspnea: A score of &gt;=2 on the Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale
             at Visit 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy: Women who are pregnant or lactating or are planning on becoming pregnant
             during the study.

          -  Asthma:  A current diagnosis of asthma.

          -  Other Respiratory Disorders: Known alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, active lung
             infections (such as tuberculosis), and lung cancer are absolute exclusionary
             conditions. A subject who, in the opinion of the investigator, has any other
             significant respiratory conditions in addition to COPD should be excluded. Examples
             may include clinically significant bronchiectasis, pulmonary hypertension,
             sarcoidosis, or interstitial lung disease.

          -  Other Diseases/Abnormalities: Any subject who is considered unlikely to survive the
             duration of the study period or has any rapidly progressing disease or immediate
             life-threatening illness (e.g. cancer). In addition, any subject who has any
             condition (e.g. neurological condition) that is likely to affect respiratory function
             should not be included in the study.

          -  Severe Hepatic Impairment: Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class
             C) should be excluded unless, in the opinion of the investigator, the benefit is
             likely to outweigh the risk.

          -  Unstable or life threatening cardiac disease: UMEC/VI should be used with caution in
             subjects with severe cardiovascular disease.  In the opinion of the investigator, use
             should only be considered if the benefit is likely to outweigh the risk in conditions
             such as: myocardial infarction or unstable angina in the last 6 months; unstable or
             life threatening cardiac arrhythmia requiring intervention in the last 3 months; New
             York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV heart failure.

          -  Contraindications: Any history of allergy or hypersensitivity to any
             anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist, beta2-agonist, sympathomimetic,
             lactose/milk protein or magnesium stearate.

          -  Antimuscarinic effects: Subjects with medical conditions such as narrow-angle
             glaucoma, urinary retention, prostatic hypertrophy, or bladder neck obstruction
             should only be included if, in the opinion of the study physician, the benefit
             outweighs the risk.

          -  Hospitalization: Hospitalization for COPD or pneumonia within 12 weeks prior to Visit
             1.

          -  Lung Resection:  Lung volume reduction surgery within the 12 months prior to Visit 1.

          -  12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG):  Investigators will be provided with ECG reviews
             conducted by a centralized independent cardiologist to assist in evaluation of
             subject eligibility. The Investigator will determine the clinical significance of
             each abnormal ECG finding in relation to the subject's medical history and exclude
             subjects who would be at undue risk by participating in the trial. Subjects with the
             following abnormalities are excluded from participation in the study: Atrial
             fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate &gt;120 beats per minute (bpm); Sustained or
             non-sustained ventricular tachycardia; Second degree heart block Mobitz type II and
             third degree heart block (unless pacemaker or defibrillator had been inserted).

          -  Medication Prior to Spirometry: Unable to withhold albuterol/salbutamol for the 4
             hour period required prior to spirometry testing at each study visit.

          -  Interactions: Concomitant administration with beta-blockers and strong Cytochrome
             P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors is only permitted if, in the Investigator's opinion, the
             likely benefit outweighs the potential risk.

          -  Medications Prior to Screening:  Use of the following medications according to the
             following defined time intervals prior to Visit 1: Depot corticosteroids (12 weeks),
