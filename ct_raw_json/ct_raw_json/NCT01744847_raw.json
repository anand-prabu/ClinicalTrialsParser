Bile duct cannulation was attempted for various reasons\n      (removal of bile duct stones, biliary stenting, cytology of bile, biopsy of the bile duct,\n      etc.).\n\n      Patients who satisfied the following inclusion criteria were enrolled in this study: (1)\n      initially pancreatic duct cannulation by chance, (2) successful insertion of the guidewire\n      into the pancreatic duct to at least half of the presumed total length of the pancreatic\n      duct,, and (3) age 20 years or older. Exclusion criteria were: (1) refusal the ERCP, (2)\n      previous endoscopic sphincterotomy or endoscopic papillary balloon dilatation, (3) acute\n      pancreatitis at the time of the procedure, (4) pregnancy and (5) anatomical change due to\n      past surgery; total gastrectomy, Billroth II operation, Whipples's operation etc. Patients\n      who satisfied the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to either the double-guidewire\n      technique (DGT) group or the transpancreatic precut sphincterotomy (TPS) group; A\n      randomization list for group allocation was generated by using computer-based pseudo-random\n      number generators. We compared both techniques , for a maximum of ten extra attempts which\n      are CBD cannulation by each methods. We obtained the written informed consent from all\n      enrolled patients."
