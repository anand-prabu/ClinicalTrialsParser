Leg length discrepancies are related to\n      poorer functional outcomes and patient dissatisfaction. Failure to restore femoral offset\n      following total hip arthroplasty has been linked to decreased range of motion and abductor\n      muscle strength, impingement, limping, higher dislocation rates, increased polyethylene\n      wear, and loosening of implants. Computer navigation has shown to improve the accuracy of\n      leg length and hip offset during total hip arthroplasty. The investigators research\n      objective is to prove the accuracy of the Intellijoint HIP\u2122 system for determining leg\n      length and hip offset. The investigators hypothesis was that Intellijoint HIP\u2122, an imageless\n      intraoperative intelligent instrument, could improve the accuracy of leg length and hip\n      offset during primary total hip arthroplasty. The investigators plan to study this\n      hypothesis in humans by comparing the leg length and hip offset discrepancies produced with\n      Intellijoint HIP\u2122 to the standard at the investigators institution, which is a pin and\n      outrigger system."
