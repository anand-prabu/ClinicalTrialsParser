Every patient will receive both the krill oil and the\n      placebo, but both the coordinator and the patient are blinded to which is which. At each\n      visit, participants will undergo a non-invasive test which measures the function of the\n      inner lining of blood vessels and they will also have blood drawn.  Fasting is required\n      before each appointment. The blood drawn is used to measure their Hemoglobin A1C, Glucose,\n      HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, C-peptide and total antioxidant capacity.\n\n      Risks to taking krill oil supplements are likely to include bad breath, heartburn, fishy\n      taste, upset stomach, nausea, loose stools, gas, and bloating.  Risks of EndoPAT testing are\n      not permanent and may include pain, numbness, tingling, redness, and bruising at the site of\n      the blood pressure cuff.  Risks that are associated with drawing blood may include redness,\n      swelling, pain or discomfort, bruising at the site of the needle stick, or in very rare\n      cases, infection at the needle site.  To minimize these risks, trained technologists and\n      phlebotomists will be used for all procedures.\n\n      This is not a treatment option; while involved in this study all participants will continue\n      their regular treatment for Type 2 diabetes mellitus (as well as any other applicable\n      conditions)."
