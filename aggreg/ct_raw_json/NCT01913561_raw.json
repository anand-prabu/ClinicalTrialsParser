The garment is designed to position the\n      electrodes in the appropriate anatomical locations, without any special guidance. The dry\n      electrodes are made from unique yarns with silver embedded into the garment using a\n      proprietary technique developed by HealthWatch (HW)that obviates the need for skin\n      preparation or the application of fluids. The garment can be connected to any standard ECG\n      device available in the hospitals.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Master Caution\n      Garment for continuous monitoring of ECG signal compared to standard gel electrodes.\n\n      The following endpoints will be evaluated in subjects participating in the study:\n\n      Primary:\n\n      Compare the quality of the ECG signal of HW textile electrodes compared to gel electrodes\n      using standard ECG devices.\n\n      Secondary:\n\n      Compare the quality of the ECG signal of HW textile electrodes compared to gel electrodes\n      when event is detected by the ECG devices."

In the beginning of the study, the following parameters will be measured and documented\n           in the CRF: blood pressure, body temperature, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation in\n           the blood.\n\n        2. The patient will be dressed with the Master Caution Garment and connected to a 12 lead\n           ECG device.  The procedure takes 5 minutes including data printing.\n\n        3. A twelve lead ECG with gel electrodes will be done and data printed. The procedure\n           takes 5 minutes. The patient will stay connected to the monitor for the following hour.\n\n        4. After an hour the data from the gel electrodes will be printed again.\n\n        5. The patient will be dressed again with the Master Caution Garment and connected to a 12\n           lead ECG device. The procedure takes 5 minutes including data printing.\n\n        6. The following parameters will be compared between the gel ECG and the Garment ECG:\n\n             -  Heart Rate (HR)\n\n             -  P wave width and amplitude\n\n             -  QRS complex width and amplitude\n\n             -  T wave width and amplitude\n\n             -  RR interval\n\n             -  PR interval\n\n             -  QT interval\n\n      Part B - ECG in motion\n\n        1. In the beginning of the study, the following parameters will be measured : blood\n           pressure, body temperature, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation in the blood.\n\n        2. Four (4) gel electrodes will be placed on the patient on the following places - Left\n           Arm (LA), Right Arm (RA), Left Leg (LL) and Right Leg (RL).\n\n        3.

The 4 gel electrodes will be connected to a standard of care ECG device.\n\n        6. The ECG devices will be recording the ECG signal from the two sets of electrodes for 24\n           hours.\n\n           Every hour in the first 6 hours the data will be printed from both devices. In every\n           event detected the data will be printed from both devices. the data will be evaluated\n           for quality comparison between the gel and the textile electrodes using the hospital\n           ECG device.\n\n        7.

Blinded cardiologist's assessment whether at that time interval the patient suffered\n           from a disorder. This assessment will be based on hospital's recorded data with the gel\n           electrodes.\n\n        2. The Master Caution Garment result for that time interval will be categorized as\n           follows:\n\n             -  True Positive (TP) = MCG Alert was right (based on GS)\n\n             -  False Positive (FP) = MCG Alert was wrong\n\n             -  True Negative (TN) = No MCG Alert when indeed alert was not necessary\n\n             -  False Negative (FN) = No MCG Alert but there was a disorder case"
