After 2 months, patients with stable or responding disease may\n      continue treatment. Patients achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for 8\n      months beyond CR.\n\n      Tumors are measured every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
