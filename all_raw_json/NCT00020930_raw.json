Determine the safety and toxic effects of\n      this drug in these patients. III. Determine the time to progression of patients treated with\n      this drug.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours weekly\n      for 6 weeks. Treatment repeats in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 months."
