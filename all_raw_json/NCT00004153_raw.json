These specimens\n      are examined by nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and analyzed\n      for various tumor antigens.\n\n      Patients may choose to be told the results of this testing, but the results do not influence\n      or change the planned therapy. Brief counseling is required to discuss the results and their\n      potential implications.\n\n      Patients are followed for at least 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients for the lymph node portion and 80 patients (20 per\n      stage of disease) for the peripheral blood portion will be accrued for this study within 3\n      years."
