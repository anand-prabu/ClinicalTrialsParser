Analogous to other inherited cardiomyopathies, the\n      natural course of the disease is age-related (\"age-related penetrance\"); after a\n      presymptomatic phase of variable length many PLN R14del-carriers progress to overt disease,\n      and are diagnosed with either DCM or ARVC. PLN is a regulator of the sarcoplasmic reticulum\n      Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) pump in cardiac muscle and thereby important for maintaining Ca2+\n      homeostasis. Cardiac fibrosis appears to be an early manifestation of disease. The\n      investigators hypothesize that treatment of presymptomatic PLN R14del-carriers with\n      eplerenone, which by virtue of its mineralocorticoid(aldosterone)-blocking properties is a\n      strong antifibrotic agent, reduces disease progression and postpones onset of overt disease."
