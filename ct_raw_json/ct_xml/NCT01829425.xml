      This study includes:

        1. A trial in which urge incontinent women (N=152) will be randomized to hypnotherapy or
           pharmacotherapy and evaluated at months 2, 6 &amp;12.

             -  The primary objective will be change in Urgency Urinary Incontinence (UUI)
                episodes.

             -  Secondary objectives will; be change in subjects' responses in questionnaires that
                measure the severity of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms and incontinence
                severity (Overactive Bladder Questionnaire-Short Form, Incontinence Severity Index
                and the Patient Perception of Bladder Condition), the impact of those symptoms on
                quality of life (Pelvic Organ Prolapse Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire-12),
                change in pad counts and urinary frequency, differences in subjects' attainment of
                expectations for treatment following therapy. Baseline occurrence of irritable
                bowel and painful bladder syndrome will be recorded and their potential change in
                severity following treatment will be explored.

                  1. a. The Hypothesis: Among patients with urgency urinary incontinence,
                     hypnotherapy decreases abnormal perception of bladder distension outside the
                     hypnotic state and is at least as effective as pharmacotherapy in diminishing
                     the symptoms of urgency and severity of incontinence

        2. A comparison of pre-treatment brain function in a subgroup of subjects with UUI to
           normal controls and an evaluation of post-treatment effect of hypnotherapy and
           pharmacotherapy on brain function in UUI subjects.

             -  Sixty women with UUI will undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
                before treatment and these baseline results will be compared to approximately 20
                normal controls.

             -  The same 60 UUI subjects will also undergo fMRI analysis after receiving
                hypnotherapy or pharmacotherapy for two months. Post treatment fMRI results from
                UUI subjects will be compared to their baseline results.

             -  Measured outcomes will be differences in baseline brain function in UUI subjects
                compared to normal controls as well as differences in treatment effect on brain
                function in subjects receiving pharmacotherapy compared to those receiving
                hypnotherapy

                2a.The Hypotheses: 1) Patients with UUI will exhibit increased activation within
                portions of the brain, the limbic cortex (anterior cingulate cortex&amp; insula),
                during bladder distension relative to controls. Patients will also exhibit an
                abnormal pattern of functional connectivity within these parts of the brain. 2)
                Among patients with UUI, hypnotherapy will decrease hyper-activation of portions
                of the brain in response to bladder distension and/or modulate functional
                connectivity within these portions of the brain. Moreover, normalization of
                hyper-activation and connectivity will be greater in hypnotherapy compared to
                pharmacotherapy.

      Detailed Description:  Study Objectives

        1. Primary Objective:

             1. To determine whether a mind/body therapy (hypnotherapy) is at least as effective
                and durable, in treating urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) as a non-mind/body
                treatment (pharmacotherapy) by comparing change in urinary incontinence episodes
                recorded on voiding diaries between groups using a non-inferiority design.

             2. To determine whether hypnotherapy treatment of UUI (urgency urinary incontinence)
                is associated with greater modification of brain activation and connectivity on
                functional MRI than that which occurs following pharmacotherapy

        2. Secondary Objectives:

             1. To determine whether a mind/body therapy (hypnotherapy) is at least as effective
                and durable, in treating urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) as a non-mind/body
                treatment (pharmacotherapy) comparing change in questionnaire results as well as
                urinary frequency and pad counts recorded on voiding diaries

             2. To determine the baseline occurrence of concomitant syndromes such as irritable
                bowel syndrome or other bowel symptoms such as constipation or anal incontinence
                or painful bladder syndrome in this population of women with UUI based on the
                medical history  and questionnaires. We will explore whether there is a difference
                in irritable bowel and other bowel symptoms and IC symptoms following treatment if
                there are sufficient numbers of women with pain and IC at baseline.

             3. To confirm differences in brain activation and connectivity on functional MRI in
                UUI subjects compared to normative controls.

      Overview:

        1. Women with UUI who meet inclusion criteria and who choose to participate in the study
           will be enrolled by the University of New Mexico Urogynecology Division. Investigators
           will screen subjects for study entry based on voiding diaries to ensure that subjects
           have UUI and with a screening questionnaire, the OAB Awareness tool.Subjects will be
           randomized to treatment with either: 1) Pharmacotherapy, a standard therapy for UUI,
           and conventional behavioral therapy or 2) Hypnotherapy and conventional behavioral
           therapy. All subjects will give signed informed consent prior to study treatment. One
           hundred fifty-two women will be randomized to hypnotherapy or to pharmacotherapy. Study
           participation for these UUI subjects will be approximately 1 year; Measurements will be
           performed prior to treatment, following completion of treatment visits (treatment
           visits are performed over 8 weeks), and again at 6 and 12 months.  The primary analysis
           of the RCT will be performed as an intention to treat analysis. A secondary analysis
           will be performed as a per protocol analysis.

        2. A subset of approximately 60 subjects with UUI (drawn from both treatment groups) will
           have brain fMRIs performed at baseline and follow-up. Approximately 20 normative
           controls will also undergo an fMRI to compare fMRI in affected women versus unaffected
           controls. Measured outcomes will be differences in baseline brain activation during
           bladder filling and in resting brain connectivity in UUI subjects compared to controls
           as well as differences in treatment effect on brain activation and connectivity in
           subjects receiving pharmacotherapy compared to those receiving hypnotherapy. Study
           participants will be randomized to either pharmacotherapy or hypnotherapy groups using
           a computer-generated randomization scheme in varying permuted block sizes.
           Investigators involved in analyzing fMRI results, investigators analyzing the RCT
           results and study personnel performing data entry will be blinded to knowledge of
           subjects' treatment groups. Blinding of subjects to treatment is not feasible.

      Visits for Study:

      1)UUI study subjects Screening: Subjects who are interested in study participation will be
      given information about the study and administered a screening questionnaire and be given
      the opportunity to consider carefully whether they would like to participate in the study
      Visit 1: Enrollment-- All subjects; Will be formally screened for eligibility prior to
      signing the consent. (1) If eligible, written consent to participate will be obtained (2)
      Will be administered the study questionnaires (3) Answer demographic questions and questions
      about their past medical history(4) Undergo a Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantitation (POP-Q)
      exam if they have not had one performed in the last year. Subjects will have cystometry
      scheduled (5) Voiding diary will be reviewed (6) Subjects who are willing and able to
      undergo fMRI will be screened and scheduled for that study (7) Behavioral interventions, a
      standard treatment for urgency incontinence, will be discussed with all subjects and a
      hand-out will be given to all subjects and arrangements for future contact with subjects
      will be made.

      Visit 2: Cystometry will be performed (see Visit 1). Subjects who will undergo fMRI will
      also undergo a brief simulation of the fMRI tasks at this time, filling and emptying the
      bladder. Subjects will undergo hypnotic susceptibility testing at this visit if at all
      feasible (if not feasible, this will be performed at a separate visit prior to
      randomization).

      Visit 3 for fMRI Subjects: The baseline fMRI will be performed Randomization: The subjects
      will be randomized to treatment interventions and contacted by the study personnel and
      arrangements made for their interventions

      Visits 3-10 for Hypnotherapy Treatments for those who did not undergo fMRI, Visits 4-11 for
      those who did undergo fMRI: Hypnotherapy sessions--Subjects assigned to hypnotherapy will be
      scheduled for these visits which will be performed by a certified clinical hypnotherapist.
      The subjects will have hypnotherapy sessions scheduled approximately weekly over 8 weeks.

      Visits 3-10 for Pharmacotherapy Treatments for those who did not undergo fMRI, Visits 4-11
      for those who did undergo fMRI--Medication Counseling Session: Subjects assigned to
      pharmacotherapy will be scheduled for these visits which will be performed by trained
      research personnel. The subjects will have pharmacotherapy counseling sessions scheduled
      approximately weekly over 8 weeks.

      Visit 12—follow-up fMRI testing (for the fMRI group): Follow-up fMRI will be performed on
      subjects who had baseline fMRIs performed.

      Post Therapy visit--Visit 11 (for those who did not undergo fMRIs) or Visit 13 (for those
      who did undergo fMRI): This study visit will be scheduled at the end of the hypnotherapy or
      medication counseling sessions. Those who are in the subgroup who have undergone prior fMRI
      testing will have it performed following completion of their active interventions. At the
      final study visit, subjects will 1) be administered study questionnaires 2) They will return
      their follow-up voiding diary

      6 and 12 month follow-up visits may be conducted via phone or mail. Pharmacotherapy subjects
      will continue to receive their medications for 1 year and Hypnotherapy subjects will be
      encouraged to continue self-hypnosis with the aid of hypnotherapy recordings for 1 year.

      2)Normative Controls participating in only the FMRI study: will be screened to ensure they
      do not suffer from OAB and will give written informed consent. They will undergo a Pelvic
      Organ Quantitation Exam, answer demographic questions and undergo cystometric testing and a
      brief simulation of the fMRI tasks; filling and emptying the bladder. They will then have
      their fMRI performed at a separate visit.

      Description of Interventions:

        1. Hypnotherapy:Hypnotherapy will be administered over 8 weeks by certified, trained
           clinical hypnotherapists. The subjects will be informed that sessions will be
           audio-recorded and one or more sessions will be reviewed by study personnel to ensure
           that the hypnotherapist administers the hypnotherapy session in a standardized fashion.
           Subjects will receive or download a digital recording specially prepared for them to
           for home practice of hypnotherapy sessions. They will be encouraged to listen to the
           CD/digital recording daily for one year.

        2. Pharmacotherapy:Pharmacotherapy counseling sessions will be administered over 8 weeks
           by trained research personnel. Subjects will be scheduled for visits with the
           medication counselor who will review medications and their side effects. Subjects will
           be informed that sessions will be audio-recorded and one or more sessions will be
           reviewed by study personnel to ensure that the counseling is delivered in a
           standardized fashion.If subjects state that in person visits are burdensome, these
           visits may occur via phone. The study will use either of two standard, long acting
           anti-cholinergic medications and dosages (Long acting Tolterodine or Extended Release
           Oxybutynin or their equivalent generic substitutes). Following the 8 weeks of therapy
           as described previously, subjects will continue to take their anti-cholinergic
           medications or one year.

      Description of Functional MRI:

        1. FMRI Data Acquisition: High resolution T1 [TE (echo time) = 1.64 ms, TR (repetition
           time) = 2.53 s, 7° flip angle, number of excitations (NEX) = 1, slice thickness = 1 mm,
           FOV (field of view) = 256 mm, resolution = 256 x 256] anatomic images will be collected
           at the beginning of each experiment. For each of the FMRI tasks, echo-planar images
           will be collected using a single-shot, gradient-echo

        2. FMRI Subject and Task: Study participants will complete two tasks while undergoing
           FMRI. Presentation software will be programmed to control stimulus presentation,
           synchronize stimulus events with the scanner and collect response data for offline
           analyses. To minimize neuronal activation associated with eye movements, subjects will
           be instructed to maintain visual fixation throughout all trials on the centrally
           presented cross. An eye-tracking device will be used to record saccades during the
           experiment. Subjects will be scanned while undergoing bladder filling and emptying.

        3. FMRI Image Processing: Preprocessing steps of fMRI data obtained during both tasks will
           include slice correction, temporal auto-correlations correction and motion correction.
           For task A, a voxel-wise multiple regression analysis will be used to estimate the beta
           weights corresponding to the functional activation resulting from each of the separate
           conditions. The multiple regression will contain one individually tailored demeaned
           regressor corresponding to each individual subject's urge to void (urge regressor). The
           urge regressor will resemble a step function, with each button press signaling the
           onset of either increasing or decreasing subjective levels of urge to void. The
           resulting step functions will then be convolved with a gamma variate function derived
           from known parameters of the hemodynamic response. In addition, a regressor
           corresponding to the inflation and the deflation of the bladder will be created by
           convolving the experimental time-course with a gamma variate function. Connectivity
           analysis will be performed using data from the extended resting task (unrelated to
           bladder filling/withdrawal) Functional connectivity will be measured between specific
           points and the remainder of the brain (i.e. whole brain analysis) as in our pilot
           study. Averaged individual residualized time-courses from these spheres will be the
           primary regressor in whole-brain BOLD connectivity analyses. Resultant Pearson's
           correlation coefficients will then be converted to z-scores using Fisher's method and
           blurred using a 10 mm Gaussian kernel &amp; contrasted across the two groups using
           independent sample T-tests Statistical Analysis

             1. Specific Aim 1:

                Investigators performed sample size calculations for change in UUI episodes and
                change in OABq-SF scores based on investigators' pilot data &amp; urgency incontinence
                literature.6,7 The study design will use a non-inferiority design to compare the
                primary outcome (change in UUI episodes in the hypnotherapy versus pharmacotherapy
                groups). With respect to the outcome variable of percent reduction in UUI episodes
                as determined by bladder diaries,investigators will use a one-sided
                non-inferiority test at level alpha = 0.25 and a non-inferiority margin of 5%. If
                μ_h is the population mean percent reduction in incontinent episodes for the
                hypnotherapy group, and μ_m is the population mean percent reduction in
                incontinent episodes for the medications group,investigators will then test
                H_0:μ_h-μ_m≤-5 against the one-sided alternative H_0:μ_h-μ_m&gt;-5  using
                significance level 0.025. If the null hypothesis is rejected then investigators
                may conclude hypnotherapy is not inferior to medication therapy, on average, by
                more than 5%, and in fact may be superior to medication therapy, with respect to
                percent reduction in incontinent episodes. The test may be performed by computing
                the lower 97.5% one-sided confidence bound for μ_h-μ_m. If the lower confidence
                bound exceeds -5% investigators will conclude non-inferiority of hypnotherapy.
                Should that lower bound exceed zero investigators will conclude superiority.
                Assuming a subject drop-out, withdrawal and missing data rate as high as 33%, 52
                subjects will be available for analysis in both hypnotherapy and medications
                groups. If μ_h-μ_m≥9%, this sample size would provide power ≥ 80% for the
                non-inferiority test. Improvement between hypnotherapy and controls will be
                compared at baseline and follow-up at 2, 6, 12 months. Parameters will be compared
                using a generalized linear mixed model analysis. If baseline differences between
                groups are found (e.g. incontinence severity, coexisting illnesses, prior
                treatment), appropriate variables will be added to the analysis as covariates.
                Primary analyses will be performed using intention to treat. A per protocol
                analysis will also be performed. Similar analyses will be performed comparing
                group differences in change in questionnaire scores while accounting for other
                covariates such as pain/interstitial cystitis or bowel abnormalities

             2. Specific Aim 2.1 (Normative controls vs. urgency incontinence subjects):

                Regions of interest containing the insula and anterior cingulate cortex will be
                analyzed in keeping with the a priori hypothesis using two way ANCOVA with group
                as the between subject's factor and age as a covariate. Pre-treatment β weights
                for both bladder filling and urgency regressor effect on anterior cingulate cortex
                and insula signal among normative subjects will be compared to the effect on
                signal in urgency incontinence subjects. The planned study size allows detection
                of differences between groups with an effect size &gt;0.8 with power of 0.8, smaller
                than the observed effect size in the pilot study.43 The effect size observed in
                the pilot study (Cohen's d ranged from 0.8 to 1.5) suggests that the study will be
                adequately powered (greater than 0.8) to reject the null hypothesis at an
                alpha=0.05. In addition to analysis of prior regions of interest, group wise whole
                brain contrast will also be performed using an identical statistical model. False
                positives will be corrected at a significance threshold corresponding to p &lt;.005
                applied in combination with a minimum cluster size threshold of 32 native voxels
                (p &lt; 0.05), parameters derived from 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations.80 Analysis of
                between group differences in functional connectivity will be performed in a
                similar fashion to that used to analyze brain activation evoked by bladder filling
                and emptying. The large observed effect size in the preliminary data (&gt;3) suggests
                that the sample size used for proposed analysis of evoked potentials will be more
                than adequate.

             3. Specific Aim 2.2 Efficacy of hypnotherapy and pharmacotherapy on anterior
                cingulate cortex and right insula activation will be compared using a 2x2 (Group x
                Time) mixed model ANCOVA to correct for potential differences in group
                characteristics (e.g. age). Analysis of treatment effect will be focused on the
                anterior cingulate cortex and insula based on preliminary data that suggests the
                effect size for change in activation will be highest in these regions. Current
                study size will be able to detect differences between pre and post treatment
                signal within a treatment group with an effect size of approximately 0.5 and a
                power of 0.8. Minimal effect size would be approximately equivalent to a 60%
                decrease in the excess (above normative control) anterior cingulate cortex and
                insula signal. Investigators predict a main effect of time, suggesting that both
                treatments are effective in reducing activity within the anterior cingulate cortex
                and insula. However, investigators also predict a significant Group x Time
                interaction, indicating that that change in activity will be greater for the
                hypnotherapy relative to the pharmacotherapy group. Minimum detectable effect size
                for the Group X Time interaction is 0.7 with power of 0.8 and alpha of 0.05.
                Simple effects tests will also be conducted to ensure that randomization to
                treatment arm was successful (i.e. no differences in baseline activity across the
                two groups).

      Similar analyses will be conducted to evaluate the effect of treatment on functional
      connectivity. Current study size will be able to detect within-group differences between pre
      and post treatment signal with a minimal effect size of approximately 0.5 and a power of
      0.8, much lower than the observed effect size of &gt;3 in the pilot study. The minimum effect
      size would be reached with a 15% decrement in anterior cingulate cortex to insula
      connectivity. As for evoked activity investigators predict both a main effect of time, and
      predict a significant Group x Time interaction, indicating that change in functional
      connectivity will be greater for the hypnotherapy relative to the pharmacotherapy group.
      Minimum detectable effect size for the Group X Time interaction is 0.7 with power of 0.8 and
      alpha of 0.05.This minimum effect size will be reached when between group differences in
      anterior cingulate cortex to insula connectivity are ≥ 30%.

      Missing Data:

      Standard procedures will be used to ensure that data are as complete and accurate as
      possible. In order to decrease missing data, data collection forms will be designed for
      recording measurements and the Redcap (Research Electronic Data Capture) System will be used
      by the research staff for data management. Study personnel will check the data collection
      forms for completeness before study participants leave the clinic so that missing clinical
      information may be addressed while study participants are still in the clinic. Downloads
      will be performed to check for missing values and skipped entries using SAS® programming and
      will be designed to avoid skipped entries and allow flagging of missing data. For
      individuals that withdraw from the study or have missing visits, investigators will collect
      information on the reasons for those missed visits. That information, coupled with data
      collected from earlier visits will be used to develop comparisons of the two treatment arms
      using pattern mixture models. Investigators will use multiple imputation based on a model
      conditional on baseline covariates, treatment group, and the previous measures. Separate
      imputation models will be used for the two groups.

      Data management: Data will be collected on CRFs approved by the UNMH HRPO including
      demographic and patient history forms, eligibility forms, questionnaires, Cystometrics and
      fMRI task data sheets, pharmacotherapy side effect and hypnotherapy practice logs, treatment
      compliance logs as well as forms related to adverse event tracking. As noted above data base
      has been constructed using the web-based platform, REDCap® The study's data entry personnel
      will receive only coded information that is entered into the database under those
      identification numbers. A separate log linking patient codes and unique patient identifiers
      will be kept on password protected computer available only to study personnel. CRFs will
      include forms used to collect subject information including demographic, medical history
      forms, questionnaires, compliance forms, fMRI screening forms, inclusion and exclusion
      criteria forms as well as patient behavioral therapy instruction handouts. The Mind Research
      Network (MRN) investigators (investigators responsible for performing the fMRIs) will
      collect data using standardized paper forms or digitally. Data will only be identified with
      the study's unique identifier (ID) for the participant. The link between the name of the
      participant and the study ID will be kept confidential by the MRN on a secure portal. All
      data storage devices at the Mind Research Network are encrypted devices. Personally
      identifying information will not be stored in files on networked computers and paper forms.
      Such information will be kept in separate locked file cabinets. Electronic data are doubly
      protected against computer catastrophe. Data will be backed up daily. The backup system will
      be used only by a designated administrator, preventing accidental deletion even by project
      staff.

      Quality Control

        1. RCT outcomes:

           a) Research study members who distribute and evaluate the voiding diary(s) will
           complete a training and certification process b) Research study members who distribute
           the treatment compliance and expectation questions will be trained and certified on
           their administration and interpretation

        2. FMRI outcomes:

           BOLD-related evoked activity and functional connectivity maps will both undergo
           extensive QA procedures.

             1. The transformation matrix registering each subject's functional data to structural
                space will be visualized for accuracy (for both the evoked and resting state data)

             2. Raw images will be examined for excessive motion as well as artifacts. In
                addition, the degree of motion will also be quantified for each individual based
                on the first two statistical moments from the cohort using previously published
                algorithms at the end of the study

             3. Investigators will examine the fit of different modeling parameters on a
                per-subject basis.

        3. Description of Plan for Data Quality and Management and Data Collection Forms: The
           study staff under the over site of the PIs will review data collection forms on an
           ongoing basis for data completeness and accuracy as well as protocol compliance. Data
           verification will be performed by personnel other than the individual performing data
           entry onto the database on 10% of data collected. The results of the data review will
           be incorporated into the reports for each DSMB meeting and in the Annual Report. Data
           collection forms will be maintained as part of Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Research
           coordinator will review data collection forms for completeness.
