            "textblock": "Although lowering cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) is the\n      mainstay of medical therapy for cardiovascular event prevention, evidence from clinical\n      trials supports a role for elevated triglyceride (TG) and low high-density lipoprotein\n      cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations in the residual cardiovascular risk on statin treatment.\n      Fenofibrate is the most commonly used agent to control hypertriglyceridemia as monotherapy\n      or combining with statin, which lowers TG and raises HDL-C through multifaceted mechanism by\n      PPAR\u03b1 activation. However, safety of coadministration of statin with fenofibrate has been a\n      great concern, especially drug-induced hepatotoxicity when they are combined used. Coenzyme\n      A (CoA) functions as an acyl group carrier and assists in transferring fatty acids from the\n      cytoplasm to mitochondria. It is also involved in the oxidation and catabolism of fatty\n      acids. Animal studies have proved its lipid-lowering effects. In a previous multicenter\n      study we conducted in 2008, it was found that oral CoA 400U/d effectively lowered serum TG\n      levels in hypertriglyceridemia patients without increasing adverse effects when compared\n      with placebo. So, the present study was performed to further investigate the lipid-lowing\n      effects and safety of CoA capsule combined with statin in dyslipidemia patients."
