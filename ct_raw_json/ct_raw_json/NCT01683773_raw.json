The purpose of this trial is to assess what happens when both of these\n      vaccines are given one after the other. The trial will assess the safety of both vaccines\n      and also their ability to stimulate an immune response within the body. It is hoped that\n      when these two vaccines are given in sequence, the combined immune response is even better\n      than when each vaccine is used individually."
