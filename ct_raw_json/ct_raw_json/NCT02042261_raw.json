This concept is defined as therapeutic drug\n      monitoring (TDM).\n\n      In this pilot study our hypothesis is that the ratio between MIC and drug concentration data\n      is correlated to the bacterial load measured as time to positive liquid culture (TTP).\n\n      In two sites in Sweden, 25 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis will be recruited.\n      MIC-determination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis will be performed in BACTEC 960 MGIT and\n      drug concentration will be determined at 2, 4 and 12 weeks after treatment initiation using\n      LC-MS/MS methodology. Sputum cultures will be obtained at 0, 2 days, 7 days, 2 weeks, 4\n      weeks and 8 weeks and TTP will be measured in duplicate samples."
