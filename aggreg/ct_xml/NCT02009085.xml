  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study a fluorescent contrast dye is applied to a suspicious skin lesion.

      Images are acquired and processed. The information is used to develop a prediction model for
      the presence of malignant transformation in the skin.

    <description>Patients are imaged and then undergo a biopsy. Images are used to develop a software predicting model based on pathology. Sensitivity and specificity parameters are calculated.
No long term follow up is required since the biopsy is performed on the skin imaged. The follow up required is for the pathology for the skin excised.</description>
