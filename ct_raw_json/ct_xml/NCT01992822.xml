    <textblock>
      The principal study aims at evaluating the efficiency of rTMS maintenance sessions on the
      clinical effect of a rTMS cure in fibromyalgic subjects. This complementary study consists
      in the evaluation of the experimental sensitivity to mechanical pain (pressure application
      on the forearm) of subjects presenting fibromyalgia before and after rTMS treatment (21
      days), and to put the results in relation to the clinical improvement and the psychometric
      evaluations (depression,fibromyalgia impact questionnaire, catastrophism).
