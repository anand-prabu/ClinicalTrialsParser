Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow doctors to give\n      higher doses of chemotherapy and kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by\n      peripheral stem cell transplantation or bone marrow transplantation in treating patients who\n      have relapsed or recurrent germ cell cancer."

Patients\n      receive carboplatin IV continuously and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days -5 through -3.\n      Autologous PBSC or bone marrow is reinfused on day 0.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study."
