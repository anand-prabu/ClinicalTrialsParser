            "textblock": "In the highly technological environment of the modern neonatal intensive care unit (NICU),\n      the infant is physically, psychologically and emotionally separated from its parents.\n      Recognition that this impedes parent- infant interaction and is detrimental to the infant,\n      led to the development of programs such as family centered care, kangaroo care and\n      skin-to-skin care1-3. However, they are based on the common premise that only NICU\n      professionals with special skills can provide care for the infant. Parents are relegated to\n      a supportive role, and some have described themselves as voyeurs who are \"allowed\" to visit\n      and hold their infants4. Many feel anxious and unprepared to care for their infants after\n      discharge5.\n\n      In 1979, a shortage of NICU nurses in Estonia prompted Levin1,6 to implement a \"humane\" care\n      model in which parents provided nursing care for the infant (except for administration of IV\n      fluid and medication), while nurses provided teaching and guidance to parents. This resulted\n      in 30% improvement in weight gain1,30% reduction in infections, 20% reduction in NICU length\n      of stay, 50% reduction in nurse utilization and overall improved satisfaction among parents\n      and staff [personal communication, Levin,A.]. Building on the Estonian experience, we have\n      developed a new Family Integrated Care (FIC) model that is adapted for the NICU environment\n      in North America. In a pilot study at Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto 46 infants and their\n      families were enrolled in the study. Preliminary results and feedback from parents and\n      healthcare providers (HCP) show that the FIC model is both feasible and safe, and may lead\n      to improved outcomes including improved weight gain(paper submitted for publication). This\n      study is a cluster randomized controlled trial in 16 tertiary level NICUs, to evaluate the\n      efficacy of the FIC model in Canada."
