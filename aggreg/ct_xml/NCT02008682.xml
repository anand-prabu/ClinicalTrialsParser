    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia. The aim of this trial is to investigate the efficacy and
      safety of liraglutide compared to sitagliptin, both as add-on to metformin in Chinese
      subjects with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy. Eligible
      subjects will continue their metformin background treatment during the trial.
