      To determine whether low-dose (LD) CT is noninferior to standard-dose (SD) computed
      tomography (CT) as the first-line imaging test in adolescents and young adults in regard to
      negative appendectomy rate (NAR).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Acute appendicitis is a very common disease. Many patients are adolescents or young
           adults.

        -  CT is the current standard imaging test for the diagnosis of appendicitis.

        -  In recent years, the awareness of carcinogenic risk associated with CT radiation has
           increased.

        -  According to a recent single-institutional randomized controlled trial, LD CT
           (employing a quarter of standard radiation dose) was found to be noninferior to SD CT
           with respect to NARs in adolescents and young adults with suspected appendicitis.

        -  However, LD CT is not yet widely accepted.

        -  To establish LD CT as the first-line imaging test, a multi-institutional study is
           needed to confirm the generalizability of the prior single-institutional study.

    <description>Negative appendectomy rate is defined as the percentage of negative (unnecessary) appendectomies out of all non-incidental appendectomies. As a secondary analysis, negative appendectomy rate in an alternative definition is calculated by excluding cases with appendiceal neoplasms without superimposed appendicitis, as appendectomy would be clinically necessary in such patients. Any surgery performed for the treatment of presumed appendicitis is counted as non-incidental appendectomy, even though the surgical procedures may be more extensive than simple appendectomy (e.g., ileocectomy).</description>

    <description>Area under receiver-operating-characteristic curve.
Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity: for calculation of the sensitivity and specificity, the 5-grade likelihood scores for appendicitis are collapsed into binary responses with a decision threshold of a score â‰¥ 3 as positive for the diagnosis. This decision threshold is based on the fact that appendicitis is actually present in 13-73% of patients with CT scans interpreted as equivocal and that appendiceal perforation as a consequence of a false-negative diagnosis is considered more harmful to patients than a negative appendectomy as a consequence of a false-positive diagnosis.</description>
