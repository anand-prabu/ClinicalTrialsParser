Physician based (according to GINA 2011) diagnosis of asthma for at least 6 months\n             prior to the date informed consent is obtained and confirmed by 1 of the detailed\n             respiratory criteria stated in the CSP\n\n          3. Morning prebronchodilator (ie, after abstinence from short-acting and long-acting\n             \u00df-agonist treatment for \u2265 6 and \u2265 12 hours, respectively) FEV1 of \u226570% of predicted\n             normal (PN) for age, sex and height at enrolment\n\n          4. Increased number of neutrophils in induced sputum samples at baseline, with a\n             relative neutrophil count of  \u2265 50% of total sputum cell count\n\n          5. Physician prescribed daily use of medium or high dose ICS (\u2265 fluticasone 250 \u03bcg to \u2264\n             1.000 \u00b5g or the equivalent daily, as defined in GINA 2011; see CSP Appendix E) plus\n             LABA.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1.
