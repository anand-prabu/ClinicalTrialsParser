            "textblock": "Depression is common, with one-year prevalence rates of major depressive disorder (MDD)\n      estimated to be between 6.6-10.3% in the general population. Depression imposes a very high\n      societal burden in terms of cost, morbidity, suffering, and mortality.  Research has\n      consistently found psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy to be equivalent in efficacy, however,\n      primary care patients have consistently been shown to prefer psychotherapy or counseling to\n      pharmacotherapy.  Yet only about 20% of all patients referred for psychotherapy ever enter\n      treatment and of those who initiate treatment, nearly half drop out before completion.  This\n      suggests that there are significant barriers to receiving psychotherapy.  Indeed, 75% of\n      depressed primary care patients identify one or more practical barriers that prevent them\n      from accessing psychotherapy.\n\n      The need to develop treatments that can be delivered via telecommunications technologies has\n      frequently been voiced.   The internet promises to provide inexpensive access to treatment\n      at any time of the day or night. In addition internet interventions are very scalable and\n      fidelity in clinical implementation should be excellent, since a website tested in a\n      randomized controlled trial (RCT) can be delivered thereafter without alterations.\n      Unfortunately, the potential for internet delivered services has not been realized.  Studies\n      examining treatments that simply provide access to an internet site commonly result in very\n      high dropout after the first site visit, and typically little or no improvement target\n      symptoms.  To mitigate these problems, investigators have examined whether providing support\n      via email or brief calls from research assistants can increase adherence. Both have shown\n      promise in increasing adherence. Another type of support recently being investigated is the\n      use of social networks where participants encourage each other to adhere to the\n      intervention.\n\n      The investigators are developing an intervention that utilizes multiple telecommunications\n      technologies to improve mental health care access for individuals with depression.  The\n      intervention uses an interactive website, e-mail and an online social network.\n\n      The objective of this study is to examine\n\n        1. To collect pilot data on the efficacy of a web-based intervention with a social network\n           to reduce symptoms of depression\n\n        2. To collect pilot data on adherence and usability of the web intervention.\n\n        3. To collect field trial data on the efficacy of web-based interventions on assertiveness\n           and depression."
