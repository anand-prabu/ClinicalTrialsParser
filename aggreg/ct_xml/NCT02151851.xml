      This study will evaluate the safety &amp; efficacy of Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) as additional
      medication to Methotrexate (MTX) in Chinese subjects with Rheumatoid Arthritis. 400 patients
      will be randomized to receive either CZP + MTX or placebo + MTX. Anticipated time in the
      study is about 32 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group,
      randomized, 24-week study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) as
      additional medication to Methotrexate (MTX) in Chinese subjects with active Rheumatoid
      Arthritis (RA) who have an incomplete response to Methotrexate. This study is designed to
      determine whether CZP 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2, and 4 followed by CZP 200 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W)
      in combination with MTX demonstrates superiority, in terms of greater improvement in relief
      of the signs and symptoms of RA, compared with MTX alone. Approximately 535 subjects will be
      screened to randomize 400 subjects into this study, at approximately 25 centers in the
      People's Republic of China.  There will be 2 treatment groups, with 300 subjects in the
      CZP+MTX group and 100 subjects in the PBO+MTX group. For each subject, the study duration
      will last a maximum of approximately 38 weeks. Subjects who complete study RA0044 and
      subjects who fail to achieve an American College of Rheumatology 20 % Response Criteria
      (ACR20) response at Week 12 that is confirmed at Week 14 and thus are withdrawn from this
      study at Week 16, are permitted to receive treatment with CZP in the open-label extension
      study, RA0078. The secondary objectives are to assess the dose regimen of CZP in combination
      with MTX compared with MTX alone in the safety and tolerability, ability to improve physical
      function, and health outcomes measures in Chinese subjects with active RA; also to
      characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and immunogenicity of CZP in combination with
      MTX.

The change from Baseline in HAQ-DI at Week 24 will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment as a factor and Baseline value as a covariate.</description>
