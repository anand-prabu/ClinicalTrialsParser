However the modalities and the impact of this multimodal\n           approach at a national level are unknown Primary objective: To identify predictors of\n           recurrence after esophageal cancer surgery\n\n      Secondary objectives :\n\n        -  5-year recurrence free survival\n\n        -  5-year overall survival\n\n        -  Predictors of postoperative mortality and mobidity after surgery\n\n        -  Impact of pCR on recurrence and survival\n\n        -  Impact of neoadjuvant treatments on recurrence and survival\n\n        -  Impact of patient preconditioning (such as nutritional support, esophageal prosthesis,\n           mini-invasive approach\u2026) on outcomes\n\n      Methodology : European French-speaking retrospective multicentric study Inclusion criteria:\n      All consecutive patients operated on, for a histologically proven carcinoma of the\n      esophagus, the esogastric junction (Siewert type I and II), in surgical investigator centers\n      between January 2000 and December 2010 Exclusion criteria:  Siewert III type carcinoma of\n      the esogastric junction , non surgical treatment of esophageal carcinoma Planned study\n      period:  The data will be collected over a 11-year period from January 2000 to December\n      2010. Follow up will be ascertained in May 2013."
