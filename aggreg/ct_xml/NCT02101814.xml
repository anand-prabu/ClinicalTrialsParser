  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity is steadily growing in many parts of the world in order to reach
      epidemic proportions. Changes in signaling pathways state of hunger and satiety contribute
      to the increase in obesity and metabolic syndrome. Currently, the white adipose tissue, also
      is considered a secretory tissue by producing numerous adipokines involved in a chronic
      state of inflammation, which may interfere with the neuroendocrine regulation of energy
      balance that affect the weight loss process. The bariatric surgery is recommended as the
      most effective tool in the treatment and control of morbid obesity. The study population
      will consist of patients undergoing bariatric surgery of type Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The
      study was performed in Clinical Hospital of the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR). This is
      a prospective cohort study with follow up of 6 and 24 months. The aim of this study is to
      assess the effects of weight loss after bariatric surgery associated anthropometric
      characteristic, metabolic changes (glucose, cholesterol profile,hepatic enzymes, Fibroblast
      growth factor- 21(FGF-21), blood pressure), the profile of adipokines pro/anti-inflammatory
      (adiponectin, interleukin-6 (IL-6),interleukin-10 (IL-10), C reactive protein (CRP),
      plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α),
      intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), resistin, frizzled-related protein 5 (SFrp5) and
      neuroendocrine regulation of energy balance (leptin, neuropeptide Y (NPY) , alpha-melanocyte
      stimulating hormone (α-MSH), melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and agouti-related peptide
      (AgRP), as well as the quality of life in obese adults.
