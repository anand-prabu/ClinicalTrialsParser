This one gene makes NHE proteins that control how we learn and remember items,\n      which is impaired in ADHD and may cause an inability to  plan, prioritize,\n      self-monitor,inihibit, initiate, self-correct, or control one's behavior. The investigators\n      now propose to investigate the therapeutic utility of an NHE inhibitor, amiloride\n      hydrochloride, for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in\n      medication-na\u00efve adults with ADHD."

Hypothesis 1: Amiloride will reduce scores on our\n      primary outcome measure, the Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Investigator\n      Symptom Rating Scale (AISRS) and on our secondary outcome, the ADHD specific Clinical Global\n      Impressions (CGI) improvement scale.  Hypothesis 2: Amiloride will be well tolerated and\n      will have few side effects in adults with ADHD.\n\n      Exploratory Aim 2: Assess effects of amiloride on ADHD-associated clinical features. We will\n      also assess, in an exploratory manner, the effect of amiloride on two clinical features that\n      are not well treated by current ADHD medications: deficits in emotional self-regulation\n      (DESR) and executive function deficit (EFD).  Hypothesis 3 predicts that amiloride treatment\n      will reduce symptoms of DESR and of EFD.\n\n      We will recruit 40 adults who are diagnosed with ADHD in a double blind placebo controlled\n      study. 20 subjects will receive amiloride hydrochloride and 20 subjects will receive placebo\n      for 8 weeks. Participation in the study requires subjects to meet with the physician for a\n      screening visit, baseline visit and 8 additional weekly visits."
