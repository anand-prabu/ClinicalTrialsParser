Bowel ultrasound is an emerging\n      technology for bowel assessment and offers several advantages over MRE, including lower\n      cost, shorter exam time, and lack of need for sedation and contrast materials and bowel\n      medication.  The researchers goal is to assess the accuracy of bowel ultrasound in the\n      follow-up of known pediatric small bowel Crohn disease using MRE and the reference standard."

In addition to the MultiHance, the subject will be given an oral contrast medication called VoLumen to drink approximately 45 minutes before the MRE imaging is started.  These medications are used for all clinically necessary MRE studies performed in children and adults at the UMHS.  The MRE will take approximately 50 to 60 minutes to complete.",
