To ensure home access to PREPARE content, participants will be given a website login and PREPARE content in digital video disc (DVD), booklet, and pamphlet format as well as the action plan and AD. One to three days before a primary care visit, the PREPARE arm will receive a reminder to come to their appointment and to bring their action plan."

It is written at a 5th grade level and includes\n      voice-overs of text and closed captioning of videos that model advance care planning\n      behaviors. The goal of this proposal is to test the efficacy of PREPARE plus an easy-to-read\n      advance directive, versus an advance directive alone, to improve patient engagement in\n      multiple advance care planning behaviors including discussions with surrogate decision\n      makers and clinicians in addition to advance directive completion. The investigators will\n      also determine whether PREPARE can empower and activate patients within clinical encounters\n      with their clinicians and help to decrease health disparities in advance care planning."
