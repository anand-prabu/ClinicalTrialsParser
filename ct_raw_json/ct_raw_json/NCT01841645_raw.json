A CLA depletion-repletion\n      study was carried out with healthy volunteers. CLA depletion was achieved through an\n      eight-week dairy fat restriction, followed by an eight-week repletion period consisting of\n      intake of a butter naturally enriched with CLA. Changes in body composition, fasting glucose\n      and insulin, inflammatory mediators, cell membranes' stability, plasma lipid levels and\n      fatty acid composition of lipid classes are evaluated after depletion and repletion phases."
