The intervention,\n      known as the Mfangano Health Net Microclinic Pilot Program, consists of a 6-month education\n      program on HIV biology, interpersonal communication and community mobilization for both HIV\n      positive individuals and their self-selected social network members selected irrespective of\n      HIV status.  Investigators hypothesize that participation in the microclinic program will\n      improve ART adherence, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count, social support, HIV\n      knowledge and food insecurity and will reduce HIV-related stigma, as compared to\n      participants in control communities."
