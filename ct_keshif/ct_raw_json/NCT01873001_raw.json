The study consists of a\n      screening phase, an open-label treatment phase consisting of 2 single-dose treatment\n      periods, end-of-study or withdrawal assessments done upon completion of the 72-hour\n      pharmacokinetic sampling on Day 11 of Period 2 or upon withdrawal, and a follow-up visit 5\n      to 7 days after the last study procedure. The total study length is 32 days. Participants\n      will receive pioglitazone alone on Day 1 (Period 1) of the study. On Day 8 (Period 2),\n      participants will receive a single dose of abiraterone acetate followed by a single dose of\n      pioglitazone one hour later. Successive pioglitazone administrations will be separated by a\n      washout period of 7 days. Participants will be confined to the study center from Day -1 to\n      Day 4 of Period 1 and from Day 7 to Day 11 of Period 2, at least 10 hours before each study\n      drug administration until completion of the 72-hour blood sample collection for each period.\n      A pharmacogenomic blood sample will be collected from all participants on Day -1. Safety\n      will be monitored throughout the study."
