            "textblock": "Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection, with more than 50% of\n      young women infected within  few years of initiatiing sexual activity. Persistent infection\n      with high risk HPV types is known to cause cervical cancer among other tumors and genital\n      warts. Cervical cancer and its precancerous lesions, genital warts are more common among\n      HIV-1 infected individuals, among whom, cancer occurs at an earlier age and progresses more\n      quickly.\n\n      The HPV 'Gardasil'vaccine has been tested widely among HIV-1 negative persons demonstrating\n      high efficacy and safety profiles, it is widely registered for use across continents.\n      However, there is minimal data in HIV-1 infected persons.\n\n      For many immunizations, HIV-1 infected persons experience lower immune responses compared to\n      HIV-uninfected persons.\n\n      The investigators therefore propose to conduct a prospective study of the quadrivalent HPV\n      'Gardasil' vaccine among pre adolescent HIV infected girls and boys age 9-14 years in Kenya\n      to extend current understanding f safety and immunogenicity."
