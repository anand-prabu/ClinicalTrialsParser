            "textblock": "Postmenopausal women who have hormone receptor positive breast cancer are typically treated\n      with aromatase inhibitor medications, which substantially decrease the amount of estrogen\n      produced by their bodies. These medications are fairly well tolerated, but can cause aches\n      and pains which can be quite severe in some cases.\n\n      People experience pain differently. Estrogen appears to play a role in how we experience\n      pain. Therefore, decreasing estrogen levels may lead to more pain in some women than others.\n      The goal of this study is to evaluate perception of pain in women with breast cancer, and to\n      determine if differences in pain perception lead to more aches and pains in some women\n      treated with aromatase inhibitors.\n\n      In this study, we plan to enroll 55 women with breast cancer who are starting treatment with\n      an aromatase inhibitor. Participants will undergo testing to evaluate their perception of\n      pain, and will also complete a set of questionnaires. Testing will be conducted before\n      starting aromatase inhibitor therapy, as well as after 3 and 6 months of therapy. We will\n      investigate whether pre-existing differences in pain perception lead to different amounts of\n      pain during aromatase inhibitor therapy."
