Evaluate the\n      anti-tumor activity and the immunogenicity of this treatment regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive LMB-9 immunotoxin IV over 30\n      minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Patients with negative neutralizing antibody to LMB-9\n      immunotoxin with stable or responding disease receive additional courses every 4 weeks in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive\n      escalating doses of LMB-9 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is\n      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting\n      toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional cohort of 6 patients may be treated at\n      the MTD. Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 2 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-30 patients will be accrued within 12-24 months."
