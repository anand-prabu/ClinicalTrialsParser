  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether minimal ovarian stimulation for in vitro
      fertilization is superior to high dose stimulation. Number of mature eggs, number of embryos
      as well as pregnancy rates will be compared.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized  trial will be carried out.  The Minimal stimulation (MS) protocol
      is based on low dose letrozole 2.5 mg over 5 days, starting from cycle day 2, overlapping
      with low dose gonadotropins, starting from day 3 of the letrozole at 150 units per day. GnRH
      antagonist wil be introduced to avoid premature LH surge when one or more of the growing
      follicles reached approximately 14 mm in size. The high dose stimulation protocol is based
      on high dose of gonadotropins (≥300 IU/day) throughout the cycle with the usage of
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist to avoid premature luteinizing hormone (LH)
      surge as described above.
