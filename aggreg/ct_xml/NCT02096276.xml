    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Registry is to detect and describe any abnormal pregnancy outcomes,
      including teratogenicity, in females intentionally or unintentionally exposed to Boostrix
      during their pregnancies. The Registry requires voluntary, prospective reporting of eligible
      pregnancies by patients and health care providers (HCPs). Data such as vaccination with
      Boostrix during pregnancy or within 28 days preceding conception, potential confounding
      factors (such as exposure to other medications) and information related to the outcome of
      the pregnancy will be collected prospectively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Registry was originally initiated on 03 May 2005, as part of a program of enhanced
      pharmacovigilance. Following new European Union Pharmacovigilance legislation, pregnancy
      registries are to be considered as post-authorization safety studies (PASS). The ongoing
      Registry will therefore be converted into a PASS study.

      Exposed pregnancies reported to the Registry before the transition into a PASS (between 03
      May 2005 and Q1 2014), from which data were collected and analyzed prospectively, will also
      be included in the analyses.

      Some pregnancy exposures may be reported after pregnancy outcome has been identified
      (retrospective reports). The Registry will capture retrospective reports, but these reports
      will not be included in the analyses of prospective reports.

      Pregnancy outcome data will be collected using questionnaires within 3 months of the
      estimated date of delivery (EDD) and approximately 6 months and 12 months after the EDD (for
      all live births) to ascertain the presence of birth defects not diagnosed before, from Q1
      2014 to Q4 2018.

        Pregnant women, residing in the US, vaccinated with Boostrix during pregnancy or within 28

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A subject will be included in the Registry if all of the following criteria are met:

          -  Exposure to vaccine occurs during pregnancy or within 28 days preceding conception

          -  Subject is a US resident

          -  A HCP is identified (name, address and phone number)

          -  Subject can be identified (by GSK or HCP)

        Data from registered subjects will be included in the analyses if the following criterion
        is met:

        • Pregnancy is ongoing and the outcome is unknown

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Data from registered subjects will not be included in the analyses if the following
        criterion is met:

        • Outcome of pregnancy is known at the time of initial report. Types of known outcomes
        include prenatal testing reports in which the results are abnormal or outside the
        reference range, indicating possible abnormality in the fetus. Pregnancies in which
        prenatal testing indicates a normal pregnancy would also be excluded because inclusion of
        such pregnancies could potentially bias results toward a lower overall estimate of risk
        for defects. Typically pregnancies &gt; 16 weeks gestation will have undergone prenatal
        testing that can identify whether a child has congenital abnormalities
