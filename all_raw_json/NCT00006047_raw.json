Determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose limiting toxicity, and safety of\n      nitrocamptothecin when administered with etoposide in patients with advanced solid tumors.\n      II. Determine the changes in expression and activity of topoisomerase I and II which occur\n      during administration of this treatment regimen in these patients. III. Determine the plasma\n      pharmacokinetics of this treatment regimen in these patients. IV. Compare the hematologic\n      and nonhematologic toxicities with this treatment regimen in patients 70 years of age and\n      older versus patients younger than 70 years of age.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of nitrocamptothecin. Patients receive oral\n      nitrocamptothecin on days 1-3 and oral etoposide on days 4-5 each week. Treatment continues\n      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients\n      receive escalating doses of nitrocamptothecin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is\n      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients\n      experience dose limiting toxicities. Patients are followed every 4 weeks until toxicities\n      resolve.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40-60 patients will be accrued for this study over 18 to 24\n      months."
