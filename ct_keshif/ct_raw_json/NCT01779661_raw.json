Infant Aquatics have been found to benefit and promote\n      infant development. The support and sensory stimulation of the water may improve the\n      development the sensory, motor, as well as, autonomic system of preterm infants.\n\n      The study will compare intervention by Infant Aquatics to infant massage. The intervention\n      in both methods will start at 36 weeks gestational age for 3 months and will consist of\n      sessions with a therapist every 2 weeks. Development will be assessed and compared at 3, 8\n      and 18 months using Infant Motor Pattern method, Griffith developmental scales and Vineland\n      adaptive behavior scales."
