To assess the impact of cabozantinib on markers of bone turnover and microenvironment in\n      men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and to compare the findings in\n      men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To describe the associated changes in dynamic histomorphometry at baseline and after 6\n      weeks of cabozantinib therapy in men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate\n      cancer.\n\n      II. To characterize, describe, and compare the effects of cabozantinib in men with\n      non-metastatic and metastatic bone disease with respect to the following measurements at\n      baseline and on therapy: markers of bone metabolism in blood including bone specific\n      alkaline phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); changes in markers\n      of apoptosis, proliferation, and angiogenesis in biopsy specimens from both bone and soft\n      tissue during therapy with cabozantinib.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. Radiographic disease responses and toxicities will be monitored for all patients.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive cabozantinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks."
