Participants will be trained in use of the device and will be required to wear it\n      daily for 3 months. Each participant will be evaluated before beginning the intervention and\n      after completing the intervention.  This study will provide important information regarding\n      the benefits of this treatment intervention in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy."
