    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, multicenter, open-label dose-escalation study of twice-weekly
      carfilzomib in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (CCd) as initial therapy
      for subjects with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

    <description>Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of carfilzomib given twice weekly in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (CCd) for subjects with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. The MTD is defined as the highest carfilzomib dose at which fewer than 33% of subjects experience a treatment-related dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first 28-day cycle.</description>
