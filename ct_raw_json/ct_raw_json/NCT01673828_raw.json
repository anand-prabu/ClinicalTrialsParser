Test products to be administered are low\n      and high dose allopregnanolone (Products L and H, respectively) and placebo (Product P)\n      intravenous solutions. The products are administered during a 4-day treatment period\n      followed by a 1-day dose de-escalation period. Stage 1 of the study will assess safety and\n      confirm that dosing with Products L and H achieve the target steady-state plasma\n      concentrations set for each of these products. Dosing will be adjusted in Stage 1, if\n      necessary. Stage 2 will initially allocate subjects equally to Products L, H and P but will\n      then use adaptive randomization to allocate subjects between Products L and H to optimized\n      the probability of yielding a better 3-month Glasgow Outcome Score Extended (GOS-E) score."
