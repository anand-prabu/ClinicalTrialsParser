  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most common forms of renal replacement therapy currently in use are high flux
      haemodialysis  (HF-HD) and haemodiafiltration (HDF). Although these techniques appear
      similar to the patient, there are important differences in what happens to the blood as it
      travels through the dialysis machine.

      During HDF, the machine controls hydrostatic pressure across the dialyser to remove
      additional water together with toxins from the blood and this fluid volume is continually
      replaced with an ultra-pure solution. HDF has a theoretical advantage removing more waste
      substances, especially larger molecules, from the blood than HF-HD which may be of benefit
      to the patient in the medium to long term.Despite the theoretical advantages, trials have so
      far been unable to find any significant difference in death rates or the development of
      health problems among patients on HDF or HF-HD.

      It is therefore important to examine other factors which may help doctors and patients to
      decide which treatment to use. The investigators have designed a study which aims to answer
      three main questions:

        1. Does HDF make patients feel better?

        2. Is blood pressure more stable on HDF in comparison with HF-HD?

        3. Are Phosphate levels and other blood parameters better controlled with HDF than HF-HD?

      The investigators will do this by  randomly assigning patients on HF-HD to receive 2 months
      of either HF-HD or HDF with as equivalent treatment prescriptions as possible and without
      the patient knowing which treatment they are receiving. After two months the patients will
      switch to the alternative form of dialysis for a further two months. During the study the
      investigators will ask the patients how long it took them to recover from the preceding
      session of dialysis, assess the frequency of symptomatic low blood pressure  and also
      perform blood tests at set intervals to measure specific blood parameters.

    <description>During Haemodiafiltration, the dialysis machine removes more water from the blood than during &quot;normal&quot; hemodialysis. The additional liquid is continually replaced with an ultra-pure solution. Thus, the machine exchanges a high volume of fluid during treatment and removes the liquid together with toxins from the blood.</description>
