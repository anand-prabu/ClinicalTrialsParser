A placebo is not a drug.  It looks\n      like the study drug but is not designed to treat any disease or illness.  It is designed to\n      be compared with a study drug to learn if the study drug has any real effect."

However, if needed for your safety, the study staff will be able to find out what\n      you are receiving. You will have an equal chance of being in each group.\n\n      All patients will receive haloperidol as part of your standard of care.  The study doctor\n      can tell you more about haloperidol, how it is designed to work, and about any side effects\n      it may have.\n\n      Study Drug Administration:\n\n      After you have started receiving haloperidol, you will receive lorazepam or the placebo by\n      vein 1 time over about 1-2 minutes.\n\n      Study Tests:\n\n      Every day while you are in the palliative care unit, you will be asked to complete the same\n      questionnaires about symptoms and how you are feeling that you were asked at screening. If\n      at any point you recover from your confusion, you will be asked if you remember the\n      confusion and how distressing it was.\n\n      Saliva Samples:\n\n      While you are in the hospital, saliva samples (about 1/2 a teaspoon) will be collected every\n      day to check for changes in your body's chemical levels. To collect the saliva, a swab will\n      be brushed inside your mouth until enough saliva is gathered on the swab. This should take\n      about 30 seconds to complete.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You will receive the study drug or placebo 1 time.  You will be monitored as part of this\n      study until you leave the palliative care unit.  You may go off study at any time that\n      you/your caregiver decides it is in your best interest.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Lorazepam is FDA approved and commercially available for\n      the treatment of anxiety, insomnia, and seizures.  Its use to help control\n      agitation/delirium is investigational.\n\n      Up to 34 patients will take part in this study.  All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."
