  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to better define how individuals with different genetic
      make-ups will require different interventions to improve their methylation potential and
      nutrient status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the increasing incidence of overweight and obesity among children, nutritional
      deficiencies are still a concern.

      A low intake of vitamins and minerals is associated with a reduction in the antioxidant
      capacity. Some vitamins are associated with chronic diseases including overweight and
      obesity.

      S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) are the substrate and product of
      essential reactions; the SAM:SAH ratio has been associated with health and  is an indicator
      of cellular DNA methylation potential.

      Low level of this ratio may affect short and long term health. In this explorative knowledge
      building open interventional study, subject to be enrolled are children or adolescents 9 to
      13 years of age per year (n=180 per year, over 2 years). The study consists of 6 weeks
      nutritional intervention followed by a 6 weeks follow up.

      In this study, genomics, proteomics, lipidomics analysis will be performed, in addition to
      biochemistry, hematology and vitamins analysis.
