We will modify our current regimen to include a reduced intensity dose of melphalan as an additional chemotherapeutic agent in the preparative regimen, as melphalan has commonly been incorporated into the myeloablative preparative regimens for solid tumors because of its tolerable side effect profile and anti-tumor efficacy.84 Sirolimus will be given post- transplant because of the potential for its additional anti-tumor benefit."

Graft-vs.-tumor (GVT) effects have been\n      described after allogeneic HCT for neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma,\n      rhabdomyosarcoma, melanoma and hepatoblastoma.\n\n      Our goal is to maximize a T cell and NK cell mediated graft versus tumor effect in poor\n      prognosis solid tumor patients using haploidentical donors, T cell replete bone marrow, and\n      a unique post-transplant immunosuppression regimen containing post transplantation Cy and an\n      mTOR inhibitor. This therapy will be widely applicable because almost all patients have a\n      half-matched donor available (parent or sibling). We hope to demonstrate the safety and\n      feasibility of this therapy in anticipation of combining this platform with additional\n      post-transplantation therapy such as cryoablation, Donor Lymphocyte Infusion (DLI), stem\n      cell directed therapy, immunologic checkpoint inhibitors, and/or metabolic inhibitors."
