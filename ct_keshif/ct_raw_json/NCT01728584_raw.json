Insufflation refers to the\n      injection of carbon dioxide into the abdomen during the laparoscopic surgery, to allow\n      visualization of and access to the surgical field. The primary hypothesis of the study is\n      that the use of sustained deep NMB improves the surgeon's overall satisfaction with surgical\n      conditions as compared to standard NMB. The inpatient surgery is performed on Day 1 and the\n      participant remains hospitalized for at least 48 hours following the surgery (or at least 24\n      hours following the surgery, if local practice does not allow 48 hours of hospitalization\n      post surgery). On Day 8, a follow-up visit/contact including all participants occurs."
