  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, two way cross-over, 12 week
      non inferiority study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of FSC 250/50 mcg
      capsule-based inhaler and FSC 250/50 mcg multi-dose inhaler each administered BID in adults
      and adolescents with asthma. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that FSC
      250/50 mcg administered BID by capsule-based inhaler is non-inferior compared to FSC 250/50
      mcg administered BID by multi-dose inhaler . The study consists of six phases:
      Pre-screening, Screening/Run-in (3 weeks), Treatment Period 1 (12 weeks), Washout (minimum 3
      weeks), Treatment Period 2 (12 weeks) and Follow-up (1 week). The total duration of the
      study for each subject will be at least 31 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female &gt;=12 and &lt;=80 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

          -  Non-childbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal
             ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle
             stimulating hormone &gt;40 milli international unit per milliliter (mIU/mL) and
             oestradiol &lt;40 picogram (pg)/mL [&lt;147 picomole per liter (pmol/L)] is confirmatory);
             Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt
             will be required to use one of the contraception methods (i.e., in accordance with
             the approved product label and the instructions of the physician for the duration of
             the study from Screening to follow-up contact) if they wish to continue their HRT
             during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
             postmenopausal status before study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4
             weeks should elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this
             interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. After confirmation of their
             postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a
             contraceptive method; child-bearing potential and is abstinent or agrees to use one
             of the contraception methods for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the
             product label or investigator) before the start of dosing to sufficiently minimise
             the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception
             until at least 2 days post the last dose of study treatment; abstinence from
             penile-vaginal intercourse must be consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle
             of the subject.

          -  Severity of disease: A best prebronchodilator FEV1 of &gt;=40% to &lt;=85% of the predicted
             normal value at Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit). Predicted values will be based
             upon National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III. If a subject is
             recorded as having Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, then the Mexican-American equations
             will be used (irrespective of race). If a subject is recorded as being of
             African-American/African heritage race, then the African American equations will be
             used. If a subject is recorded as being of Asian race, then the Asian adjustment will
             be used. Otherwise, the Caucasian equations will be used.

          -  Reversibility of disease: Demonstrated &gt;=12% and &gt;=200 mL reversibility of FEV1
             within 10 to 40 minutes after 2 to 4 inhalations of salbutamol inhalation aerosol (or
             equivalent nebulised treatment with salbutamol solution) at Visit 1 (Screening and
             Run-in Visit).

          -  Current anti-asthma therapy: All subjects must be using an Inhaled Corticosteroid
             (ICS) with or without long-acting beta-adrenergic agonist (LABA) for at least 8 weeks
             and a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit).
             Two populations are eligible for enrolment:  -  Subjects maintained on ICS
             monotherapy (FP 100 mcg to 250 mcg BID or equivalent) for at least 8 weeks and a
             stable dose for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit) or
             Subjects maintained on an ICS/LABA combination product (e.g., Fluticasone
             propionate/salmeterol 100/50 or 250/50 mcg BID or equivalent by other combination
             products or by separate inhalers) for at least 8 weeks and a stable dose for at least
             4 weeks before Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit). Subjects taking
             budesonide/formoterol or beclomethasone/formoterol as needed must switch to
             budesonide/formoterol maintenance dosing (excluding the highest dose) with use of a
             SABA for symptom relief at least 8 weeks and a stable dose for at least 4 weeks
             before Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit). NOTE: Subjects on low dose ICS
             monotherapy should only be enrolled, if, in the opinion of the investigator, after
             review of their medical history and clinical examination, they will be able to
             benefit from both an increase in ICS dose and the addition of LABA therapy arising
             from and ICS/LABA combination.

          -  Ability to withhold LABA therapy: Other than what is provided during the study, LABA
             therapy is not permitted on the day of Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit) and
             throughout the entire study. The last dose of LABA and LABA/ICS combinations are to
             be taken on the day before Visit 1. Sites should contact the medical monitor to
             discuss subject eligibility, for doses of commonly prescribed ICS and ICS/LABA
             combination medication; as mentioned in the study protocol.

          -  SABA: All subjects must be able to replace their current SABA treatment with rescue
             salbutamol/albuterol at Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit) for use as needed for
             the duration of the study. Subjects must be able to withhold salbutamol/albuterol for
             at least 6 hours before each study visit.

          -  Liver safety criteria: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;=2 the upper limit of normal
             (ULN), Alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;=1.5 ULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5 ULN is
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin is &lt;35%) at Visit 1
             (Screening and Run-in Visit).

          -  Electrocardiogram (ECG) safety criteria: The subject must have no ECG abnormalities
             that would, in the opinion of investigator, compromise subject safety, or
             significantly affect subject's ability to complete the trial. As such, the
             investigator will determine the clinical significance of any ECG abnormality and
             determine if a subject is precluded from entering the study. At Visit 1 (Screening
             and Run-in Visit), ECG safety criteria must be: QT interval corrected for heart rate
             (QTc) or QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia formula (QTcF)
             &lt;450 msec or QTc &lt;480 msec for subjects with bundle branch block; Investigators will
             be responsible for ensuring appropriate clinical interpretation of ECGs.

          -  The subject and/or the subject's legal guardian (if applicable) must be capable of
             giving informed consent/assent, which includes compliance with the study requirements
             and restrictions listed in the consent/assent form.

          -  Asthma exacerbation: Any asthma exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids within 12
             weeks of Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit) or that resulted in overnight
