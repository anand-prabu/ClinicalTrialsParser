Giving chemotherapy drugs, such as busulfan and\n      cyclophosphamide before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth\n      of cancer or abnormal cells and helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the\n      donor's stem cells. Also, radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, such as iodine I 131\n      monoclonal antibody BC8, can find cancer cells and carry cancer-killing substances to them\n      without harming normal cells. When the stem cells from a related donor, that closely matches\n      the patient's blood, are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow\n      make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets."
