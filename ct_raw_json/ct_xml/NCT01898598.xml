  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will assess the efficacy and safety
      of  vismodegib with surgery in patients with basal cell carcinoma. Patients will be
      randomized to receive oral daily doses of vismodegib 150 mg or matching placebo. The
      anticipated time on study drug treatment is 12 weeks.

          -  Evidence of clinically significant and unstable diseases or conditions (e.g.,
             cardiovascular, immunosuppressive, hematologic)

          -  Any dermatological disease at the target basal cell carcinoma site that may cause
             difficulty with examination
