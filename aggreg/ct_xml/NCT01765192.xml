      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of roflumilast alone and  in combination
      with montelukast on forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) in patients with
      inadequately controlled asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called roflumilast. Roflumilast is being tested to
      treat people who have asthma. This study will look at lung function and asthma symptoms of
      people who take roflumilast in combination with montelukast.
