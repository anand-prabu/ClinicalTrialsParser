    <textblock>
      Background Several studies have shown the effect of osteopathic manipulative treatment on
      neonatal care in reducing length of stay, gastrointestinal problems, clubfoot complications
      and improving cranial asymmetry of infants affected by plagiocephaly. Despite several
      results obtained, there is still lack of standardized osteopathic evaluation and treatment
      procedures for newborns recovered in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

      The aim of this research is to provide a guideline on osteopathic approach in treating
      hospitalized newborns. Specific evaluation tests and treatments have been developed to
      tailor osteopathic method according to preterm and term infants' needs, NICU environment,
      medical and paramedical assistance.
