  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In some cases, impacted wisdom teeth should be extracted. Surgical extraction of these
      impacted third molars may provide special complication as pain, swelling, and trismus. In
      previous studies, some techniques as sutureless flap closure, modified flap designing,
      antibiotic usage, and injection of corticosteroids were presented. These methods are
      reducing post operative complications to moderate level. In this study, pain, swelling,
      trismus, general patients' satisfaction, and associated quality of life after the surgical
      removal of third mandibular impacted molars will be compared while injection of
      dexamethasone (8mg) does not need excessive time, effort, and equipments and it will be
      injected in numbness area into medial pterygoid muscle and pterygomandibular space to
      current corticosteroid injecting non-corticosteroid methods. To achieve this aim, 75 non
      pregnant participants have single impacted mandibular third molar in healthy and without
      pericoronitis manner, after provision of written informed consent will be entered to the
      study. During the study, unwilling participants to continue the study and those with
      abnormality of wound healing process will be excluded. The included participants will be
      assigned into three 25-people groups. The surgeries were done by 3 same instructed
      experienced oral and maxillofacial residents. After the surgery pain, swelling, trismus,
      general patients' satisfaction, and associated quality of life were evaluated using
      interview of questionnaire in 48 hour, 96 hour, and one week period of time. The comparison
      was done between these three groups.
