The labia were spread from below to introduce the speculum, which was inserted at a 45-degree angle pointing downward then rotated horizontally as the insertion continued. AVAS score (insertion) was obtained at this point. Next, the bill of the speculum was opened up until the vaginal cuff  could be seen, and the speculum was secured by turning the thumbnut. A second VAS score (dilation) was recorded. During speculum examination, cervical smear with cervical brush was obtained for pathologic  assessment if necessary, and vaginal length was measured with a ruler. The speculum was withdrawn slightly, which allowed the bill to close together, and at this stage (extraction) the final VAS score was obtained. In the gel group , a doctor placed 6,5 mL mL sterile lubricating gel on the top and bottom blades of the speculum."
