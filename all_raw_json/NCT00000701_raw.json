The largest group of children who have AIDS are those who are less than 2 years\n      of age. AIDS is often first identified in infants who are about 6 months old. Studies of AZT\n      show that it might be useful in the treatment of AIDS. Thus it is important to study the\n      effects of the drug in children."
