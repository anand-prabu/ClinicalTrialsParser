However,\n           efficacy and safety should be evaluated in RCT.\n\n        -  Obex combines different molecules with potential effects inducing weight loss and\n           control on metabolic parameters such as fasting glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides.\n\n        -  Therefore, the administration of Obex in overweight and obese patients with impaired\n           fasting glucose could be an excellent strategy to induce weight loss and ameliorate the\n           metabolic disturbances related to obesity and overweight."
