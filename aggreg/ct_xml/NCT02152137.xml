    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well efatutazone with paclitaxel compared to
      paclitaxel alone works in treating patients with advanced anaplastic thyroid cancer. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as efatutazone and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells by stopping them from dividing or by
      stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether efatutazone in combination with
      paclitaxel is more effective than paclitaxel alone in treating patients with advanced
      anaplastic thyroid cancer.

      This is a Phase 2 randomized study of efatutazone with paclitaxel compared to paclitaxel
      alone. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms, efatutazone in combination with
      paclitaxel or paclitaxel alone. Protocol therapy will consist of continuous cycles
      administered every 21 days. Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable
      adverse events, or a minimum of two cycles beyond a complete response. The primary and
      secondary objectives are listed below.

      Primary objective:

      To determine if the combination of paclitaxel and efatutazone improves overall survival (OS)
      compared to paclitaxel alone in patients with advanced anaplastic thyroid cancer.

      Secondary objective:

      To compare the confirmed response rate, duration of response, progression-free survival
      (PFS), and adverse event rates between the combination of paclitaxel and efatutazone vs.
      paclitaxel alone.

      Patients will be followed for every 6 months until 5 years after registration.

        1. Documentation of Disease - Patients must have histologically or cytologically
             diagnosed advanced anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC).

          2. Patients must have measurable disease as defined in the protocol.

          3. Patients must have either metastatic (stage IVC) or locally advanced unresectable
             disease (stage IVB).

          4. Prior Treatment:

               -  Patients should have resolution of any toxic effects of prior therapy (except
                  alopecia) to NCI CTCAE, Version 4.0, grade 1.

               -  There is no limit to the number of prior lines of treatment a patient has
                  received.

               -  No treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, biological
                  therapy, hormonal therapy, or other thiazolidinediones (TZDs) ≤ 28 days before
                  study registration.
