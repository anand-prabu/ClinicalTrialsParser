Before surgery reconstruction the first measurement with the Sono TT FlowLab (em-Tec GmbH, Munich) ultrasound instrument was done and then after surgery reconstruction. Therefore there were different measuring heads exactly fitting around the vessels. Then the administration of 3000ng Ilomedin\u00ae in 15ml saline was injected into the common femoral artery via a a cannula over two minutes. The blood flow volume was measured again after five and ten minutes on the same point. Those results were documented in ml/min. As well on table-angiography was made."

Iloprost\u00ae, a stable prostacyclin mimetic, is an effective\n      vasodilatator, has anti-thrombotic, leukocyten and endothelium-stabilising properties,\n      reduces reperfusion injury after prolonged ischaemia and improves polyneuropathy and the\n      healing of ulcers which are caused of PAOD. At the current stage it is not clear, which\n      mechanism is predominant for diabetics with or without neuropathy.\n\n      This study is undertaken to investigate the increase of the blood flow volume on the common\n      femoral artery after Iloprost\u00ae application and surgery reconstruction and therefore\n      investigate the effect for diabetics and none diabetics in order to polyneuropathy. The\n      blood flow will be measured via an ultrasound instrument."

All\n      patients provide written informed consent.\n\n      General Practitioners and Specialists referred patients to the department. Patients were\n      stratified by their clinical presentation, their walking distance, Doppler index and their\n      angiografie pictures ( PAOD stage IIb-IV of Fontaine). ( PAOD phase IIb  was defined because\n      of a walking distance less than 200 metres, and this was measured in this center, III\n      because of pain without walking, IV because of ulcers or gangrene.)  All participants were\n      older than eighteen years. Patients who gave their written informed consent underwent a\n      standardized vascular screening, including a health questionnaire and laboratory assessment\n      and a check of the internal specialist and the anestheasia. Before each surgery a\n      measurement of the nerve conduction velocity was performed in order to determine the\n      polyneuropathy. Exclusion criteria comprised immaturity, all exclusion criterias of\n      ilomedin\u00ae, pregnancy and spinal anesthesia.\n\n      One day before surgery the patients got ilomedin\u00ae infusion (2A a 10mg into 250ml saline over\n      4 hours) intravenous at the department. Surgery was standardized by performing\n      Thrombendarterectomy in the common femoral artery, profunda and the superficial artery or by\n      performing bypass reconstruction from the common femoral artery after thrombendarterectomy,\n      to the femoropopliteal artery above the knee under general anesthesia with the systemic\n      administration of 5000 IU Heparin before clamping the peripheral vessels.  Before surgery\n      reconstruction the first measurement with the Sono TT FlowLab (em-Tec GmbH, Munich)\n      ultrasound instrument was done and then after surgery reconstruction. Therefore there were\n      different measuring heads exactly fitting around the vessels. Then the administration of\n      3000ng Ilomedin\u00ae in 15ml saline was injected into the common femoral artery via a a cannula\n      over two minutes if the systolic blood pressure of the patient was over 100mm Hg. The blood\n      flow volume was measured again after five and ten minutes on the same point. Those results\n      were documented. As well on table-angiography was made. Then the skin of the patient was\n      closed.\n\n      Before discharge from the hospital every patient was controlled by ultrasound  and  doppler\n      index and the walking distance and then after six weeks and six months again."
