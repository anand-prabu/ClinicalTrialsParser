Pegfilgrastim 6mg will be given subcutaneously (SQ) on day # 2 of each paclitaxel administration. Filgrastim may be used in lieu of pegfilgrastim at physician's discretion. Trastuzumab will be administered weekly (4 mg/kg bolus followed by 2 mg/kg weekly) starting with paclitaxel treatment cycle # 1. After 4 cycles of paclitaxel, pts will receive trastuzumab on a q 3 weeks x 15 doses (to complete about one year). The q 3 week trastuzumab may be started from 1-3 weeks after the last dose of paclitaxel. A total of 15 infusions of trastuzumab will be given q 3 weeks after the completion of paclitaxel during the HL phase. Lapatinib will be given orally at 1000 mg daily, starting with paclitaxel during the THL phase & continued for the remaining year during the HL phase for about a year."
