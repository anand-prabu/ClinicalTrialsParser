      An ORS with L. reuteri DSM 17938 and zinc is expected to reduce duration and severity of
      symptoms in infants and young children with acute gastroenteritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral rehydration solution is recommended for treatment and prevention of dehydration due to
      acute gastroenteritis in infants and children (WHO/UNICEF, 2004; ESPGHAN / ESPID Guidelines,
      2008). Acute diarrhoea may lead to zinc depletion in infants, and zinc supplementation is
      recommended in infants and children with acute gastroenteritis living in developing
      countries. In developed countries however, the studies on the efficacy of zinc
      supplementation in children with acute gastroenteritis are few and conflicting.

      Selected strains of probiotics, including L. reuteri ATCC 55730, have been shown in several
      studies to reduce the duration and the severity of diarrhoea in children with acute
      gastroenteritis and the effect is greater if the probiotics are given within 60 hours from
      the onset of symptoms. Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) has been shown to reduce the
      duration and severity of acute gastroenteritis in children aged 6-36 months. In these
      studies L. reuteri was reported to have clinical effect on diarrhoea of both bacterial and
      viral (rotavirus) origin. Furthermore, L. reuteri strain DSM 17938 has recently been shown
      to reduce the duration of watery diarrhoea by 1.2 days among 6-36 mo old Italian children
      with acute gastroenteritis treated in hospital.

      The present study is a prospective, randomized, double blind, controlled study with parallel
      groups. The planned investigation is designed to compare the efficacy of an ORS with L.
      reuteri DSM 17938 and zinc to an ORS with similar osmolarity and content of salts but
      without L. reuteri DSM 17938 and zinc, on the duration and severity of acute
      gastroenteritis. 92 children aged 6-36 months seen at private pediatric clinics and/or at
      the emergency clinics of the Athens Childrens Hospital &quot;AGIA SOPHIA&quot;, and treated either as
      outpatients or as inpatients will be recruited until the final sample size is reached.
      Assuming a difference of 30% between groups in the primary outcome of prevalence of
      diarrhoea on day 2, and estimating an attrition rate of approximately 15%, the final sample
      size will be 92 subjects, or 46 subjects in each arm.

      Data collection points will be on day 7 at the outpatient clinic of the Division of
      Pediatric Gastroenterology &amp; Nutrition of the First Department of Paediatrics, Athens
      University Hospital.
