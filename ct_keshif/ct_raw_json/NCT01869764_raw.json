To determine if omega-3 dietary supplementation results in higher PUFA levels in plasma\n      and red blood cells in women who took omega 3 tablets in comparison to those who took\n      placebo.\n\n      III. To determine if omega-3 dietary supplementation affects the metabolites of omega-3 and\n      omega-6 PUFA in surgical specimens of malignant and normal breast tissue in comparison to\n      controls.\n\n      IV. To determine if women who take omega-3 dietary supplementation have less proliferation\n      and greater apoptosis in malignant breast tissue in comparison to women who take placebo.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I: Patients receive omega-3 fatty acid orally (PO) daily for 7-14 days.\n\n      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO daily for 7-14 days."
