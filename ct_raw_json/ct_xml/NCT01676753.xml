      The purpose of this trial is to collect safety data for the combination of weekly paclitaxel
      and dinaciclib in patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies. After the Phase 2 dose is
      determined, a 12 subject expansion cohort in patients with advanced triple negative breast
      cancer will be opened.

      This is a single-site, open-label phase I/Ib trial of weekly dinaciclib in combination with
      weekly paclitaxel in patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies. Any number of prior
      therapies is allowed. Prior treatment with paclitaxel is allowed. Paclitaxel will be
      administered weekly by 1-hour intravenous infusion at a fixed dose of 80 mg/m2 during a
      28-day repeating cycle. Dinaciclib will be administered weekly by 2-hour intravenous
      infusion 24 hours later. Dinaciclib is the investigational agent and will be dose escalated
      using a 3+3 design. Only 2 cohorts are planned, although additional cohorts exploring
      intermediate doses or specific patient subsets may be added. The starting dinaciclib dose is
      7 mg/m2. The primary objective is to define the maximum tolerated dose of dinaciclib when
      given weekly in this combination and schedule. The primary endpoint is safety and
      tolerability. Secondary objectives include evaluation of the preliminary efficacy of this
      combination and determination of pharmacokinetic interactions between dinaciclib and
      paclitaxel. Exploratory studies characterizing and correlating the biomarkers relevant to
      dinaciclib activity and MYC overexpression with clinical response will be performed.
