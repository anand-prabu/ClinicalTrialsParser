Patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma receive\n      either the combination of nab-paclitaxel gemcitabine or the existing standard gemcitabine\n      alone treatment.The combination regimen of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine administered in\n      patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer in a first line setting\n      showed improved efficacy with acceptable toxicity. The current study design allows patients\n      in standard treatment to receive the combination treatment at tumour progression.\n\n      The proposed study will explore the impact of treatment on the quality of life and compare\n      the times to definitive deterioration of the quality of life scores using the validated\n      EORTC QLQ-C30. Efficacy and safety secondary endpoints are to be reported in a descriptive\n      manner.\n\n      Molecular studies will be performed on blood and tissue samples."
