            "textblock": "Hypertension is one of the most common diseases in the world, affecting approximately 26% of\n      the adult population. Persistent hypertension increases the risk of developing coronary\n      heart disease, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases, such as heart failure. Hypertension\n      is a common diagnosis in primary health care and the societal costs of examination and\n      treatment of hypertension and its consequences are considerable.\n\n      The YHIP-study (The Impact of Yoga on Blood Pressure and Quality of Life in Patients With\n      Hypertension), that investigated yoga as additional treatment for hypertension on primary\n      care patients, showed that a short yoga program practiced daily at home had a blood pressure\n      lowering effect as well as a positive effect on self-rated quality of life compared to\n      control.\n\n      Other previous studies have demonstrated positive effects of yoga on blood pressure, quality\n      of life, subjective well-being and stress. However, these studies are relatively few and we\n      need to further investigate the possibility of using yoga as a treatment in primary health\n      care.\n\n      If the yoga intervention shows to be effective, yoga exercises may be useful as a\n      supplementary BP therapy in addition to medical treatment when prescribed by primary care\n      physicians. It is to be hoped that patients will also experience a higher quality of life\n      and less stress if they perform yoga on a regular basis."
