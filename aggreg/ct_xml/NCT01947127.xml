      To investigate the role of initial venous lactate in predicting the severity progression to
      overt septic shock and 30-day mortality in non-elderly patients without hemodynamic shock
      who suspected to have acute infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood lactate is one of the markers that can predict the organ failures and mortality in
      emergency department (ED) patients with sepsis. Regarding its predictive role in the
      clinical deterioration in normotensive sepsis patients, a recent prospective observational
      study of the patients with moderately-high serum lactate (2.0-3.9 mmol/L) showed that
      one-forth of the patients eventually developed progressive organ dysfunctions or required
      vasopressor or mechanical ventilator. Unfortunately, low serum lactate (&lt; 2.5 mmol/L) was
      still found up to 50% of overt septic shock patients, even in vasopressor-dependent cases.
      For the prognostic role on mortality, numbers of articles showed that blood lactate can also
      predict death in sepsis patients, especially in those who are elderly and critically-ill.
      However, no previous study was done in younger patients since lactate kinetics in the body
      may differ among the age groups. The primary aim of our study is to investigate the role of
      initial venous lactate levels in predicting the chance of severity progression to overt
      septic shock especially in non-elderly patients who suspected to have acute infections and
      without hemodynamic shock in ED. The secondary outcomes are to evaluate its prognostic role
      on hospital length of stay and 30-day mortality of this target population.

      Venous blood lactate obtained by standard venipuncture together with other essential blood
      works before giving antibiotics or intravenous fluid, if required. Lactate level is measured
      by EpocÂ® point-of-care blood analyzer (Epocal Inc., Ottawa, ON, Canada) within 5 minutes
      after obtaining the venous sample without any preservative.
