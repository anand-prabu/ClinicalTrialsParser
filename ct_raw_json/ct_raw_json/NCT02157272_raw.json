Each local Institutional\n      Review Board will approve the study.\n\n      Study Population Patients of both sexes, of age 18-60, affected by anti-phospholipid\n      syndrome, with a high probability of recurrences as defined by triple aPL-positivity, are\n      eligible for this study.\n\n      Primary Outcome variables The primary cumulative outcome measure will be incident acute\n      thrombosis (arterial or venous) confirmed by appropriate imaging studies, major bleeding, or\n      death.\n\n      Secondary Outcome variables Separate  evaluation of arterial and venous thrombosis and\n      all-cause death."

Triple aPL-positivity in the last blood sampling defined as:\n\n               -  aCL IgG/M (\u226540 GPL or MPL, medium-to-high titer, and/or greater than the 99th\n                  percentile) and\n\n               -  aB2GPI IgG/M (\u226540 U, medium-to-high titer, and/or greater than the 99th\n                  percentile) and\n\n               -  LA test positive based on the International Society of Thrombosis & Hemostasis\n                  Recommendations.\n\n               -  Positivity of aCL and abeta2GPI must be of the same isotype.\n\n               -  To confirm triple positivity for aPL and to validate the laboratory diagnosis,\n                  plasma (at least 2ml prepared by double centrifugation at 2000g) from patients\n                  of each Center will be stored at -80\u00b0C and later on sent in dry ice and retested\n                  in a reference laboratory (Padua Thrombosis Centre). Expenses for shipment will\n                  be in charge to the coordinator Center.\n\n          4. History of thrombosis (objectively proven arterial, venous, and/or biopsy proven\n             microthrombosis) and/or pregnancy morbidity according to Miyaki\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria will not be enrolled in the study:\n\n          1. Severe hypersensitivity reaction to rivaroxaban\n\n          2. Calculated CLCR <30 mL/min at the screening visit\n\n          3. Current pregnancy or breast  feeding. Pregnancy is highly discouraged in these\n             patients and if programmed patients are excluded from the study. If sexually active,\n             be practicing an effective method of birth control (e.g., intrauterine device,\n             double-barrier method, contraceptive patch, male partner sterilization) before entry\n             and throughout the study\n\n          4. Concomitant treatment with other anticoagulants, such as unfractionated heparin, low\n             molecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.) heparin derivatives\n             (fondaparinux), other oral anticoagulants (dabigatran etexilate, apixaban) in the\n             case they can not be substituted with the study drugs.\n\n          5. Patients taking interfering medications: pharmacologic interactions may occur with\n             strong inhibitors of p-glycoprotein and of CYP3A4, e.g., azole-antimycotics, such as\n             ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors;\n             coadministration of rivaroxaban is  therefore contraindicated in these cases. Several\n             drugs used in neurological patients, such as phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine,\n             and st john's wort (hypericum), are p-glycoprotein inducers and should be avoided.\n             Whenever possible, it would be better to use levetiracetam and topiramate as\n             antiepileptic therapy.\n\n          6. Hemorrhage Risk-Related Criteria\n\n               -  History of or condition associated with increased bleeding risk including, but\n                  not limited to:\n\n               -  Major surgical procedure or trauma within 30 days before the randomization visit\n\n               -  Clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 months before the\n                  randomization visit\n\n               -  History of intracranial, intraocular, spinal, or atraumatic intra-articular\n                  bleeding\n\n               -  Chronic hemorrhagic disorder\n\n               -  Known intracranial neoplasm, arteriovenous malformation, or aneurysm\n\n               -  Planned invasive procedure with potential for uncontrolled bleeding.\n\n               -  Sustained uncontrolled hypertension: systolic blood pressure \u2265180 mmHg\n\n          7. Known liver cirrhosis or ALT above three times the upper normal value."
