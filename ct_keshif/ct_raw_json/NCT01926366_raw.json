All male subjects who are biologically capable of having children must agree and\n             commit to the use of a reliable method of birth control for the duration of the study\n             and for 15 days after dose administration.  A male subject is considered biologically\n             capable of having children even if his sexual partner is sterile or using\n             contraceptives.\n\n          3. Subjects must have a body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 30, inclusive and weigh\n             between 50kg and 100kg inclusive.\n\n          4. Subjects must be fluent in English.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. A history or presence of a clinically significant hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal,\n             cardiovascular, endocrine, respiratory, immunologic, hematologic, dermatologic, or\n             neurologic abnormality.\n\n          2. A clinically significant abnormality on physical examination, neurological\n             examination, EEG, ECG, vital signs or laboratory evaluations at screen or between\n             screen and dose administration.\n\n          3. A history of seizure.\n\n          4. A history of head trauma, including closed head injury with loss of consciousness.\n\n          5. Any history of suicide attempt or suicidal behavior, or, in the opinion of the\n             investigator, clinically significant risk of suicide or violent behavior.\n\n          6. Urine drug screen positive for a drug of abuse\n\n          7. A family history of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or psychosis in first\n             degree relatives."
