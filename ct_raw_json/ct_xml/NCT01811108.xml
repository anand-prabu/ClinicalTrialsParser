  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators propose to assess, retrospectively (from 1/7/2009) and prospectively (up to
      31/12/2013,) the safety and tolerability profile (number of participants with adverse
      events) of standard chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic agent bevacizumab (Avastin) as first
      line treatment of patients with metastatic Colorectal Cancer with or without KRAS mutation.
      All treatment schedules that are going to be assessed are considered by the international
      guidelines as standard therapy for patients with metastatic Colorectal Cancer.

      In addition investigators propose to assess the compliance of patients to treatment and the
      efficacy of treatment. That means percentage of objective responses, duration of response,
      frequency of curative liver resection after the administration of treatment, progression
      free survival and estimation of overall survival
