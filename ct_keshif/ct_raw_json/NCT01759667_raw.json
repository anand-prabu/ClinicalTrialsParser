This loss is a result of several factors that go beyond the simple\n      anatomical abnormality of the gastrointestinal tract and may be the product of post-op\n      energy expenditure changes. The respiratory quotient (RQ) and diet-induced thermogenesis\n      (DIT) are important components of energy expenditure and possible changes in them can\n      perform an important role in weight loss after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB). Previously,\n      we conducted a cross-sectional study where we measured the RQ and DIT in pre and post-op\n      RYGB patients, which was published in the Surgery of Obesity and Related Diseases (SOARD)\n      journal. The objective of this study is to perform a prospective analysis of these same\n      variables (RQ and DIT), evaluating them in the same patients, when pre and postoperatively."
