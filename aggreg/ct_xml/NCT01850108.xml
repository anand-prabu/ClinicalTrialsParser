  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation (alloBMT) is a curative therapy for a variety of
      hematologic disorders, including sickle cell disease and thalassemia. Even when it is clear
      that alloBMT can give to these patients an improvement in their disease, myeloablative
      transplants have important toxicities and mortalities associated. The lack of suitable
      donors continues to be a limit to access to transplantation. Substantial progress has been
      made recently in the development of pre-treatment regimens that facilitate the sustained
      engraftment of donor marrow with reduced toxicity. Most of these regimens incorporate highly
      immunosuppressive drugs, which allow the reduction or elimination of myeloablative agents or
      total body irradiation without endangering the sustained engraftment of HLA-identical
      allogeneic stem cells. Preliminary results of non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation suggest that the procedure can be performed in patients who are ineligible
      for myeloablative alloBMT, and that sustained remissions of several hematologic malignancies
      can be obtained.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients who are ineligible for BMT from an HLA-matched sibling donor can proceed to a
        haplo-BMT. Patients with an HLA-matched related donor will proceed to a matched BMT.

          -  Age 2-70 years

          -  Good performance status (ECOG 0 or 1; Karnofsky and Lansky 70-100)

          -  Patients and donors must be able to sign consent forms. First degree relative should
             be willing to donate

          -  Patients must be geographically accessible and willing to participate in all stages
             of treatment.

          -  Eligible diagnoses: Patients with sickle cell anemia such as sickle cell anemia (Hb
             SS), Hb Sβ° thalassemia, Hb Sβ+ thalassemia, Hb SC disease, Hb SE disease, Hb SD
             disease, Hemoglobin SO- Arab disease HbS with hereditary persistence of fetal
             hemoglobin. Other significant hemoglobinopathies that also fulfill criterion from
             below.

        Plus one of the following:

          1. Stroke or central nervous system event lasting more than 24 hours.

          2. MRI changes indicative of brain parenchyma damage.

          3. MRA evidence of cerebrovascular disease.

          4. Acute chest syndrome requiring exchange transfusion or hospitalization.

          5. Recurrent vaso-occlusive pain episodes and hospitalization crisis (more than 2/year
             for the last 2 years).

          6. Stage I or II sickle lung disease.

          7. Transfusion dependent thalassemia

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Poor performance status (ECOG&gt;1).

          -  Poor cardiac function: left ventricular ejection fraction&lt;35%.

          -  Poor pulmonary function: FEV1 and FVC&lt;40% predicted.

          -  Pulmonary hypertension moderate to severe by echocardiographic standards.

          -  Poor liver function: direct bilirubin &gt;3.1 mg/dl

          -  HIV-positive

          -  Minor (donor anti-recipient) ABO incompatibility if an ABO compatible donor is
             available.

          -  Prior transfusions from donor or recipient if caused alloimmunization vs. donor
             cells.

          -  Women of childbearing potential who currently are pregnant (Beta-HCG+) or who are not
             practicing adequate contraception.

          -  Patients who have any debilitating medical or psychiatric illness that would preclude
             their giving informed consent or their receiving optimal treatment and follow-up.

        Criteria for donor eligibility

          -  Weight ≥ 20kg and age ≥ 18 years

          -  Donors must meet the selection criteria as defined by the Foundation for the
             Accreditation of Hematopoietic Cell Therapy (FAHCT) and will be screened per the
             American Association of Blood Banks (AABB). (AABB guidelines and the recipients will
             be informed of any deviations.)

          -  When more than one donor is available, the donor with the lowest number of HLA allele
             mismatches will be chosen, unless there is HLA cross-match incompatibility or a
             medical reason to select otherwise, in which case donor selection is the
             responsibility of the PI, in consultation with the immunogenetics laboratory. In
             cases where there is more than one donor with the least degree of mismatch,donors
             will be selected based on the most favorable combination of (i) HLA compatibility in
             cross-match testing and (ii) ABO compatibility:

          -  HLA crossmatching (in order of priority)

               1. Mutually compatible (no cross-matching antibodies)

               2. Recipient non-cross-reactive with donor, donor cross-reactive with recipient

               3. Mutually cross-reactive

          -  ABO compatibility (in order of priority)

               -  Compatible

               -  Major incompatibility

               -  Minor incompatibility

               -  Major and minor incompatibility

          -  Donors will be selected to minimize HLA mismatch in the host-versus-graft direction.

          -  Donor must have a hemoglobin S =/&lt; ~50%.
