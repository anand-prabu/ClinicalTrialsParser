DFO-MSTP2109A is an\n      antibody that works against STEAP1 - found on the surface of prostate cancer cells. Attached\n      to the DFO-MSTP2109A is a radioactive material called 89ZR, which allows it to be imaged by\n      a PET scanner. The results of this study may help researchers know whether\n      89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A can be used as a diagnostic agent for finding prostate cancer that have\n      STEAP1 on its surface with a PET scanner. The reason why identifying STEAP1 on prostate\n      cancer cells is that new therapies are being developed to target STEAP1 prostate cancer\n      cells."
