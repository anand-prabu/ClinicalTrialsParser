Therefore, children affected by\n      this condition present with high blood sugars. This condition affects 1:400/500 persons\n      worldwide.Type I Diabetes, previously known as Juvenile Diabetes,usually strikes in\n      childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood, but lasts for a lifetime. To date, there has\n      been no treatments that can arrest, or reverse the ongoing beta cell destruction. We\n      hypothesize that GABA, a naturally occurring substance, has the potential to reduce the\n      inflammation and protect the pancreatic beta cells from autoimmune destruction. GAD-alum may\n      contribute to the preservation of residual insulin secretion in patients with recent onset,\n      Type I Diabetes."
