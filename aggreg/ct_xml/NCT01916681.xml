  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The percentage of women undergoing an induction of labor (IOL) is estimated to be 20% and
      continues to rise. Simultaneously, the cesarean delivery (CD) rate has continued to increase
      (2). Induction is a known risk factor for CD. Despite numerous studies evaluating time
      periods to define a failed IOL, there are no guidelines or accepted definitions of when to
      call an IOL failed given the incremental gain in vaginal delivery when IOL is prolonged.
      While decreasing the CD rate is an important primary focus in obstetrics, attention must
      also be paid to the overall length of labor given that prolonged labor is associated with
      adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Furthermore, a prolonged labor is associated with an
      increase in direct hospital costs and healthcare utilization. The use of cervical ripening
      agents, such as vaginal prostaglandin and mechanical dilators, has been demonstrated to
      reduce labor time and CD rate. In addition to specific individual agents, certain dosing and
      regimens for IOL and active labor have been compared to evaluate whether a particular dose
      or regimen can decrease the length of labor and decrease the CD rate. Most of these
      regimens; however, focus on individual induction agents and few have compared the efficacy
      of using more than one agent simultaneously. Given the associated risks of prolonged labor
      and limited data evaluating the use of combined cervical ripening agents, our objective is
      to evaluate the difference in time to delivery among women who undergo an IOL with four
      different methods.
