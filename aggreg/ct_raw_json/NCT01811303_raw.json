All of the subsequent measurements were assessed against the average of the two baseline readings.

Each volunteer then took a blood sugar readings at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes following the initiation of consumption of the test product. Measurements were taken using the Ascensia Contour, Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems (Bayer), which analysed the blood sample and provided a blood glucose reading in mmol/l. The AUC is calculated using the trapezoid rule and the final outcome is the incremental area under the curve for the arm expressed as a percent of the average response for the control by the same subject.",

All of the subsequent measurements were assessed against the average of the two baseline readings. Each subject was then presented with a test product and they were instructed to consume the whole amount within a fifteen-minute period.  Each volunteer then took a blood sugar readings at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes following the initiation of consumption of the test product. Measurements were taken using the Ascensia Contour, Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems (Bayer), which analysed the blood sample and provided a blood glucose reading in mmol/l. The AUC is calculated using the trapezoid rule and the final outcome is the incremental area under the curve for the arm expressed as a percent of the average response for the control by the same subject.",

All of the subsequent measurements were assessed against the average of the two baseline readings. Each subject was then presented with a test product and they were instructed to consume the whole amount within a fifteen-minute period.  Each volunteer then took a blood sugar readings at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes following the initiation of consumption of the test product. Measurements were taken using the Ascensia Contour, Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems (Bayer), which analysed the blood sample and provided a blood glucose reading in mmol/l. The AUC is calculated using the trapezoid rule and the final outcome is the incremental area under the curve for the arm expressed as a percent of the average response for the control by the same subject.",
