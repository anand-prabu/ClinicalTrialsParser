  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, comparative and parallel-group study of
      ovulation induction evaluating tailoring of Recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
      treatment using the Gonal-f® prefilled pen in World Health Organization (WHO) Type 2
      anovulatory subjects who have previously failed to conceive with clomifene treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will enter a screening period of up to one month before being randomized at the
      Baseline Visit, which will occur on Day 1 of the subject's menstrual cycle. Each subject
      will then receive up to 4 weeks treatment with Gonal-f®. If adequate follicular development
      (assessed by transvaginal ultrasound) is achieved, the subject will proceed to
      administration of  human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) within 24-48hrs of last Gonal-f®
      injection (or according to standard site practice).

      Following administration of hCG, subjects will attempt to become pregnant via intercourse or
      intrauterine insemination. The method of conception will be determined by the subject's
      requirements and standard practice at the clinic site.

      All subjects will be followed up appropriately until confirmation of biochemical pregnancy
      (hCG + minimum 14 days) and clinical pregnancy (hCG + minimum 42 days, for subjects with
      positive biochemical pregnancy test).

          -  Subjects with any medical condition which, in the opinion of the  Investigator,  may
             interfere  with  the  absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of the drug
