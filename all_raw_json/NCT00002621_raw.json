Treatment continues for\n           a minimum of 4-12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n           Patients who received IT therapy during induction receive the same IT therapy at 4, 8,\n           and 12 weeks and then every 8 weeks thereafter.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months for 4 years and then annually for survival until entry\n      on another POG protocol.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 evaluable patients will be accrued for this study within\n      4.2 years."
