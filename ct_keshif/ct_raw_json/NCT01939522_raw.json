            "textblock": "Children/ young people with diabetes may be at a higher risk of acquiring certain\n      infections. These infections include those caused by a bacterium called the pneumococcus\n      which can cause pneumonia, meningitis and ear infections. In the UK older children with\n      diabetes are given a vaccine against the pneumococcus bug called Pneumovax (or PPS23 for\n      short). Although PPS23 causes a good immune response in children over 2 years of age it is\n      not actually known how well PPS23 protects against infection in children of any age. In\n      addition there is some data in adults and children that PPS23 may result in a reduced\n      response to future doses of pneumococcal vaccines (hyporesponsiveness). Because of the lack\n      of information on how well PPS23 protects and potential hyporesponsiveness the investigators\n      would like to study the use of an alternative vaccine against pneumococcus called Prevenar13\n      (or pCV13). This vaccine is known to be safe and to work well in babies and young children\n      and there have been no concerns about hyporesponsiveness. It has been approved for use in\n      children up to 17 years of age but there is little information on the size and duration of\n      immune response to PCV13 in children aged 6 years and older."
