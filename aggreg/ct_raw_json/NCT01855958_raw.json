DIMST using was administered maintaining a distance from the spinous process line of 2 cm. The anatomic sites of peripheral DIMST were the muscles vastus medialis, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, tibialis anterioris; and the pes anserinus bursae.

The electrodes were placed on the same points where the active stimulation was applied while the nerve stimulation unit was left in front of the subject, for 30 minutes. This positioning ensured that the intermittent diode simulating the electrical stimulus was visible and audible."

Due to these promising initial results, the\n      plasticity of M1 has also been investigated as a potential marker for chronic pain. TMS\n      studies using single or paired pulse shown changes in M1 plasticity in neuropathic pain and\n      fibromyalgia pain compared to healthy subjects. Thus, there is a decrease in the inhibitory\n      activity of chronic pain that can take a state as shown uninhibited by measuring TMS indexed\n      intracortical inhibition (ICI) and cortical silent period (CSP). Based on these experimental\n      data and clinical studies have been focused on the effects of neuromodulation techniques in\n      M1 excitability. The techniques used to stimulate the peripheral nervous system was\n      investigated using different approaches. The DIMST is a therapy applied to treat peripheral\n      chronic syndromes that may have central components such as myofascial pain. During DIMST,\n      the needles are applied to the spinal segment associated with nerve roots dermatome\n      corresponding to the pathology. This treatment can also be effective in the treatment of\n      diseases that have major peripheral components such as OA. OA is a major cause of suffering\n      and disability in the elderly, having an inflammatory component, such as a factor that\n      contributes to the symptoms and progression of the disease. There is evidence that OA could\n      lead to sensitization central and segmental, but these effects on M1 plasticity and other\n      central components are not completely known.\n\n      Therefore, researchers proposed to evaluate the plasticity of M1 in this chronic pain\n      condition and also the effect of bottom-up DIMST in pain and cortical excitability."
