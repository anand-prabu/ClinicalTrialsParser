  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is still one of the most common malignance in Korea. Because of the
      popularity of regular check ups, early detection of gastric cancer has increased,
      consequently, the survival of the patients also has increased. In this reason, the interest
      of outcomes after gastrectomy for gastric cancer move survival only to quality of life of
      these patients.

      Although the definition of metabolic syndrome is various, but it is normally accepted as a
      state that insulin resistance or glucose intolerance combined with hypertension or
      hyperlipidemia or obesity. Metabolic syndrome is a worldwide health problem, and the
      treatment is modification of life style, weight loss and medication. However, in most of the
      patients metabolic syndrome is considered not curable disease. Recent studies have shown
      that some bariatric surgery offers not only control the overweight but also metabolic
      syndrome. The exact mechanism is still unknown but decreased gastric volume and intestinal
      bypass itself seemed to play an important role to improve metabolic syndrome over just
      decreased weight.

      For treating gastric cancer, gastrectomy is essential and the extent of gastrectomy is
      varied subtotal and total gastrectomy according to the location of tumor. Also,
      reconstruction type is varied gastroduodenostomy and Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy after
      subtotal gastrectomy, esophagojejunostomy after total gastrectomy. This kind of operation
      for gastric cancer lead decreased gastric volume and/or intestinal bypass, which means this
      operation could lead similar effect of bariatric surgery. Already, there have been several
      retrospective reports that metabolic syndrome or diabetes was improved after gastrectomy for
      gastric cancer but no prospective study about this subject yet in Korea.

      The purpose of this study is that evaluating the degree of improvement of metabolic syndrome
      after gastrectomy for gastric cancer, and analyze the differences between the type of
      operation.
