Primary\n      percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) is currently the most effective treatment strategy\n      in acute myocardial infarction. However, a sizable number of patients fail to restore\n      optimal myocardial reperfusion, mostly because of the 'no-reflow' phenomenon. Glucagon-like\n      peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone that regulates plasma glucose, and recently GLP-1\n      analogues have been introduced for the treatment of type-2 diabetes. In experimental\n      studies, GLP-1 or its analogues protect against reperfusion injury-induced cell death.\n      Exenatide reduces reperfusion injury in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial\n      infarction. Liraglutide(GLP-1) is safe and effective to reduce weight,serum lipid levels and\n      blood pressure. Liraglutide can reduce cardiac rupture (12 of 60 versus 46 of 60; P=0.0001)\n      and infarct size (21\u00b12% versus 29\u00b13%, P=0.02) and improved cardiac output (12.4\u00b10.6 versus\n      9.7\u00b10.6 ml/min; P=0.002) in normal and diabetic mice. The investigators planned to research\n      the cardioprotective effects of intravenous liraglutide administered prior to reperfusion\n      and continued after restoration of coronary blood flow in patients with STEMI undergoing\n      pPCI."
