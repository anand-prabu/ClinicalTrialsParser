            "textblock": "In endurance sports competitions such as cycling, an athlete's capacity to sustain\n      submaximum power (i.e. endurance capacity) strongly influences overall race performance.\n      Endurance capacity can be increased by both long, continuous endurance exercise at moderate\n      oxygen consumption, and high-intensity (at or above peak oxygen consumption) interval\n      training. However, it has also been shown that resistance exercise, if performed in addition\n      to endurance exercise, can further enhance endurance capacity. The investigators have\n      recently described a novel training method, which is based on combined vibration and\n      resistance training and superimposed vascular occlusion. Based on the investigators previous\n      results showing that this type of training leads to marked increases in endurance capacity\n      in previously untrained young women, the investigators aim at investigating whether the\n      method is also effective in increasing endurance capacity in highly endurance-trained young\n      men, and whether the method leads to bigger improvements relative to resistance exercise\n      alone. Besides the functional outcomes the investigators are also interested in the\n      specificity of the cellular adaptations with respect to the two trainings methods."
