Mounting evidence suggests the\n      beneficial effects of acupuncture for mitigating chronic low back pain with acceptable minor\n      adverse events. However, little information exists regarding the effects and safety of\n      acupuncture for degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis, one of the spinal disorders that\n      present chronic low back and leg pain.\n\n      The investigators aimed  to assess the overall effectiveness, safety,  and feasibility of\n      acupuncture in combination with usual care (as opposed to usual care alone) for patients\n      with symptomatic degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis.\n\n      The hypotheses of this study are as follows:\n\n        1. A set of acupuncture  sessions in combination with usual care can provide greater\n           functional improvements than usual care alone .\n\n        2. A set of acupuncture sessions  in combination with usual care can provide greater pain\n           reduction than usual care alone .\n\n      The study aims to include 50 participants (25 in the acupuncture group and 25 in the usual\n      care group)."
