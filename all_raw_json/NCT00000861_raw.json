There is an urgent need to identify the optimal use\n      of IDV in patient management, since clinical endpoint studies have not been completed in the\n      United States. Since there is little information about the long term durability of clinical\n      effects, and even less information about the timing of the initiation of protease inhibitor\n      therapy, exploring the disease progression and survival impact of immediate versus delayed\n      use of IDV will yield important information to guide clinical decision making for this group\n      of patients."
