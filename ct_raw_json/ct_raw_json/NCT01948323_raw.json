The website content will include a number of short videos of which and health messages related to a pregnancy-specific-disease outcomes.\nParticipants will also be asked to answer questions from 2 questionnaires ( 24 hour dietary recall assessment and short messaging service technology driven questionnaire) in conjunction to engaging with the HEDUAfrica website.
