            "textblock": "Background Increased levels of C reactive protein (CRP) can be found not only within\n      individuals with periodontal diseases and those with atherosclerotic alterations but also\n      have been proved in men with erectile dysfunction (ED). NO seems to be the key mediator in\n      the endothelial-derived vasodilation and penile erection.\n\n      The incidence of ED increases in patients with diabetes, hypertonia, hypercholesteremia,\n      cardiovascular diseases and renal failure. First evidence suggests that there is a\n      relationship between periodontal disease and ED as well. Due to slow progression of chronic\n      periodontal disease (0.3-0.5mm attachment loss/year) it can be assumed, that periodontal\n      disease exists mainly before ED develops.\n\n      Specific Aims This cross-sectional study aims to assess the incidence of periodontal disease\n      in male individuals with ED. A possible correlation between severity of periodontal disease,\n      level of systemic hs-CRP and ED will be assessed. Additionally, further risk factors for\n      endothelial dysfunction, such lipid values, will be determined and regarded in the analysis.\n\n      Hypothesis The investigators assume, that severity of ED correlates with severity of\n      periodontal disease as well as with systemic involvement assessed by CRP-levels. In detail,\n      the investigators hypothesize, that severity of ED (assessed by the questionnaire\n      \"International Index of Erectile Function\") correlates with the mean probing depth and the\n      level of systemic hs-CRP.\n\n      Material and Methods\n\n        1. st appointment: In the present cross-sectional study 100 male patients with ED will be\n           included. Patients who visit the urological department (Rudolfstiftung) for\n           ED-treatment will be asked to participate. The erectile dysfunction will be assessed by\n           means of a questionnaire (International Index of Erectile Function - IIEF-5). Urologic\n           examination. The following blood parameters will be assessed: testosterone, prolactin,\n           hs-CRP, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, Interleukin-1, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL,\n           HbA1c and fasting glucose.\n\n        2. nd appointment: At the department of Oral Surgery (Bernhard Gottlieb School of\n           Dentistry) the periodontal situation and the index of decayed-missing-filled permanent\n           teeth (DMFT) index of the patients will be determined. A panoramic radiograph for\n           assessment of alveolar bone loss and a periodontal status (probing depth, recession,\n           bleeding- and plaque-indices) will be performed. The observer at the dental clinic will\n           have no information on the severity of the ED (observer blinded)."
