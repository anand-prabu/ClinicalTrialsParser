UCAN is a manualized, 22-session Cognitive Behavioral Couple Therapy (CBCT) intervention that engages the couple to target the core psychopathology of AN and address the uniquely challenging stress that AN places on intimate relationships. The CBT proposed for this study is a 22 session adaptation of the manualized intervention that has been employed successfully as an outpatient post-hospitalization therapy and in an National Institute of Mental Health multisite study of fluoxetine with elements from the CBT manual used in McIntosh et al (PubMed 15800147)."

Most of these patients have complicated histories, long-standing eating disorders, and complex comorbid conditions."

The investigators plan to compare UCAN with\n      individual treatment in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). All participants with AN will\n      receive a common set of core interventions, including medical management, nutrition\n      counseling, and a base level of individual cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), with\n      randomization either to: 1) UCAN couple-based intervention or 2) a higher \"dose\" of\n      individual CBT. The partners are involved in varying ways and to varying degrees in\n      treatment. In addition, progress will be followed for one year after completion of active\n      treatment."
