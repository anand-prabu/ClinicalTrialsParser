  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine the efficacy and safety of 2 dose levels of weekly
      subcutaneously injected albiglutide compared with placebo and an open label reference arm of
      daily subcutaneous injections of liraglutide, in Japanese subjects with Type 2 diabetes
      mellitus.
