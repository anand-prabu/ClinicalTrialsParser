The total duration of stimulation is 132\n      minutes. Each session was given on a separate day and in general each session occurred on\n      consecutive days with the exception of weekends.\n\n      Group II:  Patients receive 9 sessions of sham stimulation, which consists of 8 minutes of\n      sham stimulation during session 1, 12 minutes duration sham stimulation during session 2,\n      and 16 minutes duration sham stimulation during sessions 3-9.
