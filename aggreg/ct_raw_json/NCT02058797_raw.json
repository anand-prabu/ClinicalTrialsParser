Procrastination, negative emotional states and cognitive\n      structure will be assessed in pre-treatment and post-treatment evaluation. A total of 30\n      students will be randomly assigned to Coherence Therapy (n=15) or Cognitive Behavioral\n      Therapy (n=15). In both forms of treatment students will receive three weekly sessions and\n      one more session six to seven weeks after the third session. The treatment will be provided\n      by trained psychotherapists. Findings would clarify the effectiveness of Coherence Therapy\n      for the treatment of procrastination and the change of emotional states and cognitive\n      structure of the students after the treatment."
