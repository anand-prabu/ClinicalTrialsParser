The\n      role of gut-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), the formation of which is enhanced by\n      microbial fermentation of fibre, is still controversial. At the present time, our\n      understanding of the effects of SCFA on human metabolism (in gut or systemically) is still\n      limited.
