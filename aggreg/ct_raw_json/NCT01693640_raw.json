Before any study procedures are performed, subjects will have the details of the\n             study described to them, and they will be given a written informed consent document\n             to read. Then, if subjects consent to participate in the study, they will indicate\n             that consent by signing and dating the informed consent document in the presence of\n             study personnel.\n\n          2. Female patients with a diagnosis of Behcet's syndrome\n\n          3. Women, greater than 18 years of age\n\n          4.

Patients must have oral ulcers or genital ulcers that have been resistant to\n             colchicine or topical measures for at least a month.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. WOCBP who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method to avoid pregnancy for\n             the entire study period and for up to 10 weeks after the last dose of study drug.\n\n          2. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n\n          3.

Female subjects who have had a breast cancer screening that is suspicious for\n             malignancy and in whom the possibility of malignancy cannot be reasonably excluded by\n             additional clinical, laboratory, or other diagnostic evaluations.\n\n          7. Subjects with a history of cancer in the last 5 years, other than non-melanoma skin\n             cell cancers cured by local resection or carcinoma in situ.\n\n          8. Subjects who currently abuse drugs or alcohol.\n\n          9. Subjects with evidence (as assessed by the investigator) of active or latent\n             bacterial or viral infections at the time of potential enrollment, including subjects\n             with evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) detected during screening.\n\n         10. Subjects with herpes zoster or cytomegalovirus (CMV) that resolved less than 2 months\n             before the informed consent document was signed.\n\n         11.

Subjects with any serious bacterial infection within the last 3 months, unless\n             treated and resolved with antibiotics, or any chronic bacterial infection (eg,\n             chronic pyelonephritis, osteomyelitis, or bronchiectasis).\n\n         13. Subjects at risk for tuberculosis (TB).\n\n         14. Subjects must not be positive for hepatitis B surface antigen.\n\n         15. Subjects who are positive for hepatitis C antibody if the presence of hepatitis C\n             virus was also shown with polymerase chain reaction or recombinant immunoblot assay.\n\n         16. Subjects with any of the following laboratory values\n\n         17. Hemoglobin < 8.5 g/dL\n\n         18. WBC < 3000/mm3 (< 3 x 109/L)\n\n         19.

Any other laboratory test results that, in the opinion of the investigator, might\n             place a subject at unacceptable risk for participation in the study.\n\n         23. Subjects who have at any time received treatment with any investigational drug within\n             28 days (or less than 5 terminal half-lives of elimination) of the Day 1 dose.\n\n         24.
