    <textblock>
      Patients is going to submit to the 2 spontaneous breathing trial ( Automatic tube
      compensation plus continuous positive airway pressure and continuous positive airway
      pressure without automatic tube compensation. The oxygen consumption and energy expenditure
      is going to measure during the spontaneous breathing trial by indirect calorimetry.
