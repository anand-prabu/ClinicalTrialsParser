      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of AD5-SGE-REIC/Dkk-3
      in subjects with localized prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2a clinical trial in subjects who are diagnosed with prostate cancer to
      evaluate the effectiveness of Ad5-SGE-REIC/Dkk-3 in the treatment of localized prostate
      cancer.

      Subjects enrolled will be diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (clinical stage T1/T2)
      having a Gleason score of 6 to 7 (3+4 or 4+3).  Subjects will be candidates for definitive
      therapy.

      Subjects will receive up to four (4) TRUS-guided intratumoral treatments with
      Ad5-SGE-REIC/Dkk-3 into the prostate approximately 6-weeks apart.  Each treatment cycle will
      be performed using three track injections through the prostrate using 1 mL each injection (3
      mL total) with focus on the most dense areas of cancer based on biopsy mapping.

      Subjects will be considered a success if they experience a 50% drop in PSA or a 1 point drop
      in the Gleason score after 24 weeks. Subjects who are progressing at any time after the
      second injection of Ad5-SGE-REIC/Dkk-3 will be discontinued and will be treated according to
      standard medical practice.

    <description>Ad5-SGE-REIC/Dkk-3, was designed to increase intracellular production REIC protein. The adenovirus vector is a transport mechanism to infuse the REIC protein into the cell providing a temporary transfusion of protein that induces apoptosis in target cancer cells, but does not appear to have a significant effect on normal tissues.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be included:

          1. Male aged between 50 and 80 years (inclusive) with histologically documented
             clinically localized, adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

          2. Subject with clinical stage T1 or T2 with Gleason score is between 6 and 7 (3+4 or
             4+3).

          3. Recent (≤ 3 months prior to study entry) negative bone scan and CT scan of
             abdomen/pelvis.

          4. Life expectancy of at least 5 years.

          5. Subjects should have adequate bone marrow function defined as an absolute peripheral
             granulocyte count ≥ 1,500 and platelet count of ≥ 100,000, adequate hepatic function
             with a bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dl and SGPT &lt; 4x the upper limits of normal, adequate renal
             function defined as serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl

          6. Subjects must have a coagulation profile (PT, PTT) not more than 2-times the upper
             limit of normal and no history of substantial non-iatrogenic bleeding diatheses. Use
             of anticoagulants is limited to local use only (for control of central line patency).

          7. Subject is willing to refrain from sexual activity or agrees to use a barrier
             contraceptive device (e.g. condom) for 8-weeks after treatment with
             Ad5-SGE-REIC/Dkk-3.

          8. Subjects must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the
             investigational nature of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded:

          1. Hormonal treatment, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy or other
             investigational study drug within the past 4 weeks.

          2. Unable to tolerate transrectal ultrasound.

          3. Subjects with uncontrolled cardiac, hepatic, renal or neurologic/psychiatric
             disorders, that in the opinion of the investigator put the subject at significant
             risk, are not eligible.

             eligible.

          5. Subjects with a clinical history of primary or secondary immunodeficiency, autoimmune
             disease or subjects taking immunosuppressive drugs such as corticosteroids
             continuously for &gt; 4 months [&gt; 5 mg hydrocortisone/day] are ineligible.

          6. As a result of medical review, physical examination, the Principal Investigator (or
             medically qualified nominee) considers the subject unfit for the study.
