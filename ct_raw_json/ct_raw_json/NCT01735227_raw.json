It can effectively suppress acute\n      \u3001subacute stent thrombosis formation , reduce readmissions ratio , thus greatly improving\n      the quality of life of patients . A large number of clinical practice reports, although the\n      treatment strategies to reduce the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events ,it has\n      increased the possibility of the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding complications .\n      Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are often used to prevent gastrointestinal complications of\n      dual antiplatelet therapy . 2008 American College of Cardiology (ACC) / American Society of\n      Gastroenterology (ACG) / American Heart Association (AHA) jointly issued a consensus\n      document , consistently recommended that the majority of clinicians application of dual\n      antiplatelet and PPIs treatment for patients with risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding\n      that may exist at the same time ,in order to reduce the occurrence of gastrointestinal\n      adverse events . But at home and abroad in recent years, there have been reports suggest\n      that the interaction of PPIs with clopidogrel may exist , thereby reduce the latter 's anti-\n      platelet effect , in order to make the incidence of adverse CV events increased about 25-64\n      % . In January 2009 , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a safety review\n      of an earlier report on the potential interaction of these two types drugs , particularly\n      stressed the need to carry out a large number of clinical practice research further to clear\n      both the interaction . PPIs antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel after PCI is not yet very\n      clear , clinical results on both interactions still exist many different academic\n      perspectives and research defects , so still need to arouse sufficient attention , continue\n      to carry out the relevant fields research .\n\n      In order to further clarify the interaction of PPIs with clopidogrel anti - platelet effect\n      , the investigators designed a clinical randomized controlled trials of omeprazole and\n      pantoprazole antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel .In this experiment , the investigator have\n      taken a randomized NSTE-ACS hospitalized patients met the inclusion criteria were randomly\n      divided into omeprazole and pantoprazole groups .
