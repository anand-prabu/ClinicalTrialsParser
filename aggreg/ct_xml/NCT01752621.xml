      Background: Acromegaly is a rare disease caused by GH hypersecretion from a pituitary
      adenoma.  The annual incidence is estimated to be 3-5/million with a prevalence of 100 -
      150/million. The incidence rate is however uncertain since no nationwide surveys exist. If
      left untreated or poorly controlled the condition is associated with progressive morbidity
      and an excess mortality. The primary treatment is surgery, which however only provides a
      cure rate of ≈ 50 -60% due to the size of the tumour. The second line treatment today is
      medical treatment with slow release formulations of somatostatin analogs (SA) and, more
      recently, a specific GH antagonist. It is well known that surgical cure may normalize
      mortality but similar data are not available for patients receiving medical treatment.

      Accurate data on incidence rates and outcome of treatment are of obvious importance in order
      to provide optimal and evidence-based treatment for the disease. This is particularly
      relevant in light of the availability of new and effective treatment modalities such as the
      GH antagonist, the proper place of which in the treatment algorithm still remains
      controversial.

      Denmark holds a unique position in terms of epidemiological studies due to the existence of
      well organized databases which include all its inhabitants. A recognised problem with
      epidemiological surveys from specialised centres is whether the figures are representative
      for the general population. A nationwide Danish study will profit from the fact that every
      Danish citizen holds a unique ID number that makes it easy to retrieve and combine pertinent
      data regarding health, disease and death from different registries. The investigators have
      previously used this for a landmark survey of another rare endocrine disease, i.e. Cushing's
      syndrome. This publication has been cited more than 100 times.

      Aim: To assess the incidence rate, morbidity and mortality of acromegaly in Denmark with a
      specific attention to a comparison between the outcome of surgery alone vs. medical
      treatment.
