            "textblock": "Interoperable health IT allows for the reduction of barriers in the exchange of health\n      information.  Substantial work flow efficiencies and cost reductions may be realized by\n      reducing these barriers, and integrating information exchange among different providers and\n      healthcare systems.  Some of the avenues in which these efficiencies and cost reductions are\n      likely to be achieved are through easier access to test results, reduction in medication\n      errors, quality monitoring and improvement methodologies, and increased consumer choice.\n      In recognition of the potential for these improvements, New York State has provided funding\n      to regional entities (Regional Health Information Organizations\u2014RHIO'S) whose role is to\n      assist practice providers in the development, implementation, and integration of these\n      interoperable IT systems.  New York State has also provided funding to evaluate the\n      technology implementations facilitated by the RHIOs. The investigators will be working with\n      health care providers that have been assisted by the Greater Rochester RHIO.\n\n      Depending on the unique characteristics of the hardware and software that is developed and\n      implemented, there may be variations in operational flow that effect efficiency in the\n      ambulatory care setting.  The goal of our study is to measure and evaluate the effects of\n      interoperable IT systems in the work flow practices of providers that have implemented them\n      in the ambulatory care setting."
