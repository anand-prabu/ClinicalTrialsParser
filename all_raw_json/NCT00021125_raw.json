Patients are randomized to one of two\n      treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy 3 times daily, with an interval of at least 6\n           hours between any 2 treatments, 5 days a week, for just over 2 weeks, for a total of\n           13-14 treatment days.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy daily, 5 days a week, for 6-6.5 weeks. Quality of\n           life is assessed at baseline and then annually for 5 years.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 460 patients (230 per arm) will be accrued for this study\n      within 2-3 years."
