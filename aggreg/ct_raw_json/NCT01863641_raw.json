On the other hand, there is evidence that\n      vitamin D and its analogs have known immunosuppressant properties and profound effects on\n      glomerular mesangial cell proliferation. Moreover much literature such as animal studies\n      suggests it as a therapeutic intervention in autoimmune disease. The investigators plan to\n      conduct a double blind randomized control clinical trial to study effects of calcitriol on\n      progress and activity of lupus nephritis. Fifty patients with clinically quiescent SLE and\n      biopsy-proven glomerulonephritis will be recruited. They will be treated with calcitriol for\n      1 year. Proteinuria, renal function, lupus disease activity, serum inflammatory markers will\n      be monitored."
