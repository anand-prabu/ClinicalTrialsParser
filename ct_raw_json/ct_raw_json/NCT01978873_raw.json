We hypothesize further that\n      the approach is likely to be more effective at a time of minimal tumour burden, resulting in\n      minimization of the overall burden of therapy and better quality of life while on treatment.\n\n      This trial will determine whether any benefit is gained by adding chemotherapy before\n      hormonal therapy to hormonal therapy alone in the population of subjects with metastatic or\n      high risk disease."
