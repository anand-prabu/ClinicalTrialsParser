These objectives\n      will be carried out by answering the following questions:\n\n        1. What is the infection rate within one year of surgery for open and closed tibia\n           fracture subjects in India treated with internal fixation?\n\n        2. What is the distribution of infection per type of infection, stratified by time (early,\n           delayed, late) and location (superficial or deep) in open and closed tibia fracture\n           subjects in India treated with internal fixation?\n\n      Secondary objectives\n\n        1. How are infections managed in open and closed tibia fracture subjects in India treated\n           with internal fixation?\n\n        2. What is the treatment outcome for open and closed tibia fracture subjects in India\n           treated with internal fixation?\n\n        3. What is the influence of the following clinic and subject factors on the occurrence of\n           infection within one year for open and closed tibia fracture subjects in India treated\n           with internal fixation?\n\n             1. Hospital standard hygienic and antibiotic protocol for infection prevention\n\n             2. Subject demographics\n\n             3. Time between injury and surgery and between admission and surgery\n\n             4. Fracture type (AO M\u00fcller classification)\n\n             5. Soft tissue damage (according to the Tscherne classification for closed fractures\n                or Gustilo classification for open fractures)\n\n             6. Fracture management and implant type\n\n             7. Surgical details such as duration of surgery\n\n        4. Is there a difference in health-related quality of life as measured by the EuroQol-5\n           Dimensions (EQ-5D) between subjects with and without infections?\n\n        5. Is there a difference in the number of complications not related to infection (adverse\n           events and serious adverse events) between subjects with and without infections?"
