            "textblock": "This is a randomized controlled, open labeled multicenter, non-inferiority trial with\n      blinded assessment of outcome events. Implementation of this study is planned at Swiss\n      Stroke Centers or Units.\n\n      Identical investigations will be performed in all patients eligible to participate in this\n      study.\n\n      Imaging: For verification of CAD diagnosis, all study participants will undergo a\n      standardized routine MRI scan of brain and neck before study entry. 14 +/- 7 days after\n      treatment onset a second MRI of brain and neck will be performed. The following MRI\n      sequences will be performed on a 3 Tesla scanner (1) SE T1w, TSE T2w, FLAIR to detect\n      chronic ischemic brain lesions. (2) Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) including apparent\n      diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps to detect acute ischemic brain lesions. (3) SWI sequences\n      or T2*w gradient echo (GRE) to detect hemorrhagic brain lesions (4) contrast-enhanced\n      magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) to improve delineation of the wall hematoma against\n      the perfused vessel lumen, and to assess the degree of obstruction of the affected artery.\n      MRI scans will be centrally analysed at the University Hospital Basel, and independently\n      assessed by two observers who are blinded to the type of treatment and clinical outcome.\n\n      Clinical examination: Patients will be examined clinically by a neurologist at the screening\n      visit, at the randomization visit, 14 +/- 7 days after randomization, at 3 months and at 6\n      months after randomization. At each visit, clinical outcome events will be assessed, focal\n      neurological deficit measured using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Stroke Scale,12\n      and functional level of independence using the modified Rankin Scale13. Clinical outcome\n      events will be independently adjudicated in the coordinating center Basel, blinded to the\n      type of treatment.\n\n      Blood sampling for biomarkers analyses will be done at two times; the first as soon as\n      possible after verification of CAD-diagnosis and the second 14 +/- 7 days after treatment\n      onset. Measured biomarkers include: MMP9 and TIMP2. The biomarkers will be analysed with\n      multiplex electrochemiluminescent immunosorbent assays .\n\n      Treatment allocation: Patients will be randomized to receive either Aspirin (ASA) or\n      anticoagulants (ratio 1:1). ASA means Aspirin\u2122 300 mg q.d. given orally. In patients who\n      cannot swallow safely, ASA will be given intravenously (e.g. Aspegic\u2122 250 mg q.d.) until\n      swallowing function has recovered. Anticoagulants mean the use of vitamin K antagonists\n      (i.e., phenprocoumon [Marcoumar\u2122] or acenocoumarol [Sintrom\u2122]) with a target international\n      normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 - 3.0. Until the target INR has been reached, patients will\n      receive anticoagulation with i.v. heparin or low molecular weight heparin). The choice of\n      the distinct agent (e.g. phenprocoumon or acenocoumarol) can be chosen by the treating\n      physician and the patient, taking into account the experience with these agents\n      (phenprocoumon is more commonly used in the German speaking part, acenocoumarol is usually\n      used in the French speaking part of Switzerland). Treatment should start as soon as\n      diagnosis has been established, informed consent by patients or next-to-kin was obtained and\n      baseline MR-images have been performed (maximum time window maximum 24 hours). Treatment\n      duration will be 90 days +/-14 days (i.e., until the follow-visit 2).\n\n      Miscellaneous: The patients will be asked to allow the usage of anonymous study data for\n      possible individual patient data meta-analyses in the future in case of other randomized\n      clinical trials (RCT) studying the same subject will become available."
