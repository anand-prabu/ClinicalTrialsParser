  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the safety and effects over time for giving both ADASUVE and
      lorazepam (intramuscular) compared to that of each agent given alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the safety and pharmacodynamic profiles of
      concomitant administration of a single dose of ADASUVE and lorazepam (IM) compared to that
      of each agent administered alone. Respiratory pharmacodynamics will be monitored through
      recordings of respirations/minute and pulse oximetry. Other pharmacodynamic safety measures
      will include effects on blood pressure, heart rate, sedation and psychomotor measures of
      attention, information processing speed, reaction time, and coordination.

      Initially, 4 subjects will receive lorazepam 1 mg IM + ADASUVE 10 mg open label to validate
      the dose regimen. After the safety data are reviewed and the dose regimen confirmed, 18
      non-obese, healthy male or female volunteers between the ages of 18 and 50 will be enrolled
      in this double-blinded, double-dummy, randomized, 3-period cross-over drug interaction
      study.
