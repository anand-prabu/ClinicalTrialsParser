Interactive\n      Reminders is an interactive SMS reminder system to help patients remember to take their TB\n      medication.  In this system, patients receive daily SMS reminders for the duration of their\n      treatment at a pre-specified time, reminding them to take their medication. Patients are\n      asked to reply back to the system, either through SMS or a missed call, with the time they\n      took their medicine that day.  If a response is not received within two hours, a second\n      reminder is sent.  If a response is still not received in a further two hours, a third and\n      final reminder for the day is sent.  Non-responsive patients are followed up with phone\n      calls and a list of non-responsive patients is shared with clinics based on the parameters\n      of non-responsiveness that they specify.\n\n      IRD seeks to determine the impact of this system on treatment outcomes and compliance to\n      prescribed medication through administering a randomized control trial among newly diagnosed\n      TB patients in Karachi, Pakistan."
