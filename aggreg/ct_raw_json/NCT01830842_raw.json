Nonsmokers (n = 24) and smokers (n = 24) will\n      undergo fMRI scans on two separate occasions while performing a decision-making task that\n      will elicit prediction error signals in the mesocorticolimbic pathway of the brain.\n      Nonsmokers will be scanned once following an acute dose of nicotine and once following\n      placebo administration. Smokers will be scanned once following smoking as usual and once\n      following 24-hours of smoking abstinence, in order to measure the effects of nicotine\n      withdrawal. The study team hypothesizes that acute nicotine will increase the prediction\n      error signal in nonsmokers compared to placebo, and that nicotine withdrawal will decrease\n      the prediction error signal in smokers compared to the normal satiated condition.\n      Furthermore, nonsmokers (during the placebo condition) will have greater prediction error\n      activation than smokers (during the satiated condition). The results of this study will\n      inform whether the initiation and maintenance of smoking behavior could be facilitated by\n      the effects of nicotine on reinforcement learning."
