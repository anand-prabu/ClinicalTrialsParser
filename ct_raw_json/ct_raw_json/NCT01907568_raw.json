To date, the exact pathophysiological mechanism of these symptoms remains\n      unknown. By investigating (subtypes) of hallucinations and delusions in all populations, a\n      common pathway may be found, leading to more effective treatment options. Alternatively,\n      different subtypes may be associated with different pathophysiological mechanisms."
