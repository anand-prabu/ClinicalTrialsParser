    <textblock>
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center study During Visit 1 study
      information and an informed consent form are handed out. After study inclusion on Visit 2,

    <description>The primary objective is to assess effects of P. incarnata on psychological stress measured by Visual Analogue Scales (VAS; Bond and Lader 1974) by comparing scores collected before, during and after stress exposure between the P. incarnata and a placebo group. In this study, psychological stress is defined as stress perception, anxiety and insecurity. These three variables are determined simultaneously in the study before, during and after the stress test.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The STAI-X1 measures state anxiety (one scale). Answers are given on a four-point rating scale ranging from 1 = &quot;not at all&quot; to 4 = &quot;very true&quot;. The questionnaire is used as baseline measurement at V2. In addition, it is also employed before and immediately after the stress test at V3 to assess changes in state anxiety. Assess V2, before and after V3</description>

    <measure>POMS Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The POMS assesses the four states depression/anxiety, fatigue, vigor and hostility (4 scales). High vigor scores reflect a positive mood whereas high scores in the other subscales indicate negative mood. Subjects rate their mood state on a 7-point rating scale ranging from 1 = &quot;not at all&quot; to 7 = &quot;very strongly&quot;. The questionnaire is completed on V2 and V3.</description>

    <description>The MDBF assesses the three bipolar dimensions good/bad mood, wakefulness/tiredness and calmness/agitation (3 scales). The short form of the MDBF and its parallel version (versions A and B) each consist of 12 items. Subjects rate their mood state on a 5-point rating scale ranging from 1 = &quot;not at all&quot; to 5 = &quot;very true&quot;. To determine mood changes induced by the TSST, the questionnaire is completed shortly before (version A) and immediately after the TSST (version B). Assess before and after V3</description>
