This\n      study aims to investigate the effects of low intensity laser therapy (904nm) and stretching\n      exercises in pain, range of motion, flexibility, functionality and quality of life of\n      patients with knee OA according to the criteria of the American College of rheumatology.\n      Methods: The sample consists of 125 patients aged between 50 and 75 years, from the\n      Rehabilitation Center in the city of Tabo\u00e3o da Serra - S\u00e3o Paulo/Brasil, who have knee pain,\n      functional reduction in the last three months and grade between 2 and 4 classification of OA\n      by Kellgren and Lawrence (1957). Patients will be divided into five groups: Group A - Low\n      Intensity Laser Therapy (LILT) with an active dose of 3 Joules more stretching exercises,\n      Group B - LILT placebo plus stretching exercises, Group C - only stretching exercises, Group\n      D - only LILT and Group E - control. For groups A and B, in the first three weeks, the\n      treatment will be done with the LILT (active or placebo) totaling nine sessions and in the\n      next eight weeks will be performed stretching exercises totaling 24 sessions. C and D groups\n      will realize eight weeks of stretching exercises and LILT, respectively. The patients will\n      be assessed before and after each intervention. The clinical evaluation includes pain\n      intensity by visual analogue scale (VAS) functionality by the Lequesne's Functional\n      Questionnaire and Get Up and Go Test, the range of movement of flexion and knee extension\n      and shortening of the hamstrings with the goniometer; flexibility through the\n      finger-to-floor distance test and the quality of life by the Western Ontario and McMaster\n      Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC). The data will be considered statistically significant\n      at \u00b1 <0.05."

            "textblock": "Physical performance as a determinant of disability in osteoarthritis (OA) has been\n      investigated extensively, but research has focused primarily on the effect that the decrease\n      in muscle strength has on the functionality in patients with OA. However, the reduced range\n      of motion in affected joints is also an important risk factor for the occurrence of\n      locomotor disability and other developing disability in patients with OA.\n\n      Studies using stretching exercises are scarce in the Reid & Mc Nair (2010) specifically\n      examined the range of motion can be improved in subjects with knee osteoarthritis, although\n      this study did only stretching the hamstrings. The results indicate that there is immediate\n      benefits of stretching in subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee joint, providing evidence\n      for the long term development of stretching programs for this population.\n\n      In the literature are observed inconsistent results regarding the benefits of laser\n      treatment in improving pain and function in individuals with knee OA. Also there are few\n      studies that specify which dosage and frequency of laser must be used.\n\n      In view of the increasing need to support the role of physiotherapy in evidence-based\n      practice, this study is justified by the need to test the effectiveness of stretching\n      exercises and elucidate the effectiveness of low intensity laser therapy in patients with\n      knee OA."
