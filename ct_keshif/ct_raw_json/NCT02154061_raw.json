The change to micro-organisms in the intestines may\n      change the body's vaccine immune response and alter the effectiveness of the IIV (seasonal\n      flu) vaccine.\n\n      In particular, the investigators will be looking at certain markers in blood after\n      vaccination with IIV (seasonal flu vaccine) with or without the use of antibiotics before\n      vaccination.\n\n      There will be two randomized groups. Group A will start taking antibiotic by mouth 3 days\n      prior to vaccination and continue taking antibiotics the day of vaccination and one day\n      after vaccination for a total of 5 days. Group B will only receive the IIV (seasonal flu\n      vaccine) and will not take any antibiotics.\n\n      The investigators hope to enroll 22 subjects at Emory."
