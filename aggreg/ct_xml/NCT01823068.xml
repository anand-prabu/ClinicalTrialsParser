  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of vandetanib, in
      patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer harboring RET gene rearrangement. In 2011,
      gene rearrangement between RET and KIF5B gene (fusion) was discovered in a young, male lung
      cancer patient. The following studies showed that this gene rearrangement was critical for
      tumor initiation and maintenance. Of note, the growth and signaling properties mediated by
      KIF5B-RET were diminished after treatment with vandetanib.

      Until now, RET rearrangements have been known in thyroid cancers. Vandetanib, a multi-kinase
      inhibitors with anti-RET activity, is an FDA-approved drug for the treatments of adults with
      metastatic medullary thyroid cancers who are ineligible for surgery and who have progressive
      or symptomatic disease. This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of this drug,
      for the treatment of advanced lung cancer harboring RET rearrangement.

      Patients will be screened so as to confirm RET fusion in their tumor tissue. RET fusion will
      be tested using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) at central laboratory. Central
      laboratory of this study is the department of pathology at Seoul National University
      Hospital (SNUH) and tumor specimen should be sent to department of pathology at SNUH. Only
      patients whose tumor have confirmed RET gene fusion are eligible for this study.

      Enrolled patients will begin on once daily vandetanib at 300 mg with one cycle of 4 weeks.
      Renal-impaired patients (defined as patients with creatinine clearance ≥30 to &lt;50 mL/min at
      screening) will start treatment at the lower dose of 200 mg. Treatment will be continued
      till progression, unacceptable toxicity, or till 1 year. Vandetanib can be administered
      after 1 year to the patients with benefit from vandetanib.

      During the administration of vandetanib, vital signs, physical examination, ECOG performance
      status, height, weight, hematology and chemistry test, ECG, adverse events and concomitant
      drugs will be evaluated every four weeks (one cycle, for the first 6 months) or eight weeks
      (two cycles, from 6 months to 1 year) and, if necessary, chest X-ray and pregnancy test will
      also be performed. CT for tumor assessment will be performed once every 8 weeks for 1 year.
      If the disease progression is suspected, the test can be additionally conducted at the
      investigator's discretion.
