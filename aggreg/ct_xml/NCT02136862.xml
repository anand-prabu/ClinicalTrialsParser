  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is limited published clinical data about the natural history of renal disease in
      Alport syndrome.  The RG012-01 study will collect data to characterize the progression of
      renal dysfunction in Alport syndrome patients.

      Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Alport syndrome who have GFR between 30-75 mL/min
      (inclusive) will be considered for enrollment.  The sequential sampling of subjects' urine
      and/or blood will allow an assessment of the rate of change of established clinical
      endpoints, such as GFR and/or the rate of change of other renal biomarkers (proteinuria and
      β-2 microglobulin) in subjects whose renal function is steadily declining.  The
      identification of surrogate markers that track the decline of renal function and could
      correlate with time to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a key goal of the natural history
      study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a natural history study, designed to collect data from patients with Alport syndrome
      with GFR between 30-75 mL/min (inclusive). Assessments and blood and urine sample collection
      will be performed at Baseline and every 6 weeks thereafter, for up to 24 months.  Scheduling
      of clinic visits will take in to consideration the timing of Standard of Care (SOC) visits.
      Alternative arrangements may be made to enable subjects to schedule a home nurse visit for
      study procedures instead of certain clinic visits. Remaining blood and urine aliquots will
      be stored and may be used in the future for the discovery, analysis, verification and/or
      validation of other biomarkers or test for renal disease.  The samples will be kept for up
      to five years.  Each sample will be identified only by it's barcode number and will not be
      individually identifiable.
