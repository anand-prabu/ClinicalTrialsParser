  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2 study will be conducted at 10 centers and enroll patients from August 2013 to
      August 2015.Firstly, All patients included will provide written informed
      consent.Secondly,they will be randomized equally to receive modified VCD regimen1 arm or
      modified VCD regimen2 arm.In total, 47 patients per arm (or 94 in total) are required. The
      Treatment consists of four or six 4-week cycles of induction therapy followed by intensive
      therapy with auto-transplantation±modified VCD regimens and maintenance treatment with VD or
      CTD/TD regimen. Then,patients will be followed up for 24 months after chemotherapy. The
      investigators will record all the laboratory and clinical investigations to assess response
      at different points of the study. We also monitor and assess adverse events (AEs), as graded
      according to NCI-CTCAE Version 3.0.Response categories were based on the International
      Myeloma Working Group uniform response criteria.
