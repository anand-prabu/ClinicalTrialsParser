            "textblock": "The purpose of the study is to investigate the benefits of switching away from a kind of\n      drug called a boosted protease inhibitor (PI) to a new drug called dolutegravir on patients'\n      cardiovascular health (the health of their hearts). Patients are currently taking two other\n      anti-HIV drugs, called nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), with their\n      boosted PIs; these NRTIs will not be changed throughout the study. In order to compare the\n      boosted PI and dolutegravir more accurately, half of study participants will be switched to\n      dolutegravir immediately, and the other half will be switched after 48 weeks of continuing\n      on the boosted PI.\n\n      Boosted PIs are associated with increased heart and circulation risk so it is hoped that\n      switching from a boosted PI to dolutegravir will improve the health of the patients' hearts.\n      Dolutegravir is a drug for HIV treatment which has been approved for use in HIV patients in\n      the US and Europe. Clinical trials using dolutegravir have found that it is effective at\n      suppressing the HIV virus, and it  is at least as effective as the other drugs.\n\n      This study will also investigate the safety (in terms of other side effects and the routine\n      blood tests which the investigators ordinarily use to monitor patients' treatment) and\n      monitor effectiveness, patients' viral load and CD4 counts, when patients switch treatment\n      from a boosted PI to dolutegravir. Viral load is the amount of the HIV virus they have in\n      their blood, and CD4 count is a measure of a type of cell that is in their immune system. We\n      also aim to improve patients' cardiovascular health in general by providing them with\n      information on how to live a healthy lifestyle (eg improving their diet, stopping smoking\n      etc)."
