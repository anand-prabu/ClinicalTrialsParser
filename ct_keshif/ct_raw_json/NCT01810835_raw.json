The level of HBV-DNA varies according to HBe status and geographical\n      origin, and is strongly predictive of the risk of HBV mother-to-child transmission (MTCT).\n      It has been shown that the rate of vertical transmission (Chinese study by Yuan J et al) was\n      0 % in newborns to mothers whom HBV-DNA was < 105 copies/mL and up to more than 40 % in\n      newborns to mothers with high viral loads > 108 copies/mL, despite HBIg and vaccine at\n      birth. Thus, data are needed concerning the current practices about the prevention of HBV\n      MTCT in France, and their results."
