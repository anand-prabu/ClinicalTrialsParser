Usually, when HL relapses for the first time, the standard is to receive\n      combinations of chemotherapy, including an autologous blood or marrow transplant (BMT, also\n      called a stem cell transplant) which has about a 40% cure rate.  BMT may cure the HL, but\n      also may be associated with serious side effects and risks.  This research looks at a\n      combination of drugs for relapsed HL that may not have the side effects of standard\n      therapies and that does not involve BMT.  The goal is to treat the lymphoma effectively with\n      drugs that we expect will have fewer side effects, while avoiding a treatment like BMT."
