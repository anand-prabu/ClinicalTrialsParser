Accordingly, other\n      variables, such as ocular blood flow-related factors, have been implicated in disease\n      pathogenesis. However, most findings involving vascular variables come from partial,\n      small-scale studies. Furthermore, recent technological advances have identified a number of\n      ocular blood flow variables that have yet to be tested in large scale trials. Therefore, a\n      study that specifically aims at uncovering the role of vascular aspects in glaucoma is\n      needed.\n\n      For this purpose, a cross-sectional, observational case-control study will be conducted in\n      the University Hospitals Leuven. This will be the largest-yet study on the subject,\n      involving more than 750 patients. This will allow the creation of a specific cohort of\n      patients where the vascular aspects are thought to be particularly important (low-tension\n      glaucoma). It will use the largest combination yet of vascular-related measuring techniques\n      (dynamic contour tonometry, optic coherent tomography, colour Doppler imaging and retinal\n      oximetry)"
