      The aim of this study is to further characterize the safety profile of IMOJEV®.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To describe serious adverse events (SAEs, including adverse events of special interest
           [AESIs]) up to 60 days after administration of one dose of IMOJEV®.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To describe Grade 3 (severe) systemic Adverse Events (AEs) up to 30 minutes after
           administration of one dose of IMOJEV®.

      Participants aged 1 year to less than 5 years will be randomized to receive one injection of
      IMOJEV® either as a primary vaccination or as a booster. Safety data will be collected for
      60 days after IMOJEV® vaccination. The duration of each subject's participation in the trial
      will be 60 days.
