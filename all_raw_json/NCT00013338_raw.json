Each subject will receive twelve weeks of either CGT or STAT, given as 20\n      minutes of training within a one-hour period per day, five days per week.  These subjects\n      will be studied baseline, 4,8 and 12 weeks of training, and three months after the end of\n      training with a battery of tests designed to evaluate the subjects' gait and muscle\n      function."
