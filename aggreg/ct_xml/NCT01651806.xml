  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypotheses: Primary - A weighted dose of 20 mg/kg of tranexamic acid will be more
      efficacious than a single uniform dose of 1 gram in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA)
      cases.  This includes having a greater impact on decreasing blood loss without increasing
      the occurrence of adverse thromboembolic events in patients undergoing primary, elective
      total knee arthroplasty.

      Secondary - TA will decrease blood loss more effectively in women than in men undergoing
      this procedure.

      Overall Study Design

      Study design and control methods:

      This study is designed as a prospective, randomized, double-blinded controlled clinical
      trial to compare the effect of a single uniform 1 g dose of TA and a single weighted 20
      mg/kg dose of tranexamic acid (TA).

      Treatment group:

      The subjects will be randomly assigned to the uniform dose group or weighted dose group at
      the time of the surgery via the opening of a randomly selected closed envelope. The patient
      and the independent reviewer will be blinded as to the dose of TA utilized during the
      surgery. This information will be linked to a confidential database for later review by the
      principal investigator.

      Treatment allocation:

      All eligible patients (i.e., meeting inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria) will be
      treated and observed per the research protocol. All patients will maintain the right to
      refuse participation and receive a specific treatment of the study if desired.

      Trial Population

      Target population:

      The target sample size is 60 patients of each of the uniform and weighted dose groups (120
      total) with each group split evenly between males and females. There will be one actively
      enrolling surgeon (Dr. Brett Levine). The goal is to enroll a total of 120 subjects
      experiencing joint pain that warrants a TKA. The specific diagnosis for the joint pain will
      not direct the subjects' assignment or eligibility at the time of surgery. All 120 patients
      will be enrolled from the office of the primary investigator (Dr. Brett Levine). All
      indications for TKA will be included unless one of the exclusion criteria is met.
