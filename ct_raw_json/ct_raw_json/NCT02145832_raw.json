            "textblock": "The epidemiology of candidiasis is rapidly changing; recent estimates are that nearly 50% of\n      Candida bloodstream isolates are non-albicans Candida species requiring the use of\n      treatments active against them.\n\n      Because of the high risk associated with candida infection in premature babies and\n      fluconazole prophylaxis is now recommended in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) with a\n      high incidence in fungal infections. As candida infection is difficult to prove and requires\n      an urgent treatment, in particular to avoid central nervous system (CNS) infection,\n      treatment is often started in high risk patients when the infection is only suspected, i.e.\n      on clinical arguments without waiting for positive cultures (10% of cases).\n\n      Fluconazole has not been approved for use in the treatment of neonatal candidiasis. In\n      contrast, the efficacy of echinocandins for the treatment of invasive candidiasis has been\n      suggested by pre-clinical and clinical studies.\n\n      Related to Micafungin, the available data suggest that only dosages that are greater than\n      what currently recommended in infants (2 to 4 mg/kg/day) may ensure adequate coverage of the\n      CNS, given that ability of low dosages of micafungin to penetrate the cerebrospinal\n      compartment and to diffuse in the cerebrospinal fluid is deemed suboptimal.\n\n      The doses that will be administered are higher that currently used in order to optimize\n      efficacy, and the concept of a loading dose that will be used for both drugs in this\n      project, is present in antifungal treatment strategies for adults, but it has never been\n      applied to infants and preterm neonates."
