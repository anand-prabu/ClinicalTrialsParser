      extended-release (ER) as a potential smoking cessation aid in treatment-seeking smokers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nicotine dependence is a major public health problem and currently available treatments are
      ineffective for the majority of smokers.  Thus, there is an urgent need to develop and test
      new medications to aid in smoking cessation.  Recent evidence from a genetic study of
      prospective smoking cessation conducted at the CIRNA suggested smoking cessation may be
      influenced by variationin acetylcholine levels.  The proposed proof-of-concept study is a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm pilot study of the effects of the
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, galantamine (vs. placebo), on short-term abstinence among 24
      treatment-seeking smokers. The primary outcome is the number of days abstinence a 7 day quit
      attempt.  Secondary outcomes include: smoking rate during the run-up and monitored
      abstinence phase, medication adherence, side effects, cognitio, and smoking urges and other
      withdrawal symptons.  The pilot data generated will be used to support an NIH grant
      application by a new investigatot to evaluate whether acetylcholinesterase inhibitors could
      be effective smoking cessation medications.

        study.

        General Exclusion

          2. Not planning to live in the area for the next two months.

          3. Any medical condition, illness, disorder, or concomitant medication that could

             determined by the Principal Investigator.

          6. Not able to effectively communicate in English (reading, writing, speaking).

          7. Missing 2 or more consecutive sessions, or 3 or more sessions during the medication
