Further improvement of cardioprotection is\n      therefore necessary. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is an easy and non-invasive\n      method. Laboratory research has shown promising results regarding myocardial survival during\n      open heart surgery, but the clinical value of RIPC is still largely unknown. The\n      investigators hypothesize that RIPC before coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) reduces\n      the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF)."
