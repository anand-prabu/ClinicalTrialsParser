            "textblock": "Fondaparinux is a parenteral anticoagulant drug approved for the prophylaxis of venous\n      thromboembolism in high risk medical patients. A relevant proportion of these patients have\n      renal insufficiency and/or thrombocytopenia which represent independent risk factors for\n      bleeding. The risk of bleeding may be increased when fondaparinux is administered to\n      patients with a reduced renal function and/or low platelet count. A lower dose of\n      fondaparinux, 1.5 mg daily, has been approved for patients with renal insufficiency defined\n      by a creatinine clearance between 20 and 50 mL/min. However, to our knowledge, there are no\n      clinical studies that have specifically evaluated prophylaxis with fondaparinux in\n      acutely-ill medical patients with a moderate to severe thrombocytopenia. The scope of this\n      study is to evaluate the safety of fondaparinux in high risk hospitalized medical patients\n      with a moderate to severe thrombocytopeniada defined by a platelet count between 100,000/uL\n      and 30,000/uL."
