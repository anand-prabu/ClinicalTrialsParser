  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      UPGRADE aims to see whether data from Pharmacogenomic Testing (PGx) can help physicians
      manage patient medication regimens and assess if the testing has an effect on reducing
      adverse drug reactions, hospitalizations and emergency department visits.

      The way an individual processes a drug is in part determined by their genes, and  there is
      known to be genetic variation between humans in the way drugs are metabolized.  The study of
      the way genes affect a person's response to drugs is known as &quot;Pharmacogenomics.&quot;

A genotype known to affect a target drug is identified by PGx testing, AND
The treating physician makes at least one target drug regimen change in dose, frequency, or route of administration, or when target drug discontinuation or substitutions occur.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject underwent pharmacogenomic testing for genes known to influence metabolism of
             at least one target drug with the prior 1-year period

          -  Subject is able and willing to provide written informed consent

          -  Subject has a history of at least one target drug related adverse event or an
             inadequate therapeutic effect from target drug over the 12-month period preceding
             receipt of pharmacogenomic test results

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is currently hospitalized

          -  Subject's medical and medication history is unavailable over the 90-day periods
             preceding and following the receipt of pharmacogenomic test results

          -  Subject is unable to provide an accurate history due to mental incapacity

          -  Subject is known to have undergone prior pharmacogenomic testing for genes specific
             to the target drugs within the 2-year period preceding enrollment
