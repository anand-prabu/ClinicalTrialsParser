Yoga is an ancient physical and mental practice that as\n      a form of exercise may share properties of TAE and in turn offer similar mood and stress\n      effects. However, scientifically rigorous studies examining the psychological effects of\n      yoga and published in peer-reviewed Western journals are rare. The aim of this research was\n      to establish preliminary evidence for the acute effects of vinyasa yoga on mood and stress\n      among young adults."
