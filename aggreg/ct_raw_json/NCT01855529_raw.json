They respond poorly\n      to opioid analgesics impair the quality of life.\n\n      Among the different postoperative analgesic techniques used, the use of a local anesthetic\n      infiltration continues catheter has advantages including improving the quality of analgesia,\n      with a significant decrease in average of VAS (scale visual Analogue), a decrease in\n      morphine consumption, improving the quality of life of patients.\n\n      Our study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a continuous local anesthetic infiltration\n      in the control of postoperative pain after mastectomy."
