      The general aim of this 1-day, open label, non-randomised, trial is to characterize the
      performance of an adapter device designed to permit use of the Respimat® inhaler with
      patients requiring mechanical ventilation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  All patients or their health care proxy must sign an informed consent consistent with
             International Conference on Harmonization (ICH)-Good Clinical Practice (GCP)
             guidelines prior to participation in the trial.

          -  Male or female patients, 40 years of age or older

          -  Patients must have a pre-admission/pre-ventilation diagnosis of chronic obstructive
             pulmonary disease, and have a history of treatment with an inhaled bronchodilator.

          -  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients must be current or ex-smokers
             with a smoking history of at least 10 pack years. Note that the availability of prior
             confirmatory spirometry is desirable but not required for participation in the trial

          -  Patients must have a clinically relevant and acceptable elective or semi-elective
             indication for intubation and initiation of mechanical ventilation prior to
             consideration for trial enrollment.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patients with disease, respiratory or non-respiratory, that is sufficiently unstable
             (beyond the need for intubation and routine mechanical ventilation) such that their
             condition will, in the opinion of the investigator (i) put them at risk because of
             participation in the study, (ii) influence the results of the study [including the
             assessment of pharmacokinetic parameters], or (iii) cause concern regarding their
             ability to participate in the study for its duration of one (nominal) day.

          -  Patients with any of the following specific conditions:

               -  A history or diagnosis or treatment of asthma within the previous 10 years

               -  A current indication for &quot;crash&quot; or emergency intubation and ventilation (such
                  as a cardio and/or respiratory arrest).

               -  Any systemic or respiratory condition or degree of instability that in the
                  judgment of the principal investigator renders the patient unlikely to safely
                  participate in or complete the study. Investigators are encouraged to contact
                  the trial clinical monitor or team member medicine should there be any question
                  about the suitability of a particular patient for this study.

               -  A diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis (due to the known class side effect profile of
                  ß2-agonists)

               -  A diagnosis of paroxysmal tachycardia (&gt;100 beats per minute) (due to the known
                  class side effect profile of ß2-agonists)

               -  A myocardial infarction within the past six weeks

               -  Unstable or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia within the past six weeks

               -  A diagnosis of Class III or IV heart failure  within the past six weeks

               -  Renal and/or hepatic failure to an extent likely to significantly affect drug
                  metabolism and the consequent effect on the determination of pharmacokinetic
                  parameters as determined by the investigator.

               -  Known active tuberculosis

               -  Currently under treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy for a
                  malignancy.

               -  Clinically evident bronchiectasis

          -  Patients who have taken an investigational drug within one month or six half lives
             (whichever is greater) prior to screening. (Note that for the purpose of this trial,
             commercially available and previously prescribed/administered Combivent Respimat® or
             Combivent Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) will not be precluded as &quot;investigational&quot;.)

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to ß-adrenergics drugs, anticholinergic drugs,
             Benzalkonium chloride (BAC), Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), or any other
             component of the Respimat® inhalation solution delivery system

          -  Pregnant or nursing women

          -  Women of childbearing potential not using two effective methods of birth control (one
             barrier and one non-barrier). Female patients will be considered to be of
             childbearing potential unless surgically sterilized by hysterectomy or bilateral
             tubal ligation, or post-menopausal for at least two years

          -  Patients who have previously been randomised in this study or are currently
             participating in another study
