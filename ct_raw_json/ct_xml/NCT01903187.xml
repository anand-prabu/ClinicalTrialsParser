        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is ≥18 years of age and ≤ 80 years of age at time of informed consent for
             participation in the clinical investigation

          -  Subject must be able and willing to provide written informed consent

          -  Subject must be able and willing to comply with the required follow-up schedule

          -  Subject has an office Systolic Blood Pressure ≥ 160 mmHg based on an average of 3
             Blood Pressure readings at the confirmatory visit (except for subjects with Diabetes
             Mellitus Type II who must demonstrate an office Systolic Blood Pressure of ≥ 150
             mmHg)

          -  Subject has a daytime mean Systolic 24-hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure value of ≥ 140
             mmHg as measured during the two week screening period and confirmed at the
             confirmatory visit

          -  Subject is taking ≥ 3 antihypertensive medications concurrently at full tolerated
             doses (this must include one diuretic) or subject is taking a diuretic and has a
             documented intolerance to at least two (2) out of the three (3) remaining major
             classes of anti-hypertensives (ACE / ARB, Calcium Channel Blockers, Beta blockers and
             is unable to take 3 anti-hypertensive drugs)

             o Intolerance is defined as an absolute contraindication to an anti-hypertensive
             medication according to the approved labeling or an inability to take an
             anti-hypertensive medication as prescribed due to an adverse drug effect including an
             immune mediated response or interaction with other medications.

          -  Subjects must be on a stable antihypertensive medication regimen for a minimum of 2
             weeks prior to completing the initial screening visit and the medication regimen must
             remain unchanged during the 2 week screening period following signing consent.
             Subject must be assessed at the confirmatory visit with no expected changes for at
             least six (6) months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has known cause of secondary hypertension other than sleep apnea

             &gt;30%, previous renal stenting or angioplasty, renal artery occlusion, renal vein
             thrombosis, renal aneurysm or renal atheroembolism

          -  Subject has had a myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, or cerebrovascular
             accident &lt; 180 days prior to enrollment

             significant anemia

          -  Subject life expectancy is &lt; 12 months, as determined by a Study Investigator

          -  Subject is participating in another Clinical Investigation (IND or IDE)

          -  Subject is pregnant, nursing, or of childbearing potential and is not using adequate
             contraceptive methods

          -  Subject has active systemic infection as determined by a Study Investigator

          -  Subject has main renal arteries with diameter(s) &lt; 4 mm in diameter or &lt; 20 mm in
             length or multiple renal arteries where the main renal arteries supply &lt;75% of the
             kidney

          -  Subject has eGFR &lt; 45 mL/min per 1.73 m2 using the Modified of Diet in Renal Disease
             (MDRD) formula

          -  Subject has evidence of significant abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) defined as an
             aneurysm size of ≥5.0 cm in width and/or involving the renal arteries, and/or
             requiring surgical or percutaneous intervention within 6 months of enrollment.

          -  Subject has had &gt;1 in-patient hospitalization for a hypertensive crisis within 12
             months prior to enrollment

          -  Subject has a condition which would interfere with the accurate interpretation of the
             study endpoints including but not limited to orthostatic hypotension, chronic oxygen
             support other than for sleep apnea, primary pulmonary hypertension, Type I Diabetes
             Mellitus, pheochromocytoma, Cushing's disease, coarctation of the aorta,
             hyperthyroidism, or hyperparathyroidism, large arm diameter that is unable to
             accommodate the blood pressure cuff, arrhythmia that interferes with automatic pulse
             sensing.

          -  Any condition that would prohibit or interfere with the ability to obtain accurate
             Blood Pressure measurements using the CIP specific automatic Blood Pressure monitor

          -  Subject has Systolic Blood Pressure values which are greater than 20mmHg apart after
             six (6) measurements as assessed at the confirmatory visit
