Researchers are collecting blood samples to develop way to make a\n      special cell product called    induced pluripotent stem cells    (iPSCs). iPSCs may be used\n      to repair or replace organs and tissues, produce blood and immune cells for transfusion, or\n      correct inherited immune and blood diseases. iPSCs can be made from many kinds samples, such\n      as skin, blood, or hair. This is different from embryonic stem cells, which can only be\n      derived from embryos.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To develop new methods to make iPSCs; to identify better ways to collect, produce, and\n      grow them; and to make an iPSC bank.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Healthy adults and adults already in a treatment protocol who have a medical condition\n      that could be treated with iPSCs.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  All participants will be screened with questionnaire, physical exam, and blood and HIV\n           tests.\n\n        -  All participants:\n\n        -  Will donate 4 tablespoons of blood. It will be taken by needle from a vein in their\n           arm.\n\n        -  Participants already in another protocol:\n\n        -  Will have their blood collected, separated in a lab, and iPSCs grown in large numbers.\n           Some may have their sample given back to them as a treatment.\n\n        -  Samples will be kept in the study up to 5 years or until a participant withdraws from\n           the study or becomes ineligible to participate, or the study is closed. If participants\n           have not withdrawn their consent, they may be contacted in the future to donate again."

            "textblock": "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be produced from small quantities of blood.\n      Clinical protocols to treat several diseases using iPSCs or cells derived from iPSCs are\n      being developed by intramural investigators, i.e., investigators in National Institute of\n      Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and National Eye Institute (NEI). This clinical\n      protocol will allow personnel in the Cell Processing Service (CPS) of the Department of\n      Transfusion Medicine (DTM) to collect blood from healthy donors or patients with diseases\n      targeted in IRB-approved treatment protocols to manufacture iPSCs or iPSC derived products\n      to support these intramural investigators.  CPS DTM will submit a Drug Master File (DMF) to\n      the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the manufacture and testing of these products.\n      When iPSCs are used clinically in some cases the donors will be the recipients of the iPSCs,\n      or the ex vivo expanded and differentiated iPSCs (autologous therapy).  In other cases,\n      healthy subjects will serve as donors of the blood used as starting material for\n      manufacturing iPSCs (allogeneic therapy) where no matching of HLA or other antigens is\n      required between the healthy blood donor and the iPSC recipient.\n\n      While methods to produce and expand iPSCs have been described, they must be modified\n      periodically to meet changing Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) requirements for\n      manufacturing clinical cell and gene therapies, therefore peripheral blood for iPSCs from\n      normal donors is needed for research and development.\n\n      The purpose of this protocol is to collect blood from:\n\n        1. healthy volunteers to produce clinical grade iPSCs (allogeneic) to treat Clinical\n           Center (CC) patients participating in an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved\n           clinical trial;\n\n        2. patients to produce iPSCs which will be used for their own treatment (autologous\n           therapy) participating in an IRB-approved clinical trial; and\n\n        3. healthy volunteers to obtain research samples with the aim of improving GMP methods for\n           iPSC production, expansion and differentiation.\n\n      The iPSCs will be produced in the GMP Clinical Cell Processing Laboratory, located in CPS,\n      DTM, CC.  Cells will be differentiated into specific cell types or tissues for patient\n      administration.  iPSC therapies may consist of either fresh or cryopreserved cells. Up to\n      250 subjects will be enrolled in this study.  This protocol will provide a mechanism for\n      obtaining blood from individuals with the goal of providing iPSCs and iPSC-derived products\n      that can be used for patient care and research.  This is not a treatment protocol.  Subjects\n      receiving products derived from these iPSC products will be required to be enrolled in a\n      specific IRB-approved treatment protocol that will contain the cell dose, method of\n      administration, treatment regimen, and where indicated, the specific regulatory approvals\n      (i.e., IND)."
