    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of an investigational drug called LB 100 for
      Injection for treatment of solid tumors, when given with or without docetaxel. LB-100 is a
      small molecule that in laboratory and animal studies has shown activity when used by itself
      or together with drugs approved to treat some types of cancer (chemotherapeutic agents).
      Docetaxel is a drug that has been approved for the treatment of some types of cancer; one of
      the trade names for docetaxel is TaxotereÂ®. The study is in 2 parts. Part 1: Patients will
      receive injections of LB-100. Part 2: Patients will receive injections of LB-100 and
      docetaxel. This is the first study where LB-100 for Injection will be used in humans.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Part 1 only: Patients with histologically or cytologically proven progressive or
             metastatic solid tumors who have failed standard treatment and have no other
             effective treatment available.

             Part 2 only: Patients with histologically or cytologically proven progressive or
             metastatic solid tumors who have failed standard treatment and have no other
             effective treatment available, or docetaxel-naive patients who have failed standard
             treatment and have tumors for which a docetaxel-based regimen would be appropriate.

          2. Part 2 only: Patients must be docetaxel-naive.

          3. Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          4. Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of
             0 or 1.

          5. Patients must be men and women &gt;= 18 years of age.

          6. Patients must have recovered from all acute adverse effects (excluding alopecia) of
             prior therapies to baseline or &lt;= grade 1 prior to study entry.

          7. Patients must have adequate bone marrow function, defined as an absolute neutrophil
             count &gt;= 1.5 x 10^9/L and a platelet count &gt;= 100 x 10^9/L.

          8. Patients must have adequate renal function, defined as serum creatinine &lt;= 1.2 mg/dL
             (if &gt; 1.2 mg/dL, a calculated creatinine clearance [Cockcroft-Gault method] must be
             &gt;= 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2).

          9. Patients must have adequate hepatic function, defined as:

               -  Part 1 only: plasma total bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 mg/dL, alanine transaminase (ALT) and
                  aspartate transaminase (AST) &lt;= 2.5 X ULN (upper limit of normal).

                  concomitant with alkaline phosphatase &lt;= 2.5 X ULN.
