The study will use positron emission tomography\n      (PET scan) to detect areas of the brain receiving increased blood flow and using increased\n      amounts of glucose.  Increases in blood flow and glucose use are good indicators of brain\n      activity.\n\n      Researchers are interested in determining the effects of Vigabatrin on brain blood flow and\n      glucose use."
