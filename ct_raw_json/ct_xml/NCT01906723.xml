  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unstrained ambulation is the main goal of gait rehabilitation for preventing fatigue and
      increasing functionality in patients with gait deficiencies. The Up n' Free (Easy Walking)
      is a gait trainer equipped with a dynamic partial weight-bearing. The trainer is designed to
      provide the user with independence, safety, and endurance. It allows for easy transfer from
      sitting to standing position and stabilizes the pelvis, allowing for free movement of the
      hands. The effectiveness of the Up n' Free trainer in increasing the patient's functionality
      at the hospital or at home has not been quantified. We therefore aim to evaluate
      effectiveness of the gait trainer in increasing the functionality and spatiotemporal
      parameters of gait of 4 patients.

      Four ambulatory adults with postpolio syndrome, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy and
      spinal cord injury will be recruited for the study (one of each pathology).

      Inclusion criteria:

        -  Ambulatory patients ages of 18 and above

        -  Cognitive and cooperative ability to follow simple instructions

        -  Independently capable to understand an informed consent form

        -  Weight below 100kg

      Exclusion criteria:

      • Cognitive disorders preventing the subject from understanding the trial protocol or
      following the researcher's instructions

      2.2 Trial Protocol The subjects will be recruited from the rehabilitation department at the
      Hadassah medical center. Each subject will understand and agree to an informed consent form
      pretrial. The subjects' age, weight, and BMI will be documented. They will then receive a
      10- minutes instruction on using the Up n' Free gait trainer and will be provided with the
      trainer for the 1-week duration of the trial. Spatiotemporal parameters and gait symmetry
      will be recorded in the Hadassah gait laboratory, while the patient ambulates with his or
      her own walking aid. Physical Activity (PA) will be assessed using triaxial
      accelerometer-based activity monitors (ActiGraph GT3X, Pensacola, Florida, USA), using a
      preset sampling epoch of 1s. The participants will be instructed to wear the activity
      monitors on their right hip for 7 consecutive days and only remove it during night time
      sleep or water activities. At the end of 7 days the subjects will return the Up n' Free gait
      trainer and fill out a satisfactory questionnaire. Spatiotemporal parameters and gait
      symmetry will be recorded again in the Hadassah gait laboratory, while the patient ambulates
      with the Up n' Free.

      2.3 Data Analysis Estimates of the PA will be weighed by 5/7th of the weekly activity for
      the weekdays (Sunday-Thursday) and 2/7th for weekend days (Friday and Saturday) as
      within-week variation is expected. Total PA (1,000 counts × day−1), wear time PA (count ×
      min−1), sedentary time (hours × day−1; between 0-99 counts/min), low-light PA (min×day−1;
      between 100-759 counts/min), High-light PA (min × day−1; 760-2019 counts/min),
      moderate-vigorous PA (min × day−1; ≥2020 counts/min).
