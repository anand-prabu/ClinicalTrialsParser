            "textblock": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in Denmark and Europe, accounting\n      for 1.92 million deaths in Europe per year: over one in five men (21%) and one in five women\n      (22%) die from CHD.\n\n      Patients presenting with a ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)have despite advanced\n      treatment with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) a significant mortality and\n      morbidity at one year with 17.4% of patients dying from a cardiovascular cause or being\n      hospitalised from heart failure.\n\n      Remote Ischaemic Conditioning (RIC) applied at the time of myocardial reperfusion can reduce\n      myocardial infarct size, confirming the existence of myocardial reperfusion injury. In this\n      respect, RIC has been shown to limit myocardial infarct size and preserve cardiac function\n      in STEMI patients undergoing pPCI.\n\n      RIC is performed in the ambulance during transport to the PCI unit by cycles of inflations\n      of a blood pressure cuff to induce four 5-minute cycles of limb ischaemia and reperfusion.\n      The method is virtually cost-free non-pharmacological and non-invasive therapeutic strategy.\n\n      Hypothesis:\n\n      RIC followed by pPCI improves clinical outcomes in STEMI patients when compared to STEMI\n      controls undergoing standard pPCI evaluated one year post PCI.\n\n      Trial Design and aim:\n\n      Multinational investigator-driven, multi-centre, randomized, controlled, single-blind\n      (Outcomes Assessor), parallel assignment, prospective clinical efficacy trial. A total of\n      2300 patients are to be included over a 36 months period.\n\n      Overall primary objective To determine whether RIC improves clinical outcomes\n      (Cardiovascular mortality and hospitalisation for heart failure) at one year in 2300 STEMI\n      patients undergoing pPCI.\n\n      Secondary objectives:\n\n      To determine, in the pre-specified subgroups, whether age, gender, diabetes, and duration of\n      chest pain to PCI influence the response to RIC.\n\n      To determine whether RIC preserves left ventricular function measured by echocardiography\n      after three months post pPCI.\n\n      Study progress The patient will be informed and treated according to the national and\n      international guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and protected under the Act concerning\n      the processing of personal data and health law.\n\n      The admitting ambulance doctor or doctor at the receiving hospital will orally inform the\n      patient and hand out the approved short written information. After information is given in\n      the acute phase the patient does not have much time for reflection before signing the\n      informed consent form.\n\n      Therefore a full written information and additional oral information will be given to the\n      patient after the acute phase by a study nurse or the doctor performing the pPCI. As well\n      during the first and second stage of information it will be emphasised that the patient has\n      the right to withdraw his/her informed consent at any time.\n\n      After informed consent is obtained the patient will be randomised via a secure web-site to\n      either pPCI with or without RIC by the the doctor on duty at the receiving hospitals.\n      Computer-generated blocked randomisation lists, stratified by centre, will be prepared in\n      advance of the study.\n\n      pPCI incl. the use of stents and antithrombotic regimens will be performed according to\n      standard procedures at the treating hospital.\n\n      Blood samples (acute, 6-8, 24 and 72 hours after pPCI will be drawn during the acute phase\n      at the treating hospital or at the local hospital.\n\n      Three days after pPCI an echocardiography (ECCO) will be performed at the hospital. Further\n      three months after pPCI an ECCO will be performed at the  hospital.\n\n      Information regarding re-hospitalisation or death will be drawn from electronic patient\n      chart.\n\n      Benefit of the study Potential benefits: Participating patients will be offered an extra\n      clinical out patient control, incl. an echocardiography three months  after pPCI.\n\n      Disadvantage: In relation to the inflation of the blood pressure cuff temporary moderate\n      pains in the treated arm might occur. Otherwise, the RIC has previously been proven to be\n      without side effects.\n\n      An extra blood sampling of app. 15 ml will be drawn 72 hours after pPCI. A small but\n      insignificant risk of local infection in relation to this is a risk."
