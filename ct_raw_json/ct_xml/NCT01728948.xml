  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective,single arm, multi-center pilot study includes 120 mRCC patients over 65
      years, no prior systemic treatment, determined to be candidates for systemic therapy by the
      investigator. The treatment with Sorafenib should comply with the recommendations written in
      the local product information. The primary endpoint is overall survival.the secondary
      endpoins including other effectiveness points, safety and patinet characteristics. With 120
      completed patients,if the observed survival rate at 12 months is 60%, the width of a 95%
      confidence interval will be approximately 18%.
