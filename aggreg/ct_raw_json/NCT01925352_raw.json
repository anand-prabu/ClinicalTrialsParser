Gene therapy offers an attractive alternative to current pharmacologic therapies and\n           may be beneficial in refractory disease. Gene therapy with hepatocyte growth factor\n           induces angiogenesis, decreases apoptosis and leads to protection in the ischemic\n           heart. In this study, we mainly explore the safety and effects of adenovirus hepatocyte\n           growth factor for the treatment of ischemic heart disease."
