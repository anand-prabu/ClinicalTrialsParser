Study\n      subjects will identify potential Medication Adherence Partners (MAPs) who can receive\n      information about their adherence patterns at enrollment. For the 90-day trial, subjects\n      will be randomized to: 1) the subject's MAP receives daily notification about whether\n      subject took statin; 2) the subject's MAP receives weekly about how often the subject took\n      statin during previous week; 3) the subject's MAP receives notification if the subject\n      missed >2 consecutive daily doses of statin; and 4) usual care (GlowCaps without any\n      notifications). The primary outcome will be the percent of statin doses taken during the\n      study as measured by the GlowCaps. The secondary outcome will be subjects' statin medication\n      possession ratio (MPR) during the study."
