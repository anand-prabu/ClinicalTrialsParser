  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether low-level laser therapy can improve
      hearing thresholds in individuals with hearing loss. Subjects will be randomly assigned to a
      treatment, placebo, or control group. The treatment group will be given a three treatment of
      low-level laser therapy, which consists of shining low-level lasers beams onto the ear and
      head. The laser beams are cool to the touch, and do not cause discomfort. Each laser
      treatment will last approximately 4 minutes. Three treatments will be applied three times
      within the course of one week. Hearing tests will be administered immediately before
      treatment, immediately after treatment, and six weeks after treatment. Results will be
      analyzed to determine the effect of the laser treatment on hearing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low-level laser therapy has been practiced for about 20 years in Europe and is beginning to
      be practiced in the US. Theoretically, laser energy in the red and near infrared light
      spectrum is capable of penetrating 2-5 cm into tissue and can stimulate mitochondria in the
      cells to produce more energy (through the production of adenosine triphosphate), which in
      turn may help prevent or repair tissue damage. The effects of low-level laser therapy on
      hearing have not been well studied. It has been suggested that laser therapy might help
      repair damage to the cochlea and restore some degree of hearing loss. Studies of low-level
      laser stimulation of cochleae utilizing microscopy, PET imaging, and MRI suggest potential
      therapeutic benefit to hearing. While preliminary studies suggest a possible improvement in
      hearing thresholds, a carefully controlled study is needed to verify the results using a
      valid battery of audiological tests.

    <description>Portable unit containing two laser diodes producing 532 and 635 nm wavelengths. Both diodes produced energy levels of 7.5 mw (class IIIb). Beams from both diodes were dispersed through lenses to create parallel line-generated beams, rather than spots. The 532 nm light was constant, and the 635 nm light was pulsed, with frequencies of 15 and 33 Hz. The pulsing alternated between frequencies every 30 seconds.</description>
