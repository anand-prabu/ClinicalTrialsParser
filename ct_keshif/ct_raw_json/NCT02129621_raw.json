Serum\n      aldosterone level is insufficient to know if the mineralocorticoid receptor is activated or\n      not. The aim of this study is to identify biomarkers of mineralocorticoid receptor activity.\n      The first \"candidate biomarker\" is Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) or\n      \"lipocalin\" which being measured in blood or in the urine. According to scientific\n      knowledge's evolution, others biomarkers could be tested later thanks to the blood or\n      urinary samples taken during study."
