This condition can lead to significant pain and limit a person's ability to\n      function.  Moreover, doctors disagree about the best way to treat people with lumbar spinal\n      stenosis.\n\n      In this study we will compare surgical treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis with nonsurgical\n      treatment using physical therapy. The results of this study should help clarify which\n      treatment strategies are the most effective for patients with lumbar spinal stenosis."

The prevalence of this\n      condition is growing as the population continues to age. Substantial controversy exists\n      regarding the management of lumbar spinal stenosis. Surgery has traditionally been the\n      treatment of choice, although physicians typically recommend a trial of nonsurgical care\n      prior to surgery. The most effective means of nonsurgical treatment has not been identified,\n      although a \"standard\" regimen has been developed.\n\n      There is presently no evidence in the literature regarding the relative effectiveness of\n      surgical versus nonsurgical treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis, or the efficacy of the\n      standard nonsurgical treatment approach. This randomized clinical trial will compare\n      surgical decompression versus nonsurgical treatment (i.e., physical therapy) of lumbar\n      spinal stenosis. The results of this study should help clarify which treatment strategies\n      are the most effective for patients with lumbar spinal stenosis."
