This study will use\n      the hematologic response rate, defined as the proportion of subjects showing improvement in\n      at least one of the three blood cell lineages or a decrease in blood transfusion volume, as\n      the primary endpoint.\n\n      Twenty patients will be enrolled in the study. Treatment with eltrombopag will be started at\n      25 milligram (mg)/day and increased by 25 mg/day every 2 weeks according to the platelet\n      count up to 100 mg/day. Response assessment will be performed at 3 months after starting the\n      study treatment (Week 13). Subjects in whom the treatment is assessed as effective will be\n      continued with the study treatment. Subjects in whom the treatment is assessed as effective\n      (when meeting any of the response criteria) at 6 months after starting the study treatment\n      (Week 26) may enter the extension phase and continue the treatment with eltrombopag.
