Recently, chronic myeloproliferative\n      diseases (CMPD) associated with pulmonary hypertension were included in the group 5\n      category, corresponding to PH for which the aetiology is unclear and/or multifactorial. CMPD\n      include chronic myelogenous leukaemia, chronic neutrophilic leukaemia and chronic\n      eosinophilic leukaemia (which primarily express a myeloid phenotype and polycythaemia vera),\n      idiopathic myelofibrosis, and essential thrombocytosis in which erythroid or megakaryocytic\n      hyperplasia predominates.\n\n      The purpose of this research:\n\n        1. Assess Prevalence of PH in patients with CMPD in Northern Israel\n\n        2. Describe the demographics and clinical course in patients with CMPD who are diagnosed\n           with PH."
