  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gemcitabine is considered one of the standard drugs for advanced pancreatic cancer and is
      approved by the FDA to treat it. Cabozantinib is a new drug that has demonstrated
      effectiveness against pancreatic cancer in laboratory experiments, especially when given
      with gemcitabine. Initial studies with cabozantinib  in pancreatic cancer have shown some
      activity against the disease. The purpose of this study is to determine the safest and
      highest dose of cabozantinib that can be given together with standard doses of gemcitabine
      in patients with pancreatic cancer.  This study will determine the safety and tolerability
      of this two drug combination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical work at the University of Michigan has demonstrated that inhibition of c-Met
      with cabozantinib prevented the development of metastatic disease in an intra-cardiac
      injection model in NOD/SCID mice. Additionally, the combination of cabozantinib and
      gemcitabine demonstrated improved tumor control compared to either agent alone in a relevant
      orthotopic implantation mouse model.

      Combining gemcitabine with the c-Met inhibitor cabozantinib in advanced pancreatic cancer is
      a novel strategy that takes advantage of an established cytotoxic agent with one that
      targets a pathway known to be important for the growth, dissemination, and resistance of
      this disease.

             following surgical therapy.

          3. ≥ 18 years old.

          4. Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.

          5. ECOG performance status ≤1 (Karnofsky ≥70%) (See Appendix A).

          6. adequate organ and marrow function as follows:

          7. capable of understanding and complying with the protocol requirements and has signed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas.

          2. more than 1 prior systemic treatment regimen for pancreatic cancer. may have received
             prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy, including gemcitabine, provided 6 months have

             chemotherapy within 4 weeks, nitrosoureas/mitomycin C within 6 weeks, or monoclonal
             antibody within 6 weeks prior to planned initiation of study treatment.

          4. prior treatment with a small molecule kinase inhibitor or a hormonal therapy within
