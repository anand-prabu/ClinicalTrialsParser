            "textblock": "Neuroma excision and digital nerve reconstruction remain the best option for the treatment\n      of Painful Digital Neuroma (PDN). When the distal nerve end is preserved, conventional\n      nonvascularized nerve grafting is the primary option to bridge the defect. The investigators\n      hypothesize the pedicled nerve flap taken from the dorsal branch of the homolateral digital\n      nerve is better than conventional methods for reconstruction of the digital nerve defect\n      after painful neuroma resection.\n\n      This study reports treatment of painful digital neuroma using a pedicled nerve flap taken\n      from the dorsal branch of homolateral digital nerve. From May 2007 to March 2010, the\n      patients had previous nerve injuries with or without nerve repair. The mechanisms of injury\n      include sharp cut, avulsion and crush. The  defects were between the middle of the distal\n      phalanx and the palmar digital crease."

The test points were at the center of the radial or ulnar portion of the finger pulp (i.e., injury side). Each area was tested 3 times with a discriminator (Ali Med, Dedham, MA). Two out of 3 correct answers were considered proof of perception before proceeding to another lower value. We stopped at 4mm as a limit of 2PD and consider this normal.
