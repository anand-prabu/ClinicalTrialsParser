            "textblock": "Osteoporosis is a disease that leads to impaired skeletal strength and increased fracture\n      risk. Among 200 million osteoporotic patients (Tarantino, Cannata et al. 2007) most are\n      diagnosed only after a fracture. We expect with our aging population to see a significant\n      increase in the prevalence of osteoporosis. It is estimated that over 75% of osteoporotic\n      patients are not diagnosed and do not receive treatment for their condition.\n\n      This research plan describes a study for clinical validation of the novel ultrasound device\n      (Bindex\u00ae, Bone Index Finland Ltd.). In a preliminary study, the technique has been validated\n      in a Finnish postmenopausal woman population of 285 healthy and 56 osteoporotic subjects (n\n      = 341 in total). Significant and good correlation was observed between Density Index (DI)\n      determined with Bindex and femoral neck bone mineral density determined with DXA (r = 0.65 -\n      0.70). In addition, with determination of 90% sensitivity and specificity thresholds,\n      significant number (65-75%) of patients could be diagnosed without additional verification\n      with DXA.\n\n      For validation of the technique in US population, our study plan is presented for\n      determination of diagnostic thresholds for osteoporosis. Taken together, DI with Bindex,\n      lumbar spine and femoral bone BMD with DXA are obtained from 500 postmenopausal women and\n      140 men. The study will be carried out at the HealthEast Osteoporosis Care service in\n      Woodbury, MN.\n\n        1. To investigate the capability of DI for prediction of proximal femur and lumbar spine\n           BMD;\n\n        2. To develop national diagnostic thresholds for DI in prediction of osteoporosis status\n           with a reference population (American-Caucasian) of 500 (if prevalence of osteoporosis\n           is 20%) post-menopausal females (50-90 years);\n\n        3. To investigate ability of Density Index + FRAX with BMI in fracture risk prediction;\n\n        4. To investigate correlation between lumbar spine or proximal femur BMD and Density Index\n           in 140 men at wide age range (20-90 years), 70 with osteoporosis and 70 with normal or\n           low bone mass. Determine diagnostic thresholds for DI in men."
