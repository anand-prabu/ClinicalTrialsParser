In addition,\n      safety data will be reviewed to ensure that saquinavir is well tolerated with nucleoside\n      antiretrovirals before it is combined with a second protease inhibitor. In part 2,\n      saquinavir will be combined with nelfinavir, a protease inhibitor recently approved for use\n      in children. The pharmacokinetics and safety profile of these drugs in combination will be\n      determined."
