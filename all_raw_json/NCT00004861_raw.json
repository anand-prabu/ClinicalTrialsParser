Determine the efficacy and safety of CI-994 given in combination with\n      gemcitabine compared to gemcitabine alone in the treatment of patients with advanced\n      pancreatic cancer.\n\n      OUTLINE: Gemcitabine is the standard of care for pancreatic cancer and is administered by\n      intravenous injection. Patients receive gemcitabine once a week for 3 weeks followed by 1\n      week of rest. Patients take the capsules (placebo or investigational chemotherapy) daily for\n      21 consecutive days beginning with the first gemcitabine infusion. The duration of treatment\n      is determined by the patient's tolerance of therapy and the assessment of disease response.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 172 patients will be enrolled in Canada, Europe, and the\n      United States on a competitive basis."
