      This a prospective, non-controlled, open, multi-center study evaluating the reduction of
      bacteriuria after bladder irrigation with chlorhexidine in spinal cord injured patients with
      chronic bacteriuria practicing intermittent catheterisation (IC). Patients will be treated
      with chlorhexidine for bladder irrigation twice daily for a maximum of 7 days.

      The study hypothesis is that bladder irrigation with chlorhexidine is efficient for a short
      term reduction of bacteriuria in patients performing intermittent catheterization (IC).

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Provision of informed consent

          2. Female or male spinal cord injured subject aged 18 years and over

          3. Bacteriuria of &gt;10^5 CFU/mL of &gt;1 bacterial species verified during screening visit

          4. Regular users of intermittent catheterisation as primary method for bladder
             management (defined as a normal catheterisation frequency of at least 3 times daily
             for at least 1 month)

          5. Ability to retain fluid in the bladder (approx. 120 ml) for at least 10 minutes, as
             judged by the investigator

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Signs or symptoms of symptomatic UTI that requires treatment, as judged by the
             investigator.

          2. Ongoing antibiotic treatment

          3. Known anatomical pathology of the urinary tract that could compromise results, as
             judged by investigator

          4. Subject with severe catheterisation difficulties, as judged by investigator

          5. Known hypersensitivity to chlorhexidine

          6. Use of other instillation products

          7. Pregnancy

          8. Use of medications that may affect the bacterial culture in the urine and bladder
             (e.g.  methenamine hippurate)

          9. Involvement in the planning and conduct of the study (applies to both Wellspect
             HealthCare staff and staff at the study site)

         10. Previous enrolment or allocation of treatment in the present study.

         11. Simultaneous participation in another clinical study that may interfere with the
             present study.

         12. Severe non-compliance to protocol as judged by the investigator and/or Wellspect
