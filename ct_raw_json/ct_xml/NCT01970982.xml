  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the study is to evaluate if the ad libitum use of the THS 2.2 for 5
      consecutive days by adult Japanese healthy smokers affects the levels of biomarkers of
      exposure for selected harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) compared to
      smoking conventional cigarettes and smoking abstinence.
