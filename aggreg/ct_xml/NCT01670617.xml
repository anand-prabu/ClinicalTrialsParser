    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term relief of pain and return to function
      for patients receiving DeNovo NT for cartilage lesions in the knee.  DeNovo NT is a marketed
      product and has been used in more than 3000 patients over the last 5 years.

         10. Is refractory to conservative non-surgical management (e.g. hyaluronic acid
             injection, activity modification) or previous minimal surgical intervention (e.g.,
             arthroscopic lavage, debridement) or ACI or marrow stimulation for this condition and
             is further than 3 months from either the initiation of nonsurgical management or from
             minimal surgical intervention or is further than 12 months from  ACI or marrow
             stimulation,

         11. Must record a response, at the preoperative study visit, of moderate to extreme pain
             for any one of the KOOS Pain Scale questions, P2 through P9.

         12. Must be physically and mentally willing and able, in the Investigator's opinion at
             the time of enrollment, to be compliant with the protocol - including all follow-up

               -  Osteochondritis dissecans of the knee with significant bone loss (greater than 6
                  mm deep from the subchondral plate).

               -  Associated damage to the underlying subchondral bone requiring bone graft,
