  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial study is to examine the extent that
      financial incentives when combined with diabetes evidence-based practices, improve
      self-management and biometric measures for adult diabetic Medicaid recipients with an HbA1c
      of â‰¥ 8.0 at enrollment. The study will also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the program.

      Specific Aims:

        1. Evaluate whether financial incentives for completing ADA recommended tests, exams and
           vaccinations will improve compliance rates.

        2. Evaluate whether financial incentives for health education and biometric outcomes will
           improve diabetes patients' self-management.

        3. Evaluate the extent to which financial incentives for healthy behaviors reduce health
           care utilization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States (OECD 2013). It is also
      known that certain populations are at greater risk for diabetes. In Hawaii, diabetes
      disproportionally affects Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders as they are three times
      more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. In addition, in 2010 the U.S. Department of
      Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health reported that Native Hawaiians/Pacific
      Islanders in Hawaii were 5.7 times as likely as Caucasians living in Hawaii to die from
      diabetes(Office of Minority Health, 2010).

      In order to address the challenges that chronic diseases impose on individuals and the
      health care system the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) is assessing the
      impact of incentivizing patients to increase self-care and disease management. Previous
      studies have demonstrated that monetary incentives have been associated with an improvement
      in behavioral outcomes, most notably when the incentive is received immediately following
      the targeted behavior (Volpp, K.G., et.al., 2008; Mitchell, M.S., et.al., 2013). Cahill et
      al. (2008) showed that economic incentives were tied to smoking cessation and led to a
      decrease in relapse within a year. Our study seeks to build on these findings and determine
      whether economic incentives may provide a way to improve diabetes self-management.
