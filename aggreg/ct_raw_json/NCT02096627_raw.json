Because all study\n      participants will have been scheduled for elective cataract extraction regardless of their\n      participation in this study, there will be little or no additional surgical risk associated\n      with participation. A total of 720 patients are expected to be enrolled in the study during\n      a period of 2 years. The investigators will recruit patients with bilateral operable\n      cataracts. One eye will undergo cataract surgery using conventional cataract extraction\n      technique including phacoemulsification whereas the second eye will undergo FLACS. No\n      significant increased risk to the patient is expected in either arm of the study compared to\n      routine cataract surgery. The patients will be examined as per previous post-operative\n      cataract surgery guidelines on POD1, POW1, POM1, POM3, POM6, POY1 and POY2. The only\n      treatment difference will take place at the time of the cataract surgery. Post-operatively,\n      endothelial cell count will be obtained by the no-touch technology of specular microscopy at\n      baseline as well as three months after surgery. If the study ends prematurely, the\n      investigators do not anticipate any significant change in the care of the patient."
