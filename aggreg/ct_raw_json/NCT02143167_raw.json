Thus by combining the two it is likely\n      to see an synergistic effect.\n\n      This trial is designed as a double blind, randomized placebo controlled trial with\n      subsequent cross-over.\n\n      Participants in the two arms will go through the same progressive training program targets\n      at the lower limbs. For 24 weeks one group receives SR-fampridine and the other receives\n      placebo. in the the end there is another four weeks of training after cross-over has been\n      performed."
