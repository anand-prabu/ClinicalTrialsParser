Study outcomes are psychological responses (unmet needs, depressive symptoms,\n      anxiety, and burden) and physical responses (levels of stimulated and circulating IL-6 and\n      IL-1\u03b2, C-reactive protein, peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells, physical symptoms, and new\n      diagnoses or exacerbations of co-morbid conditions). The proposed study addresses research\n      priorities set by both NCI and NINR to improve the quality of life of patients and their\n      families and NINR's emphasis on integrating bio-behavioral science and adopting, adapting\n      and generating new technologies.\n\n      Primary aims:\n\n        1. Compare the efficacy of a) an intervention for depressive symptoms (Beating the Blues)\n           delivered prior to a needs-based caregiver intervention (SmartCare\u00a9) versus b)\n           SmartCare\u00a9 alone versus c) enhanced care as usual (CAU+) in improving caregivers'\n           psychological and physical responses.\n\n           H1: At 4- and 6-months, caregivers who receive Beating the Blues prior to SmartCare\u00a9\n           will display improved psychological and physical responses compared to caregivers who\n           receive CAU+.\n\n           H2: At 4- and 6-months, caregivers who receive SmartCare\u00a9 alone will display improved\n           psychological and physical responses compared to caregivers who receive CAU+.\n\n           H3: At 4- and 6-months, caregivers who receive Beating the Blues prior to SmartCare\u00a9\n           will display improved psychological and physical responses compared to those who\n           receive SmartCare\u00a9 alone.\n\n        2. Compare the efficacy of Beating the Blues versus CAU+ in improving subjects' short-term\n           psychological and physical responses.\n\n      H1: At 2-months following baseline, caregivers who receive Beating the Blues will display\n      improved psychological and physical responses compared to CAU+.\n\n      Exploratory aims:\n\n        1. Determine whether any changes in psychological and physical health resulting from\n           receiving Beating the Blues prior to SmartCare\u00a9 or SmartCare\u00a9 alone are maintained at\n           10-months after baseline.\n\n        2. Evaluate whether the effect of Beating the Blues + SmartCare\u00a9 (vs. SmartCare\u00a9 alone) on\n           4- and 6-month psychological and physical responses is mediated by 0- to 2-month\n           changes in depressive symptoms."
