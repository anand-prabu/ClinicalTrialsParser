            "textblock": "A satisfactory spinal anaesthesia requires both a fast onset and proper duration at the same\n      time. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P) is a surgery of medium duration. The\n      addition of lidocaine to hyperbaric bupivacaine shortens the duration of bupivacaine spinal\n      block and therefore provides more rapid recovery. This property of lidocaine is not verified\n      with other local anesthetics.  Levobupivacaine is a S-enantiomer of racemic bupivacaine and\n      is a long acting local anesthetic.The aim of this prospective randomized controlled study\n      was to investigate this effect of lidocaine, with a local anesthetic other than bupivacaine.\n      It was hypothesized that the duration of the intrathecal block could change when performed\n      with hyperbaric levobupivacaine mixed with low dose lidocaine and this technique could be\n      consistent for the duration of TUR-P surgery. Participants will be followed on the day of\n      surgery for primary and secondary outcome measures and 3 days postoperatively for\n      complications (TNS)."
