In this pathway, the patient will be\n      screened by the STOP-Bang questionnaire. The recruited patients will be randomized into two\n      groups:\n\n      The STOP-Bang questionnaire score is \u22654 then you will be assigned to any one of these groups\n\n        -  sleep study group (group 1)  or\n\n        -  oximetry group (group 2)."

The patients in the Sleep\n      Study group will be referred to a sleep medicine specialist who is part of the Bariatric\n      Surgery Psychosocial Program. In the Sleep Study group, patients will undergo sleep studies\n      overnight in a  sleep laboratory. At  the same time, they will also wear the oximeter\n      wristwatch to measure overnight oximetry.  Depending on the sleep study results and medical\n      history, a decision will be made regarding therapeutic options. If the patient has severe\n      sleep apnea (AHI>30) or moderate sleep apnea (AHI>15 to <30) with significant co-morbidities\n      (e.g. cardiovascular disease, diabetes), CPAP treatment will be recommended.
