    <textblock>
      Due to metabolic disorders and dietary restrictions, patients with diabetes may have
      different degrees of malnutrition. The primary objective of this study is to investigate
      whether supplementation of LEHEL, a multi-nutrients supplement, is capable to improve
      metabolic parameters in patients  with type 2 diabetes.
