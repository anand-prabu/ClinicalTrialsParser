Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 will evaluate escalating\n      doses of GSK2647544 in young healthy volunteers for 7 days, 7 days, and 14 days,\n      respectively. Cohort 4 will evaluate repeat doses of GSK2647544 in healthy elderly\n      volunteers for 14 days. Additionally, Cohorts 1 and 3 will include an assessment of\n      potential drug-drug interaction with simvastatin to examine CYP3A4 inhibition by GSK2647544."
