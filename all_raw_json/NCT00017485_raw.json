Photosensitizing drugs such as HPPH are absorbed by cancer\n      cells and, when exposed to light, become active and kill the cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy with HPPH in\n      treating patients who have basal cell skin cancer."

Patients undergo phototherapy on days 2-3.\n\n      Cohorts of 2-6 patients receive escalating doses of HPPH and phototherapy to determine the\n      minimum erythemal dose (MED). The MED is defined as the dose combination of HPPH and laser\n      light preceding that at which at least 1 patient experiences grade 3 or worse toxicity or at\n      which at least 2 patients experience grade 1 or worse toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed daily for 4 days, at week 1, and at months 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 4-25 patients will be accrued for this study."
