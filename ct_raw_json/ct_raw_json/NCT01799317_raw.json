Indices of bone\n      mineralization obtained at baseline and after 8 months of treatment will be measured by\n      quantitative histomorphometry in iliac crest bone biopsies after double tetracycline\n      labeling. Immunohistochemistry will be done in specimens of bone biopsies from iliac crest\n      to examine the expression for selected markers of bone turnover and mineralization such as\n      FGF-23, DMP1, MEPE and OPG. Serum PTH levels will be measured with the 1st and 2nd\n      generation immunometric assay (PTH-IMAs) and fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) will be\n      determined by one assay with specific detection antibodies that are against epitopes within\n      the C-terminus of FGF-23 and another assay that uses antibodies against epitopes within the\n      N- and C-terminal portions of the molecule respectively. The value of non-invasive\n      assessment of bone mass by quantitative computed tomography (QCT) and its relationship with\n      vascular disease determined by ultrasound (US) of intimal carotid thickness (CIMT) will be\n      correlated with bone histomorphometry and the different biochemical determinations."
