  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-armed, open-labeled and single-centered study of everolimus in selective
      patients with metastatic melanoma for evaluation of the efficacy and safety. The study
      objective is to evaluate efficacy profile of everolimus.

      The patients who comply with the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled. The
      estimated recruiting duration is 18 months. Everolimus will be given in the dose of 10 mg
      orally each day at lease 6 months unless disease progression or intolerance. The follow-up
      is till death(at least 1 year).
