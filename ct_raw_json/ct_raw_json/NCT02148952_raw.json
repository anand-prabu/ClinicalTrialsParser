At the program's core is the Safe Childbirth Checklist, a\n      31-item list of essential practices that target the major causes of maternal and newborn\n      mortality in low-resource settings globally. The program was developed over 3 years by a\n      partnership of WHO and HSPH, working with a large international network of experts and\n      stakeholders in maternal, fetal, and newborn health. Pilot testing of the program at a\n      public-sector birth center in south India demonstrated dramatic improvements in health\n      worker adherence to essential childbirth-related clinical care standards. The current study\n      is a matched-pair, cluster randomized trial to measure the efficacy of the program in\n      reducing severe maternal and newborn harm. This trial will be conducted at approximately 120\n      health facilities in Uttar Pradesh, India."
