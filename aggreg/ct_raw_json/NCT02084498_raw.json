Additionally, the investigators propose that carbohydrate counting\n      will lead to better quality of life as a result of fewer restrictions when eating and less\n      variation in blood glucose. Finally the investigators hypothesize that the use of Accu-Chek\n      Aviva Expert will lead to fewer hypoglycemic episodes."
