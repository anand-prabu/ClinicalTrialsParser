Comprehension of the study requirements; expressed availability for the required\n             study period, including readings at the nominal time points of 48 and 72 hours\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Prior PPD test within the past 30 days\n\n          2. Subject is of childbearing potential and unable to use contraceptives;  is planning\n             pregnancy; is pregnant or lactating\n\n          3.
