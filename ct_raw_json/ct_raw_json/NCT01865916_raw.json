The purpose of our study is to determine if using a 2-litre mixture in combination\n      with vitamin C is better than using 2 litres of mixture with bisacodyl tablets. Two-litre\n      PegLyte based preparations with an added laxative agent are commonly used for colonoscopies\n      in outpatient settings. If the investigators discover that a 2-litre mixture with either the\n      tablets or the ascorbic acid work better, future patients undergoing colonoscopy will be\n      able to experience fewer side effects and be less troubled by the preparation while still\n      allowing a good view of the colon."

Exclusion criteria included those with\n      constipation, suspected or known small bowel obstruction, severe inflammatory bowel disease,\n      and any history of colonic resection.  278 consecutive eligible patients will be randomized\n      to one of two bowel preparations through the use of concealed allocation by a scheduling\n      assistant (blinded) in a one-to-one allocation ratio. Bowel preparations included: (i) 2 L\n      of MoviPrep (2 L PEG 3350 electrolyte solution + ascorbic acid) or (ii) Bi-Peglyte (2 L PEG\n      3350 electrolyte solution and 15mg bisacodyl). Patients in both arms will be instructed to\n      adhere to a clear liquid diet commensing 24 hours prior to scheduled colonoscopy in addition\n      to their remaining bowel preparation.\n\n      The investigators will not have access to the randomization envelopes and the randomized\n      bowel preparation will be stored within the medical record that will not be accessible by\n      the endoscopist. The endoscopists can break blinding and access the bowel prep given when\n      medically necessary.\n\n      At the time of their procedure check-in, written consent will be confirmed and patients will\n      respond to a brief survey assessing patient tolerance. All colonoscopies will be performed\n      under conscious sedation by an experienced endoscopist. Endoscopists will be blinded to the\n      bowel preparation until the completion of the study. We will use the Boston Bowel\n      Preparation Scale (BBPS) and Ottawa Bowel Preparation Scale (OBPS) to assess efficacy in\n      bowel preparation."

Segment score 1: 'portion of mucosa of the colon segment seen, but other areas of the colon are not well seen due to staining, residual stool and/or opaque liquid'.  Segment score 2: 'minor amount of residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid, but mucosa of colon segment seen well'. Segment score 3: 'entire mucosa of the colon segment seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid'.  In this study, we define an excellent equivalent BBPS score as 8 or 9.  Scores of 7 or above are generally felt to provide a good visualization of the colon.",
