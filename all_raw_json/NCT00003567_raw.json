Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor\n      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of gene therapy\n      together with chemotherapy in treating patients with advanced solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's\n      lymphoma."

Peripheral blood progenitor cells are collected 24 hours after the last dose of\n      growth factor injection on day 5 and also on day 6, if necessary. The CD34 positive stem\n      cells are then infected by the retroviral mutant MGMT-G156A ex vivo.\n\n      Patients receive O6-benzylguanine (BG) IV over 1 hour followed by carmustine IV over 1 hour\n      every 6 weeks for 5 courses, assuming recovery of peripheral blood counts. Approximately 72\n      hours after the end of the first course of chemotherapy, patients receive reinfusion of\n      retrovirally-transduced hematopoietic stem cells over 5-10 minutes. Four weeks after the\n      completion of BG and carmustine, patients receive BG IV over 1 hour followed by temozolomide\n      IV over 1 hour every 4 weeks for up to 5 courses, in the absence of hematologic toxicity.\n      Patients with responding disease may continue to receive BG and temzolomide in the absence\n      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity provided other phase II studies indicate the\n      safety of more than 5 courses.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating numbers of CD34 stem cells targeted for\n      retroviral infection and escalating doses of carmustine.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 2 months, every 4 months for 8 months, and then every 6\n      months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-18 patients will be accrued for this study."
