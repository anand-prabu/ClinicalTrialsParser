  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is designed to test the effects of affirmation and positive/negative imagery on
      individuals' thoughts about quitting smoking and willingness to join a stop smoking program.
      Previous studies have noted that viewing negative images elicits a stronger emotional
      response, and many stop-smoking campaigns have used such images to push people to quit
      smoking. However, research also shows that people are generally resistant to health
      messages. Using affirmation can help to lessen that resistance.

      In this study, we use a 2x3 design to study the individual effects of negative imagery and
      affirmation on smokers' intentions to quit smoking, acceptance of an offer to join a quit
      smoking program, and program participation and outcomes. We hope to find out whether there
      is an additive effect of the negative imagery and affirmation on the outcomes listed above.
      Our specific aims are:

      Aim 1: Determine if affirmation increases the uptake of an offer of joining a stop smoking
      program.

      Aim 2: Determine if image type (positive vs. neutral vs. negative) increases the uptake of
      the stop smoking program offer.

      Aim 3: Determine whether there is an interaction between image type and affirmation in
      people's willingness to join a stop smoking program.
