    <textblock>
      Achievement of pathologic complete response is important prognosticator to predict long term
      outcome in triple negative cancer. The efficacy of  adding 4 cycles of cisplatin (CDDP4) is
      to be investigated whether addtional pathologic complete response is achieved for those
      triple negative breast cancer patients who recieved 4 cycles of adriamycin with
      cyclophosphamide(AC4) but did not reach clinical complete response during the course of
      neoadjuvant therapy.
