The\n      research can help to build automation pathological analysis and diagnosis systems and\n      non-invasive clinical assessment criteria and models of liver fibrosis which can be applied\n      in clinical. It can also help to realize electronic patient data collection and management,\n      to establish patients management centre and follow-up database. Then it will help to improve\n      clinical efficacy of being blocked and reversed chronic hepatitis B related liver fibrosis\n      by Chinese medicine Diagnosis and Treatment program, to reduce the incidence of liver\n      cirrhosis and hepatitis B-related mortality, to prolong patients' survival and improve\n      patients' quality of life, to make clinical efficacy, which is about Traditional Chinese\n      Medicine blocking and revering chronic hepatitis B-related liver fibrosis, increase by 15%\n      or more ."
