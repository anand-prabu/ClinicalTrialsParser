            "textblock": "The investigators propose to test a community-developed and targeted intervention that\n      employs community health workers (CHWs) as aides to newly Medicaid-insured women. These\n      women face the challenges of engaging with their healthcare and health and of making highly\n      personal and socioculturally embedded decisions about reproductive health-related preventive\n      services (e.g., contraception, STI and cancer screening).\n\n      All newly enrolled women in one of Arizona's state-wide Medicaid health plans (University\n      Family Care) who are ambulatory and community-dwelling, and between the ages of 18-39, will\n      be identified by the health plan on a monthly basis as eligible for this study. For at least\n      the first month, these new health plan members will be randomized 2 to 1 (intervention to\n      usual care control).  Each month the health plan will provide the study team with the number\n      of new members. A study team member will then provide the health plan with a list of numbers\n      (1's and 0's) generated using the biased coin design to apply to those new members. To avoid\n      bias, health plan staff will not be aware of the study arm associated with each of those\n      numbers at the time of assignment. Once assignments have been completed, the health plan\n      will be notified as to which of the two groups will constitute the control arm. Members\n      assigned to the control and intervention groups will be tracked separately by the health\n      plan staff.\n\n      All new health plan enrollees (as per current standard health plan practice) receive a\n      series of welcome communications (by mail and electronically) from the health plan shortly\n      after enrollment. These are designed to apprise new members of health plan policies and\n      procedures related to covered benefits, facilitate the selection of a primary care provider,\n      and provide general preventive health resources and information. This is followed by a\n      second mailing at 3-months post enrollment, as well as a nurse follow-up call. The latter is\n      designed to answer questions about covered services, finding a primary care provider, and/or\n      otherwise provide support. Both intervention and control group member will receive identical\n      communications from the health plan up to this point.\n\n      Intervention group members will receive two additional mailings (at immediately after\n      enrollment and randomization and again 2 months after enrollment) from the health plan (but\n      paid for by the study) by post and electronically, briefly describing the intervention and\n      inviting eligible women to participate. Potential participants will be given a confidential\n      dedicated telephone number, email and website to contact for participation that they may use\n      should they elect to participate in the study.\n\n      When the potential participant contacts the research office she will be provided with a\n      brief verbal overview of the intervention including time requirement and content to be\n      covered. She will then be offered the opportunity to set up an individual confidential\n      appointment with a community health worker (CHW) at her earliest convenience. At that time,\n      basic contact and demographic information will be collected, language and location\n      preference, date/time of proposed meeting, and the contact information for the research\n      office for any questions. Additionally, a packet of information will be mailed to the\n      participant explaining the nature and content of the intervention as well as a copy of the\n      informed consent document. At 48 to 72 hours prior to the appointed time, the assigned CHW\n      will call to introduce herself, to answer lingering questions about the proposed encounter,\n      and to confirm the time and location of the intervention appointment.  The CHW will meet\n      with the subject and complete the informed consent process. Also, the baseline informed\n      patient choice survey will be performed using a touch tablet device (to ascertain baseline\n      knowledge, patient preferences, informed decision making, and health literacy). The CHW will\n      tailor the individual education session to meet the unique needs of the participant (e.g.,\n      an individual who discloses a history of surgical sterilization will not receive information\n      about contraception). The 45-minute intervention will be delivered as described above. The\n      patient will be asked to personally assess her needs with regard to reproductive\n      health-related issues. The CHW will work with the participant to develop a personalized plan\n      to access the relevant targeted preventive services. This may involve assistance with\n      contacting the Health Plan and assistance with identifying or making an appointment with a\n      primary care provider. At the conclusion of the intervention, the patient will be encouraged\n      to reach out to the CHW by telephone or electronically if she has any subsequent questions\n      or concerns, and appointments for the two booster telephone calls will be scheduled.\n      Finally, in consideration for her time and participation, the participant will be provided\n      with a $50 gift card.\n\n      Booster telephone support calls will occur at 2 and 4 months post intervention. A telephone\n      call guide will be designed to reinforce and clarify key concepts from the initial\n      intervention encounter as well as to help clients formulate relevant questions related to\n      specific women's preventive services and other health concerns in anticipation of their next\n      primary care provider (PCP) visit. Participants will also be queried specifically about any\n      issues related to interactions with the health plan and/or contacting her primary care\n      provider. The patient will be assisted with connecting to the health plan or her PCP's\n      office for those issues that cannot be easily addressed by the CHW. Whenever possible, every\n      effort will be made by the CHW to connect the patient to the appropriate outreach staff at\n      that PCP's office (if such staff is available). Again the availability of the CHW by\n      telephone or electronically for interval questions will be emphasized. At month 6, the\n      participant will receive a call from the telephone interviewer to administer the 6-month\n      informed patient choice survey identical to the survey that was completed at baseline. A $30\n      gift card incentive will be offered to complete this survey."
