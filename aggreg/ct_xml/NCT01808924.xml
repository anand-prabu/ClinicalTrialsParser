  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this project is to thoroughly investigate the effects of
      diet-induced weight loss in the absence of or in combination with exercise on skeletal
      muscle IR, energy metabolism and function. These studies will significantly improve our
      understanding of the fundamental biochemical and molecular factors linking
      intervention-induced changes in mitochondria, oxidative stress, lipotoxicity, IR, and loss
      of muscle function in aging humans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aging is associated with alterations in skeletal muscle energy metabolism, insulin
      resistance and a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Aging is also
      associated with a progressive loss of muscle mass and increased adiposity, known as
      sarcopenic obesity, which leads to mobility limitations and disability. However, the causes
      of insulin resistance and sarcopenia in humans are not known. This project will provide
      novel information regarding potential factors underlying both metabolic dysfunction and
      sarcopenia in aging muscle - namely, mitochondria and the accumulation of intramyocellular
      lipids. Within this conceptual framework we will help elucidate the biological underpinnings
      of these two significant health problems related to aging. In addition, we will provide
      intervention-based evidence to better understand these complex age-related disorders and
      whether mitochondria or intramyocellular lipids are modifiable targets for improved
      prevention or treatment strategies for metabolic and muscle dysfunction. Therefore, our
      overall objectives are to employ highly innovative methods in muscle biopsy specimens in
      order to determine the functional and clinically relevant consequences of these
      interventions as well as alterations in several novel biochemical and molecular factors
      potentially underlying these intervention effects on human skeletal muscle. Our primary
      approach to address all aims of the proposed studies is to conduct a 6-month randomized
      controlled trial in obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) sedentary older men and women 65-80 years of age.

        1. Control (health education) group (CON): Subjects will not receive specific exercise or
           dietary education or prescription, but will be asked to participate in biweekly health
           education sessions.

        2. Diet-induced weight loss (DIWL): The goal will be to achieve a goal of 10% weight loss.

        3. Weight Loss + Exercise (WLEX): This group will receive exactly the same dietary
           intervention as the respective DIWL group. In addition, subjects will be complete a
           progressive, moderate intensity supervised This is a single-site randomized controlled
           trial. The analysis of each of the aims will involve multiple steps and draw on
           statistical methods ranging from simple descriptive statistics to the modeling of
           repeated measures outcome data accounting for potential missing observations.

      The major outcomes of the study, the muscle biopsy parameters, insulin sensitivity, muscle
      mass, strength, power and quality, will be measured at entry into the study and at the end
      of the study.

    <description>The goal of the weight loss intervention will be to produce a weight loss of 10% body weight. A reduction of 500-1000 kcal/day - based on baseline weight -and low fat (&lt;30% of calories from fat) diet will be used as part of the weight loss intervention. Particular efforts will be made to maintain the recommended daily protein, vitamin and mineral intake. The weight loss program will be administered individually to subjects so that the registered dietician will meet with each subject weekly to provide dietary prescription and record body weight. In order to eliminate the confounding effects of acute caloric restriction on insulin sensitivity, the dietician will keep subjects weight stable during the last two weeks.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete a progressive 6-month exercise-training program, 4-5 days per week, 45 min per session (180 min per week), consisting mostly of walking (both outside and on an indoor treadmill) but with the option to include both stationary cycling and rowing, similar to what we have utilized previously to elicit significant improvements in insulin sensitivity in both middle-age and older adults (52-55).
Beginning at week 8, these subjects will also perform 2 non-consecutive resistance exercise sessions per week, 30 min per session, focused on major muscle groups using Keiser pneumatic-powered machines (total days of exercise will still be 4 to 5).</description>

    <description>Educational control. Subjects in the control arm will require special attention for compliance.
This will involve frequent (biweekly) educational sessions, including topics such as medications. We will in part model this program on what we have developed and implemented for the LIFE study, a large, multi-center randomized controlled exercise trial in older adults (57; 58). The primary purpose to ensure compliance is not to equate their contact time or exposure time to the exercise group, but rather to increase the chance to detect differences in the outcomes between the control group and treatment groups. At the end of the 6 months these participants will be offered a structured weight loss and exercise program, which should greatly aid in recruitment and adherence.</description>
