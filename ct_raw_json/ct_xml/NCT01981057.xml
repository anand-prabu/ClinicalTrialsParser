  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective noninterventional study is to evaluate the clinical application
      of Numeta® in preterm infants and critically ill neonates in comparison to individualized
      prescribed parenteral nutrition. With the prescription software Cato-PAN® (by Cato software
      solutions) exact valid prescriptions for ordering parenteral nutrition solutions for
      premature infants are compared. Each PN solution is prescribed individually as well as with
      Numeta. Prescriptions were mirrored  with respect to weight, venous approach, total volume
      and amount of enteral feeding, 24h medication and  flipped vice versa. The key nutrient for
      calculating Numeta prescriptions was protein. The results of PN prescriptions were compared
      with each other/ESPGHAN recommendations. The investigators hypothesize that nutrimental
      content of Numeta prescriptions is equal to individually prescribed .parenteral nutrition
      solutions
