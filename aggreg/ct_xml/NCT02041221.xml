  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sun Pharma Advanced Research company Limited has developed a dry powder inhaler  of compound
      S0597 for oral inhalation. This clinical study is a Phase I/IIa study to investigate the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single and multiple ascending
      doses of S0597 administered by oral inhalation to healthy volunteers and asthma patients.
