They will be randomized\n      into one of the following two groups by computer-generated random numbers:\n\n      Group I: luteal phase support using HCG 1500 IU intramuscular injection will be given on the\n      day of FET and 6 days later.\n\n      Group II: normal saline (placebo) intramuscular injection will be given on the day of FET\n      and 6 days later.\n\n      Treatment:\n\n      Ovarian stimulation protocol:\n\n      All women received ovarian stimulation according to the standard protocol of the Centre. HCG\n      is given intramuscularly when the leading follicle reaches 18 mm in mean diameter.  Oocyte\n      retrieval is carried out 36 hours after the HCG trigger.  A maximum of two embryos will\n      transferred and any excess good quality embryos will be frozen two days after the retrieval.\n\n      FET cycle:\n\n      FET is carried out at least 2 month after the stimulated cycle if the patient fails to get\n      pregnant in the stimulated IVF cycle and there is at least one frozen embryo.  Frozen\n      embryos after thawing are transferred in natural cycles for those women having regular\n      ovulatory cycles, during which the patient is monitored daily for serum estradiol ad\n      luteinising hormone levels from 18 days before the expected date of the next period.\n\n      The transfer is performed by the team clinician on the third day after the luteinising\n      hormone surge and a maximum of two normally cleaving embryos are replaced according to our\n      standard protocol.  The luteal phase is supported as per randomization arm.  Before the\n      embryo transfer, the patient is interviewed by a designated research nurse who will explain\n      the purpose of this study.  Patients consenting to take part in the study will be assigned\n      into one of the two study arms specified in an opaque envelope according to a\n      computer-generated randomization list.  The envelope will be read and injection (HCG or\n      placebo as normal saline) given by a service nurse not involved in the study.  Blood will be\n      taken on day 6 after FET before the patient receives the second dose of HCG or placebo. A\n      urine pregnancy test will be performed 16 days after the FET.  In case of pregnancy, the\n      outcome of pregnancy will be traced afterwards and used for analysis. Luteal phase support\n      is not continued in those who get pregnant."
