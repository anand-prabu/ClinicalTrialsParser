Clopidogrel is converted into its active metabolite\n      by Cytochrome P2C19 (CYP2C19). However 30 % of the Saudi population is carrier of the non\n      functional CYP2C19*2 or *3 alleles having an impaired CYP2C19 capacity, resulting in\n      decreased effectiveness of Clopidogrel. These patients have a 42% higher risk for major\n      cardiovascular events (MACE) compared to non carriers. Further 50 % of the MACE occurs in\n      the first 48 hours. Therefore Ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily) or prasugrel ( 10mg once daily\n      or 5mg once daily if the patient older than 75 years or a body weight < 60kg) whose actions\n      are not dependent on conversion by CYP2C19 may be an alternative only in carriers of the non\n      functional CYP2C19*2 or *3 alleles. This might be cost effective and prevent patients form\n      MACE. Therefore the objective of this study is to assess the efficacy, complication free\n      survival, safety and cost-effectiveness of the CYP2C19 genotype guided antiplatelet\n      treatment strategy, using clopidogrel or prasugrel (or Ticlid).
