In order to obtain this result, BM blood of all enrolled patients\n      will be stored after 6 months of treatment with nilotinib.

These endpoints will be obtained at the central\n      laboratory of  Niguarda Ca' Granda Hospital, Milano, Italy.\n\n      Secondary endpoints will be reached performing:\n\n        -  the same analyzes on CD34+/lin- cells at diagnosis, at 3 and 12 months of treatment;\n\n        -  cytogenetic analysis to estimate the rate of CCyR at 3, 6 and 12 months; this analysis\n           will be performed at each local laboratory;\n\n        -  molecular analysis to determinate the rate of MR (\u2264 10%, \u2264 1%, MMR, MR4,5 IS) at 3, 6\n           and 12 months in the peripheral blood; the molecular analysis will be performed using\n           the Labnet standardized laboratories in Lombardy."
