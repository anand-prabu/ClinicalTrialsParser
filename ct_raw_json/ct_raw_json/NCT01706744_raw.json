Are the cost by discharge to the Intermediate Care Unit in Stj\u00f8rdal, when the hospital\n           is not located in the same Municipality, comparable to the cost by direct discharge to\n           the Municipality of Verdal, for patients over 60 years that have been hospitalized in\n           Levanger hospital?\n\n        3. Which issues are considered important by patients and health personnel during\n           discharge, arrival and follow up in the Municipality, to ensure an optimal interaction\n           between the involved units."
