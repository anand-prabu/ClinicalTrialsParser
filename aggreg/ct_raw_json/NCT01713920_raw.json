If subjects fail to reach the SBP threshold of SeSBP\u2265 140mmHg after 4-week treatment, they will receive Sevikar 5/40mg for 4 weeks. At the end of 4-week treatment, subjects who fail to reach SBP threshold will receive Sevikar 10/40mg for 4 weeks. Subjects who can reach SBP threshold will continue to treat with current dose until 12 weeks."

            "textblock": "A majority of Korean doctors tend to add other antihypertensive rather than to titrate the\n      same drug.\n\n      However, we try to induce doctors to titrate the Sevikar than to add other antihypertensive\n      if patients are not controlled with Sevikar 5/20mg(amlodipine 5mg + omlesartan 20mg). As\n      above, for patients who are not controlled with Sevikar 5/20mg, doctors will proceed to\n      other prescription pattern with other choices of titration to Sevikar 5/40, 10/40mg.\n\n      It is important to evaluate BP lowering efficacy of Sevikar through the titration step in\n      patients uncontrolled with Sevikar low dose. Thus, this study is designed to demonstrate the\n      efficacy of Sevikar by titration in patients who are not controlled their BP with low dose\n      of Sevikar."
