Specifically,the investigators expect the PAT to improve decision\n      self-efficacy and healthcare satisfaction without increasing disability days.\n\n      Methods/Outcomes: The investigators will perform a randomized controlled trial comparing a\n      PAT to standard surgical consultation in patient-caregiver dyads choosing between either\n      antibiotics alone or appendectomy for early appendicitis. The investigators will identify\n      differences in various components of decision making and patient centered outcomes including\n      caregiver decision self-efficacy, preparedness for decision making, decisional conflict,\n      decision regret, caregiver activation, caregiver and child satisfaction with care and health\n      related quality of life (HRQOL), and caregiver and child knowledge. The investigators will\n      also characterize the effects of a PAT on medical outcomes from appendicitis in patients\n      receiving the PAT compared to those receiving standard surgical consultation alone. The\n      investigators will determine differences in disability days, length of stay, readmission\n      rates, and medical complications related to treatment choice (e.g. infection, recurrence)."
