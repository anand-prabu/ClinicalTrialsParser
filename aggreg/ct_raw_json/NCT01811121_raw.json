            "textblock": "Glioblastoma is the most frequent primary malignant brain tumor in adults (3,000 new cases\n      per year) and is characterized by a poor prognosis (median survival 12 months). Treatment is\n      based mainly on surgical excision as complete as possible followed by an additional\n      radiochemotherapy. The prognosis depends mainly on the quality of resection when it is\n      macroscopically complete. Different techniques to support the surgical resection have been\n      developed over the past 20 years. The reference technique is currently the intraoperative\n      neuronavigation for guiding excision by matching the intraoperative tumor boundaries with\n      those of the preoperative MRI. Its main drawback is the loss of precision during the\n      resection related to changes in anatomical limits of the tumor.\n\n      The per-operative fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) is an innovative alternative technique\n      to support the surgical resection. The 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), a molecule absorbed by\n      the patient before surgery is captured specifically by the tumor cells and transformed into\n      a fluorochrome revealed intraoperatively by a light source length adapted wave with a set of\n      lenses included in the microscope. Resection is thus guided by this fluorescence whose\n      disappearance translates complete tumor resection.\n\n      Its interest is twofold:\n\n        -  Increase the percentage of complete tumor resection.\n\n        -  Improve disease-free survival and overall survival. The objective of the study is to\n           compare the FGS to the intraoperative neuronavigation for the resection of\n           glioblastoma, on a medical and economical level through a randomized, prospective,\n           multicenter trial.\n\n      The annual number of patients likely to benefit of this technique in France is estimated at\n      2200 new cases."
