    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, safety and activity study of lenvatinib in subjects with
      KIF5B-RET-positive adenocarcinoma of the lung and other confirmed RET translocations. At
      least 20 subjects with KIF5B-RET will be treated and will receive lenvatinib at a starting
      dose of 24 mg orally, once per day. Additional subjects with other RET translocations will
      be treated with lenvatinib at a starting dose of 24 mg orally, once per day. The study will
      consist of 3 phases: The Pretreatment Phase, The Treatment Phase and the Extension Phase.
      The Pretreatment Phase will include screening procedures and eligibility assessments. The
      Pretreatment Phase consists of a Screen 1, Screen 2 and Baseline Period. The Treatment Phase
      will begin when the subject has met all eligibility criteria on Day 1 of the first Treatment
      Cycle. The Treatment Phase contains the Treatment and Follow-up Periods. The Extension Phase
      will begin for subjects who received treatment in the study (either in the Treatment Period
      or Follow-up Period) at the time of database cutoff.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must have a cytological or histological confirmed diagnosis of
             adenocarcinoma of the lung.

          2. Subjects must have tumors expressing the KIF5B-RET translocation as detected by gene
             sequencing, or other confirmed RET translocations (e.g., CCDC6-RET).

          3. Subjects may have received up to three prior systemic anticancer treatment regimens
             for adenocarcinoma of the lung (including adjuvant therapies and tyrosine-kinase
             inhibitors [TKI]), unless discussed with the sponsor.

          4. Subjects must have a clinically indicated need for systemic chemotherapy for
             adenocarcinoma of the lung based on the investigator's assessment

          5. Presence of measurable disease meeting the following criteria:

               1. At least one lesion of at least 1.0 cm in the long-axis diameter for a non-lymph
                  node or at least 1.5 cm in the short-axis diameter for a lymph node which is
                  serially measurable according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
                  1.1 (RECIST 1.1) using either computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance
                  imaging (MRI). If there is only one target lesion and it is a non-lymph node, it
                  should have a longest diameter of at least 1.5 cm.

               2. Lesions previously treated with radiotherapy or locoregional therapy must show
                  radiographic evidence of disease progression to be deemed a target lesion.

          6. Subjects with known brain metastases who have completed whole brain radiotherapy,
             stereotactic radiosurgery, or complete surgical resection will be eligible if they
             have remained clinically stable, asymptomatic and off of steroids for 28 days.

          7. Adequate bone marrow function, defined as:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.5 x 109/L (greater
                  than or equal to 1500/mm3)

               2. Hemoglobin (Hb) greater than or equal 8.5 g/dL

               3. Platelet count greater than or equal 75 x 109/L (greater than or equal
                  75,000/mm3)

          8. Adequate liver function, defined as:

               1. Bilirubin less than or equal 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) except for
                  unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia or Gilbert's syndrome

               2. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline
                  phosphatase (ALP) less than or equal 3 x ULN (less than or equal 5 x ULN if
                  subject has liver metastases). If alkaline phosphatase is greater than 3 x ULN
                  (in absence of liver metastases) or greater than 5 x ULN (in presence of liver
                  metastases) AND the subject also is known to have bone metastases, the
                  liver-specific alkaline phosphatase must be separated from the total and used to
                  assess the liver function instead of total alkaline phosphatase.

          9. Adequate renal function, defined as calculated creatinine clearance greater than 40
             mL/min per the Cockcroft and Gault formula.

         10. Adequately controlled blood pressure (BP) with or without antihypertensive
             medications, defined as BP less than 150/90 mmHg at screening and no change in
             antihypertensive medications within 1 week before Cycle 1/Day 1 (C1D1).

         11. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)-Performance Status (PS) of 0 or 1.

         12. Survival expectation of 12 weeks or longer after starting study drug.

         13. Males or females aged at least 18 years (or any age greater than 18 years as
             determined by country legislation) at the time of informed consent (Screen 1).

         14. Females must not be breast-feeding or pregnant at Screening or Baseline (as
             documented by a negative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [B-hCG] test with a
             minimum sensitivity of 25 IU/L or equivalent units of B-hCG). A separate baseline
             assessment is required if a negative Screening pregnancy test was obtained more than
             72 hours before the first dose of study drug.

         15. All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are
             postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate
             age group and without other known or suspected cause) or have been sterilized
             surgically (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy or bilateral
             oophorectomy, all with surgery at least one month before dosing).

         16. Females of childbearing potential must not have had unprotected sexual intercourse
             within 30 days before study entry and must agree to use a highly effective method of
             contraception (e.g., total abstinence, an intrauterine device, a double-barrier
             method [such as condom plus diaphragm with spermicide], a contraceptive implant, an
             oral contraceptive, or have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia)
             throughout the entire study period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation.
             If currently abstinent, the subject must agree to use a double barrier method as
             described above if she becomes sexually active during the study period or for 30 days
             after study drug discontinuation. Females who are using hormonal contraceptives must
             have been on a stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4
             weeks before dosing and must continue to use the same contraceptive during the study
             and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation.

         17. Male subjects must have had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they
             and their female partners must meet the criteria above (i.e., not of childbearing
             potential or practicing highly effective contraception throughout the study period
             and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation). No sperm donation is allowed
             during the study period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation.

         18. Provide written informed consent (Screen 1 and Screen 2)

         19. Willing and able to comply with all aspects of the protocol

         20. In Japan, only subjects who have archived tumor sample will be eligible for the
             study. A fresh biopsy to obtain tumor sample for genetic screening is not permitted
             for Japanese subjects.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have received any anticancer therapy (including surgery, locoregional,
             biological, immunotherapy, hormonal, or radiotherapy) within 21 days before the first
             dose of study drug (28 days for investigational therapies).

          2. Leptomeningeal metastases or brain metastases except as for Inclusion Criterion #6.

          3. Subjects who have not recovered from toxicities as a result of prior anticancer
             therapy to &lt; Grade 2 severity per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
             Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0, except alopecia and infertility.

          4. Significant cardiovascular impairment: history of congestive heart failure greater
             than New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II, unstable angina, myocardial
             infarction, or stroke within 6 months of the first dose of study drug, or cardiac
             arrhythmia requiring medical treatment at Screening.

          5. Gastrointestinal malabsorption or any other condition in the opinion of the
             investigator that might affect the absorption of lenvatinib.

          6. Active malignancy (except for adenocarcinoma of the lung or definitively treated
             melanoma in-situ, basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in-situ
             of the cervix) within the past 24months.

          7. Major surgery within 3 weeks before the first dose of study drug.

          8. Bleeding or thrombotic disorders or use of anticoagulants such as warfarin or similar
             agents requiring therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring.
             (Treatment with low molecular weight heparin is allowed.)

          9. Active hemoptysis (bright red blood of at least 0.5 teaspoon) within 3 weeks before
             the first dose of study drug.

         13. Any medical or other condition that in the opinion of the investigator(s) would
             preclude the subject?s participation in a clinical study or would preclude them from
             completing the study.

         14. Scheduled for surgery during the study.
