This process appears to involve an interaction between two different sorts of blood\n      cells, platelets and white blood cells via a receptor called the P2Y12 receptor. The purpose\n      of this study is to determine whether the drug clopidogrel which blocks the P2Y12 receptor\n      on platelets, reduces inflammation following breathing in house dust mite in people with\n      mild asthma."
