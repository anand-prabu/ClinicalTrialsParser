Inflammation also affect the glands of\n      the genital tract. This can eventually leads to male infertility, long after the initial\n      infection. But 10% of men who seek treatment for infertility have such a leucospermia, while\n      it is a potentially treatable cause.\n\n      Main aim of this study: Search of development of an inflammatory genital tract syndrome in\n      patients with urethritis proven and treated at 6 months after the end of treatment.This\n      group of patients will be compared to a control group with no urethritis and no history of\n      urogenital infection. Monocentric, prospective trial.\n\n      Primary endpoint: Seminal elastase value to 6 months after the end of treatment. (500ng/ml\n      or greater)\n\n      Secondary objective:\n\n        -  Search for a genital inflammation in patients with urethritis proven and treated at 12\n           months after the end of treatment\n\n        -  Search for oxidative stress in patients with urethritis proven and treated at 6 and 12\n           months after the end of treatment\n\n        -  Study of the frequency of relapses infectious and / or passages at the stage of chronic\n           infection after acute urethritis\n\n        -  Assessment of the parallel evolution of the quality of sperm in the two groups\n\n      Progress of research. Time frame Search :\n\n        -  Duration of inclusions: 12 months\n\n        -  Duration of patient follow-up: 12 months for control group, 14 months at most for\n           patients taking into account the duration of treatment for urethritis which is 4 to 6\n           weeks\n\n        -  Total duration of the study: 26 months\n\n      Patients & Methods: French monocentric, prospective trial. 300 subjects are planned to be\n      included for 150 subjects in each group"
