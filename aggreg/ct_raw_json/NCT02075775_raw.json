Surgeons will\n      complete a form after surgery with information on radiographic findings, physical exam,\n      surgical findings, and the repair. The subject questionnaires will be completed over a\n      series of timepoints and the subject's information from the subjects' electronic medical\n      record will be abstracted for research data at various timepoints as well. Patients will\n      wear a sling post-operatively, and follow standardized rehabilitation protocols, including\n      physical therapy."

            "textblock": "Participants will complete the MOON Shoulder Instability patient form to document shoulder\n      function and overall health status. The questionnaire will take 20-30 minutes to complete.\n      The patient questionnaire will be completed once in the clinic before surgery and then will\n      be mailed to them at 2 years, 6 years, 10 years and 20 years after surgery. An additional\n      pre-surgical questionnaire will be completed on-line and will become part of the\n      participant's UIHC electronic medical record. This is the standard of care for all shoulder\n      instability patients in the Sports Medicine Clinic, regardless of study participation.\n      Reviewing the noted pre-surgical questionnaire will be a review of data collected as part of\n      clinical activity and is not considered a research-initiated data collection. Study-specific\n      information, such as follow-up contact information, will be collected at this time. The\n      follow-up questionnaires will be mailed to participants with a postage-paid return envelope\n      by the coordinating center at University of Iowa. The coordinating center will also call\n      participants prior to mailing follow-up questionnaires to confirm that the mailing\n      information is correct and to ascertain whether the participant has had any subsequent\n      shoulder surgery. At the two, six, ten, and twenty year time-points the participant's local\n      medical record will be queried to identify any subsequent shoulder surgery occurring at the\n      University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics. Physicians will complete an initial evaluation form\n      detailing range of motion and radiologic imaging information when the patient is indicated\n      for surgery. They will complete an in depth evaluation form detailing specific pathologies\n      of the shoulder and any operative findings at the time of surgery. Finally at the 4-6 month\n      time point following surgery the physician will complete a clinical follow up form on range\n      of motion and shoulder function.\n\n      Additionally, for recruitment purposes, we will need to obtain potential subjects'\n      demographic data, as well as any information related to the diagnosis and treatment of their\n      shoulder instability, from their medical record. This information will be obtained from\n      potential subjects' medical records prior to consent has been given. We will review\n      subjects' medical record at each of the follow-up timepoints (4-6 months, and 2, 6, 10, and\n      20 years) for updated demographic information, as well as information related specifically\n      to their diagnosis of shoulder instability. This may include information about the initial\n      surgery, as well as subsequent shoulder surgeries, complications, additional treatment and\n      physical therapy notes, x-rays or other images, and outcome measures for pain and\n      functionality."
