Measures taken\n      to allay concerns about the safety of blood transfusions have translated into the increasing\n      cost of allogeneic blood units. Blood banks regularly undergo blood shortages. For these\n      reasons, there is a need to reduce allogeneic blood transfusions. A number of effective\n      interventions have been developed, such as preoperative autologous donation, cell salvage,\n      or the use of erythropoietin. Pharmacologic agents such as aprotinin, tranexamic acid, or\n      epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) could reduce perioperative blood loss by interfering with\n      fibrinolysis."
