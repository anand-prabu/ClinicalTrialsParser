  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective diagnostic performance study which compares three new imaging methods
      with the current standard imaging method for the diagnosis of metastatic lymph nodes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to demonstrate whether leading edge molecular imaging technologies (FDG-PET/CT,
      DW-MRI and Fluoro-ethyl-choline (FEC) PET/CT) can identify lymph node metastases with
      sufficient accuracy to allow non-invasive lymph node staging in patients with endometrial
      and cervical carcinoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Females 18 years or older; (no upper limit).

          2. Patients with histologically confirmed cancer of the cervix or endometrium.

               1. In patient with cervix cancer, there must be confirmation of invasive disease;
                  FIGO stage 1B1 or higher FIGO stage demonstrated clinically and/or on MRI. In
                  patients with advanced disease being considered for chemoradiotherapy treatment,
                  patients may be considered for entry if nodal lymphadenectomy is being used to
                  inform radiotherapy planning;

               2. In patients with endometrial cancer, a) stage 1A with myometrial invasion or any
                  higher stage and grade 3 b) stage 1A with myometrial invasion or any other
                  higher stage and serous papillary or clear cell sub-types

               3. stage II disease or above and any histology grade The MDT decision may be based
                  on the combination of tumour characteristics on histology, clinical and imaging
                  findings.

          3. No contra-indication to FDG-PET/CT, FEC-PET/CT or MRI.

          4. Fit for surgical lymphadenectomy, as determined by the local MDT. The patient should
             also be considered fit for extended field radiotherapy in cases where lymphadenectomy
             is being undertaken to inform radiotherapy planning.

             The extent of lymph node dissection will be made by the local multidisciplinary team,
             based on the presence of risk factors for lymph node metastases, according to the
             protocol. Patients must be considered fit to undergo lymph node dissection.

          5. Able and willing to give written informed consent and to comply with the study
             protocol procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known contra-indication to MRI or PET/CT scan.

          2. Known allergy to FDG or FEC.

          3. Not considered fit for lymphadenectomy (open or laparoscopic) or, where appropriate,
             radiotherapy, as determined by the local MDT.

          4. If the patient is pregnant or breast-feeding.

          5. Females of childbearing potential must be willing to use an effective method of
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) from the time consent is
             signed until 6 weeks after the last PET/CT scan unless undergoing hysterectomy.

             Note: subjects are not considered of childbearing potential if they are surgically
             sterile (they have undergone bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or
             they are postmenopausal

          6. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within three
             weeks prior to being registered for the study.

          7. Participation in another Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product
             (CTIMP).  If patient's have recently completed a CTIMP trial they must have had their
             last dose(s) of study drug prior to their first imaging procedure on the MAPPING
             study.

          8. Participation in another clinical trial (CTIMP or non-CTIMP) where the protocol
             contains imaging procedures that would occur during the MAPPING study.

          9. Medical or psychiatric illness, which makes the patient unsuitable or unable to give
             informed consent.
