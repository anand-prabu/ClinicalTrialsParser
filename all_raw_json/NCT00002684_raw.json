Combining more\n      than one drug and giving drugs in different ways may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well combination chemotherapy works in treating\n      patients with metastatic urinary tract cancer that cannot be treated with surgery."

Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously\n      daily beginning on day 6 and continuing through day 17 or until blood counts recover.\n      Treatment continues every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of stable or\n      progressive disease after completion of course 2 or complete response after completion of\n      course 4.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
