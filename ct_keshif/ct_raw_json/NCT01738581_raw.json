Our working hypothesis\n      is: subjects receiving the combined intervention will (1) display significantly improved\n      handwriting measures; (2) report significant improvement in daily functional ability; (3)\n      display reduced hand cramping compared; and (4) demonstrate reduced corticospinal\n      excitability after the Dual intervention when compared to the rTMS+ stretching and massage\n      (Sham) intervention.\n\n      METHODS: A randomized, single-subject, multiple baseline design with crossover is used for\n      this study that will examine ten subjects with FHD with two interventions: five days of\n      low-frequency 1 Hz rTMS + sensorimotor retraining (Dual intervention) vs. rTMS + stretching\n      and massage (Sham). The rTMS is applied to the premotor cortex at 1 Hz at 90% resting motor\n      threshold for 1200 pulses. For sensorimotor retraining, a subset of the Learning-based\n      Sensorimotor Training program was followed."
