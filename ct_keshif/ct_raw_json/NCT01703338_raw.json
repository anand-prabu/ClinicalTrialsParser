            "textblock": "Lumbar fusion has been widely used for spinal disorders when conservative treatment has\n      failed. However, a number of studies have reported that the rate of re-operation is high for\n      lumbar fusion surgery. Swelling, atrophy or fat infiltration of the paraspinal muscles at\n      the surgery site can cause weakness and pain. After fusion, the range of motion is\n      constrained at the fused spine and might facilitate compensative movement of the adjacent\n      levels and increase degeneration rate of the spine.\n\n      Evidence has shown that core muscles play an important role to stabilize and support the\n      spine. Whether core stability exercise can enhance spinal stability after lumbar fusion\n      surgery remains unclear. Therefore, the overall goal of this proposed research is to\n      investigate how core muscles affect outcomes after lumbar spinal fusion. The investigators\n      will explore this issue hierarchically and systematically in 3-year duration."
