  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Palliative care is a priority area of focus for health care in an aging population
      experiencing burdens of chronic illness. Despite the evidence-based benefits of palliative
      care, access remains limited, especially in poor urban and rural settings. Cultural and
      linguistic barriers may also increase disparities in palliative care for Latinos. Due to a
      nationwide shortage of palliative care providers and the unique cultural preferences and
      values of patients, we are testing a patient navigator intervention to improve palliative
      care outcomes for Latinos with advanced cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our project uses a patient navigator to deliver a culturally tailored intervention to
      improve palliative care for Latinos with advanced cancer in urban and rural communities. The
      proposed research aims to improve palliative care with the goal of preventing and relieving
      suffering for people facing serious, complex illness. Palliative care, according to the
      National Quality Forum and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, provides patient and
      family-centered care offered in conjunction with curative and all other appropriate forms of
      medical treatment. It addresses physical, intellectual, emotional, social, spiritual needs,
      and facilitates patients' understanding of illness and choice. There is emerging evidence
      that palliative care may also improve survival for cancer patients. The proposed research
      also focuses on reducing health disparities. Studies have shown that Latinos are more likely
      to die in a hospital, less likely to use hospice services, and more likely to have unmanaged
      pain. Our study will recruit 240 Latino patients with advanced cancer from an urban safety
      net hospital, a National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, and
      several rural communities (including some of the poorest, most underserved counties in
      Colorado). Patients will be randomized to either a control or intervention group. The
      control group will receive written materials covering three important palliative care
      domains -advance care planning, pain management, and hospice care. The materials, in English
      and Spanish, are appropriate for patients with low health literacy. Patients in the
      intervention group will receive the same written materials but will also have a patient
      navigator who will make 5 home visits to review materials, help patients and families talk
      about goals/values, and complete an advance directive, all in a culturally and
      linguistically appropriate manner. The navigator may also help with: accessing community
      resources, participating in family meetings with health care providers, and offering support
      to patients and families. We hypothesize that our intervention will increase advance care
      planning, improve pain management, increase hospice referrals, and patients will have
      improved palliative care overall at the end of life. The patient navigator model has
      demonstrated an ability to improve cancer screening, early diagnosis, treatment, and
      survivorship. Once we demonstrate the efficacy of a patient navigator intervention to
      improve palliative care for advanced cancer patients, we can disseminate the training and
      intervention to all patient navigators working with Latino cancer patients.
