  <brief_summary>

      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of an experimental antibiotic,
      solithromycin, in the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) is an acute infection of the pulmonary
      parenchyma with symptoms such as fever or hypothermia, chills, rigors, chest pain, and/or
      dyspnea. The widespread emergence of antibiotic resistant pathogens, including the
      macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, has resulted in a need for new and effective
      antibiotics that have activity against CABP pathogens. Solithromycin is a fourth generation
      macrolide antibiotic with excellent activity against resistant S. pneumoniae and other key
      typical and atypical bacterial respiratory pathogens. A completed Phase 2 study showed
      comparable efficacy to levofloxacin in adults with CABP.
