  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two parts. Each participant will receive a daily injection of LY2605541
      during one treatment period and a daily injection of insulin glargine during one treatment
      period. Each treatment period is 2 to 3 weeks and is followed by a procedure to lower blood
      sugar levels to see how the body recovers after each treatment.
