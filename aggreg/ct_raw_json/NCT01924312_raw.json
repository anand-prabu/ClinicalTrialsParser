By doing this study, we hope to learn how vascular risk factors cause memory and\n      thinking changes in the elderly, and whether we can prevent memory and thinking changes by\n      reducing these risk factors. Successful completion of project aims will allow an integrated\n      understanding of mild cognitive impairment caused by vascular risks (MCI-CVD) with the\n      potential for tremendous impact on one of the major healthcare crises facing the nation\n      today.\n\n      The study will enroll 80 participants with memory and thinking problems (mild cognitive\n      impairment; MCI) and are at risk for stroke and further difficulties with memory and\n      thinking that may eventually lead to disability and a diagnosis of dementia.  Each\n      participant will be randomized into one of two groups (40 in each group) and followed over\n      36 months. One group will be followed to allow us to understand the natural history of\n      memory and thinking impairment, while the other group will receive intensive education and\n      assistance with vascular risk factor (CVD) control."

You will be in the study for 36 months if you\n      enroll.\n\n      Even if you do are not in the study group receiving medical management and educational\n      programs, we will be monitoring your risks for stroke and vascular risks every 6 months and\n      this information will be provided to your primary doctors, potentially resulting in an\n      increased level of care as a result of your participation in this study.\n\n      You must have an individual (spouse, friend, or relative), called a \"study partner\", who is\n      willing to accompany you to all of the study visits or be available by telephone to\n      communicate changes in your health status over the period of this study.\n\n      The study visits include checking vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate weight), regular\n      blood testing at 6 month intervals to monitor your vascular risks (blood sugar, cholesterol\n      levels)as well as ensure your safety throughout the study, yearly brain imaging with MRI\n      scans, and spinal fluid collection at enrollment and end of study to help us understand\n      brain changes that cannot be measured in blood."
