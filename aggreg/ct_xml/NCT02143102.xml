  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators use MRI to evaluate the extent, as well as, the structure, composition,
      and functional aspects of atherosclerotic plaques in human carotid and femoral arteries in
      patients scheduled to undergo an endarterectomy of the aforementioned vascular beds as part
      of their routine clinical care.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that in vivo MRI examinations of patients, when suitably
      acquired and analyzed with the vascuCAPâ„¢ analysis software, can provide a sufficiently
      accurate profile of plaque characteristics to provide an objective basis for patient
      management.  Study subjects include patients undergoing endarterectomies to mitigate their
      clinical risk or symptoms for conditions including stroke, claudication, and critical limb
      ischemia. The endarterectomy specimens removed at surgery will allow a direct comparison
      between the MRI information obtained prior to the surgery and the histopathological analyses
      of the arterial specimens. The vascuCAPTM measurements of structural and functional features
      of the arterial wall will be performed in patients undergoing endarterectomy. Measured
      results will be compared in a blinded fashion with histology to assess performance of plaque
      profiling and build a pilot prediction model for risk scoring.

    <description>Classify the target lesion according to whether the analytes suggest it is not a plaque, or if it is, which of the 8 AHA types best fits the analyte profile.  for each of the AHA types according to histopathology, we will report the frequency with which vascuCAPTM's classification agrees with histopathology.</description>
