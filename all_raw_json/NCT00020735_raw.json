Patients are stratified\n      according to participating center and baseline high-grade prostatic intraepithelial\n      neoplasia (none vs more than 0% up to 10% vs more than 10%). Patients are randomized to 1 of\n      2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral toremifene daily for 3-6 weeks in the absence of\n           unacceptable toxicity.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo observation alone. Patients in both arms then undergo radical\n           prostatectomy.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 78 patients (52 for arm I, 26 for arm II) will be accrued for\n      this study at a rate of 6-7 patients per month."
