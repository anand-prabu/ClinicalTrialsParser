Diagnosis is clinical and is based on the Bohan\n      and Peter criteria which comprises clinical examination, serological markers,\n      electromyography (EMG) and muscle biopsy. This has relatively poor sensitivity and\n      specificity. Muscle biopsy in particular has a false negative rate of 10-15% and is\n      invasive. Clinical criteria also lack the discriminatory power to differentiate between\n      recurrent (or breakthrough) myopathy and myopathy secondary to treatment with\n      corticosteroid.\n\n      Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has the advantage of being non-invasive, and is able to\n      discriminate between different tissues, and to identify areas of inflammation. The aim of\n      this study is to assess the effectiveness of MR sequences in the diagnosis of myopathy,\n      monitoring of treatment response, and in differentiating between breakthrough myopathy and\n      steroid-induced myopathy."
