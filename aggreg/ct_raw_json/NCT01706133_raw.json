Functional impairment may be a\n      \"marker\" of the effect of systemic disease on the patient and is also an indicator of\n      severity of disease because it measures the ability of independence\n\n      The accumulation of normal aging characteristics define a threshold, which once pierced,\n      tends to increase the propensity for loss of functional abilities due to aging. However, not\n      everyone ages the same way, since factors such as inherited genetic capital, especially the\n      accumulation of risks associated with lifestyle and work activities, and the opportunity to\n      identify the disease in its period latency coupled with the accessibility and use of health\n      services, can delay or exacerbate the loss of functionality and increase the dependency of\n      the elderly.\n\n        -  Quality of life of older\n\n      Frailty in the elderly is a state of increased susceptibility due to less booking multiple\n      physiological systems resulting in lower resilience, negative energy balance, sarcopenia,\n      decreased strength and reduced exercise tolerance. Frailty is associated with adverse health\n      outcomes such as institutionalization, falls, reduced performance status and increased\n      mortality."
