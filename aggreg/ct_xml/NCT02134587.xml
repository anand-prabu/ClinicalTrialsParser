  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spontaneous reports by health professionals generate the signals in pharmacovigilance.
      However, the passive method has limitations and the most important of them are the
      underreporting and the poor quality of data, hindering the causality assessment of adverse
      drug events (ADE). Therefore, the present study aimed to validate an educational
      intervention (EI) in pharmacovigilance for hospital health professionals, in order to
      analyze the impact on the knowledge, skill and attitude in ADE reporting.

      Investigators proposed a multifaceted EI which will be developed in four meetings with one
      hour each. The following activities will be carried out: application of a questionnaire to
      assess the knowledge, skill and attitude before and after EI; lecture; practical class and
      education material distribution. The answers of questionnaire are going to be analyzed using
      content analysis technique. The definitions of World Health Organization and the minimum and
      desired criteria to fill the ADE form, according to the Pan American Health Organization,
      are going to be considered gold-standard answers. The statistical test of Wilcoxon-Mann
      Whitney test for paired samples will be applied, in order to assess the impact of
      educational intervention on behavior of health professionals (ADE reporting).

      With the present study, the following hypotheses  will be tested:

      H0= There is no difference between the numbers of ADE reported (behavior/attitudes) before
      and after the educational intervention.

      H1= The numbers of ADE reported before and after the educational intervention are different.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A quasi-experimental study with health professionals who acted in a general and public
      hospital of medium complexity with 104 beds will be performed.

      Investigators proposed an educational intervention, with the development of lecture and
      practical class, application of questionnaire before and after EI and the distribution of
      educational material. Activities will be developed in four meetings of one hour each one.

      In the first meeting, questionnaire will  be applied, in order to assess knowledge, skills
      and attitudes in pharmacovigilance prior to EI. The instrument was elaborated based on
      previous studies. Second meeting will be comprise a lecture regarding the theoretical
      framework and importance of pharmacovigilance, and distribution of educational material,
      whose content includes the same issues of presentation. In the third meeting, a practical
      class will be performed to promote a discussion of a fictitious case of adverse drug
      reaction (ADR), in order to elucidate the correct fill of ADE form. In the fourth meeting,
      will be repeated the application of questionnaire, in order to assess the impact of EI. With
      the aim to verify change behavior of health professionals regarding pharmacovigilance
      activities, the number of ADE reports made prior and after intervention will be compared.

    <description>Investigators are going to verify the numbers of adverse drug events reported by health professionals which was made 12 months before educational intervention. A follow up across 12 months post-educational intervention also will be performed, in order to identify the number of adverse drug events reported by health professionals. Prevalence of ADE in both periods will be estimated and compared, in order to asses the impact of the intervention on change behavior of health professionals.</description>

    <description>Knowledge assessment will be performed by content analysis of answers obtained from questionnaire, being assigned scores from zero to ten. Definitions related to pharmacovigilance of World Health Organization will be considered gold-standard answers. Scores bellow five will be classified as unsatisfactory, among five and 7.5 were considered regular and above 7.6 satisfactory on the knowledge acquisition.The questionnaire will be applied in the first (prior to educational intervention) and fourth (post-educational intervention period) meetings. Data will be compared, in order to assess the impact of educational intervention on knowledge of health professionals.</description>

    <description>Skills evaluation will be carried out according to the perception of the voluntary regarding the relevance´s degree of the information to be filled in ADE form. Therefore, in the first (prior to educational intervention) and fourth (post-educational intervention period) meetings, subjects will be asked to highlight the fields of ADE form, according to unnecessary, necessary or essential information to be reported. Minimal and desirable criteria to be filled in ADE form preconized by Pan-American Health Organization will be considered gold-standard answers. Scores from zero to ten will be assigned, according to gold-standard answers. Data will be compared, in order to estimate the impact of educational intervention on skills to fill ADE form.</description>
