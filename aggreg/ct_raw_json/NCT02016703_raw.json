In each group of children, only one dose level\n      was tested such that each child was exposed to only a single dose level versus placebo. The\n      erythritol dose started at 5 grams and was increased by 10 g between each group of children\n      only if the preceding dose level was found to have no significant GI tolerance effects. The\n      effects on faecal parameters and gastrointestinal complaints were recorded in order to\n      determine the threshold dose. After finding a significant difference in tolerance between\n      erythritol and placebo in the 25 g dose cohort, a protocol amendment was approved allowing\n      the investigators to study a dose of 20 g.\n\n      Test materials were prepared by Cargill, Vilvoorde, Belgium and supplied in bottles\n      containing 250 mL of a noncarbonated fruit-flavoured (two flavours: strawberry and orange)\n      clear drink sweetened with erythritol at four different dose levels: 5, 15, 20 and 25 g\n      (equivalent to 2, 6, 8 and 10% w/v erythritol, respectively). Placebo was supplied in an\n      identical manner but prepared with common nutritive carbohydrates (saccharose and\n      maltodextrin) and providing an equivalent sweetness to that of the corresponding erythritol\n      beverages (i.e.: 1.4, 4.2, 5.6 and 7% w/v).\n\n      In total 185 healthy young children aged 4-6 years were recruited at three clinical\n      investigation centres after informed consent of both parents; 184 completed the study."
