    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the most effective route to administer steroids to
      patients with chronic sinusitis, specifically a type of chronic sinusitis not associated
      with nasal polyps (CRSsNP). The investigators would like to better understand whether orally
      administered steroids results in superior results when compared with nasally sprayed
      steroids. The investigators propose to test the hypothesis that for patients with
      radiographically proven CRSsNP, routine medical therapy consisting of a short course of
      systemic corticosteroids is superior to topical corticosteroids for relieving inflammation
      and the symptoms of CRS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic sinus infections (chronic sinusitis or CRS) are common conditions that affect
      millions of Americans. While this is a common disorder, medical treatments for this
      condition vary a lot and little is known how and why different treatments work in some
      individuals and not in others. Some physicians commonly utilize a course of oral steroid
      therapy similar to treatment of inflammatory conditions including asthma and arthritis.
      Other physicians feel that oral steroids are not more effective than nasal steroid sprays in
      reducing inflammation and prefer prescribing nasal steroids. There is no conclusive data as
      to whether oral or sprayed nasal steroids are more effective in providing long-term benefit
      to patients. Nasal steroids are FDA approved to treat some types of chronic sinusitis but
      oral steroids are FDA approved medications that are used to treat inflammatory conditions
      but is not specifically indicated for chronic sinusitis and thus should be regarded as
      investigational drug. The purpose of this research study is to better understand whether
      orally administered steroids results in superior results when compared with nasally sprayed
      steroids. The investigators will compare patients with chronic sinusitis who are first
      treated with antibiotics and oral steroids, and compare them to chronic sinusitis patients
      who receive antibiotics and nasally sprayed steroid therapy.
