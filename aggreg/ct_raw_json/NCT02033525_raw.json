For this purpose, 20 patients will be randomized (10 per group) to one of\n      the two treatment arms (rehabilitation + xcel-m-alpha or rehabilitation alone) . The\n      conduction of this clinical trial will, in addition of having the aim of improving the\n      patient's quality of life, contribute to consolidate an emerging new type of therapy which\n      is still under development."
