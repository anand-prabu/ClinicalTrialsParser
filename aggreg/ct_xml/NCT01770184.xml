  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who have a mild stroke have a 44% risk of dying from a second stroke within 10
      years which is in large part due to the cyclical relationship of chronic disease, poor
      health, and mild stroke which has gone largely unnoticed in the United States.
      Self-management intervention has been proven to be an effective intervention to increase
      healthy behaviors, improve overall health status, decrease healthcare utilization/cost,
      decrease depressive symptoms, and improve participation in people with a variety of chronic
      conditions; however, it has never be used with individuals with mild stroke.  The critical
      next step and goal of this study is to evaluate if self-management intervention will improve
      health outcomes for persons with mild stroke.  The overall hypothesis of this study is that
      self-management intervention will improve outcomes in the mild-stroke population.

    <description>The intervention group will receive the rehabilitation services and support that is recommended and provided in the current health care structure.  The intervention group will also receive the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP).  The CDSMP is an education program based on the concept of self-management. Self-management refers to the ability of an individual to manage the day-to-day responsibilities of living with a chronic condition. The CDSMP will be delivered in two and a half hour sessions, once a week, for six weeks, in group format.</description>
