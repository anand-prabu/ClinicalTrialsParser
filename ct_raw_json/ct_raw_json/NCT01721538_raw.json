It is a single-blinded, randomized, controlled multicentre trial with\n      two arms. The therapy arm is participating in a comprehensive weight reducing program,\n      whereas the control group takes part in a lecture on healthy nutrition. The primary study\n      objective is to assess the efficacy of non-drug therapeutic weight reduction in the\n      secondary prevention of stroke. Secondary objectives are functional outcome, cognitive\n      status, post stroke depression, and health-related quality of life."
