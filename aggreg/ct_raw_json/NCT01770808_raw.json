            "textblock": "Digestive discomfort includes gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, altered\n      bowel habit, flatulence and bloating and can sometimes result from slower intestinal transit\n      and other digestive irregularities. Digestive discomfort may lead to health issues in the\n      long-term. In a recent survey of over 1,000 women in the UK, 88% reported having experienced\n      digestive discomfort from time to time, but the majority of them (70%) had never consulted a\n      doctor or nurse. Digestive discomfort is often a source of embarrassment for people; they\n      therefore may be reluctant to address these issues with a healthcare professional.\n\n      Aquamin is a seaweed-derived mineral source, which is rich in calcium, magnesium and 74\n      other trace minerals including zinc, iron and selenium. It is produced from the red algae,\n      Lithothamnion Calcareum, which is found in just three locations in the world, including the\n      south-west coast of Ireland and Iceland. During a five-year life span, these algae absorb\n      essential minerals from the sea - this gives Aquamin its unique multimineral content. The\n      algae then break down naturally and settle on the sea bed. These calcified skeletal remains\n      are harvested, washed, dried and milled and provided in a capsule formulation. Aquamin is\n      proven to deliver digestive health benefits.  In a recent study, mice feed on a high-fat\n      'Western-style' diet (HFWD) and Aquamin, suppressed colon polyp formation and a reduction in\n      systemic inflammatory changes in comparison to those not receiving Aquamin.\n\n      The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of consuming Aquamin (as AquaCal\n      and AquaPT) on digestive discomfort and symptoms amongst adults without diagnosed\n      gastrointestinal disorders."
