            "textblock": "It has long been known that anaemia increases the risk of death and complications in\n      patients who have cardiovascular surgery, but results of a recent study show that these\n      risks are increased in patients with anaemia who undergo various types of surgery, including\n      gynaecological procedures.\n\n      Compared with patients without anaemia, the risk of death within 30 days after surgery was\n      42% higher among patients with anaemia. In addition, patients with anemia were 35% more\n      likely to experience cardiac, respiratory, urinary, and wound complications as well as\n      sepsis and blood clots.\n\n      Because even mild anaemia increases the risk of postoperative morbidity in patients\n      undergoing major non-cardiac surgery, doctors need to consider preoperative treatment of\n      anaemia when possible. More research is needed to establish the efficacy, safety and\n      cost-effectiveness of  pre-operative anaemia management.\n\n      One of the major clinical issues in many gynaecological patients in Nigeria is that of\n      optimizing the packed cell volume before surgery. Anaemia could be traced to multiple\n      factors notable of which are high prevalence of infection, worm infestation and malnutrition\n      (R). In other to reduce the waiting time and reduce morbidity and mortality associated with\n      surgery, it is important to correct the packed cell volume adequately before surgery.\n\n      The traditional method of correcting PCV involves the use of 'routine' haematinics such as\n      Ferrous sulphate, Folic acid and Multivitamin. This is in addition to dietary advice. While\n      the efficacy of these drugs has been well acknowledged in clinical practice, there is dearth\n      of literatures on their specific influence on haematological parameters. Majority of\n      Nigerians are gradually having a change of perception about traditional medicines with\n      gradual shift towards their use. It is believed that traditional drugs act faster and more\n      effective than other orthodox drugs in conventional use. One of such area is in the\n      correction of anaemia.\n\n      Sorghum bicolor, a grain long used in Africa for its high nutritional value also exhibits\n      strong antioxidant properties and antiinflammatory effects. The traditional preparation of\n      Sorghum bicolor has an oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) OF 37,622 micro mole TE/g.\n      This is much higher than other botanical preparations. Complementing the antioxidant\n      properties, Sorghum bicolor also exhibits anti inflammatory effects and demonstrated\n      selective COX-2 inhibition, providing effective reduction in inflammation without residual\n      side effects.\n\n      Sorghum bicolor extract  has been shown to increase the haematocrit and haemoglobin level\n      and reduce the white cell count in trypanosome brucei brucei induced anaemia in experimental\n      rabbits. These effects were conclusive within 49 days of experimentation. Animals sacrificed\n      after the administration of lethal dose Jobelyn were shown to have congestion of the liver,\n      kidneys and lungs. This might be as a result of direct effect on these organs or a sign of\n      cardiotoxicity. However there is a wide therapeutic range.\n\n      Sorghum bicolor is the proprietary name for the product intended to treat sickle cell\n      disease. It is exactly the same as jobelyn which is currently marketed as a nutritional\n      supplement. Jobelyn is marketed in 250mg capsules of sorghum bicolor leaf extract. The\n      product is widely marketed in the United States and in Nigeria. Many pregnant women have\n      been using it regularly for a long time without any report of adverse effect.\n\n      The sorghum bicolor extract is expected to increase the haematocrit of' pregnant women\n      within a short time."
