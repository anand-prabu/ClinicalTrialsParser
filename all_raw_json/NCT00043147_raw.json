Patients are stratified according to graft tissue source (2 HLA haplotype-identical\n      sibling vs all others) and topical steroid use at baseline (yes vs no). Patients are\n      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral beclomethasone dipropionate 4 times daily on days 1-50.\n           Patients also receive oral prednisone (or methylprednisolone IV) twice daily on days\n           1-10 with a rapid taper on days 11-17 followed by low-dose prednisone on days 18-80.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo 4 times daily on days 1-50. Patients also receive\n           prednisone (or methylprednisolone) as in arm I.\n\n      In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of poorly controlled GVHD at day 10 or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at days 51, 60, and 80 and then at 200 days post-transplantation.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 130 patients (65 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
