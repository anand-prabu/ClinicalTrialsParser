Optical\n      molecular imaging of neoplasia associated biomarkers could form a promising technique to\n      accommodate this need. It is known that the biomarker Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor\n      (VEGF) is overexpressed in dysplastic and neoplastic areas in BE segments versus normal\n      tissue and has proven to be a valid target for molecular imaging. The University Medical\n      Center Groningen (UMCG) developed a fluorescent tracer by labeling the VEGF-targeting\n      humanized monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, currently used in anti-cancer therapy, with the\n      fluorescent dye IRDye800CW. We hypothesize that when bevacizumab-IRDye800CW is administered,\n      it accumulates in VEGF expressing high grade dysplasia (HGD) and esophageal adenocarcinoma\n      (EAC), enabling early cancer visualization using a newly developed fluorescent NIR\n      fiber-bundle. This hypothesis will be tested in this pilot intervention study."
