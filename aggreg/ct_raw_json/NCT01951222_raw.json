Secondary properties of\n      V0162 (i.e.H1/H4 and PDE IV-inhibition) could enhance the efficacy of this antimuscarinic\n      compound and could bring option in the treatment obstructive lung disease. The objective of\n      the study is to assess the bronchodilator properties of V0162 during 8 days in adult\n      patients with asthma usually treated with ICS and LABA. The study is a randomised,\n      double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-period crossover, preceded by an open-label\n      active-control period before randomisation."
