Dose adjustments of the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) are allowed at any time based on the clinical judgment of the investigator. The BRV dose can be increased or decreased in increments of 50 mg/day based on the individual subject's seizure control and/or tolerability; however, the BRV dose should not exceed 200 mg/day during the study and must always be administered as a symmetrical morning and evening dose. Upon completion or early discontinuation from this study, there will be a Down-Titration Period in steps of 50 mg/day on a weekly basis until 20 mg/day for 1 week is reached, followed by a Post-Treatment Period (between 2 and 4 weeks) during which the subject will not receive study drug. No down-Titration Period will be applicable  if subjects are continued on BRV after they complete this study."
