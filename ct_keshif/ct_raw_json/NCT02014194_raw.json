Thus, the development of\n      new treatment strategies is necessary. The attentional bias - ability to aversive stimuli in\n      capturing the attention of an individual compared to a neutral stimulus - has been\n      extensively studied. Already training attentional bias modification has been shown effective\n      in reducing anxiety present in other anxiety disorders.This project aims to: 1 - generate\n      knowledge on attentional bias in individuals with OCD through the use of a standardized\n      protocol developed for OCD; 2 - available to the scientific community the first specific\n      paradigm for the study of attentional bias in OCD patients, 3 - test the effectiveness of a\n      training protocol for reversing attentional bias in individuals with OCD."
