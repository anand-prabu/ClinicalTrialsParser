HBV is one of the leading causes for rapid deterioration of liver function, which\n      is a serious condition termed as \"acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF)\" with high\n      mortality. There is a high prevalence of HBV in Asian developing countries where\n      acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure (ACHBLF) accounts for more than 70% of ACLF and\n      almost 120, 000 patients died of ACHBLF each year. The transplantation of liver is the basic\n      and strong effective therapeutic option for ACHBLF patients. However, liver transplantation\n      is difficult to be extensively applied due to the shortage of liver donors and other\n      socioeconomic problems. Thus, an early predictive model, which is objective, reasonable and\n      accurate, is necessary for severity discrimination and organ allocation to decrease the\n      mortality of ACHBLF.\n\n      MELD-based scoring systems still failed to predict the mortality of a considerable\n      proportion of patients and their predictive accuracy was not satisfying enough.\n\n      The ANN is a novel computer model inspired by the working of human brain. It can build\n      nonlinear statistical models to deal with the complex biological systems. In the recent\n      years, ANN models have been introduced in clinical medicine for clinical validations,\n      including predicting the hepatocellular carcinoma patients' disease-free survival and\n      preoperative tumor grade, predicting the mortality of patients with end-stage liver disease\n      and identifying the risk of prostate carcinoma."

Given the lack of donors, MELD was used as organ allocation tool to increase graft success rate and patient survival rates, which was generally accepted. Recently, some adjustments were added to the original MELD formula to overcome limitations of MELD score. Published data suggested that MELD-Na (R = MELD + 1.59 \u00d7 (135 - serum sodium (mmol/L))) might improve the prognostic accuracy [5].  Furthermore, several other scoring systems such as MELDNa (R = MELD - serum sodium (mmol/L) - (0.025 \u00d7 MELD \u00d7 (140 - serum sodium (mmol/L))) + 140), MESO (R = (MELD/serum sodium (mmol/L)) \u00d7 100), iMELD (R = MELD + (age(year) \u00d7 0.3) - (0.7 \u00d7 serum sodium (mmol/L)) + 100)), etc had been described for predicting the mortality of end-stage liver disease accurately.",
