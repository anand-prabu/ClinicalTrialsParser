This form\n      of stimulation is similar to transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) but allows for\n      more spatially focused stimulation. We hypothesise that HD-tDCS when applied to regions of\n      the brain important for learning and memory will improve verbal learning and memory compared\n      to sham HD-tDCS."
