Postoperative care was identical for both groups; A brace allowed free\n      active plantar flexion of the ankle postoperatively, whereas dorsiflexion was restricted to\n      neutral for the first three weeks. Weight bearing was limited for six weeks. To compare\n      these treatments, we use 1998 published Leppilahti-score, Rand-36 quality of\n      life-questionnaire and MRI. Mean follow-up time is 14 years.\n\n      Hypothesis; Augmentation with a down-turned gastrocnemius fascia flap does not provide\n      better result than would end-to-end suture repair with use of the Krackow locking loop\n      surgical technique in long-term follow up."
