      This partially randomized clinical trial studies cholecalciferol in improving survival in
      patients with newly diagnosed cancer with vitamin D insufficiency. Vitamin D replacement may
      improve tumor response and survival and delay time to treatment in patients with cancer who
      are vitamin D insufficient

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if vitamin D replacement in vitamin D insufficient patients with newly
      diagnosed untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) can improve event free survival at
      12 months to be equivalent to that of a control population of vitamin D sufficient patients.
      (Study I) II. To determine if vitamin D replacement in vitamin D insufficient patients with
      early stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) being managed with observation can improve
      the percentage of patients requiring treatment with conventional therapy at 36 months to
      that of a control population of vitamin D sufficient patients. (Study II) III. To determine
      the incidence of vitamin D insufficiency in Alaska Native People with untreated breast
      cancer and colorectal cancer. (Study III)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the effect of vitamin D replacement in vitamin D insufficient patients with
      newly diagnosed untreated DLBCL on overall survival. (Study I) II. To assess the effect of
      vitamin D replacement in vitamin D insufficient patients with newly diagnosed untreated
      DLBCL on event free survival. (Study I) III. To assess the effect of vitamin D replacement
      in vitamin D insufficient patients with newly diagnosed untreated T cell lymphoma on event
      free and overall survival. (Study I) IV. To assess if vitamin D replacement will increase
      the tumor response rate in Vitamin D insufficient CLL patients. (Study II) V. To assess the
      effect of vitamin D replacement in vitamin D insufficient Alaskan Native patients with newly
      diagnosed colorectal cancer (CRC) or breast cancer (BC) on event free and overall survival.
      (Study III)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study immune effector cells (lymphocytes, monocytes), serum cytokines, and tumor cells
      from vitamin D deficient and sufficient patients to learn the effects of vitamin D on both
      tumor cells and the patient's immune system. (Study I-II) II. To assess the kinetics of
      vitamin D replacement in vitamin D insufficient Alaskan Native people with CRC or BC. (Study
      III)

      OUTLINE:

      STUDY I: Vitamin D sufficient patients receive no intervention. Vitamin D insufficient
      patients receive cholecalciferol orally (PO) once weekly for 12 weeks and then once monthly
      for a total of 36 months.

      STUDY II: Vitamin D sufficient patients receive no intervention. Vitamin D insufficient
      patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive cholecalciferol PO once weekly for 12 weeks and then once monthly
      for a total of 36 months.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO once weekly for 12 weeks and then once monthly for a
      total of 12 months. Patients then receive cholecalciferol once monthly for up to 24 months.

      STUDY III: Vitamin D sufficient patients receive no intervention. Vitamin D insufficient
      patients receive cholecalciferol orally (PO) once weekly for 12 weeks and then once monthly
      for a total of 36 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.
