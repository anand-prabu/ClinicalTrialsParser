It is characterized by asymmetric occipital\n      flattening (one side or the central part of the occiput is flattened)with ipsilateral\n      frontal bossing.Viewed from above, this results in a parallelogram deformity of the head. We\n      hypothesize that children who had plagiocephaly when they were infants, they have postural\n      and spine implications at 3-5 years old."
