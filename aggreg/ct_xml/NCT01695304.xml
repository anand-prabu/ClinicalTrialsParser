  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to examine the efficacy of ceramic water filters to reduce the
      burden of waterborne diarrheal illness among infants in selected villages in Kenya. In Kenya
      very young children are given drinking water or water is used in reconstitution of their
      food.  We hypothesize that ceramic water filters will remove Cryptosporidium from drinking
      water reducing infection in infants.

    <textblock>
      Diarrhea is a major cause of illness among children in Africa. Cryptosporidium is a
      protozoan waterborne diarrheal pathogen resistant to chlorine. Ceramic filters are effective
      at improving drinking water quality, including removal of protozoa. In a recent preliminary
      analysis of &gt;22,000 children &lt;5 years enrolled in the Global Enterics Multi-Center Study
      (GEMS) case-control study of moderate-to-severe diarrhea, Cryptosporidium was identified as
      a leading cause of diarrhea in infants across all four participating African sites. This
      pilot is the first Cryptosporidium specific intervention trial of household ceramic water
      filters to reduce the burden of cryptosporidiosis acquired through drinking water in rural
      Kenya.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Children 4-10 months old living in selected villages in the Asembo Health and Demographic
        Surveillance System (HDSS) study area in Kenya whose primary caretakers consent on their
        behalf to be visited weekly for 6 months to carry out weekly illness surveillance, and
        have a follow up home visit one year after initial enrollment into the trial. The
        household in which the child resides must be a consenting participant in the HDSS. As the
        children included in the trial are infants, the child's primary caretaker will be invited
        to participate and be administered questionnaires. Random selection will be at the
        compound level. Only one household per compound will be eligible for selection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Children 4-10 months old whose households are not active consenting participants in the
        HDSS will not be eligible for inclusion. Only the subset of children 4-10 months old who
        are randomly selected in the sample will be eligible for participation.
