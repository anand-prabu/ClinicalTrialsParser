In a recent preliminary\n      analysis of >22,000 children <5 years enrolled in the Global Enterics Multi-Center Study\n      (GEMS) case-control study of moderate-to-severe diarrhea, Cryptosporidium was identified as\n      a leading cause of diarrhea in infants across all four participating African sites.
