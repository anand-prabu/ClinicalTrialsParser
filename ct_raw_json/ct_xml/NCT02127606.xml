  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective randomized crossover study is to determine the effect of
      whole body vibration compared with tilt table standing on spasticity in patients with
      chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). Twenty subjects with chronic (greater than 6 months)
      complete or incomplete SCI with a neurological level of injury above T10 will be randomly
      assigned to first undergo whole body vibration while standing on a tilt table for multiple
      treatments for a total of approximately 14 minutes followed by a one-hour break and then
      tilt-table standing alone for the same amount of time or vice versa. Spasticity monitoring
      will be evaluated prior to, during and after each treatment with physical examination
      electrophysiological monitoring and subject impression. We hypothesize that treatment
      following the combination of whole body vibration with tilt table standing compared to tilt
      table standing alone will result in a greater decrease spasticity measured by change in
      combined Modified Ashworth Scale score and at the individual joints evaluated, change in
      H-reflex amplitude, changed in H-reflex to M wave ratio (H:M ratio), and subject global
      impression.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is male or female, 18 to 70 years of age, inclusive.

          -  The subject has neurological impairment secondary to a spinal cord injury that
             occurred at least six (6) months prior to the study that can be categorized as either
             a complete or incomplete spinal cord injury.

          -  The neurological level of lesion is above T10.

          -  The subject has self-reported stable moderate to severe spasticity (Modified Ashworth
             Score scale at or greater than a 2 at the hips or knees). Patients can be enrolled if
             on a stable dose of oral medications or intrathecal medications.

          -  The subject is able to stand with the assistance of a tilt table at a minimum of 70
             degrees for 45 minutes without significant orthostasis or other adverse events or
             symptoms.

          -  The subject is able and willing to comply with the protocol.

          -  The subject is able to and has voluntarily given informed consent prior to the
             performance of any study-specific procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject does not self report lower limb spasticity.

          -  The subject experiences symptoms consistent with infection, including but not limited
             to fever, chills, dysuria, gallbladder or kidney stones.

          -  The subject experiences pain that is not well controlled with consistent pain
             medication use.

          -  The subject has recent thromboembolism, diabetes mellitus, intractable hypertension
             or cardiac/pulmonary instability, internal fixation implants, acute thrombosis,
             pregnancy, acute inflammation of the locomotor system including active arthrosis or
             arthropathy, acute tendinopathy, acute hernia, acute discopathy, recent post-surgical
             wounds, epilepsy, rheumatoid arthritis, or recent fractures&lt;6 months.

          -  The subject has a lumbar spinal hardware or artificial joints in the lower
             extremities.

          -  The subject is participating in any experimental studies that could alter the
             patient's spasticity.

          -  The subject has a concomitant brain injury or other cognitive deficits that would
             preclude following instructions.

          -  The subject has skin breakdown in areas receiving direct pressure during tilt table
             standing.

          -  The subject has any medical condition, including psychiatric disease that would
             interfere with the interpretation of the study results or the conduct of the study.
