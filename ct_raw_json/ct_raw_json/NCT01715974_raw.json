These women\n      will undergo IVF cycle and they will randomly divided in two groups: one (50 women) will be\n      treated with subcutaneous G-CSF 60 micrograms/day from the day of transfer to the day of\n      \u03b2-hCG test, and if it will be positive the treatment will be continued for other 40 days;\n      the group of control will be treated with subcutaneous saline solution infusion in the same\n      way of the study group. Primary outcomes will be considered: pregnancy rate and the of \u03b2-hCG\n      levels at 14/21/28 and 35 days after embryo transfer."
