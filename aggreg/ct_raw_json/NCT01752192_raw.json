The Teledi@log consortium sees its major task\n      as developing and testing scenarios which can lead to a more coherent rehabilitation for\n      heart patients in areas such as patient training, organization across the boundaries of the\n      health system and using tele-rehabilitation technology. The Teledi@log consortium seeks to\n      develop new tele-rehabilitation concepts which bring the patient closer to the health system\n      and thereby promote the heart patient's rehabilitation, giving the patient and their\n      families a more active role via new tele-rehabilitation technologies.The hypothesis of the\n      study is that heart patients participating in a telerehabilitation program will have a\n      higher quality of life compared to heart patients following traditional rehabilitation\n      activities."
