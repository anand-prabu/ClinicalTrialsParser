  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ubiquitous healthcare service for elderly patients with type 2 diabetes have been developed
      and improved glycemic control. However, previous U-healthcare service had some limitations,
      which needs specific devices to check blood glucose and send it to central system. Voice
      inception technique based U-healthcare service is expected to improve glycemic control
      without specific devices.

      To evaluate the clinical efficacy of this system, researchers plan to compare the
      improvement of glycemic control, self-management, and quality of life between U-health care
      group (intervention) and conventional treatment group (control).

      Ubiquitous healthcare for chronic disease such as diabetes is intensively developing field.
      Nowadays, various methods are tried to find the most effective and easiest way for supplying
      U-health care.

      Here, researchers are going to investigate the efficacy and safety of voice inception
      technique based U-healthcare service.
