  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Eating disorders&quot; includes anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating and eating
      disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS). Common to all is the intensively occupation to
      control food intake, body image and body weight. Most people with this kind of disorder
      don't reach for professional help, or there may be more than 4 years before they do.
      Cognitive behavior therapy is the foremost method of treatment of eating disorders, but up
      to 30% of the patients don't respond to this. The investigators find it important to
      identify science based alternatives of therapy, as this may reduce the health concern, and
      broaden the choice of therapy methods. A former study by Sundgot-Borgen et al in 2002, found
      guided physical activity to reduce symptoms of bulimia nervosa just as good as the
      traditional cognitive therapy.

      The primary objective of the project is to see whether the combination of physical activity
      and nutritional education is more effective in treating eating disorders, than cognitive
      therapy.

      Secondly, the investigators want to see whether there are any differences with regard to the
      individual satisfaction of treatment method, and to associated costs.

      Subjects are recruited through primary doctors, social media and newspapers, and will be
      included continuously by screening interviews. There will be a randomization into two
      treatment groups (cognitive behavior, or physical activity and nutrition education) to be
      followed for 16 weeks. Each week includes one meeting of group therapy (90 minutes) and
      homework related to treatment, and for 4 weeks midway there will be two therapy meetings pr
      week (a total of 20 meetings). Post tests are planned at week 17, and at 6, 12, 18 and 36
      months after treatment.
