The subject is a woman of childbearing potential who is pregnant, seeking to become\n             pregnant, or has a positive pregnancy test.\n\n          7. Subject with clinical instability in the judgment of the investigator, with a heart\n             rate > 120 bpm, respiratory rate > 24, SpO2 < 88%, blood pressure < 90/60 or > 140/90\n             or fever > 101, or subjects with hospitalization for progression of pulmonary\n             hypertension or right heart failure in the three months prior to the study.\n\n          8. Subject with diagnosis of active tuberculosis, lung cancer, clinically overt\n             bronchiectasis, allergic rhinitis, asthma, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, or\n             COPD.\n\n          9. Subject that had a respiratory tract infection in the 4 weeks prior to the screening\n             visit and throughout the duration of the study.\n\n         10. The subject has been exposed to a radiation dose over the past year that, when added\n             to the radiation dose expected in this study, would exceed permissible yearly\n             exposure as determined by the MGH radiation safety committee."

Briefly, this method consists of filtering the images with filters of different spatial size (length, mm) and measuring the coefficient of variation (CV) of perfusion in the imaged field. We then bin the CV into the following intervals: 12-36 mm, 36-60 mm, 60-84 mm, 84-108 mm and >108 mm and compare the CV in each bin among subjects.",
