  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, as a Phase I/II clinical trial, has two parts. The objective in the first part
      of this study is to determine the largest dose of the experimental anti-cancer drug, oral
      rigosertib, that can be given safely in combination with azacitidine. Azacitidine is an
      approved drug used to treat patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).  The second part
      of the study will assess if treatment with rigosertib (at the dose determined in the first
      part), in combination with azacitidine, has measurable effects in patients with MDS and
      other diseases. Safety of patients is an objective throughout both parts of the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase I/II open-label, single-arm, dose-escalating, multicenter study in
      which patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), or chronic
      myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) will receive subcutaneous (SC) or intravenous (IV)
      azacitidine per approved label in combination with oral rigosertib.

      The Phase I dose escalation portion of the study (3 to 18 patients) will follow a
      traditional 3+3 design, and will aim at determining the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and the
      Recommended Phase Two Dose (RPTD) for the combination regimen. The Phase II RPTD cohort (up
      to 28 evaluable patients) will be treated at the MTD/RPTD level, as determined during the
      escalation phase. Patients treated at the MTD/RPTD in the Phase I component of the study
      will be included in the Phase II component and evaluated for response.
