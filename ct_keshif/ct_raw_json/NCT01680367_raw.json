Currently there is a dressing that is transparent and it is placed on the wound\n      after surgery and wrapped with gauze and an elastic bandage. Two days after the surgery the\n      gauze and elastic bandages are removed and the area is left with the transparent dressing.\n      Sometimes the dressing needs to be changed because it leaks. On the fifth day this dressing\n      is removed and the wound is left open to air. The dressing researchers are studying is a\n      dressing that has been used for different types of wounds, as well as this type of wound. It\n      is applied in the same manner; however, it is left in place until it falls off\n      independently, usually around post-operative (post-op) day 10."
