Treatment\n      continues for at least 2 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease\n      progression. Patients achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for an additional\n      8 months after CR.\n\n      Tumors are measured after 1 month, every 1-2 months for 2 years, every 3 months for 1 year,\n      every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified"
