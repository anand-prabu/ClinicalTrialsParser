Normally, bowel emptying requires relaxation of the anal sphincter (i.e.,\n      lowermost end of intestinal tract) and pelvic muscles.  Some people cannot relax these\n      muscles normally and experience constipation. Alfuzosin is a medication which is approved to\n      treat bladder but not bowel problems."
