  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the overall safety and efficacy of TRV027 when administered in addition to
      standard of care (SOC) on mortality, morbidity, dyspnea, and length of stay in patients
      hospitalized with Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF).

    <description>The primary clinical endpoint is a  of the following outcomes: (1) time from randomization to death through day 30, (2) time from randomization to heart failure re-hospitalization through day 30, (3) time from randomization to worsening heart failure through day 5, (4) change in dyspnea VAS score (calculated area under the curve) from baseline through day 5, and (5) length of initial hospital stay (in days) from randomization.  The component outcomes will be combined by deriving an average Z for each patient.</description>
