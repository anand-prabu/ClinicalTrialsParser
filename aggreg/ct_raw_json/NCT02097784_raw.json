This echocardiography will be done before the volemic expansion and the final\n      diagnostic of hepatorenal syndrome or prerenal azotemia. The primary endpoint is to describe\n      the hemodynamic characteristics of this population at the time of acute kidney injury and\n      their association with diagnostic of hepatorenal syndrome or prerenal azotemia. Patients\n      with elevated filling pressure, predicting poor outcome of volemic expansion will be\n      excluded of the study after the echocardiography and will not undergo volemic expansion but\n      appropriate management."
