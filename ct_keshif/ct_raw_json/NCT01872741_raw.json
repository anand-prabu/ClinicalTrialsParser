In the first, the patients will be\n      showed to a rule, with a scale from 0 to 100, in which 0 mean the best result and 100 the\n      worst result. Photos will be taken and showed to two independent observers, the results will\n      be classified as excellent, good, regular or poor. The degree of atrophy will be measured\n      with three methods. In the first one, the authors wiil observes the percentage of thick\n      reduction in the temporal muscle, subcutaneous tissue and skin. In the second method the\n      percentage thick reduction of the isolated temporal muscle will be measured and the third\n      the volumetric analysis of the temporal muscle, subcutaneous tissue and skin will be\n      calculated from the superior edge of zygomatic arch to superior temporal line. The\n      functional results wiil be compared using the Modified Rankin Score. Others variables such\n      frontal facial palsy, post-operative hemorrhage, cerebrospinal fistulas, hydrocephalus and\n      mortality will be also analyzed"
