            "textblock": "Vildagliptin and Sitagliptin both belong to the class of DPP-4 inhibitors, but differ in\n      their pharmacokinetic profile as well as in their approved application (Vildagliptin, 2x 50\n      mg daily, Sitagliptin, 1x 100 mg daily). This leads to distinct results regarding\n      postprandial blood-glucose normalization as well as protective properties regarding\n      hypoglycemic episodes - especially during the night. Additionally, in type 1 diabetic\n      patients a correlation has been described between hypoglycemia and abnormal heart function\n      (QTc-elongation), which can have severe consequences for the patients. This study aims for\n      the evaluation of the potency of both drugs to prevent and/or reduce hypoglycemic events in\n      insulin-dependent type-2 diabetics and furthermore to evaluate the correlation of\n      hypoglycemic episodes with changes in heart-function measured by Holter-ECG.\n\n      The hypothesis is tested, if vildagliptin leads to a more favourable glycemic profile than\n      sitagliptin and is more potent in protecting from nocturnal abnormalities in heart-function\n      caused by undetected hypoglycemic episodes."
