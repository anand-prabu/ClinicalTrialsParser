Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to\n      kill liver cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of doxorubicin and interleukin- 2 in\n      treating patients who have liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery."

Evaluate the immunological response to doxorubicin and protracted recombinant\n      interleukin-2 in terms of alterations in hepatocellular carcinoma specific cytotoxic T cells\n      detectable in peripheral blood in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. II.\n      Determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen in this patient population. III. Determine\n      the tumor response to this regimen in terms of changes in alpha fetoprotein and tumor size\n      measured by CT scan in these patients. IV. Determine the progression free survival and\n      overall survival of this patient population treated with this regimen. V. Determine the\n      correlation between immunological response, tumor response, progression free survival and\n      overall survival in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 3-5 minutes on day 1 and recombinant\n      interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV continuously beginning on day 5 and continuing until day 57.\n      Patients achieving partial or complete clinical response regardless of immunological\n      response and patients with stable disease and an immunological response continue on IL-2\n      therapy continuously until day 92. Patients with stable disease and no immunological\n      response receive an additional dose of doxorubicin on day 57 and then continue on IL-2 until\n      day 92. Patients who are clinically eligible with progressive disease and an immunological\n      response continue IL-2 therapy as above. Patients are followed at 2 weeks and then monthly\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-30 patients will be accrued for this study within\n      approximately 3 years."
