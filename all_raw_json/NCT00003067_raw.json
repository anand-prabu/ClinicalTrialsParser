Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill\n      cancer cells in patients with primary or advanced glioma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of biological therapy with interleukin-2\n      and lymphokine-activated killer cells in treating patients who have primary, recurrent, or\n      refractory malignant glioma."

Lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and IL-2 are infused on\n      day 1. Bolus infusions of low-dose IL-2 are administered on days 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12,\n      followed by a rest period on days 13-24. The course is repeated on day 25 starting with\n      leukapheresis. Therapy courses are repeated for up to 1 year for stable disease or response\n      to therapy. Maintenance doses repeat every 4-6 months thereafter.\n\n      Disease restaging is done every 8-12 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients per year will be enrolled."
