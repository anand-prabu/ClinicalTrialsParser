  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A previously published, placebo-controlled, head-to-head comparator study found eletriptan
      to have superior efficacy to oral sumatriptan 100 mg in treating a single acute migraine
      attack. The goal of the current study was to extend the findings of that study by examining
      the efficacy of eletriptan compared with both 50- and 100-mg doses of sumatriptan; and to
      evaluate the comparative efficacy of eletriptan and sumatriptan across additional important
      clinical outcomes. In particular, early response (at 1 hour), sustained response (without
      need for additional treatment) at 24 hours, and consistency of response across multiple
      attacks were examined.
