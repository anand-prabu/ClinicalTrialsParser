The duration of the\n      study is 18 weeks, including a 2-week run-in period before randomization of subjects into\n      the synbiotic or placebo group, a 12-week intervention period, and a 4-week follow-up after\n      the end of the intervention. During the intervention period, subjects will be instructed to\n      take 3 capsules of either synbiotic or placebo per day and maintain their habitual diet and\n      physical activity. They will also be asked to document any unusual symptoms or side effects\n      as well as keep a bowel diary. Diet and physical activity will be monitored via 24-h dietary\n      recalls and the global physical activity questionnaire respectively. Changes in the gut\n      microbiota composition will be determined by measuring bacterial population levels in stool\n      sampled collected at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and the follow up time point. Body\n      composition will be measured using the BOD POD at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. Gene\n      expression levels will be assessed at baseline and 12 weeks in colonocytes (isolated from\n      stool samples) and PBMCs (isolated from blood samples) by qPCR. Metabolic markers will be\n      measured at baseline and 12-weeks in plasma or serum using the respective biochemical- or\n      immuno-assays."
