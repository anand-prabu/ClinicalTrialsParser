    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of TMC278 after a
      single oral dose of TMC278 25 mg tablet (27.5 mg as the hydrochloride salt) under fed
      conditions in healthy Japanese adult male participants.

    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label (all study staff and participants will know the identity
      of the treatment assigned), single dose study in healthy Japanese adult male participants.
      The study consists of 3 phases: a screening phase up to 26 days; an inpatient phase from Day
      -2 to Day 8; and a follow-up assessment phase that occurs on Day 15 (± 2 days) or at the
      time of the participant's early withdrawal from the study. Participants who meet the
      selection criteria will be admitted to the investigational institute on two days before the
      dose (Day -2). All enrolled participants will receive orally (by mouth) a single dose of one
      TMC278 25 mg tablet on Day 1 within 10 minutes after completion of the standardized
      breakfast. Enrolled participants will remain in the investigational institute for the entire
      duration of the inpatient phase. Participants will be discharged on Day 8 after the
      completion of all required assessments. Blood samples for determination of plasma
      concentrations of TMC278 will be collected over a period of 168 hours (7 days). The maximum
      study duration for each participant is 45 days, including the screening phase, in-patient
      period, and follow-up visit.
