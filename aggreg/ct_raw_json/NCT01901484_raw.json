Communities with the highest S. mansoni prevalence and\n      intensity will be chosen and included in the study. In the second phase (Phase II) the S.\n      mansoni positive children will be divided randomly into two intervention groups, single and\n      double dose praziquantel treatment arms. Abdominal ultrasound will be combined with clinical\n      examination to accurately identify hepatosplenomegaly. The sizes of both the liver and\n      spleen will be examined. Anthropometric measurements and Hb for each child will also be\n      recorded. In the last phase (Phase III), the effect of praziquantel on S. mansoni morbidity\n      will be evaluated in all the treated children aged 1-5 years."
