Patients with ADA deficiency and ineligible for matched sibling allogeneic bone\n      marrow transplantation are eligible to participate in the study. To increase engraftment and\n      selected advantage or gene-corrected cells, busulfan will be used as a cytoreductive agent.\n      Enzyme replacement (PEG-ADA) will be discontinued 30 days after infusion of gene-corrected\n      cells.  CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors will be isolated from the patient bone marrow,\n      peripheral blood or cord blood, exposed to lentiviral vector-mediated gene transfer and\n      re-infused into the patient through a peripheral vein. Clinical, immunological and molecular\n      follow-up studies will assess safety, toxicity, and efficacy of the procedure."

Patients with DFSP who are not being treated with\n                       active anti-neoplastic therapy at the time of enrollment AND have no plan\n                       to receive active anti-neoplastic therapy in the absence of progressive\n                       malignant disease AND whose DFSP is not expected to be life-limiting within\n                       the five years following the infusion of genetically corrected cells are\n                       eligible.\n\n        Patients with DFSP, for whom radiation or chemotherapy has been chosen, would remain\n        ineligible during treatment, as the interaction of busulfan and the experimental gene\n        transfer vectors with active anti-neoplastic therapy is difficult to predict and could\n        reasonably be expected to be deleterious due to overlapping toxicities. When\n        anti-neoplastic therapy is concluded, patients with ADA-SCID and a history of DFSP can be\n        included."
