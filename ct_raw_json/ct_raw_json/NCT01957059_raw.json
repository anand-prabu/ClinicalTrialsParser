Duchenne muscular dystrophy resulting from a mutation correctable by treatment with\n             PRO053 confirmed by a state-of-the-art DNA diagnostic technique covering all DMD gene\n             exons, including but not limited to MLPA (Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe\n             Amplification), CGH (Comparative Genomic Hybridisation), SCAIP (Single Condition\n             Amplification/Internal Primer) or HRMCA (High-Resolution Melting Curve Analysis).\n\n          2. Ambulant boys aged at least 5 years on the day of first dosing able to walk for at\n             least 230 metres in the 6 minute walking distance (6MWD) test. In addition, results\n             of the 6MWD test must be within \u00b130 metres of each other at 2 of 3 pre-treatment\n             visits (screen 1, 2 and baseline) prior to first PRO053 administration.\n\n          3. Adequate quality for biopsy (confirmed with MRI) of the lateral head of the\n             gastrocnemius muscle. Only under exceptional circumstances will an alternative muscle\n             (preferably brachii) be considered for biopsy and only following discussion between\n             the Principal Investigator and the Prosensa Medical Monitor.\n\n          4. Life expectancy of at least 3 years after inclusion in the study.\n\n          5. Glucocorticosteroid use which is stable for at least 3 months prior to first PRO053\n             administration. Subjects must have been receiving glucocorticosteroids for at least 6\n             months prior to the first PRO053 administration.\n\n          6. Willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol\n             requirements.\n\n          7. Written informed consent signed (by parent(s)/legal guardian and/or the subject,\n             according to the local regulations).\n\n          8. In France, a subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if either\n             affiliated to, or a beneficiary of, a social security category.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Known presence of \u22655% dystrophin in fibres of a pre-study diagnostic muscle biopsy\n             (i.e. historic muscle biopsy taken prior to written informed consent for this study).\n\n          2. Current or history of liver disease or impairment.\n\n          3. Current or history of renal disease or impairment.\n\n          4. At least two aPTT above upper limit of normal (ULN) within the last month prior to\n             first dose of PRO053.\n\n          5. Screening platelet count below the lower limit of normal (LLN).\n\n          6. Acute illness within 4 weeks prior to first dose of PRO053 which may interfere with\n             the study assessments.\n\n          7. Severe mental retardation and/or behavioural problems which, in the opinion of the\n             Investigator, prohibit participation in this study.\n\n          8. Severe cardiomyopathy which, in the opinion of the Investigator prohibits\n             participation in this study. If a subject has a left ventricular ejection fraction\n             <45% at screening, the Investigator should discuss inclusion of the subject with the\n             Medical Monitor.\n\n          9. Expected need for daytime mechanical ventilation within the next year.\n\n         10. Use of anticoagulants, antithrombotics or antiplatelet agents.\n\n         11. Use of idebenone or other forms of coenzyme Q10 within 1 month prior to the start of\n             the screening for the study.\n\n         12. Use of nutritional or herbal supplements which, in the opinion of the Investigator,\n             may influence muscle performance within 1 month prior to first dose of PRO053.\n\n         13. Use of any other investigational product or participation in another trial with an\n             investigational product, within 6 months prior to the start of the screening for the\n             study."
