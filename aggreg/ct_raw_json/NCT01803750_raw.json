Interviews will be audio recorded if the participant agrees, and answers to fixed response questions will be marked for complete analysis. The data collection portion of the study is estimated to take approximately 8 months. Areas to be addressed in the open-ended portion of the interview include: 1) Knowledge, attitudes and beliefs toward evidence-based cancer screening and prevention approaches 2) Barriers to implementing evidence-based cancer screening practices in the individual provider's clinical setting 3) Preferences for mechanisms of information dissemination and implementation and 4) Ideas and methods to facilitate evidence-based practices to improve cancer screening in the Latino population. A community-based participatory committee (CBPC) will be formed with 5-7 key informants identified during the interview process.",
