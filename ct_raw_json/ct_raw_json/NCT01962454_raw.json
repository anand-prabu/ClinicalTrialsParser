This study will also investigate whether\n      the FSR of proteins may serve as early biomarkers for muscle anabolism, a known anabolic\n      agent (testosterone) will be administered to healthy, elderly male subjects over a 3 week\n      period. The fractional synthetic rate of several muscle-derived proteins will be analyzed at\n      Baseline and during the period of testosterone treatment using deuterium labelling of these\n      proteins by the incorporation of deuterium from deuterated water (D2O)."
