The SNUMAP device consists of a wrist module and finger module, which\n      attaches to an patients's finger and transmits three dimensional motions to a wrist module\n      for storage and further analysis. The aims of this study is to assess tremor severity using\n      tri-axial accelerometry and gyroscope to determine the reliability and the correlation with\n      clinical measurements."
