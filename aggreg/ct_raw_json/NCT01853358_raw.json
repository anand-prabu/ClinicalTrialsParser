However, regular documented effects are the occurrence of secondary aplasia\n      and/or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) including the post RIC situation. These effects are\n      related to the high content of cytotoxic T cells in the DLI. Attempts to deplete CD8+\n      T-cells from DLI have been conducted with promising results but are not totally\n      satisfactory.\n\n      More recently the infusion of r-IL2 ex-vivo activated autologous or allogeneic NK-selected\n      cells have been studied and the safety established in patients presenting various\n      malignancies.\n\n      Indeed, NK are thoroughly characterized in terms of genotype, phenotype and function.\n      Although a handful of clinical-grade reagents and devices exist that give access to the\n      human NK cell compartment, an immuno-selection device exists that allows for the selection\n      of NK cells from various types of hematopoietic cell collections in view of clinical\n      applications: the process produces CD3-/CD56+ cells in two steps and have been used in the\n      previous experiences."
