This has been attributed to a rise in Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection.\n      HPV+OPSCC is considered a distinct disease entity, affecting younger patients and has a good\n      prognosis following treatment. Subsequently, patients can live with the considerable side\n      effects for several decades.\n\n      Radiotherapy and cetuximab (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-inhibitor) have demonstrated\n      similar efficacy to 'platin' chemoradiotherapy (current standard treatment containing\n      platinum-based compounds) in head and neck cancer, but is potentially less toxic.\n\n      Results of this trial will be used to determine the optimum treatment of this debilitating\n      cancer, with the primary aim of decreasing toxicity and improving quality of life for\n      HPV+OPSCC patients."
