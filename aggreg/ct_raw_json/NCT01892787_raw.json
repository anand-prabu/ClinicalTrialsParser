            "textblock": "The airways in the lungs get smaller the further into the lungs they go. Most simple\n      measurements of lung function only reflect the larger 'central' airways and do not provide\n      information on the smaller 'peripheral' airways. Newer measurements have been developed that\n      can now give us accurate information on how the smaller airways are working. Indeed the\n      small airways seem to play a significant role in asthma in terms of inflammation and airway\n      narrowing. Recently, new types of inhaler formulations have been developed that have a much\n      smaller particle size than other standard formulations. These formulations have been shown\n      to go further into the lungs, thus getting into the smaller airways. In this study we aim to\n      compare the two extremes of available long acting beta agonists in terms of particle size\n      i.e. extra fine formoterol (Atimos) versus coarse particle salmeterol (Serevent)in\n      asthmatics with abnormal small airway function using a breathing test called impulse\n      oscillometry. By using this test we will be able to find out whether using an extrafine\n      particle inhaler improves small airway function."
