  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators purpose is to determine the ability of a low cost, currently available
      imaging technique to predict the location of shoulder disease based on motion analysis of
      subjects with known shoulder disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder disorders account for the second largest number of musculoskeletal cases in the
      United States with a large health care burden. The current standard for diagnosis of
      shoulder disorders is a clinical exam, visual motion assessment and in some cases, costly
      magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. However, specific tissue pathologies are not always
      accurately identified, and often not directly linked to the magnitude of dysfunction. There
      is a need for categorizing or sub-grouping patients based on the underlying movement
      dysfunctions with which they present. Video fluoroscopy is a common clinical tool that can
      improve the accuracy of motion analysis. The investigators are using 2-D fluoroscopy,
      combined with 3-D MR imaging to measure shoulder motion. From the motion analysis we can
      predict areas of potential soft tissue disease, and compare these to disease locations from
      MR imaging. The investigators hypotheses is that our motion based predicted disease
      locations will be significantly associated with disease locations from MR imaging.

    <description>Measures will predict presence/absence of rotator cuff disease in each of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis muscles (rotator cuff).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Normal subjects with normal normal shoulder movement and function will be included,
             age and gender matched to symptomatic subjects.

          -  Symptomatic subjects will be included if visual shoulder movement deviates from what
             might be considered normal; they are experiencing shoulder pain with movement, and
             clinical examination is consistent with soft tissue cumulative trauma to the soft
             tissues (rotator cuff disease).

          -  Clinical MR imaging will be used to confirm rotator cuff disease, subacromial
             bursitis, and/or bicipital tendinitis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age outside the accepted range. Contraindications to radiation exposure (pregnancy or
             possible pregnancy, other recent substantive radiation exposures (CT scanning,
             treatments involving radiation). Subjects unable to move through at least 90 degrees
             of shoulder motion will also be excluded.
