            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Scleritis is the inflammation of the white outer coating of the eye, known as the sclera.\n      In severe cases, it can cause blindness. It is commonly associated with autoimmune disorders\n      such as rheumatoid arthritis. Mild scleritis can be treated with drugs such as ibuprofen.\n      More severe scleritis may need oral steroids or immunosuppressive treatments; however, these\n      treatments can cause side effects in the whole body. Gevokizumab is a newer\n      anti-inflammatory drug that is under investigation to treat other inflammatory diseases. It\n      may not have as severe side effects as some other drugs. However, it has not yet been used\n      to treat scleritis. Researchers want to see if it can be given as a safe and effective\n      treatment for scleritis.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To see if gevokizumab is a safe and effective treatment for scleritis.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have active scleritis.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  There are two parts in this study, the initial phase and the extension phase. The\n           extension phase is optional. The initial phase of the study requires seven visits to\n           the National Eye Institute.\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and eye exam.\n           Blood and urine samples will be collected.\n\n        -  Participants will receive an injection of gevokizumab. The injections will be given at\n           the first study visit and at Weeks 4, 8, and 12. They will be given under the skin by\n           the stomach, or in the upper arm or thigh.\n\n        -  Participants will have additional visits at 2, 16, and 28 weeks after the first study\n           visit. These visits will monitor the treatment. Eye exams will be given, and blood and\n           tear samples will be collected.\n\n        -  If the scleritis improves by Week 16, participants may choose to continue the study.\n           They will have a visit every 4 weeks until Week 36 and then two additional monitoring\n           visits at Weeks 40 and 52 for a total of 13 study visits."

            "textblock": "Objective: Scleritis is a chronic, painful and potentially blinding inflammatory disease\n      characterized by edema of the episcleral and sclera tissues and is commonly associated with\n      systemic autoimmune disorders. Gevokizumab is an interleukin-1Beta (IL-1B) inhibitor, thus\n      possibly preventing the IL-1B that may be responsible for scleral breakdown in patients with\n      anterior scleritis. The study objective is to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of\n      gevokizumab as a possible treatment of non-infectious, active, anterior scleritis.\n\n      Study Population: Ten participants with non-infectious, active, anterior scleritis with a\n      scleral inflammatory grade of greater than or equal to plus 1 in at least one eye will be\n      initially enrolled. However, up to an additional two participants may be enrolled to account\n      for participants who withdraw from the study prior to Week 16. Participants may be on less\n      than or equal to 20 mg/day of prednisone or the equivalent at the time of enrollment but all\n      other immunosuppressive drugs will be stopped with the initiation of study drug.\n\n      Design: This is a Phase 1/2, open label, non-randomized, prospective, single-arm, pilot\n      trial to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of gevokizumab in non-infectious,\n      active, anterior scleritis. The study consists of an initial phase followed by an extension\n      phase. For the initial phase, all participants will receive one subcutaneous injection of 60\n      mg gevokizumab at Baseline and Weeks 4, 8 and 12. At Week 16, participants will be assessed\n      for eligibility in the extension phase of the study. Participants who do not continue in the\n      extension phase of the study will discontinue the study drug and may receive salvage therapy\n      using standard-of-care treatment at the investigator   s discretion. Participants who do not\n      continue in the extension phase will return for a final safety visit at Week 28.\n      Participants who are determined eligible for the extension phase may continue in the\n      extension phase and receive one gevokizumab injection (60 mg) every four weeks until the\n      Week 36 visit. Participants in the extension phase will have safety visits at Weeks 40 and\n      52.\n\n      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome is the number of participants with at least a 2-step\n      reduction or reduction to grade 0 in scleral inflammation in the study eye (or eyes, if both\n      eyes meet study eye criteria), according to a standardized photographic scleritis grading\n      system developed at NEI, on or before the Week 16 visit as compared to Baseline. Secondary\n      outcomes include changes in visual acuity, changes in intraocular pressure and changes in\n      scleral grading. Safety outcomes include the number and severity of systemic and ocular\n      toxicities and adverse events (AEs), and the proportion of participants with loss of greater\n      than or equal to 15 ETDRS letters at any follow-up visit."
