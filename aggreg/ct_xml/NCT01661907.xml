  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium is a common complication in critically ill patients after surgery.
      Its occurrence is associated with poorer prognosis of the patients. The pathophysiology of
      delirium remains poorly understood. A universal phenomenon is that delirium was frequently
      identified in elderly patients after major complicated surgery, but was rarely noted after
      minor ambulatory surgery (such as cataract surgery). This indicated that stress response
      produced by surgery might have an important role in the pathogenesis of delirium. It has
      been reported that, when compared with general anesthesia and postoperative intravenous
      analgesia, neuraxial anesthesia and analgesia reduced the occurrence of postoperative
      complications and mortality in high risk patients. Combined epidural-general anesthesia is
      frequently used in clinical practice. This anesthesia method provides advantages of both
      epidural and general anesthesia, i.e. it blocks the afferent pathway of nociceptive stimulus
      by neuraxial blockade during and after surgery, and allows patients to endure lengthy
      complicated operations without any awareness. The investigators hypothesize that combined
      epidural-general anesthesia and postoperative epidural analgesia can decrease the incidence
      of postoperative delirium and, thus, improve the prognosis of critically ill elderly
      patients undergoing major surgery. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of
      combined epidural-general anesthesia/postoperative epidural analgesia and general
      anesthesia/postoperative intravenous analgesia on the incidence of postoperative delirium in
      elderly patients undergoing major surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is a transient mental syndrome of acute onset characterized by global impairment of
      cognitive functions, reduced level of consciousness, abnormalities of attention, increased
      or decreased psychomotor activity, and disordered sleep-wake cycle. Postoperative delirium
      is a common complication in critically ill patients after surgery. Dyer et al reviewed 80
      primary studies and found that the mean incidence of postoperative delirium is about 36.8%
      (range 0%-73.5%) after surgery. It occurred in up to 80% of patients in the ICU. Our recent
      studies found that the incidence of postoperative delirium occurring in patients at the SICU
      was 51.0% after cardiac surgery and 44.5% after non-cardiac surgery.

      The occurrence of postoperative delirium is associated with poorer prognosis of the
      patients. Studies showed that delirious patients had prolonged ICU stay, increased incidence
      of complications, prolonged hospitalization, high mortality rate, and increased health care
      costs. Delirium is also associated with increased risk of long-term cognitive decline and
      poor quality of life. A recent follow-up study (mean follow-up time 27.9 Â± 3.1 months) by
      our research group found that, after adjusting factors such as age, occurrence of
      postoperative complications, and stage of malignant tumors, etc, the occurrence of
      postoperative delirium still remained an independent predictor of long-term mortality in
      patients.

      The pathophysiology of delirium remains poorly understood. A universal phenomenon is that
      delirium was frequently identified in elderly patients after major complicated surgery, but
      was rarely noted after minor ambulatory surgery (such as cataract surgery). Studies also
      found that postoperative pain was an independent risk factor of delirium, and effective pain
      relief may help to reduce the incidence of delirium. Our recent studies of patients
      undergoing cardiac or non-cardiac surgeries both showed that high serum cortisol level was
      an independent predictor of postoperative delirium. In addition, inflammatory response may
      also contribute to the pathogenesis of delirium. Trauma, pain, cortisol secretion and
      inflammation are all important components of surgical stress response. The above results
      indicated that stress response produced by surgery might have an important role in the
      pathogenesis of delirium.

      Previous studies demonstrated that, when compared with general anesthesia, neuraxial
      anesthesia attenuated the hypersecretion of cortisol, and decreased the intensity of
      inflammatory response more effectively after surgery. And epidural analgesia provided better
      postoperative pain relief than intravenous analgesia. It was also reported that, when
      compared with general anesthesia and intravenous analgesia, neuraxial anesthesia and
      analgesia reduced the occurrence of postoperative complications and mortality in high risk
      patients. Combined epidural-general anesthesia is frequently used in clinical practice, and
      is performed in about 1/4 of patients undergoing surgery in the applicant's hospital.
      Theoretically, this anesthesia method provides advantages of both epidural and general
      anesthesia, i.e. it blocks the afferent pathway of nociceptive stimulus by neuraxial
      blockade during and after surgery, and allow patients to endure lengthy complicated
      operations without any awareness. However, because of the limitations of study methods and
      sample size, there were no clear answers to date on the difference between the incidences of
      postoperative delirium after general versus regional anesthesia. And there is no evidence
      whether combined epidural-general anesthesia can decrease the incidence of postoperative
      delirium and, thus, improve the prognosis of critically ill elderly patients undergoing
      major abdominal surgery.

      The objective of the study is to compare the effects of combined epidural-general anesthesia
      and general anesthesia on the incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly patients
      undergoing major surgery.

    <description>Patients assigned to this group (experimental group) will receive combined epidural-general anesthesia (combined Epi-GA) and patient controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA).
An epidural catheter will be placed prior to anesthesia induction. General anesthesia will be induced and maintained in the same manner as in the control group, with the addition of continuous infusion or intermittent boluses of 0.5%-0.75% ropivacaine given through the epidural catheter for analgesia maintenance. If necessary, other types of opioids and muscle relaxants will also be allowed. Patient controlled epidural analgesia will be used for postoperative analgesia (1% ropivacaine 30ml and sufentanil 125ug diluted with normal saline to 250ml, continuous infusion 4 ml/hr, bolus 2ml and lockout interval 20 minutes).</description>

    <description>Patients assigned to this group (control group) will receive general anesthesia (GA) and patient controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA).
General anesthesia will be induced with midazolam, sufentanil, propofol and rocuronium. Anesthesia is then maintained by inhalation of oxygen-nitrous oxide mixture (1:2) and sevoflurane, or continuous intravenous infusing of propofol. Sufentanil and rocuronium will be given when needed. If necessary, other types of opioids and muscle relaxants are also allowed. Patient controlled intravenous analgesia will be used for postoperative analgesia (morphine 50mg diluted with normal saline to 100 ml, continuous infusion 1 ml/hr, bolus 2ml and lockout interval 6-10 minutes).</description>

    <description>General anesthesia will be performed in both arms. In the arm of combined Epi-GA/PCEA, an epidural catheter will be placed and a test dose of lidocaine will be administered before the induction of general anesthesia. Besides conventional general anesthesia, epidural anesthesia will be added with the use of 0.5%-0.75% ropivacaine during surgery. Patient controlled epidural analgesia will be used after surgery. In the arm of GA/PCIA, only general anesthesia will be performed during surgery and patient controlled intravenous analgesia will be used after surgery.</description>
