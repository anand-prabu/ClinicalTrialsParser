When the urine and catheter are colonized by urease-producing bacteria\n      such as Proteus mirabilis, encrustation of the catheter is likely to occur.\n\n      The use of a catheter irrigation solution that can prevent biofilm formation and\n      encrustation leading to blockage may keep the catheter patent longer, resulting in fewer\n      catheter changes, potentially lower incidence of UTIs and better  patient quality of life.\n\n      Auriclosene is a non-antibiotic, fast-acting, broad-spectrum antimicrobial, which exhibits\n      potential for the rapid decolonization of a range of urologic pathogens, including the\n      urease-producing Proteus mirabilis.\n\n      Subjects will be randomized to either Auriclosene Irrigation Solution, Auriclosene in saline\n      solution or citrate vehicle solution."
