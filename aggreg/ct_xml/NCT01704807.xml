  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose of study: To assess the effects of wearing custom orthotics as opposed to placebo
      foot inserts on the duration of chiropractic correction of spinal fixations and muscle
      imbalances using applied kinesiology techniques.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with chronic lower back pain of greater than one month duration will be
      randomized to receive custom foot orthotics or placebo flat inserts. Both groups will
      receive chiropractic treatment 5 times over the course of 4 weeks following receipt of
      orthotics. Subjects and treating doctor will be blind to the insert type.  Patients will
      report present, average, best and worst pain at each visit, and complete a Roland-Morris
      questionnaire. Secondary outcome measures will be number of fixated vertebral levels
      identified by motion palpation and challenge and number of muscles testing grade 4 and below
      from a list of 5 muscles to be tested bilaterally before and after each treatment.
