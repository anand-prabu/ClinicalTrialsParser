            "textblock": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders in women of\n      childbearing age. However, the optimal infertility treatment for PCOS patients is still a\n      matter of controversy. Despite producing more follicles and more oocytes than other women\n      undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation during an IVF cycle, women with PCOS have\n      comparable or lower pregnancy rates. Additionally women with PCOS patients undergoing IVF\n      have a higher risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), which may be\n      aggravated by pregnancy after an embryo transfer in a fresh cycle. Further women with PCOS\n      are thought to have higher rates of later pregnancy complications including spontaneous\n      abortion, pre-eclampsia, and preterm labor that may be related to impaired implantation in\n      the superovulated endometrium. We propose a randomized clinical trial of elective embryo\n      cryopreservation followed by a programmed cycle of endometrial preparation and frozen embryo\n      transfer (FET) compared to fresh embryo transfer in women with PCOS undergoing in vitro\n      fertilization (IVF)."
