    <textblock>
      Asthma is the number one cause of pediatric emergency department (ED) visits in young
      minority children and is responsible for high healthcare costs. The ED is often the point of
      contact for many inner city children and many families view the ED as the child's primary
      source of asthma care.  This study plans to test a new model of asthma care, Asthma Express
      (AEx), that includes a follow-up asthma visit in the ED for an asthma &quot;check-up&quot; , asthma
      education, a prescription for preventive asthma medications, an appointment for the child to
      see their pediatric provider and a home visit to assist families with environmental control
      methods to prevent asthma symptoms.

    <textblock>
      Asthma, the leading chronic disorder in childhood, is the number one cause of pediatric
      emergency department (ED) visits in young children and is responsible for a substantial
      impact on healthcare costs. The ED is often the point of contact for low-income children and
      many families view the ED as their primary source of asthma care.  Poor and minority
      children have the highest asthma morbidity, are the least likely to receive adequate
      preventive therapy or specialty care and more frequently exposed to environmental triggers
      than non-poor children.  However, prior studies, including our pilot, indicate that children
      with frequent asthma ED visits will attend a one-time ED-based follow-up clinic for an
      asthma &quot;check-up&quot; and education. The goal of this randomized controlled trial is to test the
      efficacy of a multifaceted, ED + primary care provider (PCP) and home-based intervention,
      Asthma Express (AEx), for children with &gt; 2 asthma ED visits or 1 hospitalization/year that
      provides tailored guideline based asthma care. Allergy and cotinine biomarkers, collected
      during the ED visit, are used to target the home environmental control component of the
      intervention. The AEx intervention (n=132) will be compared to an attention control (CON)
      group (n=132) for the specific aims: (1) to reduce asthma morbidity (increase symptom free
      days and nights) and decrease ED visits and hospitalizations and increase asthma control and
      caregiver quality of life, (2) to improve the use of appropriate preventive
      anti-inflammatory medication based on child pharmacy refill records and (3) to compare the
      economic cost and effects of this intervention. Children aged 3-12 years with &gt; 2 asthma ED
      visits or 1 hospitalization within the past 12 months and a current ED visit for asthma will
      be recruited from the Johns Hopkins Pediatric-ED and followed for 12 months.  Symptom
      frequency, health care utilization, caregiver quality of life and cotinine measures will be
      collected at baseline, 6 and 12 months and pharmacy data collected at baseline and 12
      months. Data analysis includes initial cross tabulations of health outcomes by group (AEx
      vs. CON) and multivariate generalized linear regression models to study the effects of the
      AEx treatment on mean symptom free days/nights, repeat ED visits, hospitalizations and
      caregiver quality of life scores and anti-inflammatory medication refills. Mean total costs
      of ED, PCP visits, hospital days and medication costs will be compared between groups (AEx
      and CON) for the economic analysis. The AEx model is designed to be accessible,
      guideline-based, easily replicated and incorporated into ED care. If successful, this study
      will fill critical gaps in the ED transition to preventive care asthma interventional
      research.
