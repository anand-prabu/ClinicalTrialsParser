Evaluate the efficacy of amifostine in enhancing hematopoietic recovery\n      following cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin therapy in patients with hematologic\n      malignancies and adult solid tumors.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients receive intravenous amifostine over 15\n      minutes daily 30 minutes prior to high dose chemotherapy on days 0-2. Cyclophosphamide is\n      administered over 3 hours on days 0 and 1, intravenous etoposide over 4 hours on days 0, 1,\n      and 2, and cisplatin over 4 hours on days 0, 1, and 2. All patients receive sargramostim\n      (GM-CSF) beginning on day 4. Patients receive a maximum of 2 courses of treatment (with\n      35-42 days between chemotherapy courses). Patients are followed for 1-5 months after\n      treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 12\n      months."
