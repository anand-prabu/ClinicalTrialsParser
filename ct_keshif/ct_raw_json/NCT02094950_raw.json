Twelve subjects with dyspnea will be recruited to this clinical trial. Up\n      to 10 sessions of acupuncture will be delivered over the course of 8-10 weeks. The primary\n      outcome will be dyspnea as measured by the English version of the Cancer Dyspnea Scale at\n      the completion of the intervention."
