Any other clinically significant, in the opinion of the Investigator, local skin\n                  condition (e.g., skin infection) at target treatment site that may interfere or\n                  be a safety concern.\n\n              11. Any physical or psychiatric condition that in the Investigator's opinion would\n                  prevent adequate study participation.\n\n              12. Chronic medical condition that in the Investigator's opinion would affect study\n                  participation (such as uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes, hepatitis, HIV,\n                  etc.).\n\n              13.
