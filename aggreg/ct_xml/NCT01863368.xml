  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare Systane Ultra lubricant eye drops to Optive
      lubricating eye drops for ocular surface staining within dry eye subjects and to evaluate
      the safety of Systane Ultra after 3 months of use.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following a 2-week washout phase with saline eye drops, subjects will be randomized to
      receive either Systane Ultra or Optive for the remainder of the study.

    <measure>Change from baseline in Total Ocular Surface Staining (TOSS) Score at Day 35 (Phase I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 35</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The TOSS score is a cumulative cornea and conjunctival staining score. After instilling ophthalmic dye in the eye, the investigator grades three areas of the ocular surface for dryness on a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is &quot;Absent&quot; and 5 is &quot;Severe.&quot; The three scores are summed for a resultant overall 0-15 score.</description>

    <measure>Mean Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) Score at Day 35 (Phase I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 35</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The OSDI is a 12-item, patient-reported outcome questionnaire used to measure ocular symptoms, visual function, and environmental factors that may affect a patient's vision. Each item is scored on a 0-4 Likert-type scale, where 0 is &quot;None&quot; and 4 is &quot;All of the Time.&quot; A resultant overall 0-100 score is calculated, where 0 corresponds to no disability and 100 corresponds to complete disability.</description>

    <measure>Mean Impact of Dry Eye on Everyday Life (IDEEL) treatment satisfaction score at Day 35 (Phase I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 35</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The IDEEL is 10-question patient-reported outcome questionnaire that assesses the subject's general satisfaction with treatment use. A resultant overall 0-100 treatment satisfaction score is calculated, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction and less treatment-related bother.</description>
