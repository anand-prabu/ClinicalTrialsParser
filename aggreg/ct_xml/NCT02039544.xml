    <description>Scores of TCM clinical symptom. Using statistical table score, main symptoms and secondary symptoms according to the degree is divided into light, medium, heavy, the main symptoms were recorded 2, 4, 6 points, the secondary symptoms were recorded 1, 2, 3 points. No symptomatic record 0 points. Before the study, of 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 week each recorded 1 times. Description of tongue and pulse only, not scoring.
the clinical scoring system of Toronto (TCSS). TCSS includes a score of neural symptoms, nerve reflex scores and sensory examination , a total of 19 points.Before the study, of 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 week each scoring 1 times.According to the classification standard, 0-5 points does not have DPN, 6-8 points for mild DPN,  9-11 points for moderate DPN, 12-19 points for severe DPN.</description>
