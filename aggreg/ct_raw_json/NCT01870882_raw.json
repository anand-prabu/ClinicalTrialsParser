Both cocaine and opioids will be targeted in the AR procedure the investigators\n      will test in this study. The retraining or control condition, along with a series of\n      assessments, will be delivered on the PED as part of a daily (Monday through Friday)\n      appointment at which time participants will also obtain their daily methadone dose.\n      Assessments will cover substance use, craving and other issues. In addition to completing\n      the retraining or control procedure, participants will also be engaged in standard versions\n      of attentional bias tasks (i.e., without retraining) periodically in order to gauge an\n      effect of study condition on attentional bias over time. Thus, the investigators will be\n      able to track changes in attentional bias over time in a more detailed fashion than has been\n      previously possible. Following the 3 week training period, there will be another 3 weeks of\n      treatment in which patients will continue to receive methadone and complete limited\n      assessments without any AR or control procedures with the PED."
