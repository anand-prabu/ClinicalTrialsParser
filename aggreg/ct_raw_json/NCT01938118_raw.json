            "textblock": "Mothers and Others: Family-based Obesity Prevention for Infants and Toddlers will be one of\n      the first to meet the unique needs of individual families by delivering anticipatory\n      guidance on infant care, feeding and growth through multiple channels and to multiple\n      caregivers. Primary modes of delivery for the Obesity Prevention Group (experimental arm)\n      will include face-to-face counseling through 8 home visits (1 by a certified Lactation\n      Consultant), 5 health newsletters, and approximately 160 cue-based text messages. The Injury\n      Prevention Group (active comparator) will receive messages on child safety delivered through\n      similar channels. Our main outcome is infant/toddler growth, captured by mean\n      weight-for-length z-scores (WLZ) at 18 months, mean change in WLZ between 0-18 months, and\n      likelihood of overweight (WLZ \u2265 95th percentile) at 18 months. Differences between groups\n      are expected to be achieved through uptake of targeted health behaviors, including a greater\n      likelihood of breastfeeding initiation, exclusivity and duration; after 6 months, higher\n      dietary intakes of whole fruits and vegetables and lower intakes of energy-dense snack\n      foods; age-appropriate durations of infant and toddler sleep; and, lower levels of\n      television and electronic media exposure. We further hypothesize that these targeted health\n      behaviors will be achieved through modifiable risk factors underpinning the intervention,\n      namely more positive breastfeeding attitudes; higher levels of parenting and breastfeeding\n      self-efficacy; higher levels of perceived social support; higher responsive feeding style\n      scores; improved accuracy in perceiving infant/toddler weight status; and, diminished\n      parental perceptions of infant fussiness."
