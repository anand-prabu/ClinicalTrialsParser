            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to identify genes that are responsive to paricalcitol (active\n      vitamin D) therapy.  Scientists have found that over 30 different types of cells in the body\n      respond to vitamin D therapy, including blood vessels. Low levels of vitamin D may reduce\n      the amount of calcium in the blood, increase the amount of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and\n      cause the parathyroid gland (small gland located in the neck) to get bigger which is called\n      secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). Also, low levels of vitamin D may worsen the heart\n      disease seen in dialysis patients. Paricalcitol, a man-made active vitamin D, is a\n      replacement for vitamin D for preventing and treating SHPT.  Studies that followed patients\n      on dialysis have found:  (1) differences in death rates between those who received active\n      vitamin D compared with no activated vitamin D, and (2) a survival benefit in chronic kidney\n      disease (CKD) patients receiving paricalcitol, over calcitriol (natural active vitamin D).\n      Researchers have considered that giving paricalcitol to people with (CKD) may also prevent\n      or slow the progression of heart disease.\n\n      Currently, physicians can only tell how well the vitamin D is working by measuring PTH\n      concentrations. This study aims to identify markers in the blood that can be used to\n      determine the efficacy of Vitamin D therapy."

A simple blood draw\n      will be obtained from the patient on days 0, 1, and 14 of each treatment arm, and they will\n      also be assessed for side effects at the end of each treatment.\n\n      The blood obtained during these visits will be analyzed for any changes that may have\n      occurred in the white blood cells (WBC) and/or plasma. These samples will be tested to see\n      if there are any markers in the blood that changed after treatment with vitamin D. The\n      samples collected will be temporarily stored in the research laboratory and subsequently\n      sent to a separate laboratory (Genus Systems Company) in batches for analysis."
