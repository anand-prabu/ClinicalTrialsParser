To assess the prevalence of Peripheral Obliterative Arteriopathy of the Legs (POAL) by\n      measuring the Systolic Pressure Index (SPI) at the toe (ratio of arterial pressure in upper\n      limbs versus lower limbs). Measures are made \u200b\u200bby a general practitioner in the same\n      population.\n\n      C. To assess the quality and interpretability of ultrasound recordings and ultrasound\n      acquistion failure rate. These second measures are made by an expert in vascular medecine.\n      This evaluation with use a 3-level scale:\n\n        1. appropriate image was not obtained or not recognized expert - uninterpretable\n\n        2. poor image quality - interpretable\n\n        3. image of good or very good quality - interpretable\n\n      D. To calculate the impact of risk cofactors such as hypertension , smoking, age and family\n      history among patients diagnosed with AAA.\n\n      E. Evaluation of general practitioner training from a qualitative and quantitative point of\n      view after 4 h of training organized by Dr. Bobbi\u00e0 ."
