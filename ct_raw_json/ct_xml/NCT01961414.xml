      The purpose of this research study is to determine if a &quot;Treat and Extend&quot; regimen
      (increasing the time between visits when the disease is stable and not getting worse) of
      aflibercept 2.0mg injections inside the eye for treating patients with Wet Age-related
      Macular Degeneration.

      After exiting VGFT-OD 0910, patients will be enrolled into RANGE, a longterm extension trial
      evaluating the safety and efficacy of aflibercept IAI utilizing a &quot;treat and extend&quot;
      regimen.  Using pre-specified re-treatment criteria, treatment intervals will be variable
      with dosing of the active treatment at least every 12 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous enrollment in 0910-extension study evaluating intravitreal aflibercept
             injection (NCT 00964795) without early study discontinuation prior to sponsor early
             termination.

          -  Patients are enrolled within 90 days of site activation (all attempts will be made to
             ensure IAI is given once exited from the 0910-extension and prior to enrollment).

          -  Willing and able to comply with clinical visits and study related procedures.

          -  Provide signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with verteporfin, or external-beam radiation therapy, or
             transpupillary thermotherapy in the study eye

          -  Previous subfoveal focal laser photocoagulation involving the foveal center in the
             study eye

          -  History of vitrectomy, submacular surgery, or other surgical intervention for AMD in
             the study eye

          -  Any concurrent intraocular condition in the study eye (e.g. diabetic retinopathy or
             glaucoma) that, in the opinion of the investigator, could either

               -  require medical or surgical intervention during the study period to prevent or
                  treat visual loss that might result from that condition, or

               -  if allowed to progress untreated, could likely contribute to loss of at least 2
                  Snellen equivalent lines of best corrected visual acuity over the study period

          -  Active intraocular inflammation (grade trace or above) in the study eye, or history
             of idiopathic or autoimmune-associated uveitis in either eye

          -  Current vitreous hemorrhage in the study eye

          -  History of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or macular hole (Stage 3 or 4) in the
             study eye

          -  Active infectious conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, or endophthalmitis in either
             eye

          -  Aphakia, ACIOL, or unstable PCIOL

          -  Uncontrolled glaucoma in the study eye (defined as intraocular pressure â‰¥30 mmHg
             despite treatment with anti-glaucoma medication)

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women

          -  Sexually active men* or women of childbearing potential** who are unwilling to
             practice adequate contraception during the study (adequate contraceptive measures

             [IUD]; bilateral tubal ligation; vasectomy; condom plus contraceptive sponge, foam,
             or jelly, or diaphragm plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or jelly)

               -  Contraception is not required for men with documented vasectomy.

                    -  Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months in order
