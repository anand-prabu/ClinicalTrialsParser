  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phase I trial is being conducted in patients with inoperable locally advanced NSCLC to
      treat with a combination of Conventional Fractionated Radiotherapy (CFRT) on the mediastinal
      lymph nodes and Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR)on the primary tumor with
      concurrent chemotherapy. It is hypothesized that this will lead to an increase of local
      control and overall survival

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In locally advanced NSCLC local control has been poor, but with SABR remarkable high local
      control rates with low toxicity have been reported. Currently stage III and inoperable II
      NSCLC patients have been treated with IMRT and concurrent chemotherapy at out institute. In
      this study we will explore the combination of SABR and CFRT with concurrent chemotherapy

             and national regulations

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patients with central tumors &lt; 2 cm of the proximal bronchial tree (Figure 2) or
             tumors immediately adjacent to mediastinal or pericardial pleura.

          -  Patients that receive sequential chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy only.
