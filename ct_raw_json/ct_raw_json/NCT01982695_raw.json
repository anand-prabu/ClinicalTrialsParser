Both drugs are known to be\n      effective for the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy. ACEi have been reported to delay the\n      onset and progression of left ventricle dysfunction in children with DMD. Multiple studies\n      show therapeutic efficacy of losartan in animals with cardiomyopathy related to muscular\n      dystrophy and in patients with cardiomyopathy from diverse causes. ARBs are often reserved\n      for patients in whom heart failure is not adequately treated or where side effects preclude\n      the use of an ACEi. However, in DMD, losartan might be a better choice as a first line drug\n      because of studies demonstrating a potential benefit for skeletal muscle in the mdx mouse.\n      Considering that both skeletal and cardiac muscles are major contributors of the disability\n      of DMD, a drug that could improve both heart and skeletal muscles simultaneously would need\n      consideration as the drug of choice for the cardiomyopathic DMD patient."
