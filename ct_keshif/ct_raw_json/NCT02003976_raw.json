Participants randomized to surgery will also undergo medial opening wedge HTO after\n      12 weeks of optimized non-surgical treatment. Both groups will follow the same schedule of\n      clinic visits throughout the 24 month follow-up period. MRI-derived measures of articular\n      cartilage morphology, biological markers of articular cartilage degradation and synthesis,\n      gait biomechanics and patient-reported outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 12 and 24\n      months follow-up."
