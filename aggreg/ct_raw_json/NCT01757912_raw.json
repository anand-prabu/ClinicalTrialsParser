            "textblock": "The endotracheal tube secures free airway in patients undergoing surgical procedures or\n      mechanical ventilation. The extraluminal airway needs to be sealed by a cuff. The cuff needs\n      to be adequately inflated with air. The cuff pressure should be between 20 and 30 cm H2O. A\n      cuff pressure in excess of the target range is associated with a risk of tracheal injury,\n      whereas a cuff pressure below the lower limit includes a risk of micro-aspiration of\n      subglottic secretions, with risk of subsequent ventilator-associated pneumonia. It is\n      unknown whether the cuff pressure changes following changes in body position of the patient.\n      The objective of this study is to investigate to which extent - if any - cuff pressures\n      change after body position changes of the patient."
