  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of an in-person peer mentoring and health
      literacy intervention on improving medication adherence, HIV-1 viral load, CD4+ T lymphocyte
      counts, and HIV medical appointment attendance among newly-diagnosed and/or medication
      non-adherent HIV-positive individuals, compared to standard of care provider/staff-delivered
      education.

    <description>Between baseline and 4-month follow-up, experiment group patients will be receiving (a) Weekly contacts with their Peer Mentor, with the option of receiving more frequent contact, if needed; and (b) 4 monthly, 1-hour workshops on HIV/AIDS, medication adherence, health literacy, and health and wellness. In addition, experiment group participants will also be provided with all standard practice services given to control group participants, including: (c) Two more or HIV basics education and medication adherence counseling sessions with their HIV specialty care provider and Patient Navigator; (d) resource referrals from a Patient Navigator based on the participant's needs; and (e) automated medical appointment reminders via phone.</description>

    <description>Participants in the Peer Mentoring arm will be paired with a Peer Mentor for the duration of the 4-month intervention. Peer Mentors are HIV-positive patients who demonstrate high levels of medication and treatment adherence and are knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS and barriers to care. During the 4-month intervention, Peer Mentors will contact participants weekly via in-person, phone, or email, with the option to provide more frequent contact, if needed. Peer Mentors will provide social support and remind participants to take their medications and attend upcoming medical appointments.
Study participants will also attend four monthly, one hour workshops on HIV/AIDS, medication adherence, health literacy, and health and wellness, which will be developed and co-facilitated by Peer Mentors.</description>
