    <textblock>
      ESD (Endoscopic Sub-mucosal Dissection)is the first-intent method to treat superficial
      neoplasms of the digestive tract at it allows an en-bloc R0 resection. Following marking of
      the lesion margins, ESD comprises 3 steps: 1) liquid injection into the sub-mucosal space 2)
      circumferential (complete or partial) incision and 3) dissection of the submucosa. Several
      tools are necessary to perform ESD with the standard technique. Development of water jet
      with bi functional (injection and cutting) catheter allows time and significant reduction of
      perforation risk (due to multiple changes of instruments). For this purpose, Nestis
      introduced the Enki 2 pulsed jet technology with high pressure system to inject efficiently
      and at any time viscous solutions in direct viewing and retroflexion. Preliminary pig
      studies indicate that injection of glycerol, hyaluronate and hydroxyethlstarch with Enki 2
      are possible. In addition, preclinical studies on living pig colon models using saline
      solutions have demonstrated that perforation rates and operating times are significantly
      reduced compared to a standard electrosurgical knife.  The present clinical study is being
      performed to confirm this system capability to perform ESD in humans.
