            "textblock": "Organophosphate pesticide poisoning causes close to 300 000 deaths per year worldwide. Many\n      patients who ingest organophosphates require ventilation; of these patients approximately\n      50% die. Much of the mortality in these ventilated patients is secondary to intermediate\n      syndrome. This is because OP pesticides inhibit acetylcholinesterase, causing an excess of\n      acetylcholine at nerve synapses and the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). At the NMJ, the excess\n      acetylcholine causes overstimulation and damage, which may lead to sudden respiratory arrest\n      or prolonged ventilation and its associated complications.\n\n      The investigators believe that blocking these receptors using a neuromuscular blocking agent\n      such as Rocuronium will protect the NMJ from damage and thus prevent intermediate syndrome\n      and reduce number of intubated days and mortality.\n\n      In this pilot randomised controlled trial Rocuronium, a competitive nicotinic receptor\n      antagonist, will be used to bind to the receptor at the neuromuscular junction and to block\n      the effects of the accumulated acetylcholine. The effects of OP pesticide on cholinesterase\n      in the blood will then be monitored and Rocuronium withdrawn using Sugammadex as the OP is\n      eliminated from the body."
