      This research is to establish a simple and practical system to predict the prognosis of
      sever hepatitis B.Seven factors (level of serum total bilirubin, prothrombin time, severity
      of hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome,ascites ,infection and  size of liver) which
      were easier to evaluate and more influential， were included to establish a prognosis scoring
      system．The scorings of a new score system and MELD were graded at the same time in the
      patients with sever hepatitis B. And then the distribution figures of survival rates and
      mortality rates were done according to the scores from low to high. The features of
      distribution figures of two score system in survival rates and mortality rates and
      significances of clinical application in certain score were interpreted.
