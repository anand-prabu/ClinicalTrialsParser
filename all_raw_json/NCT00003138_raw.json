Patients are\n      stratified according to morphologic subtype (refractory anemia [RA] vs RA with ringed\n      sideroblasts vs RA with excess blasts), transfusion requirement (yes vs no), prior\n      erythropoietin treatment (yes vs no), and erythropoietin level (at least 200 mU/mL vs less\n      than 200 mU/mL). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I (standard transfusion support): Patients receive red cell and platelet\n           transfusions for symptoms or to maintain hematocrit level of 25% or above. Patients\n           undergo bone marrow aspirate and biopsy at 4 months and then every year until\n           development of acute leukemia or completion of study. Patients with progressive disease\n           may cross over to arm II after at least 4 months on study and up to 1 year from the\n           time of randomization. Patients who cross over receive erythropoietin alone.\n\n        -  Arm II (Erythropoietin): Patients receive erythropoietin subcutaneously (SC) or\n           intravenously (IV) daily. Patients undergo bone marrow aspirate and biopsy as in arm I.\n           Treatment continues daily for a maximum of 1 year.\n\n      Patients with stable or progressive disease at day 120 receive filgrastim (G-CSF) SC daily\n      or 3 days a week and erythropoietin SC daily for up to 6 months. Patients with no response\n      to G-CSF and lower-dose erythropoietin may proceed to a higher dose of erythropoietin.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 4 months during study, and at study\n      completion.\n\n      Patients are followed every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually for 5 years.\n\n      ACTUAL ACCRUAL: A total of 118 patients were accrued for this study."
