The status of IMLNs also provides\n      important prognostic information for breast cancer patients. The technical evolvements of\n      sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and lymphoscintigraphy provided a less invasive method for\n      assessing IMLNs than surgical dissection. Recently, many study concerning IMSLNB was\n      performed in the patients with clinically negative axillary nodes. However, previous\n      published studies concerning patients with breast cancer who all underwent a radical\n      mastectomy have shown that IMLN metastases are mostly found concomitantly with  axillary\n      metastases. For this reason, IM-SLNB is even more important for clinically axillary\n      node-negative  patients. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt of the IM-SLNB in early\n      breast cancer patients with clinically positive axillary nodes."
