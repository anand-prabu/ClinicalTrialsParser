There are currently no approved therapies for\n      frailty.  Ghrelin is a hormone produced by the stomach that stimulates appetite centers in\n      the brain. The investigators already know that a single dose of Ghrelin improves food intake\n      immediately after the dose in frail older people. In addition, exercise programs have been\n      shown to improve strength and function in older people. In this study, the investigators are\n      trying to find out if a joint intervention of ghrelin and resistance training will improve\n      walking, balance and leg strength in frail elderly people."
