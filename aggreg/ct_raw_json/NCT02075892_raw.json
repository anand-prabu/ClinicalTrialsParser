A randomly selected subset\n      of 8 participants will continue to phase II, and return to the lab for an additional 3\n      visits to evaluate feasibility. Visit 1 will consist of a physical, enrollment and\n      consenting. Visits, 2, 3, and 4 will be separated by a minimum of 24 hours. During visit 2,\n      participants will perform a maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) test on a cycle ergometer.\n      During visit 3 participants will be asked to complete a 6-minute oxygen kinetics test on a\n      cycle ergometer; lactate threshold and oxygen saturation will be measured at baseline,\n      minutes 2, 3 and 6 during the 6 min ride. During visit 4, participants will perform a\n      3-minute critical power (CP) test and will provide a saliva sample, to be measured for\n      cortisol levels, immediately prior to and after the CP test. Following visit 4, participants\n      will be randomly assigned, in a double-blind fashion, to either a placebo or mushroom blend\n      treatment group. Participants in the placebo and treatment groups will be asked to consume 2\n      servings, 3 times daily for 7 days. Following supplementation, participants will return to\n      the laboratory for visits 5-7, each of which will be separated by a minimum of 24 hours. The\n      same protocol performed during visits 2-4 will be repeated in the same order for visits 5-7;\n      the VO 2max test, the 6 min oxygen kinetics test, and the CP test with a pre and post saliva\n      sample. The randomly selected subset of 8 participants will continue into phase II (n=4 for\n      treatment; n=4 for placebo). During phase II, the 8 participants in the placebo and\n      treatment groups will be asked to consume 2 servings, 3 times daily for 14 additional days\n      to determine feasibility of a longer supplementation phase. Following supplementation, the\n      same protocol performed during visits 2-4 will be repeated in the same order for visits\n      8-10, each of which will be separated by a minimum of 24 hours."
