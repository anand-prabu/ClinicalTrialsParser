Combining more than one drug and giving drugs in different ways\n      may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known if surgery is more effective with or without\n      chemotherapy for colon cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of fluorouracil plus\n      leucovorin with that of no further therapy in treating patients who have stage II or stage\n      III colon cancer that can be surgically removed."

Compare survival, disease free survival, and locoregional and distant\n      metastases recurrence rates of patients with stage IIC or stage III colon cancer treated\n      with curative colon resection with or without perioperative fluorouracil, followed by\n      fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium. II. Compare survival and disease free survival in\n      patients with stage IIB colon cancer treated with curative colon resection with or without\n      perioperative fluorouracil.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients undergo curative colon resection via\n      laparotomy. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. Arm I: Within 24 hours of the colon\n      resection, patients receive perioperative fluorouracil IV over 24 hours for 7 days. Arm II:\n      Patients receive no perioperative fluorouracil. After surgery, patients with stage I, stage\n      IIA, or stage IV colon cancer are immediately removed from study. Patients with stage IIB,\n      IIC, or III colon cancer are reregistered within 35 days postoperatively. Beginning 21-35\n      days after surgery, patients with stage IIC or III disease receive leucovorin calcium IV\n      bolus immediately followed by fluorouracil IV bolus on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28\n      days for a total of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients with stage IIB disease do not receive adjuvant fluorouracil and\n      leucovorin calcium. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months\n      for 2 years, and then annually.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 800-2,000 patients (at least 400 per treatment arm) will be\n      accrued for this study over 2-3 years."
