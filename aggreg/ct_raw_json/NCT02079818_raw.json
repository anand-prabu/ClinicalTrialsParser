This coil system is specifically designed for the occlusion of aneurysms and vessels that is equivalent to standard platinum coils.  This system consists of: an implantable Coil attached to a Detachment Pusher as well as a Detachment Handle. The Detachment Pusher is comprised of a shaft with a radiopaque positioning marker, a Distal Detachment Tip, and a pull wire. The Detachment Handle is used to detach the Coil Implant from the Detachment Pusher. The Penumbra Ruby Coil is designed for endovascular embolization in the peripheral vasculature. Intended users for this device are physicians who have received appropriate training in interventional radiology and endovascular intervention.",
