  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, unblinded trial without placebo control to evaluate the acute
      effects of caloric vestibular stimulation on UPDRS motor scores in Parkinson's Disease
      patients.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Motor UPDRS score (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes in motor score at 25, 50, 75, 100, 130, 160 and 220 minutes relative to baseline</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>A motor score prior to use of the device will be established (time zero), the motor test will be repeated after the first use of the device (times 25, 50, and 75 minutes), and then after a second use of the device (times 100, 130, 160 and 220).  Any changes in motor scores at the various time points will be noted.  A videotape of the motor UPDRS examination will be obtained at baseline and during the final test.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EKG to record beat-to-beat (R-R) interval data</measure>
    <time_frame>On a separate day, for a total of 40 minutes</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Patient will have EKG recorded in order to calculate beat-to-beat (R-R) interval data as follows: 1) for 10 minutes prior to using the device, 2) during device use (~19 minutes) and 3) for 10 minutes following device use.</description>

    <description>ThermoNeuroModulation (TNM) device with a standardized active neuromodulation waveform will be used for all patients. The device will be used twice for ~19 minutes each time.  There will be a gap of roughly 1 hour between the two device applications.</description>
