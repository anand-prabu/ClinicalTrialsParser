Rehabilitation progress highly depends on training intensity and\n      training duration, favouring the use of RAT.\n\n      In this pilot study, the clinical effects of using a new upper arm RAT device for upper arm\n      rehabilitation in patients with stroke is investigated. Myo-electrical signals will serve as\n      input for the device, assisting the user in flexion and extension of the elbow. The device\n      is coupled to a virtual environments, creating a stimulating therapy environment."
