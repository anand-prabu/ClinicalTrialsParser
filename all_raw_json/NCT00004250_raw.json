Infusing chemotherapy to the tumor area only may kill more\n      tumor cells and cause less damage to healthy tissues.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying isolated limb infusion of chemotherapy to see how\n      well it works in treating patients with melanoma or soft tissue sarcoma of the arm or leg\n      that cannot be removed by surgery."

After the limb is warmed, melphalan and\n      dactinomycin are rapidly infused into the isolated limb via the arterial catheter. Melphalan\n      and dactinomycin are then recirculated for 20 minutes. Patients with little or no response\n      at 8 weeks may receive up to 2 additional treatments at the discretion of the treating\n      physician.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1-2 weeks, 3-4 weeks, 6-8 weeks, and then every 3-6 months\n      thereafter as deemed necessary by the treating physician.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
