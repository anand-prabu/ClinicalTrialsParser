In current clinical practice, cost is a factor in considering\n      procedures and adjunct products. AlloDerm RTU and SurgiMend PRS are dissimilar in cost, with\n      AlloDerm RTU more costly by 30-50%, and it is unclear if they are similar in efficacy.\n\n      This study will be a prospective, randomized-to-test article (ADM), controlled,\n      blinded-to-aesthetic/biopsy specimen evaluator trial. It will provide a way to assess the\n      relative performance and complication rates between the AlloDerm RTU and SurgiMend PRS\n      product as well as the relative economics of these two treatment options. Study subjects\n      will only be randomized to one of two surgical mesh products. Patient information including\n      age, BMI, smoking history, tumor size and location, preoperative bra cup size, mastectomy\n      specimen weight, mastectomy method, plastic surgeon, mastectomy surgeon, quality of skin,\n      tissue expander type and maximal volume, intra-operative fill volume, gel/saline implant\n      type and size, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy will be summarized."
