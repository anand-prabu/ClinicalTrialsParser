  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves research. Drugs can permanently reduce hearing are termed &quot;ototoxic&quot;.
      One such drug is the chemotherapy called cisplatin. Currently, if a patient is receiving
      cisplatin, hearing is tested and monitored only when it is requested by their physician.
      Researchers think that hearing testing prior to each treatment with cisplatin may reduce the
      number of Veterans who get disabling hearing loss from treatment. The purpose of this study
      is to compare the current method of monitoring hearing (only when requested by the
      physician) with a new hearing monitoring program that tests hearing prior to each cisplatin
      treatment.

      Approximately, 320 Veterans receiving cisplatin chemotherapy and an additional 120 healthy
      subjects not administered chemotherapy will be enrolled at the Portland VA Medical Center.
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to one monitoring method. Answers to questionaires will
      be obtained and phone calls will be made at pre-arranged intervals All will be followed for
      1 year. Healthy subjects will be tested at 5 specified timess only.

      The proposed study tests this new approach for guideline-concordant ototoxicity monitoring
      implemented as a portable, comprehensive program of evidence-based protocols for VA
      healthcare (Comp-VA program). Research objectives are:  to compare the effectiveness of
      ototoxicity monitoring implemented using Comp-VA and standard of care testing (SOC) with
      regard to (1) improving Veterans' hearing and quality of life outcomes and use of
      audiological rehabilitation services and (2) assisting Oncologists in chemotherapeutic
      planning and counseling. In order to achieve these objectives, we propose a randomized trial
      conducted at the Portland VA Medical Center.  We plan to recruit a total of 320 Veterans
      undergoing cisplatin chemotherapeutic treatment over 4 years and 120 control subjects.

      Program Evaluation: Hearing testing prior to treatment will be done by an NCRAR research
      audiologist not associated with the intervention groups in order to establish eligibility,
      enroll and randomize each subject into one of two study arms. At 5 weeks and at one year
      post-randomization hearing will be re-tested in order to obtain an estimate of longitudinal
      trends in hearing and quality of life assessment. Use of audiological services following
      treatment from the randomized subjects will be tracked. Finally, data will also be collected
      at each treatment interval to track use of counseling tools and oncology personnel treatment
      decisions.

      Proposed Intervention Groups: Serial measurements from subjects receiving cisplatin prior to
      treatment who are randomized to the Comp-VA group will be obtained at each treatment
      interval and at one-month post-treatment. Auditory testing will be done on the Chemo Unit
      and will include otoscopy, immittance testing, automated air conduction hearing testing, and
      distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). The SOC group will receive the current
      standard of care:  full audiometric evaluations (otoscopy, immittance testing, air
      conduction and bone conduction hearing testing, speech audiometry, and DPOAEs) in a
      sound-treated booth before chemotherapy with any further testing done by oncology request.
      Additional data will also be collected from control subjects who are similar in age and are
      tested at intervals similar to the chemotherapy subjects.

    <description>Oncologists will employ COMP-VA tools for pretreatment counseling and when considering dose modifications during treatment. i) COMP-VA counseling tools that identify patient-specific factors including expected dose at which significant hearing loss occurs will be more precise than the often-cited level of 400 mg/m2.  ii) COMP-VA patients will be more likely to have ototoxic events endorsed as motivation for drug treatment modification compared with patients randomized to SOC.</description>

    <description>Use of COMP-VA will improve patientsï¿½ hearing and quality of life outcomes without diminishing chances for survival. i) Relapse-free survival rates at 1-3 years post-treatment will be the same for patients randomized to COMP-VA and SOC, indicating that COMP-VA does not interfere with successful cancer treatment and recovery. ii) Hearing loss progression following an initial cisplatin-induced shift will be less among patients randomized to COMP-VA compared with patients randomized to SOC. iii) Patients randomized to COMP-VA will rate their health-related quality of life after treatment higher than patients randomized to SOC.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All Veterans entering cisplatin chemotherapy will be informed of the project and
             invited to participate unless the Veteran was excluded by CPRS review or medical
             advice.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be prescribed cisplatin for treatment of cancer to be enrolled in the
             treatment arms of this study. Criteria for excluding subjects (chemotherapy and
             controls subjects) from this study will be:

               -  cognitively or physically unable to participate (patient or nurse report patient
                  is incapable of participating), CPRS indication that subject exhibits aggressive
                  behavior, subject has documented dementia, Alzheimer's disease, or severe
                  psychosocial disorder, CPRS notes indicate individual is not legally capable of
                  providing informed consent (subject has a legal guardian)

               -  unable to provide reliable behavioral hearing test responses (for either program
                  evaluation hearing test or baseline, pre -treatment hearing test) as indicated
                  by intra-session behavioral threshold reliability criterion of &gt; +5 dB)

               -  exhibits Meniere's disease or retrocochlear disorder based on hearing test
                  results, patient report or notes in CPRS

               -  exhibits active or recent history of middle ear disorder based on otoscopy,
                  tympanometry, patient report, or notes in CPRS

               -  unwilling to participate

               -  hearing thresholds &gt; 70 dB SPL at 4 kHz and below (based on DPOAE 'no response'
                  data from a similar protocol described in Bibliography Reference 32, Table 3).
                  The last exclusion was adopted in an effort to increase the potential that
                  DPOAEs will be measurable in a large number of subjects.
