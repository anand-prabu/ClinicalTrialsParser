      Women and Reserve/National (RNG) Veterans are among the fastest growing groups of new VA
      users. While PTSD is prevalent in this group, most women don't access or complete needed
      treatment. This study will investigate OEF/OIF/OND RNG female war Veterans' perceptions,
      preferences, barriers and facilitators to accessing VA mental health (MH) and evidence-based
      PTSD psychotherapy. This information will be used to revise an existing web-based screen
      that educates participants about their unique post-deployment MH conditions. This
      web-interface will then be used to randomly assign women who screen positive for PTSD to
      either 1) a concierge nurse case manager who uses shared decision-making to engage Veterans
      in EBP or 2) usual outreach to determine what engagement approach women prefer. Our findings
      will provide VA leaders with key information to understand and improve access to RNG PTSD
      treatment

    <textblock>
      Women and OEF/OIF/OND Reserve/National Guard (RNG) war Veterans are among the fastest
      growing groups of new VA users. Although PTSD is highly prevalent in this group of Veterans,
      most choose not to seek care for a variety of reasons. Facilitating access to mental health
      (MH) services for RNG OEF/OIF/OND female Veterans with PTSD is challenging and requires new
      approaches to outreach. Such approaches are urgently needed to mediate the severity of
      post-deployment MH conditions, alleviate concerns over MH diagnoses, and interrupt the cycle
      of chronicity found in many with PTSD. This gap between need for and use of VA PTSD services
      suggests that further research is needed to understand specific barriers to VA MH care and
      VA PTSD evidence-based psychotherapy (EBP). A web-based interface tailored to consumer needs
      has the potential to promote active engagement by Veterans in their health care. Considering
      that OEF/OIF combat Veterans enrolled in VA care report a preference to seek readjustment
      services or information over the internet, such an approach may have important advantages
      for engaging this group. Furthermore, evidence indicates that when patients are educated
      about their physical health conditions and treatment alternatives, shared decision-making
      results in increased treatment participation, better adherence to treatment recommendations,
      and better health outcomes. Although highly promising, web-based and shared-decision making
      approaches to facilitating VA MH treatment utilization are in need of further study.

      In Phase 1 of the project, we will use qualitative methods to assess VA enrolled PTSD
      positive OEF/OIF/OND RNG female war Veterans' perceptions, preferences and barriers and
      facilitators to accessing VA MH services and EBP for PTSD. This information will be used to
      refine our existing web-based interface to better address these issues. Satisfaction with
      the revised interface will then be assessed. Phase 2 will focus on comparing the efficacy of
      two approaches to promoting VHA initiation. Participants who screen positive for PTSD on the
      web interface will be randomly assigned to: 1) Study concierge nurse case manager (NCM)
      facilitated shared decision making to assist with VA MH evaluation and treatment; or 2)
      existing outreach (current standard of care). Follow-up assessments will be conducted at 6
      and 12 months to determine whether and where participants sought MH care (from both VA and
      non-VA resources).

      This study will provide valuable insights about this population's perceptions of VA MH
      services and of PTSD EBP, as well as their evolving use of VA and other community resources
      to address PTSD and other post-deployment MH needs. Furthermore, it will provide important
      information regarding the efficacy of relatively inexpensive and resource-sparing
      interventions that can be readily implemented within existing and emerging (e.g., Patient
      Alight Care Teams [PACT]) models of VA care delivery. While the proposed web interface and
      shared decision-making intervention are currently directed at RNG women Veterans
      post-deployment, there are clear implications for expansion to other populations and
      health/MH concerns, as well. Findings have important policy implications for several
      operational partners heavily invested in the improved access and delivery of evidence-based
      mental health care for Veterans with PTSD
