        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Unwilling or unable to give informed consent.

          -  2. As a result of the medical screening process, the study physician considers the

             equivalent per day).

          -  4. Subjects who smoke more than 10 cigarettes a day.

          -  7. For subjects with renal impairment: No clinically significant change in disease
             status within at least 1 month prior to study entry, as determined by the
             investigator.

          -  8. The subject had donated a unit of blood (450 mL) within the 3 months before
             dosing, or intends to donate in the month after the last scheduled visit.

          -  9. Participation in another clinical study with an investigational drug or device
             within the last month.

          -  14. The subject has tested positive for drugs of abuse at screening.

          -  15. Subjects who have received any prescribed systemic or topical medication within 4
             weeks prior to dosing (excluded are those drugs the renally impaired subject is
             currently taking for treatment of the renal or concomitant disease).

          -  16. Immunocompromised patients (patients after solid organ or bone marrow transplant;
             patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment).

          -  17. Subjects with known or suspected Pseudomonas infection or colonization (e.g.
             patients with cystic fibrosis).
