  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a brief psychosocial intervention together
      with early palliative care are feasible, acceptable and effective in the reduction of
      depressive symptoms of patients with advanced cancers starting first line palliative
      chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced cancer report physical, emotional, social and existential problems
      that may be due to the cancer itself or its treatment. Previous studies have demonstrated
      the benefit of early inclusion of palliative care (PC) in combination with standard
      oncologic care in reducing depressive symptoms, improving quality of life, increasing
      survival and also decreasing unnecessary invasive procedures. However, patients continue to
      arrive late at PC, even in large comprehensive cancer centers. One of the barriers is the
      stigma of PC perceived by patients and health professionals as &quot;a place to die.&quot; The
      primaries objectives are to evaluate the feasibility and satisfaction of patients with
      advanced cancer submitted to a brief psychosocial intervention based on Cognitive Behavioral
      Therapy (CBT) in addition to early PC and to evaluate the impact of these interventions on
      the reduction of depressive symptoms. A randomized, open-label, phase II trial, with two
      intervention arms and a control group. It will be included 150 patients with advanced cancer
      initiating palliative chemotherapy who meet the selection criteria. Participants will be
      recruited from the outpatient oncology clinics from the Barretos Cancer Hospital and will be
      randomized in one of the three treatment arms: arm A, five weekly sessions of brief
      psychosocial interventions based on CBT in combination with early PC; arm B, early PC only;
      arm C, standard oncologic care. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Patient
      Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Brazilian version of the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System
      (ESAS-br), European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life
      Questionnaire Core 15 PAL (EORTC QLQ-C15-Pal), 13-item measure of patient satisfaction
      (FAMCARE-P13), and the Disease Understanding Protocol, will be the instruments used for data
      collection. Patients will answer these instruments at baseline and after 45, 90, 120, and
      180 days after randomization. An interim analysis is planned to occur after the inclusion of
      20 participants with complete data in each arm; if the Cohen's effect size between the arms
      A and B is small (d&lt;&lt;0.2), the study will continue only with arms B and C.
