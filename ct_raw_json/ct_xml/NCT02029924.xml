  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The addition of Biochaperone to insulin lispro may accelerate the onset and shorten the
      duration of action of insulin lispro due to a facilitation of the absorption of the insulin
      after subcutaneous injection.

      The aim of the trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of BioChaperone insulin lispro in
      subjects with Type 1 diabetes under a dose of 0.2 U/Kg.

      This trial is a single-center, randomised, double-blinded, two-treatment, two-period
      cross-over, 6-hour euglycaemic glucose clamp trial in subjects with Type 1 diabetes
      mellitus. Each subject will be randomly allocated to a single dose of BioChaperone insulin
      lispro 0.2 U/Kg and a single dose of Humalog® 0.2 U/Kg on 2 separate dosing visits.
