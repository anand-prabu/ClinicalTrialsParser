The objective of\n      this matched cohort study (Phase 1B)are to investigate whether the filters and stoves\n      delivered in October 2012 are still performing and in use, to determine whether they are\n      associated with reductions in exposure to pathogens from drinking water and stoves, and to\n      assembly information on health and other conditions necessary for the design of a large\n      scale health impact evaluation."
