      Background:

      - Previous research has shown that dopamine, a brain chemical, is involved in decision
      making. Different genes influence how much dopamine people have in their brains and how that
      affects their behavior. Researchers will study if genes associated with dopamine affect
      decision making and impulsiveness. All participants will take tests; some will have brain
      images taken. Researchers will study the test responses and images; they will look for how
      differences in these genes affect different types of decision making.

      Objectives:

      - To see if genes involved in a brain chemical, dopamine, are related to impulsiveness on
      behavioral tests.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy adults ages 18 to 50.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam.

        -  All participants in this study will have at least 1 outpatient visit to the NIH
           Clinical Center. Each visit will last 2   4 hours. At the first visit:

        -  A blood sample will be taken only from participants that have not been previously
           enrolled in 95-M-0150

        -  Participants will be given tests of their memory, attention, concentration, and
           thinking.

        -  Some participants will have a second visit. It will be scheduled as soon as possible
           after the first. At the second visit:

        -  Participants will have an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). They will have to lie in a
           scanner for up to 2 hours. The MRI uses magnets, radio waves, and computers to produce
           detailed pictures of the brain.

        -  Participants will repeat the tests from the first visit. Some will be done during the
           MRI.

      The objective of this study is to examine the effects of genetic variability in the dopamine
      signaling pathway on metric measures of impulsivity. Our hypothesis is that increased
      dopamine levels or conversion of dopamine to intracellular signals, brought about by
      specific variants of genes in this pathway, will increase impulsivity in our behavioral
      tasks.  We will examine variability by recruiting up to 400 ethnically and racially diverse
      healthy adult male and female volunteers aged 18 to 50.  We will carry out genotyping,
      behavioral testing and functional magnetic resonance imaging on this group.  We will
      initially recruit a large pool of subjects for behavioral testing and genotyping.
      Behavioral tests will include various laboratory tasks related to impulsivity.  We have
      recently developed a series of tasks that we have used in a group of Parkinson   s patients
      with impulsive/compulsive behaviors (PD+ICBs). Several tasks have shown large group effects
      between Parkinson   s patients with and without ICBs (PD +/- ICBs).  We will focus on those
      tasks in the present study.  Specific examples include information sampling tasks and
      measures of novelty preference.  If genetic effects on behavior in the large sample are
      found, we will ask a subset of the original sample to return for fMRI testing.  The subset
      will be selected to allow us to examine the neural circuits that operate differently as a
      function of genotype.  In other words, they will be selected on the basis of their genotype.
       The outcome measure in this case will be differences in brain activity as a function of
      genotype, during performance of our behavioral task.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects will be eligible for this study if they:

          -  are between 18 and 50 years of age

          -  are in good physical health

          -  speak English well enough to understand task instructions clearly

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects will not be eligible for this study if they:

          -  have a major medical (e.g. heart disease), neurological (e.g. stroke) or psychiatric
             (e.g. bipolar disorder) illness

          -  have a vision and/or hearing problem that interferes with testing

          -  currently use any psychotropic medication, antidepressants, steroids or opiates

          -  currently use alcohol in excess of 14 drinks/week for males or 7 drinks/week for
             females.

          -  have a lifetime history of or currently have alcohol or substance use or dependence
             (excluding nicotine) that requires independent, concurrent treatment intervention
             (such as, antabuse or opiate treatment).  This does not include self-help group
             treatment/intervention.

          -  cannot understand the consent and procedures or cannot consent themselves to the
             study

          -  Smoke more than a half pack of cigarettes a day

        In addition to the above, additional exclusion criteria apply for all MRI studies:

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or have a positive pregnancy test 24 hours prior to
             an experiment will be excluded from neuroimaging studies.

          -  All subjects will be questioned prior to MRI scanning for possible occupational
             exposure to metal  slivers  or  shavings,  which  may  have  become  accidentally
             lodged in the tissues of the head or neck. Subjects with surgical clips or shrapnel
             in or near the brain or blood vessels, subjects with cochlear implants, subjects with
             any metallic body in the eye or CNS, and subjects with any form of implant wire or
             metal  device  which  may  concentrate  radiofrequency  fields  will  be excluded
             from MRI scanning experiments because of possible risks during MRI scanning.  Those
             whose history is suggestive of such a problem will also be excluded from the MRI
             portion of the experiments.  They may still participate in the behavioral
             experiments.

          -  Subjects unable to lie flat on their back for up to 2 hours or who are uncomfortable
             in small close spaces (have claustrophobia) will not be eligible to participate in
             MRI scans.
