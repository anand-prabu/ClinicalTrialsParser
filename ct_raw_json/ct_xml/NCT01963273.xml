  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators supposed that the complete video assisted ablation of pilonidal sinus
      (VAAPS) could be an effective minimally invasive treatment of pilonidal sinus. This new
      minimally invasive treatment allows the identification of the sinus cavity with its lateral
      tracks, the destruction and the removal of all infected tissue and the removing of any hair.

    <description>Recurrence can be divided into two groups: early and late. Early recurrence is usually due to failure to identify one or more sinuses. Late recurrence is usually due to secondary infection caused by residual hair or debris that was not removed at operation, inadequate wound care or insufficient attention to depilation</description>
