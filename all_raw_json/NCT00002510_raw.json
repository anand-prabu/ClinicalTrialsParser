Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer\n      cells. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow doctors to give higher doses of\n      chemotherapy and radiation therapy and kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of etoposide plus radiation therapy\n      followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have non-Hodgkin's\n      lymphoma."

II. Determine the toxicity\n      of this regimen. III. Evaluate the short-term and long-term engraftment characteristics of\n      patients treated on this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients who respond on Regimen A and who have no bulk disease greater than 5 cm\n      are treated on Regimen B. Regimen A: Single-Agent Chemotherapy/Stem Cell Mobilization with\n      Urothelial Protection and Growth Factor Therapy. Cyclophosphamide, CTX, NSC-26271; with\n      Mesna, NSC-113891; and Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (Amgen), G-CSF, NSC-614629.\n      Regimen B: Sequential Radiotherapy, Single-Agent Chemotherapy, and Stem Cell Rescue.\n      Total-body irradiation, TBI (equipment not specified); Etoposide, VP-16, NSC-141540; and\n      Peripheral Blood Stem Cells, PBSC.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 20 patients will be studied."
