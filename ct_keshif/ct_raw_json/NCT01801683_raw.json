In spite of having access to EBM databases in every GP's\n      office in Croatia, searching and finding answers in consultation with a patient\"on the spot\"\n      in real time is missing from practice.\n\n      OBJECTIVES: To determine GP's knowledge and attitudes about EBM before and after applying\n      \"EBM intervention.\" We assume that GP's knowledge and attitudes about EBM will change as a\n      result of \"EBM intervention\" applied by students."

Data will be collected by telephone interviewing\n      before the intervention and six months after its completion.\n\n      STUDY SETTING : The sixth year medical students within Family Medicine course at Medial\n      School in Split have rotations at their mentors' offices (a total of 18 practices, two\n      students in 4 cycles, village and city, coast, islands and hinterland). Before arrival of\n      the students, mentors will respond to the questionnaire for physicians prepared for research\n      purposes, and answer the same questionnaire six months after the \"EBM intervention.\" The\n      same study will be conducted at the Departments of Family Medicine at Medical Schools in\n      Croatia: in Rijeka,Osijek and Zagreb.\n\n      SUBJECTS: Eighteen mentors /bearers of instructional practices in family medicine constitute\n      the intervention group and the same number of physicians similar in all features to those\n      from the intervention group except that they are not mentors/bearers of instructional\n      practices constitute the control group. The intervention group will be subjected to\n      students' \"EBM intervention\", and the control will not.\n\n      INTERVENTION: The sixth year medical students have practice at their mentors' offices\n      within Family Medicine course. Each mentor chooses two patients / cases from real life,\n      appearing to be diagnostic, therapeutic or prognostic problems in the outpatient work. A\n      student's task is to make a question according to Patient Intervention Comparison Outcome\n      (PICO) scheme, find the best evidence / answer to that question and write a brief report in\n      accordance withPractical Evidence about Real Life Situations PEARL. The report is then\n      brought to the mentor for review and discussion. So, it is a students' \"EBM intervention\",\n      which will (?) affect the knowledge, attitudes and practice (work style) of a family\n      physician.\n\n      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-evaluation of knowledge and attitudes after the intervention,\n      which would be a surrogate outcome measure for GP's change in behaviour and work style\n      (adoption of EBM practice)."
