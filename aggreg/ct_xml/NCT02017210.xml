      STUDY PART 1 People who are overweight and/or obese usually are insulin resistant and so are
      at risk of type 2 diabetes.  However, research has shown that some overweight and/or obese
      people remain insulin sensitive and healthy despite their weight.

      The investigators hypothesise that insulin-sensitive overweight and/or obese people maintain
      their insulin sensitivity and metabolic health over time.  The investigators also
      hypothesise that the preservation of insulin sensitivity will be determined by key metabolic
      factors.

      STUDY PART 2 The cause of insulin resistance is potentially related to special fats
      (sphingolipids) within the skeletal muscle.  Insulin resistance usually improves after
      weight loss but it is not yet known how these sphingolipids behave.

      The investigators hypothesise that improvement in insulin sensitivity with calorie
      restriction and weight loss will be coupled with decreases in specific skeletal muscle
      sphingolipids.
