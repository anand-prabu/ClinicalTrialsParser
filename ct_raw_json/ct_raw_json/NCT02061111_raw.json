Studies have also shown\n      later signs of cognitive developmental challenges (risk of attention deficit/hyperactivity\n      problems) among children of mothers with autoimmune thyroid disease. In Denmark there is no\n      formalized screening or treatment of subclinical thyroid disease - with or without Thyroid\n      Peroxidase Antibodies (TPO-antibodies) - among pregnant women.\n\n      The hypothesis of this study is that the offspring of women with subclinical thyroid disease\n      have a mitochondria-dysfunction which leads to more complications during birth, poorer\n      health and well-being in the early childhood. The investigators will test this by recruiting\n      mothers by a blood sample in the third trimester of pregnancy, screen the cord blood at\n      birth and later on test the children with Bayley test two times in the early childhood."
