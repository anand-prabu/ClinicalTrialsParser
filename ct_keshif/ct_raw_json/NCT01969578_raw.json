Until today no standard of care\n      exists to treat these cancers. The identification of a target, the androgen receptor, in SG\n      tumors has allowed for new treatment strategies options for this rare group of diseases. As\n      a matter of fact, strong positivity for androgen expression has been found in salivary duct\n      carcinoma and adenocarcinomas. The purpose of this study is therefore to evaluate the\n      efficacy and safety of chemotherapy versus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in patients\n      with recurrent and/or metastatic AR expressing SGCs.\n\n      The study will include two cohorts of patients: Cohort A, which comprises chemo-na\u00efve\n      patients, and Cohort B, which comprises pretreated patients."
