      The purpose of this study is to verify whether using penile vibratory stimulation with the
      Viberect handheld device can help the recovery of erections and urinary control after
      radical prostatectomy.

    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer screening programs have led to thousands of sexually healthy men being
      diagnosed with prostate cancer every year. Recent literature suggests that up to 80% of
      these cancers are confined to the prostate gland. Currently, radical prostatectomy (RP)
      remains the best option for management of clinically localized prostate cancer in men with
      life expectancy greater than 10 years. Despite providing optimal cancer control, surgery can
      lead to quality of life (QOL) problems such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction
      (ED). Refinement of surgical technique have improved sexual and continence outcomes; however
      erectile function lags behind other QOL measures by 1-2 years, and quality of returning
      erections is often inferior. This can have profound biological, marital, and psychological
      consequences in potent men undergoing RP.

      Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to develop and maintain an erection for
      satisfactory sexual intercourse or activity. ED after nerve-sparing RP is related to a
      certain degree with functional impairment of cavernous nerves (CN) that travel along the
      prostate to the penis. This neuropraxia can last as long as 2 years. Pro-erectile nerve
      stimulus is vital for replenishment of corporal oxygen supply and other metabolic needs.
      Several histological analyses have demonstrated decreased smooth muscle number, cell-cell
      contact, venous leakage, collagen deposition, and additional harmful effects to corporal
      tissue after injury to CN.

      Awaiting post-surgical neuropraxia recovery, urologists have proposed a proactive approach
      to use of oral, intraurethral or injectable pharmacotherapy, neuromodulation, or
      vacuum-assisted regimens in erectile rehabilitation programs. Several studies demonstrate
      variable functional improvement in erectile function. Unfortunately, prohibitive costs of
      medications, poor response, and pain from injectables or intraurethral application often
      lead to high dropout rates.

      In addition to erectile dysfunction, a significant proportion of men after surgery develop
      and suffer from urinary incontinence (Stress, Urge, Mixed) requiring wearing pads with
      bothersome complaints persisting for months, even years after radical prostatectomy.

      The primary objective is to assess the role of penile vibratory stimulation by the Viberect
      device in enhancing the recovery of erectile function/rigidity and urinary continence after
      radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer. The difference in penile
      length will be compared in each arm.

      The secondary objective is to obtain a formal risk analysis (RA). Other objectives are to
      assess the ease of use and acceptability of vibratory stimulation at home.
