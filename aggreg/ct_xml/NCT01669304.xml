  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic dizziness and recurrent vertigo are frequent complaints in primary and specialty
      medical care settings.  Two common causes of these symptoms are vestibular migraine (VM) and
      chronic subjective dizziness (CSD), which may be seen in up to 25% of patients examined in
      tertiary neurotology centers.  However, VM and CSD are relatively new diagnoses that have
      not yet been validated.  Furthermore, recent research found that they co-exist 30% of the
      time with overlap in several features.  From a clinical standpoint, this makes it difficult
      to diagnose and treat them well.  From a research standpoint, it confounds subject selection
      for mechanistic investigations.

      The primary goal of this study to dissect VM and CSD in order to identify the key features
      and clarify the diagnostic criteria of each condition.  Fifty patients diagnosed with
      coexisting VM-CSD will be treated with either verapamil or sertraline.  Based on clinical
      and research experience to date, verapamil is thought to have greater effect on
      migraine-related symptoms, whereas sertraline is thought to have greater effect on
      CSD-related symptoms.  It is hypothesized that a differential treatment response to these
      two pharmacologic probes will help to tease apart the unique clinical features of VM and CSD
      and identify risk factors that are shared or separate between the two conditions.  The
      different mechanisms of action of the two study medications may also shed light on the
      physiologic underpinnings of VM and CSD.

      This project will be a 14-week, prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel group,
      pharmacologic dissection trial.  A 12-week treatment period will follow 2 weeks of baseline
      observation.  Patients will chart daily headache and vestibular symptoms.  VM and CSD
      symptoms and potential confounds such as anxiety and depression will be measured at two week
      intervals.  Data will be analyzed for differential and shared treatment effects that align
      with or oppose current concepts of VM and CSD.
