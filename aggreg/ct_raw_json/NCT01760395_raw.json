In this study, the database of NPIA is used to\n      compare the complication profiles of open and laparoscopic inguinal hernia surgery with\n      mesh. In addition, a reference material of uncomplicated laparoscopic hernia procedures is\n      collected from North Karelia Central Hospital to search for factors predisposing to severe\n      laparoscopic complications."
