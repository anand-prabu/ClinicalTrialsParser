  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hardly any imaging studies specifically addressing the articular and periarticular
      structures in MPS patients are available at this point. The investigators propose to do for
      the first time a pilot study using musculoskeletal ultrasound in patients with various types
      of MPS.
