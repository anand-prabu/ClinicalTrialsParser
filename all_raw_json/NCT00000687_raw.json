It is\n      hoped with the present study to define the rate at which the treatment affects the tumors\n      and also to assess any toxic effects of the combination treatment over a period of time.\n\n      In a recent study, the combination of IFN-A2a and AZT in the treatment of patients with\n      AIDS-associated KS was evaluated and safe doses of both AZT and IFN-A2a were determined. In\n      addition, it appeared that there was a substantial reduction in KS lesions with this\n      therapy. Potential benefits of this combined therapy include resolution of KS lesions,\n      prolonged survival, a decrease in the frequency and severity of opportunistic infections,\n      improvement in CD4 cells, and a decrease in serum p24 antigens."

AZT is given in a\n      single capsule every 4 hours through the day for a total of six capsules. The first phase of\n      treatment continues for 8 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period, during which time AZT only\n      is given. Subjects who have had an interruption in interferon during the first 8 weeks of\n      the study for a toxicity may skip the rest period. Patients experiencing a complete response\n      will be placed on maintenance therapy. Patients without progression of their KS can continue\n      on the treatment of AZT and IFN-A2a until a complete response is obtained or until study is\n      terminated, whichever comes first. Patients with complete anti-tumor response can continue\n      on a maintenance phase, in which they receive IFN-A2a as a single injection 3 times a week\n      on nonconsecutive days and a single capsule of AZT q4h 6 x /day until the study is\n      terminated on February 1, 1992. Patients are required to visit the clinic weekly for the\n      first 12 weeks (except during the week 9 rest period), every other week for the next 8\n      weeks, every month for up to 52 weeks of the study and every 3 months thereafter. Throughout\n      the study, frequent blood samples will be taken to monitor the effectiveness and safety of\n      the treatment."
