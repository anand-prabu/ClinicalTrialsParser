  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators aim to test the effectiveness of a text-message-based behaivoral intervention
      in reducing binge drinking among young adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol consumption, especially in the form of heavy episodic drinking (bingeing), is common
      among young adults. Despite high rates of illness and injury associated with heavy episodic
      drinking, many young adults are not aware of the risks, few seek help for their drinking and
      many at-risk are not exposed to prevention-based intervention. Opportunistic screening in
      hospital Emergency Departments (EDs) tied to behavioral interventions has the potential to
      prevent future alcohol-related harm among young adults, but efficacy across outcomes has
      been mixed and large-scale implementation of prevention programs is low. Given the rapidly
      growing use of cell phone text-messaging (SMS) as a primary form of communication among
      young adults, SMS could be used to deliver health prevention interventions. We will recruit
      young adults identified in the ED with hazardous drinking behavior in a 3-arm randomized
      controlled trial to test the hypothesis that exposure to a 12-week SMS program will result
      in immediate (3-month) and lasting (6-, and 9-month) decreases in alcohol consumption.
