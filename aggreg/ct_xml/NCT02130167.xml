  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myopia is the leading cause of blindness in Taiwan. The younger children with myopia, the
      higher risk of high myopia in later life and complications such as retinal detachment and
      maculopathy will occur. We have reported the low concentration of atropine (0.05%) with the
      effect on retarding the myopia progression. Recently the 0.01% atropine was also reported
      effective and with less visual side effects such as mydriasis. The aim of this study is to
      compare the efficacy in controlling myopia progression and visual side effects of 2 low
      concentration of atropine(0.05% vs 0.01%) in children aged 6-12 years with myopia of at
      least -0.5 diopters (D) and astigmatism of -1.50 D or less.
