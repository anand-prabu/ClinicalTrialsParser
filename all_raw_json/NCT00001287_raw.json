            "textblock": "Chronic Inflammatory Demylinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) is an autoimmune condition affecting\n      the nervous system.  Researchers believe the immune system begins attacking the cells\n      covering nerves called myelin.   The destruction of myelin causes muscle weakness, loss of\n      sensation, abnormal levels of protein in the fluid surrounding the brain (CSF), and slowing\n      of the nervous system.  The disease progresses slowly and disables patients suffering from\n      it.\n\n      CIDP is treated with steroids, plasmapheresis, and immunosuppressive drugs.  Many patients\n      initially respond to these treatments, but develop resistance to the therapy or experience\n      side effects causing the treatments to be stopped.\n\n      Researchers believe that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) may provide patients with CIDP a\n      safer and more effective alternative to standard therapies for the disease.  IVIg is a drug\n      that has been used successfully to treat other immune-related diseases of the nervous\n      system.  However, because IVIg is so expensive, researchers believe it should first be\n      proven effective on a small group of patients.\n\n      The study will take 60 patients with CIDP and divide them into two groups. Group one will\n      receive 2 injections of IVIg once a month for three months.  Group two will receive 2\n      injections of placebo \"inactive injection of sterile water\" once a month for three months.\n      Following the three months of treatment, group one will begin taking the placebo and group\n      two will begin taking IVIg for an additional 3 months. The drug will be considered effective\n      if patients receiving it experience a significant improvement (>25%) in muscle strength."

            "textblock": "Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a slowly progressive disabling\n      neuropathy characterized by subacute onset of muscle weakness, distal sensory deficit,\n      elevated spinal fluid protein, and slow nerve conduction velocity with or without conduction\n      block.  A monoclonal gammopathy is at times present in the serum of some patients.  Because\n      immune-mediated mechanisms against peripheral nerve myelin are thought to be primarily\n      responsible for the clinical manifestations of CIDP, the treatment of choice is with\n      corticosteroids, plasmapheresis or immunosuppressive drugs.  Although many patients\n      initially respond to these agents, a large number of them become resistant or develop\n      unacceptable side effects that necessitate their discontinuation.  The need for a more\n      effective and safe immunotherapy in CIDP patients prompted the present study using high-dose\n      intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg).  IVIg is an immunomodulating agent which has been\n      recently shown to be effective and safe in the treatment of a number of patients with\n      immune-related neuromuscular diseases.\n\n      This is a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled, trial involving 60 patients, half of\n      which will receive IVIg and the other half placebo (D5/W).  Because IVIg is prohibitively\n      expensive, a controlled trial is needed to provide convincing evidence of efficacy, and\n      ensure that the benefit is not due to spontaneous improvement or to observer bias.  The dose\n      of IVIg is 2 GM/Kg divided into two daily doses administered monthly for six months.  The\n      drug will be considered effective if patients experience an increase of more than 25% in\n      their baseline muscle strength.  Muscle strength will be assessed with a series of objective\n      dynamometric measurements performed before and after each monthly infusion."
