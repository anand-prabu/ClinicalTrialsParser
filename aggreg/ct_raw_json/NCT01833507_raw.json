Obese patients suffer higher mortality and impaired functional status often as\n      a result of their obesity.  One primary goal to reduce both obesity and improve functional\n      status is exercise.  The investigators hypothesize that a simple exercise intervention with\n      limited behavioral goal-setting will reduce weight and increase functional status compared\n      to usual care.  As a secondary measure, the investigators hypothesize that using this\n      intervention will reduce hospital admissions and ER visits."
