Adipose tissue secretes various kinds of bioactive molecules\n      termed adipokines which contribute to the development of obesity-related disorders including\n      cardiovascular disease (CVD). Progranulin and CTRP3 are recently discovered novel\n      adipokines. Therefore, the investigators tried to compare circulating CTRP-3 and progranulin\n      levels in patients with CAD and investigated whether CTRP-3 or progranulin is significantly\n      associated with CAD prevalence after adjustment for well-known CAD risk factors."
