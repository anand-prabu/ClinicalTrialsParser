Causes enlightening POI may be enumerated as follows, according to their\n      frequency: genetic mutations, autoimmune defects and abnormalities detected on the X\n      chromosome.The purpose of the study is to determine the frequency of the genetic\n      abnormalities and polymorphisms described above in the POI Turkish population"
