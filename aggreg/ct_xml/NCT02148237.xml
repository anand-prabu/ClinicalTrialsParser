  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine preliminary effects of group peer-support with and without
      group-based incentives to increase breastfeeding (BF) duration among low-income Puerto Rican
      mothers enrolled in a Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and
      Children (WIC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effect sizes of a
      peer-support group alone and combined with group-based financial incentives to increase
      breastfeeding (BF) duration among low-income Puerto Rican mothers. These interventions will
      be tested in a Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program, which capitalizes on the current
      goals of WIC and on the current practice of using incentives to support BF - factors that
      are likely to increase potential for sustainability and dissemination of the intervention.
      The study is important because: 1) peer support for BF is the only BF maintenance strategy
      out of 10 recommended steps to support BF by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the
      United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) for prolonging BF; 2) the proposed interventions
      have potential to address health disparities related to insufficient durations of
      breastfeeding, which are particularly prevalent among low-income Puerto Rican women; 3)
      insufficient breastfeeding is related to multiple maternal and child health problems; and 4)
      increases in breastfeeding duration could save tens of billions of dollars in health costs.
      We will follow a three phase strategy. During the Formative Phase we will consult WIC staff,
      Puerto Rican postpartum mothers, and experts in BF, behavioral health incentives, and WIC
      populations and settings to develop intervention and research manuals. During the
      Implementation Phase, we will pilot the interventions and research procedures.  We will
      randomly assign 60 Puerto Rican women who initiate BF to: Treatment-as-Usual (TAU); TAU plus
      a breastfeeding peer-support group (BFS); or TAU and BFS with group-based financial
      incentives (also known as Group Contingency Management; (GCM). Participants in the
      peer-support groups will be encouraged to talk about their BF experiences and problem-solve
      BF issues. Participants also receiving GCM will be divided into two teams within their
      peer-support group and each week the team with the greatest proportion of BF mothers (as
      determined by direct observation of BF) will earn cash incentives in the amount of $5 per
      team member. We will conduct assessments at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum,
      measuring BF duration, BF exclusivity, BF self-efficacy, and infant weight gain.  In the
      Evaluative Phase, we will examine monthly recruitment, consent, and enrollment rates, as
      well as attendance and retention rates for the interventions and for research participation
      (i.e., feasibility and acceptability).

    <description>Observe breastfeeding (BF) behavior looking for one of the following indicators of successful BF in the infant: audible swallowing, a regular suck/swallow/breathe pattern, or visible milk in the infant's mouth after they are not latched anymore. For a mother who pumps milk, observation of pumping combined with observation of the resulting milk being fed to the infant will be observed.</description>

    <description>The Coercion Assessment Scale (CAS) is a 11-item questionnaire that measures perceived coercion to participate in research.  The items examine pressures emanating from WIC staff and the research assistant.  An initial support for the instrument's internal consistency, factor structure, and discriminative validity has been provided.</description>

    <description>Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS) is a 10-item questionnaire that identifies patients at risk for perinatal depression. The EPDS was found to be sensitive and specific, especially sensitive to change in the severity of depression over time. The scale can be completed in about 5 minutes and scoring is very simple.</description>

    <description>Breastfeeding self-efficacy scale (BSES) is a 39-item questionnaire to measure maternal confidence in new BF mothers. The scale has demonstrated its predictive validity showing a positive correlation between BSES scores and infant feeding patterns at 6-week postpartum. The scale has been also useful to identify new mothers with low BF confidence at high risk for premature weaning. The scale has been translated into Spanish and replicated its validity and reliability with Puerto Rican mothers.</description>

    <description>Participants in Treatment as Usual (TAU) will receive standard breastfeeding (BF) services from the WIC program and participate in research assessments. Standard services include an on-site lactation consultant, occasional one-on-one peer counseling, and an enhanced food package for BF women.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>These participants will receive usual WIC care and attend peer-support group meetings that will take place once every week for 60-90 minutes at the WIC site. Participants will be asked to participate in the meetings weekly for 6 months postpartum. They will be encouraged to talk about their breastfeeding (BF) experiences and provide peer support to each other, sharing experiences and problem-solving issues.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>These participants will receive usual WIC care, and peer-support group meetings.   The frequency, duration, content, and size of the meetings and participation requirements will be the same as for the breastfeeding support group, except that this group will also receive group contingency management (GCM). Group members will be divided into two teams of equal size and compete to earn cash incentives. Each week all members of the team with the largest proportion of participants continuing breastfeeding will win cash incentives of $5 per participant.</description>

    <description>Participants in this condition will receive usual WIC are and breastfeeding support group exposure in addition to Group Contingency Management (GCM). Transportation reimbursement will be provided as needed. BF will be determined by direct observation. If both groups have the same proportion of members attending and continuing to BF, both will receive the incentives. Women with postpartum medical restrictions or who are too fatigued to come to the peer-support groups during the first two weeks after delivery will receive individual check-ins through home visits. The maximum possible earning through GCM is $240.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Breastfeeding Support</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will attend breastfeeding peer-support groups.  The support group leader will address the importance and benefits of breastfeeding (BF), cultural misconceptions about early weaning and formula supplementation before 6 months postpartum, and the risks of smoking and second-hand smoke exposure to children. She will praise efforts that participants make to continue BF and facilitate discussions among participants on how to continue BF while working, have babies latch better, take care of sore nipples, and deal with negative views of family and others. Should the group grow to &gt;10 participants, a new group will be offered at a different time, and participants will be allowed to select the group they wish to attend (4-10 participants is considered an ideal group size).</description>
