One of these is papaverine, an inhibitor of the PDE\n      10 family. The class of PDE10 inhibitors have been reported as possible candidates in the\n      treatment of schizophrenia, and may prove an attractive antipsychotic alternative due to the\n      many side-effects of the currently available antipsychotics. It has been proposed from\n      preclinical studies that PDE10 inhibitors have the potential to reduce cognitive deficits in\n      schizophrenia and these findings need to be confirmed in a human population, in view of the\n      fact that no other currently registered drug posses these unique properties.\n\n      The currently proposed project is designed to investigate whether the PDE10 inhibitor\n      Papaverine indeed have the capacity to reduce cognitive deficits in schizophrenia patients.\n      In order to accomplish this effect, Papaverine will be investigated in schizophrenia, with\n      regards to symptomatology, hemodynamic, neurocognition and early information-processing."
