  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to examine monitored rehabilitation therapy over the internet
      to improve upper limb function for stroke patients. Home rehabilitation for stroke patients
      will avoid the burden of arrival to the health facilities, making it easier on them and
      improve their quality of life and the lives of their caregivers. To achieve this goal the
      investigators will examine the effectiveness and feasibility of home rehabilitation system
      of upper limb, consisting of ergonomic accessories (hand and arm tutors).

      The quantitative indices will be based on the quantitative clinical measures that are used
      in regular evaluations of stroke patients and function and range of motion indices as
      received from the system.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Assessment upper extremity part (FMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The FMA assesses the motor impairment of the upper extremity after stroke. Each movement is graded on a 3-point scale, and the total score for the upper extremity ranges from 0-60 points where a higher score represents more active movements. An additional part assesses the coordination of the affected upper extremity and the score ranges between 0-6 where a higher score represents poorer coordination ability. This test is one of the most commonly used instruments in rehabilitation and its validity and reliability have been well established9</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Chedoke Arm and Hand Activity Inventory (CAHAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The test assesses the functional ability of the affected arm and hand of people with stroke. The abbreviated version includes 7 functional activities (e.g. open a jar of coffee) that require bilateral use of the upper extremities as well various types of grip. The score range between1 and 7</description>

    <measure>The Motor Activity Log - MAL</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Mal consist of a semi structured interview for the patient to assess the use of the paretic arm and hand during daily activities. Two scores on a scale of 1 -5, are given for each activity;for the amount of use (AOU) and for the quality of movement (QOM). Usability of the system i.e. ease of use of the system</description>

    <measure>System Usability Scale (SUS)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>This questionnaire includes 10 items rated on a 5 points scale, which provide a global view of subjective assessment of a system's usability. The item scores were calculated to give an overall score ranging from 10 to 100 points. The SUS has been shown to be a robust and reliable evaluation tool</description>

    <measure>Box&amp; Block Test of Manual Dexterity</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>This is a valid and reliable test which is used to assess hand dexterity. In addition it is used to assess endurance of the upper extremity. The subject is asked to transfer cubes, above a partition, from one side of a box to the other for one minute with both hands. The score is the number of cubes that were transferred. In addition: Range of motion of fingers, wrist elbow and shoulder as measured by the devices</description>
