<td colspan="2" class="bigdent">
<p>The purpose of this multinational, multi-center, open label, uncontrolled, single arm phase II study is to assess the anti-tumor activity and safety profile of BAY 43-9006 as a single agent in subjects with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). &nbsp;Subjects will be treated with BAY 43-9006 400 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) until there is objective evidence of tumor progression, evidence of toxicity that is unacceptable and thought to be related to study drug.</p>
