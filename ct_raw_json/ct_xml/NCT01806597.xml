    <description>The primary endpoint is the palmoplantar Investigator Global Assessment (ppIGA) response after 16 weeks of treatment. To be considered a ppIGA responder at Week 16, a subject must have a ppIGA of 0 or 1 at Week 16 and a reduction of at least 2 points on the ppIGA scale from baseline.</description>

    <description>The ppIGA score for signs of plaque psoriasis on the palms and soles. A subject will be considered a ppIGA responder at a specific time, if the ppIGA score at that time of assessment is 0 or 1 AND if there is a reduction of at least 2 points on the ppIGA scale at that time from baseline. Each secukinumab dose regimen will be compared with placebo in terms of treatment response at each visit up to Week 16 and over time up to Week 80.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The ppPASI score evaluates erythema, induration and desquamation, as well as the area affected with the disease on the palms and soles. Percentage change from baseline in ppPASI score from randomization to Week 16 and over time up to Week 80 will be analyzed. Each of the secukinumab groups will be compared with the placebo group.</description>

    <description>201 subjects with moderate or severe plaque type psoriasis and meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned using a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the following treatment arms: secukinumab 150 mg, secukinumab 300 mg, or placebo. Subjects assigned to secukinumab will be dosed weekly for the first five weeks and then every four weeks up to and including Week 76. In order to maintain the blinding, subjects will receive additional placebo injections at Weeks 17, 18 and 19. All doses consist of sub-cutaneous injections.</description>

Prior to taking the Week 16 dose, the subject will be assessed for response to treatment using the palmoplantar Investigator Global Assessment scale. If the subject is a responder, the subject will continue on placebo for five weeks starting on Week 16 and then every four weeks up to and including Week 76. Subjects who are not responders will be randomized to either the secukinumab 150 mg or secukinumab 300mg treatment arms and dose weekly for five weeks starting on Week 16 and then every four weeks up to and including Week 76.

    <description>secukinumab 150 mg will be provided by the investigator in a pre-filled syringe at 150 mg in 1 mL. Each dosing will consist of secukinumab 150 mg s.c. injection plus a placebo secukinumab s.c. injection once weekly for five weeks (at Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4), followed by dosing every four weeks, starting at Week 8 until Week 76 inclusive. In order to maintain the blinding, subjects will receive additional placebo injections at Weeks 17, 18 and 19. The subject will dose in the clinic under the supervision of the site personnel when injections occur on days of study visits. The injections not occurring during a site visit will be done by the subjects (or caregiver) at their home.</description>

At Week 16, ppIGA responders  will continue on placebo and receive their injections on Weeks 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20, and then every four weeks from Week 24 to Week 76. ppIGA non-responders will be re-randomized to receive 150 mg or 300 mg secukinumab on Weeks 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20, and then every four weeks from Week 24 to Week 76.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects should have chronic moderate to severe plaque type psoriasis for at least  6
             months prior to entering the study, including  significant involvement of plaque type
             psoriasis on the palms and soles defined by a palmoplantar Investigator Global
             Assessment (ppIGA) score of ≥ 3 (on a 5-point scale) and at least one extra
             palmoplantar plaque on the skin

          -  Subjects should be candidates for systemic therapy, which means having psoriasis
             considered inadequately controlled by topical treatment (including super potent
             topical corticosteroid) and/or phototherapy and/or previous systemic therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Forms of psoriasis other than chronic plaque type psoriasis (e.g., pustular
             psoriasis, palmoplantar pustulosis, acrodermatitis of Hallopeau, erythrodermic and
             guttate psoriasis)

          -  Drug-induced psoriasis (e.g. new onset or current exacerbation from β-blockers,
             calcium channel inhibitors or lithium)

          -  Ongoing use of prohibited treatments (e.g. topical or systemic corticosteroids (CS),
             UV therapy). Washout periods have to be adhered to Table 5-1

          -  Prior exposure to secukinumab (AIN457) or any other biologic drug directly targeting
             IL-17 or IL-17 Receptor

          -  Receipt of any investigational drugs within 4 weeks of study drug initiation or
             within a period of 5 half-lives of the investigational treatment, whichever is longer

          -  Active ongoing inflammatory diseases other than psoriasis that might confound the
             evaluation of the benefit of secukinumab therapy

          -  History of hypersensitivity to constituents of the study treatment

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply
