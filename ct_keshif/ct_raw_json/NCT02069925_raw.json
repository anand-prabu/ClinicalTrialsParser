To determine whether an early detection intervention can reduce DUP in the US, as\n           compared to usual detection. Early detection (ED) will be implemented in one US\n           community (New Haven, CT), and usual detection efforts will continue in another\n           (Boston, MA). DUP will be measured at admission to the corresponding first-episode\n           services (STEP & PREP) in each community, over one year before and throughout ED\n           implementation. The investigators  hypothesize that DUP will be reduced significantly\n           in the early detection site compared to the usual detection site;\n\n        2. A secondary aim is to determine whether DUP reduction can augment the outcomes of\n           established FES on outcomes in the U.S. The investigators will measure symptoms,\n           functioning and engagement with treatment at entry and over 1 year at each site. The\n           investigators hypothesize that shorter DUP at one FES (STEP) will predict reduced\n           distress and illness severity at entry and better early outcomes at STEP compared to\n           PREP."

            "textblock": "Early detection, or reducing the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) can substantially\n      ameliorate the distress and disability caused by psychotic illnesses. The TIPS project in\n      Scandinavia used a combination of public and targeted education campaigns coupled with rapid\n      availability of comprehensive services to improve the identification, referral and  early\n      treatment  of  psychotic  illness.  By targeting the dual  'bottlenecks'  of inadequate\n      mental health literacy and delayed access to effective treatment, TIPS significantly reduced\n      DUP2 and experimentally demonstrated improved clinical presentations and outcomes.\n\n      Effective  service  models  for  new  onset  psychosis  exist  in  the  U.S.  Multi-element\n      specialty  'first-episode' services (FES), highlighted in this FOA, provide care that is\n      adapted to the specific needs of younger patients and their families and can improve\n      symptoms and functional outcomes during the critical early phase of psychotic illnesses. The\n      NIH-funded Specialized Treatment in Early Psychosis (STEP, New Haven) project, included  the\n       first  U.S.-based  randomized  controlled  trial  to  establish  the  feasibility  and\n      effectiveness of a public-sector approach to FES.5  The Prevention and Recovery in Early\n      Psychosis (PREP, Boston) clinic has advanced a similar model of care within an analogous\n      public-academic collaboration.\n\n      What is required, as the next logical step, is a test of the effectiveness of TIPS' powerful\n      approach to early detection in a policy-relevant U.S. setting, where relatively fragmented\n      pathways to care raise both the challenges and potential public health impact of early\n      detection. The expertise within the investigators investigative team in the design of early\n      detection and the presence of 2 similar, effective, geographically separated and\n      collaborative FES programs (STEP and PREP) presents an excellent opportunity to conduct such\n      a test and thereby advance secondary prevention for psychotic illnesses in the U.S."
