  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study will examine the efficacy and safety of Pegasys (peginterferon
      alfa-2a), mostly in combination with Copegus (ribavirin) treatment in CHC patients. Quality
      of care will also be assessed. Approximately 12% of the interferon-treated chronic hepatitis
      C (CHC) patient population in Germany is expected to be studied over a period of 5 years.
