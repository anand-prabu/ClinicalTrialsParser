  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to investigate the determinants of the quality of life in
      children and adults with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and more particularly the specific
      impact of neuropsychological deficits. In fact, cognitive impairment is currently considered
      as one of the most pervasive features of this genetic disorder but its relationship with the
      worsening of quality of life found in this population has not been directly investigated to
      date.

      Secondary objectives of this study are (i) to compare neuropsychological and quality of life
      measures between patients and healthy controls matched by age, gender and education level,
      (ii) to contrast neuropsychological deficits incidence between patients and controls, and
      (iii) to differentiate NF1 children's self versus hetero-assessment of quality of life.

      The main hypothesis of this study is that the neuropsychological impairment classically
      identified in this clinical population will be associated to the quality of life's worsening
      both in children and adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study cohort will consist of 150 patients with NF1 (100 adults and 50 children)
      recruited from the Neurofibromatosis Clinic at the University Hospital in Nantes and Créteil
      (France). A sample of 150 healthy controls (100 adults and 50 children) will also be
      recruited from sport and leisure clubs to serve as a normally developing control group.

      The protocol assessment includes a standard and thorough neuropsychological examination
      specific to children and adults, to investigate the different aspects of cognitive domains:
      language, visuoperceptive and visuomotor abilities, memory, attention, executive function
      and intelligence skills. Quality of life is measured by a questionnaire specifically adapted
      to children and adults.

      Other factors linked to the NF1 disease (familial or sporadic form, severity and visibility)
       and to demographic characteristics (sex, age, education level) will be taken into account
      to study their respective impact on quality of life, as compared with neuropsychological
      measures.
