Thereafter, three Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSC) infusions will be given at weekly interval starting from day 5. We will follow a dose escalating programme with progressively increasing doses of cells until the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) is achieved.\nThe dose escalating design will be characterised by the administration of 1x106 /kg UC-MSC per dose per three doses for the first three patients (total up to 3x106/kg). The second three patients will receive 2x106/kg UC-MSC per dose per three doses (total up to 6x106/kg). The third three patients will receive 3x106/kg UC-MSC per dose per three doses (total up to 9x106 cells/kg).\nSince three dosages of cells are programmed for each group of 3 patients, a minimum of 9 patients should be studied, unless unacceptable acute infusion related toxicity is observed."

Remarkably, in all reported clinical studies the toxicity of Mesenchymal stromal\n      cells administration has been found consistently negligible. The investigators believe that\n      Umbilical Cord (UC) derived Mesenchymal stromal cells may represent a stronger\n      immunosuppressive tool for such clinical emergency and no data suggest any change in the\n      safety profile of these cells. For this reason, and in the best interest of the patient, the\n      investigators plan to test the safety and activity of Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal stromal\n      cells when given sequentially to another partially effective treatment of steroid resistant\n      acute graf versus host disease such as Pentostatin."

Patients with persistent, recurrent, or late acute graft versus host disease (GvHD)\n             (features of acute graft versus host disease occurring beyond 100 days, often during\n             withdrawal of immune suppression).\n\n          3.
