  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To provide oral domperidone to patients between the ages of 18 and 60 years of age,
      according to the investigator's judgment, a prokinetic effect is needed for the relief of
      severe gastroparesis. We have defined severe gastroparesis as 1) positive gastric emptying
      scintigraphy (more than 10% residue at 4 hours), 2) nausea, 3) early satiety, 4) abdominal
      pain. We will recruit patients for two years and the patients will be given domperidone for
      up to two years.

          4. Subjects must have a comprehensive evaluation to eliminate other causes of their
             symptoms which includes gastric emptying scintigraphy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy
             (EGD), and the patient's subjective symptoms.

          5. Subject has signed informed consent for the administration of domperidone that
             informs the patient of potential adverse events

          6. Female subjects must be:
