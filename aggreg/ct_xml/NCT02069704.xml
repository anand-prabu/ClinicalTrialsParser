    <textblock>
      This is a  multicenter, open label, randomized bioequivalence study of BEVZ92 (bevacizumab
      biosimilar) and Avastin® with 2 parallel arms to compare the PK profile of BEVZ92 and
      Avastin® in combination with FOLFOX (any) or FOLFIRI chemotherapy.

      FOLFOX (any) or FOLFIRI will be chosen as per investigator criteria based on the hospital
      standard of care.

             conditions that could affect their participation in the study

         11. Patients with serious non-healing wound, ulcer, bone fracture, or with a major
             surgical procedure, or significant traumatic injury within  4 weeks prior to
             randomization
