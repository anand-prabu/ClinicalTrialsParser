  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      General anaesthesia is a reversible drug-induced coma. Too little can result in patients
      being partially conscious during surgery; too much can slow recovery after surgery. There is
      a range of drug doses that can be used and some anesthesiologists use more than others.
      There is no convincing evidence that any particular dose within the usual range is better.
      Consequently, there are no guidelines on the best depth of anaesthesia. This study will
      determine whether general anesthetic concentrations at the low end of the usual range are
      better than those at the high end.

      Participants will randomly be assigned to lighter or deeper general anesthesia.   The first
      day after surgery, two short questionnaires about recovery and memories of the surgery will
      be completed.  During the rest of the participant's hospital stay, a survey about how one
      feels will be completed.

      There will be two telephone contacts after discharge from the hospital.  One month after
      surgery three questionnaires will be completed about performing daily tasks, how you feel
      and memories of the surgery.  Then one year after surgery pain will be assessed.
