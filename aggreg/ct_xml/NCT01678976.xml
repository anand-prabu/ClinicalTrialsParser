      To investigate the pharmacokinetics of a single 900 mg oral dose of BIA 2-093 and a single
      900 mg oral dose of Oxcarbazepine in healthy volunteers and to assess the tolerability of a
      single 900 mg dose of BIA 2-093 and Oxcarbazepine.

    <textblock>
      Single centre, open label, balanced randomised, two-way crossover study in 12 healthy
      volunteers. The study consisted of 2 periods separated by a washout period of 7 days or
      more. On each of the study periods the volunteers received either a single 900 mg oral dose
      of BIA 2-093 or a single 900 mg oral dose of Oxcarbazepine.
