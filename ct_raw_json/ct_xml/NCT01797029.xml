      This is a single center, multi-site, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled trial
      of the clinical efficacy of trivalent Serum Institute of India, Ltd. (SIIL)live-attenuated
      influenza vaccine (LAIV) vaccine among children aged 24 through 59 months in Bangladesh.

      Background:

        1. Burden: Within Bangladesh, community- based influenza surveillance identified 84.5
           cases/1000 children-years among children &lt;5 years, while 10% of clinical pneumonia
           cases were influenza positive in this age group.

        2. Knowledge gap: There has never been a randomized clinical efficacy trial of the SIIL
           LAIV vaccine conducted among children in a low-income country.

        3. Relevance: Another LAIV vaccine (made by MedImmune) has been shown to have high
           efficacy against laboratory-confirmed influenza among children. The SIIL LAIV has the
           potential to be an inexpensive intervention to prevent pediatric influenza disease.

      Primary Hypothesis: In children aged 24 through 59 months in Bangladesh, LAIV is efficacious
      in reducing rates of symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed influenza (vaccine-matched strains)
      among children vaccinated with LAIV as compared to children vaccinated with a placebo
      through the first influenza season following vaccination.

      Primary Objective: To determine the efficacy of LAIV in reducing rates of symptomatic,
      laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection (vaccine-matched strains) among children
      receiving LAIV as compared to children receiving a placebo through the first influenza
      season following vaccination (through December 2013).

      Methods: A total of 1761 children will be enrolled and randomized in a 2:1 ratio of LAIV to
      placebo beginning in March 2013. After vaccination, all children will be evaluated for
      reactions with one home visit four days post vaccination. Subsequently, all children will be
      monitored weekly for safety outcomes and illness signs at weekly field worker home visits
      through December 2013. An extended surveillance period was added to this study and, for
      participants consenting to additional follow-up, surveillance will extend through a second
      season (through July 2014). Participants with illness signs will be referred to the study
      clinic for evaluation using standardized diagnostic criteria and treatment by a study
      physician. Children meeting protocol-defined clinical Specimen Collection Criteria will have
      a nasopharyngeal wash specimen collected. Clinical specimens will be tested by rRT-PCR for
      evidence of influenza virus infection.

      Primary Outcome measures/variables: Vaccine efficacy will be assessed against symptomatic,
      laboratory-confirmed influenza for all circulating virus strains.
