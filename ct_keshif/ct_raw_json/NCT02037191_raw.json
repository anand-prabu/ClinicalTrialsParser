Treatment of severe types of AA include\n      phototherapy, pulse IV corticosteroids, topical immunotherapy. These treatments are poorly\n      effective in severe types of AA, since the rate of hair regrowth remains lower than 10%.\n      Methotrexate is an immunosuppressant which is used in many autoimmune skin disorders.\n\n      Aim: To assess the safety and efficacy of methotrexate versus placebo in the treatment of\n      severe types of AA.\n\n      Design:  Patients will be randomly assigned to receive methotrexate 20 to 25 mg / week for 6\n      months. Patients who will experience at least a 25% hair regrowth after 5 months will\n      continue methotrexate or placebo  from month 6 to the end of the study (month 12).  Non\n      responder patients will be re randomized to receive either methotrexate alone or associated\n      with prednisone 0.3 mg/Kg/day from month 6 to the end of the study (month 12).\n\n      Study Design Primary outcome  Rate of  complete or almost complete hair regrowth   at the\n      month 12 evaluation in patients treated with methotrexate or placebo who have not been re\n      randomized after the month 5 evaluation  and have staid in their initial group of\n      randomization Secondary outcomes\n\n        1.
