Subjects may receive licensed\n      seasonal influenza vaccine prior to (2 weeks if given the inactivated vaccine or 4 weeks if\n      given the live, attenuated vaccine) the first H3N2v vaccination.  Alternatively, subjects\n      may receive licensed seasonal influenza vaccine at any time after completion of the Day 42\n      visit or following an early termination visit. Safety will be measured by the occurrence of\n      solicited injection site and systemic reactogenicity on the day of each H3N2v vaccination\n      through 7 days after each H3N2v vaccination, adverse events through 42 days after the first\n      H3N2v vaccination, and serious adverse events (SAEs) and new-onset chronic medical\n      conditions through 7 months after the first H3N2v vaccination. For subjects 6-35 months old\n      and 3-8 years old, immunogenicity testing will include performing hemagglutination\n      inhibition (HAI) and neutralizing (Neut) antibody assays on serum obtained on the day of and\n      prior to each H3N2v vaccination (Days 0 and 21) and approximately 21 days after the second\n      H3N2v vaccination (Day 42). For subjects 9-17 years old, immunogenicity testing will include\n      performing HAI and Neut antibody assays on serum obtained on the day of and prior to each\n      H3N2v vaccination (Days 0 and 21), approximately 8 days after the first H3N2v vaccination\n      (Day 8), and approximately 21 days after the second H3N2v vaccination (Day 42)."
