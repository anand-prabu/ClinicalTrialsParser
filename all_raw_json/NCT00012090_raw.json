Goserelin may interfere with the growth factor and may stop the tumor from growing.\n      Bicalutamide may prevent androgens from stimulating the growth of cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of goserelin plus bicalutamide in\n      treating patients who have refractory or recurrent cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, or\n      peritoneum."

Determine the time-to-treatment failure in patients with ovarian epithelial,\n      fallopian tube, or peritoneal carcinoma, in second or greater remission, treated with\n      bicalutamide and goserelin. II. Assess luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone\n      suppression in correlation with serum vascular endothelial growth factor levels, and\n      determine if these levels are related to time to treatment failure in these patients. III.\n      Correlate the presence or absence of androgen receptor tissue expression by\n      immunohistochemistry and androgen receptor gene trinucleotide repeat length to time to\n      treatment failure in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral bicalutamide once daily and goserelin subcutaneously once\n      every 4 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity until disease\n      recurrence.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study."
