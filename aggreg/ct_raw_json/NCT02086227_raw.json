This\n      study will examine a comparison of the bioavailability pharmacokinetics of 1 mg (1 IU) of\n      Glucagon (Fresenius Kabi USA) by having each subject receive in each period either a single\n      dose of 1 mg (1 IU) of Glucagon (Fresenius Kabi USA) or a single dose of GlucaGen\u00ae (Bedford\n      Laboratories), 1 mg (1 IU), via subcutaneous injection.  Blood samples will be collected\n      three (3) times starting 2 hours prior to dosing and at intervals over 4 hours post dose.\n      The concentrations of glucagon and glucose will be measured."
