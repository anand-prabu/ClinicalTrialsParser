Overweight and obesity are independent risk factors for chronic\n      disease such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease in both the\n      general population and those with IDD.\n\n      The investigators modified the Stop Light Diet (SLDm) to include reduced energy pre-packaged\n      meals (PM) for 6 months, encouraged consumption of low energy shakes and 35 fruits and\n      vegetables (F/V) per week.  The investigators will compare participants who use the SLDm\n      with participants who use a reduced energy and fat diet with meal plans, based off of the\n      current American Dietetic Association recommended car for weight reduction plan."
