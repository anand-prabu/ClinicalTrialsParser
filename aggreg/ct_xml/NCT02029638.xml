  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transplantation is a good treatment for people with end-stage kidney disease.  However,
      there is still much to learn about how to best care for the transplanted kidney and keep it
      working for a long time.

      Unless a person receiving a kidney from someone else takes drugs that reduce immune
      function, the kidney will be rejected. Those drugs must be continued life-long and cause
      many issues. Therefore, tolerance of the transplanted kidney, without chronic rejection and
      without the need for permanent immunosuppressive drug treatment, is a highly desirable goal.
       If this can be achieved, it would make &quot;one kidney for life&quot; possible.

      The purpose of this study is to find out if the study treatment will allow people to accept
      their new kidney and be able to stop taking anti-rejection medications.  The study treatment
      includes several days of study medications followed by a kidney and bone marrow transplant.
      After the transplant, the study treatment will continue with a few more doses of study
      medications and then anti-rejection medication is started.  After a while, the
      anti-rejection medication is slowly stopped. Researchers will examine blood and tissue
      samples and try to identify genetic markers for certain conditions like chimerism, response
      to therapy, and tolerance.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Recipient participants must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for
             this study:

               1. Recipient of a first renal allograft from an HLA-haploidentical, living related
                  donor.  The donor and recipient must be HLA identical for at least one allele
                  (using high resolution DNA based typing) at the following genetic loci: HLA-A,
                  HLA-B, HLA-C and HLA-DRB1. Fulfillment of this criterion shall be considered
                  sufficient evidence that the donor and recipient share one HLA haplotype.

               2. Age 18 to 65 years.

               3. Single solid organ recipients (kidney only).

               4. ABO compatibility with donor.

               5. Demonstration of absence of DSA using solid phase micro particle technology (by
                  Luminex® phenotype panel or Luminex single antigen bead test) performed 30 days
                  or less prior to transplant as assessed by local laboratories.

               6. No known history of anti-HLA antibodies.  Recipients with low- level anti-HLA
                  antibodies not considered to be clinically significant may be eligible,
                  following consultation with the  Protocol Chairs, the local HLA Laboratory
                  Director, the NIAID Medical Monitor and the ITN Clinical Trial Physician.

               7. Negative T and B cell flow crossmatches with the designated donor; as assessed
                  by local laboratories. If one or more of the crossmatches is positive, the
                  participant will be considered a screen failure unless combined results of
                  antibody and cross match testing implicate a non-HLA antibody as the cause of
                  the positive flow crossmatch. In this case, the Protocol Chair must approve the
                  participant as a screening success after consultation with the local HLA
                  Laboratory Director.

               8. Normal estimated left ventricular ejection fraction and no history of ischemic
                  heart disease requiring revascularization, unless cleared by a cardiologist.

               9. Forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) &gt; 40% of
                  predicted at the screening visit.

              10. Serological evidence of prior Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection as documented
                  by positive IgG and negative IgM antibodies against EBV.

              11. For women of childbearing potential, a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
                  with sensitivity less than 50 mIU/m within 72 hours before the start of study
                  medication.

              12. Use of two forms of contraception with less than a 5% failure rate or abstinence
                  by all transplanted participants for 18 months after the first dose of study
                  therapy. For the first 60 days post-transplant, recipients should be encouraged
                  to use non-hormonal contraceptives due to the potential adverse effect of
                  hormones on bone marrow engraftment.

              13. Ability to receive oral medication.

              14. Ability to understand and provide informed consent.

          -  Donor participants must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for this
             study:

               1. HLA-haploidentical, first-degree relatives or half-siblings of the recipient
                  participant at the allele or allele group.  The donor and recipient must be HLA
                  identical for at least one allele (using high resolution DNA based typing) at
                  the following genetic loci: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1. Fulfillment of
                  this criterion shall be considered sufficient evidence that the donor and
                  recipient share one HLA haplotype.

               2. Age 18 to 65 years.

               3. Creatinine clearance &gt;80 ml/minute as measured from a 24 hour urine collection
                  within 26 weeks of the screening visit. If a serum creatinine drawn at the
                  screening visit is &gt; 20% higher than the serum creatinine drawn at the time of
                  the 24 urine collection, the creatinine clearance must be re-evaluated by a
                  repeat 24 hour urine test. If the new value is ≤80mg/dL the donor will be
                  excluded.

               4. Meets institutional selection criteria for organ and bone marrow donation.

               5. Ability to understand and provide informed consent for all study procedures
                  including kidney transplant and bone marrow harvest.

               6. Serologic evidence of prior EBV infection as documented by positive IgG and
                  negative IgM antibodies against EBV.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Recipient participants who meet any of the following criteria will not be eligible
             for this study:

               1. Underlying renal disease with a high risk of disease recurrence in the
                  transplanted kidney, including:

                    1. focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).

                    2. type I or II membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.

                    3. hemolytic-uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

               2. Clinically important genital/urinary tract dysfunction.

               3. Body mass index (BMI) &gt; 40.

               4. Women who are breastfeeding.

                  stage 1 renal cell carcinoma, stage 1 prostate cancers cured by local resection
                  and any curatively treated carcinomas in situ.

               6. History of positive HIV-1 or HIV-2 serologies or nucleic acid test.

               7. Evidence of prior hepatitis B infection as evaluated by hepatitis B surface
                  antigen (HBsAg), total hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc IgM and IgG) and
                  hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBsAb).

                  Participants demonstrating any one of the following will be excluded:

                    1. positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or

                    2. positive anti-HBc IgM.

                    3. positive anti-HBc IgG

                    4. positive HBV PCR

               8. Positive anti-hepatitis C (HCV) antibodies and a positive serum HCV RNA PCR. All
                  positive HCV antibody results must be assessed by an EIA assay and confirmed by
                  a quantitative serum HCV RNA assay. Participants with positive HCV antibodies
                  but undetectable serum HCV RNA may be considered for eligibility. Participants
                  with negative anti-HCV antibodies but unexplained liver enzyme abnormalities
                  must undergo a quantitative serum RNA assay to rule out false negative HCV
                  serologies.

               9. History of active tuberculosis (TB). All participants must demonstrate a
                  negative QuantiFERON® assay result within 52 weeks of transplant regardless of
                  PPD status. Participants with a positive QuantiFERON® (QFT) assay will not be
                  eligible for the study unless they have completed treatment for latent TB and
                  have a negative chest x-ray. QFT testing done within 52 weeks before transplant
                  is acceptable as long as there is documentation of the results.  Prior
                  recipients of a BCG vaccination are not exempt.

              10. Any active, severe local or systemic infection at the screening visit.

              11. Autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressive drugs for maintenance.

              12. Use of investigational drug, other than the study medications specified by the
                  protocol, within 30 days of transplantation.

              13. Receipt of a live vaccine within 30 days of receipt of study therapy.

              14. The presence of any medical condition that the Investigator deems incompatible
                  with participation in the trial.

          -  Donor participants who meet any of the following criteria will not be eligible for
             this study:

               1. History of type I or type II diabetes mellitus.

               2. History of severe cardiovascular disease, defined as New York Heart Association
                  Class III or IV2.

               3. History of blood product donation to recipient.

               4. History of positive HIV-1 or HIV-2 serology or nucleic acid test.

               5. Evidence of prior hepatitis B infection as evaluated by hepatitis B surface
                  antigen (HBsAg), total hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc IgM and IgG) and
                  hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBsAb).

                  Participants demonstrating any one of the following will be excluded:

                    1. positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or

                    2. positive anti-HBc IgM.

                    3. positive anti-HBc IgG

                    4. positive HBV PCR

               6. Positive anti-hepatitis C (HCV) antibodies and a positive serum HCV RNA PCR. All
                  positive HCV antibody results must be assessed by an EIA assay and confirmed by
                  a quantitative serum HCV RNA assay. Participants with positive HCV antibodies
                  but undetectable serum HCV RNA may be considered for eligibility. Participants
                  with negative anti-HCV antibodies but unexplained liver enzyme abnormalities
                  must undergo a quantitative serum RNA assay to rule out false negative HCV
                  serologies.

               7. Autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressive drugs for maintenance.

               8. The presence of any medical condition that the Investigator deems incompatible
                  with participation in the trial.
