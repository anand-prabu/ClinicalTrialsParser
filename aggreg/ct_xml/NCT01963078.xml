    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to use fMRI to investigate amygdala response to fearful faces in
      men and women with and without PTSD who have experienced childhood trauma. The study will
      also compare the effects of oxytocin and placebo on amygdala response, and explore the
      interaction of oxytocin plasma levels and amygdala response in men and women with and
      without PTSD who have experienced childhood trauma.

      Hypothesis 1: Amygdala responding will be greater in subjects with PTSD as compared to
      resilient subjects, and no sex differences in the magnitude of the response will be found.

      Hypothesis 2A: In response to OT, women will exhibit a greater reduction in amygdala
      responding than men.

      Hypothesis 2B: In response to OT, women with PTSD will exhibit a greater reduction in
      amygdala responding compared to women without PTSD.

      Hypothesis 3A: Women with PTSD will have lower levels of plasma OT as compared to men with
      PTSD, and women and men without PTSD.

      Hypothesis 3B: Plasma OT levels will be inversely correlated with amygdala responding to
      fearful faces in women but not in men.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Ages 18-50.

          2. Subjects must be able to provide informed consent and function at an intellectual
             level sufficient to allow accurate completion of all assessment instruments.

          3. Subjects scoring moderate to severe (&gt;3) on a minimum of one of the five trauma
             domains of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.

          4. Subjects must have experienced, witnessed, or confronted an event(s) that involved
             actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity
             of themselves, or others and the person's response involved intense fear,
             helplessness, and/or horror (Criterion A DSM-IV for PTSD), prior to the age of 18.

          5. Subjects must consent to the two study visits.  Each study visit includes an
             outpatient admission to the CTRC and an MRI scanning session.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Subjects with evidence of or a history of head trauma, neurological disorders,
             seizures, unconsciousness or any other major medical disorder.

          2. Subjects with a history of or current (past 90 days) psychotic disorder,
             substance-dependence except for nicotine dependence, or bipolar affective disorder.

          3. Subjects with any psychoactive substance abuse within the last 30 days as evidenced
             by subject report or urine drug screen.

          4. Women who are pregnant or nursing.

          5. Women who are post-menopausal or have had a full hysterectomy.

          6. Subjects who have a BMI greater than 35.

          7. Subjects who are unwilling to maintain abstinence from alcoholand caffeine for the
             24-hour period prior to the study visits and from illicit drug use for the 72 hour
             period prior to study visits.

          8. Persons with ferrous metal implants or pacemaker.

          9. Subjects who are claustrophobic.

         10. Subjects taking psychotropic, endocrine or cardiovascular medications (other than
             blood pressure medications) during the 30-day period prior to the study. Subjects who
             have been free of psychotropic medications at least (the greater of) of 30 days or 5
             half-lives prior to the study visits will be included.

         11. Subjects who have been in evidence-based treatment for PTSD within the 6 months prior
             to the study visits.

         12. Subjects with a postive breathalyzer or urine drug screen. Group - Specific
             Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Individuals with PTSD Inclusion Criteria

        1. Subjects must meet DSM-IV criteria for current (i.e. last 6 months) PTSD. 2. Subjects
        must have a CAPS total score of â‰¥50. 3. Subjects may also meet criteria for a mood
        disorder (except bipolar affective disorder, see Exclusion Criteria) or other anxiety
        disorders (panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, or
        obsessive compulsive disorder).  The inclusion of subjects with affective and other
        anxiety disorders is essential because of the marked frequency of the co-existence of mood
        and other anxiety disorders among patients with PTSD (Brady, Killeen, Brewerton, &amp;
        Lucerini, 2000; Kessler, Chiu, Demler, Merikangas, &amp; Walters, 2005).

        Exclusion Criteria

        1. As above. Resilient Controls Inclusion Criteria

        1. As above. Exclusion Criteria

        1. Subjects meeting criteria for current or past (i.e. last 90 days) Axis I mood or
        anxiety disorders (including PTSD and depression).
