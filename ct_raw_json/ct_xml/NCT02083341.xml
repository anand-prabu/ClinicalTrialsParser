  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) is a disabling voice disorder which causes severe voice
      change, neck pain, and voice fatigue. Current therapy modalities to treat these disorders
      include multiple visits to a qualified speech language pathologist (SLP) for rehabilitation
      with voice exercises and focused laryngeal/neck massage. Access to these services is
      difficult with long waitlists and often not covered by current public health insurance or
      locally available to many patients in Ontario. The goal of this study is to demonstrate a
      reduction in symptoms and improvement in vocal function by applying an external vibration
      device to key sites (e.g. jaw, neck, skull base) commonly identified as a source of abnormal
      muscle tension and injury in certain voice disorders, specifically MTD.

      This study will also investigate the effect of external vibration on the voice quality in
      classically trained singers (CTSs). Certain desirable acoustic qualities in a singers' voice
      are only accessible when the larynx and its extrinsic muscles are in a relaxed state. Muscle
      misuse and vocal strain are common problems in performers, which can result in conditions
      that require surgery and speech therapy, and may lead to a loss of income. Similar to vocal
      warm up exercises which contribute to the prevention of vocal injury, external vibration is
      expected to improve muscle perfusion in an acute setting and may have a direct effect on
      vocal fold cover viscosity.

      Both study groups will be randomized to receive either the external vibration device or a
      sham device. The sham device looks identical to the experimental device but has the
      vibration component removed.
