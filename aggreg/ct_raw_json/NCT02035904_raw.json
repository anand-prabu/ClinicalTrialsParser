Intralesional catheter is placed at the end of\n      surgery. In the first 24 postoperative hours we provide continuous wound infusion with\n      levobupivacaine 0,25% 5ml/h with morphine Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) when NRS >4.\n      From the second postoperative day morphine PCA is removed  and patients are randomized to\n      receive levobupivacaine 0,25% or saline, released with 5 ml boluses and lock-out of 2 hours,\n      with rescue analgesia with tramadol 37,5 mg + acetaminophen 325 mg oral fix combination\n      (Patrol). Intralesional catheter is taken off 14 days after surgical intervention or after\n      36 hours of non-use.\n\n      Pain evaluation (NRS at rest and movement) and oral rescue doses consumption are performed;\n      pain physicians also care about any catheter-related or drug-related side effect,\n      registering number of total boluses. Patients are provided with a home diary for pain scores\n      to be filled and brought back when surgical visit is performed. A phone interview at 1 and 3\n      month is performed to investigate pain chronicization.\n\n      Surgical evaluation is provided, also to establish any catheter-related infective or healing\n      complication.\n\n      Physiatric evaluation before the intervention and 1 and 3 months is provided to ensure\n      rehabilitation process.\n\n      A validated questionnaire (short form 36/ SF-36) must be filled by all patients, to\n      understand differences in return to a normal quality of life and to social activities\n      between the two groups."
