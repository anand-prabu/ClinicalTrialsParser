      The objective of the PLATFORM Study is to compare clinical outcomes, resource utilization,
      and quality of life (QOL) of FFRCT-guided evaluation versus standard practice evaluation in
      patients with suspected CAD in order to further inform patients, health care providers, and
      other stakeholders about which technologies are most effective and efficient in the
      diagnosis of CAD

      The OVERALL OBJECTVE of this post-market, multicenter, longitudinal, prospective,
      consecutive cohort study is to compare clinical outcomes, resource utilization, and quality
      of life (QOL) in subjects receiving standard practice evaluation and treatment versus
      subjects receiving FFRCT-guided evaluation and treatment in subjects with suspected CAD in
      order to further inform patients, health care providers, and other stakeholders about which
      technologies are most effective and efficient in the diagnosis of CAD. Cohort 1 of this
      study will assess outcomes incorporating standard practice evaluation and Cohort 2 will
      assess outcomes incorporating FFRCT-guided evaluation. Each Cohort will be further
      delineated based upon initial presentation, whereas subjects presenting for initial
      non-invasive testing will be designated as Cohorts 1A and 2A; and subjects already referred
      for ICA will be designated as Cohorts 1B and 2B.

      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES for sequential cohort comparisons:

        1. To compare the rate of ICA documenting non-obstructive coronary artery disease,
           clinical outcomes, and QOL following standard practice for diagnostic and treatment
           planning modalities in Cohort 1 versus incorporating FFRCT as the preferred test to
           guide further invasive management and medical treatment in Cohort 2;

        2. To compare resource utilization following standard practice for diagnostic and
           treatment pathways in Cohort 1 versus incorporating FFRCT as the preferred test to
           guide further invasive management and medical treatment in Cohort 2;

        3. To provide supporting data for generating new guidelines for diagnosis and prognosis of
           CAD with comparative analysis of the risk stratification with the Updated
           Diamond-Forrester risk model (UDF);

        4. To provide society including patients, health care providers and other stakeholders
           with information about which diagnostic technologies are most effective and efficient
           in managing patients with CAD.

    <arm_group_label>Cohort 1 - Standard of Care</arm_group_label>
    <description>Subjects will be referred for non-invasive and/or invasive testing and evaluation. Prior to treatment of each subject considered for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and/or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), the investigator and the institution's heart team will review clinical data and results of the diagnostic tests to recommend a treatment strategy, according to the institution's standard practice. Cohort 1 of the study is an observational evaluation of resource utilization and outcomes based on standard practice for diagnosis and treatment of subjects with symptomatic suspected CAD and intermediate likelihood of obstructive CAD. Subjects will be followed for one year after enrollment.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Cohort 2 - FFRCT-guided</arm_group_label>
    <description>Subjects will be referred for non-invasive and/or invasive testing and evaluation. Prior to treatment of subjects considered for PCI and/or CABG, the investigator and the institution's heart team will review the results of all available diagnostic tests, including cCTA and FFRCT, and will recommend a treatment strategy accordingly. FFRCT is a non-invasive method to evaluate the hemodynamic significance of coronary artery lesions. FFRCT calculates FFR from subject-specific cCTA data using computational fluid dynamics under rest and simulated maximal coronary hyperemic conditions.  FFRCT values range between 0 and 1, and values â‰¤0.80 are considered hemodynamically (HD)-significant.</description>
