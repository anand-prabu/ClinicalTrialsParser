            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of fludeoxyglucose F 18\n      (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in detecting metastatic disease in patients\n      with stage III or IV melanoma considered for operative management based on the currently\n      accepted diagnostic work up including CT imaging. II. Determine how often the clinical\n      management of these patients is altered based on FDG PET imaging findings in addition to CT\n      scan results.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are required to fast for a minimum of 6 hours prior to positron emission\n      tomography (PET) imaging. Fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) is administered IV over 15 minutes\n      followed 50-60 minutes later by whole body PET imaging. Iodinated contrast dye is\n      administered by IV injection and by mouth followed by CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and\n      pelvis within 2 weeks of PET imaging. Whole body FDG PET imaging and CT imaging of the\n      chest, abdomen, and pelvis are repeated at 6 months. Initial positive PET or CT imaging\n      results are verified based on surgical and/or biopsy findings or clinical follow-up.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years."
