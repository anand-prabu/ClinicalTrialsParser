Giving growth hormone may\n      help girls with Turner's syndrome attain a more normal height. It is not yet known if growth\n      hormone is more effective with or without oxandrolone for Turner's syndrome.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of oxandrolone in girls who\n      have growth hormone-treated Turner's syndrome."

Treatment continues for 3 years; estrogen is offered after year 2.\n\n      A study duration of 8 years is anticipated."
