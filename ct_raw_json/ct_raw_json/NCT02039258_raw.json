Approximately 24 healthy adult participants will be enrolled to\n      ensure that at least 20 complete the study.\n\n      After a screening period, participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment\n      sequences (AB or BA) on Day 1 of Period 1. Treatment A means a participant will receive a\n      single 150/1,000 mg CANA/MET XR FDC tablet under fasted conditions, and Treatment B means\n      that a participant will receive the same drug under fed conditions. Participants will need\n      to remain at the study center for 4 days (72 hours postdose) after the drug administration\n      for collection of blood samples in each treatment period. There will be a 10- to 14-day\n      washout period between Period 1 and Period 2. On Day 4 (72 hours postdose) of Period 2, when\n      participants are discharged from the study center, they will be given instructions to return\n      for a follow-up visit 7 to 10 days later. For Treatment B (in fed state), participants will\n      be provided with a standardized high-fat breakfast. Participants' safety will be monitored\n      throughout the study."
