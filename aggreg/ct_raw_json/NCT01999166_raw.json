The patient's medical records\n      will be reviewed, a personal and family history will be taken, and a physical examination\n      will be done. Two procedures may be done including blood sampling (which will be used for\n      DNA (genetic) studies) and X-rays (to define osteoarthritis grade).\n\n      If no known mutations responsible for osteoarthritis will be detected, participating family\n      members will be interviewed by telephone about their personal and family health history and\n      will have a blood sample drawn for DNA testing, and X-rays."
