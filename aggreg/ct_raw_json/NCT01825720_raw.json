Glucose-Insulin-Potassium(GIK) has been constantly used as an\n      adjuvant therapy in patients with myocardial infarction or in the patients undergoing\n      valvular heart surgery to reduce the low cardiac output syndrome and mortality. GIK is known\n      to prevent excretion of lactate and to increase the extraction of lactate after reperfusion\n      with various mechanism. In addition, it is also known to decrease ischemic-reperfusion\n      injury of myocardium after CPB, to improve myocardial contractility, insulin resistance and\n      hyperglucemia. As a result, it brings hemodynamic stability and sufficient oxygen supply to\n      the tissue, which might reduce the incidence of hyperlactatemia after valvular heart\n      surgery."
