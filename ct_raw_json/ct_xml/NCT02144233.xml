  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint will be the average change in pain score from baseline to the three-
      and six-month assessments. Efficacy will be demonstrated by superior pain relief with the
      active treatment compared with the placebo.

    <textblock>
      -  The cause of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders (TMD) remains unknown and therapy
           is usually empirical. Systematic reviews have concluded that currently there is no
           evidence that occlusal adjustment has any therapeutic or preventive effect on
           temporomandibular disorders. However, these reviews also indicate that evidence to the
           contrary has not been provided and that more research is needed to elucidate whether
           there is any benefit of occlusal adjustment treatment for TMD. The risk factors for
           chronic unilateral TMD include a steeper condylar path, flatter lateral anterior
           guidance, and habitual chewing on the affected side. Consequently, a new occlusal
           therapy is proposed to restore the physiological jaw closure and masticatory function.

        -  The primary end point of the trial is to assess the efficacy of the new occlusal
           therapy on the affected side TMD pain, and the maximum mouth opening. Efficacy is
           demonstrated by showing significantly superior pain relief and increasing maximum mouth
           opening (when it was limited) with the active treatment compared with placebo.

      Phase III, single center, randomized, parallel-group, single-blind with blinded assessment,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial.

        -  A linear mixed model will be performed for comparisons of most variables and a logistic
           regression model will be used to measure the probability/risk of change on the chewing
           side between baseline and six months; in addition, McNemar's test may be used.

        -  Interim analysis plan and stopping rules. The study will employ an interim analysis
           plan with a single interim analysis after 70% of participants have completed the
           six-month follow-up visit. Using the Lan-DeMets version of the O'Brien-Fleming stopping
           rule, the critical value for statistical significance at the interim analysis (under
           both intention-to-treat and per-protocol sets) will be +2.438, corresponding to a
           nominal two-sided P value of 0.0146.
