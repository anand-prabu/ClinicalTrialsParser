Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients with stage I or II non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), no baseline lactate dehydrogenase\n      (LDH) elevation, baseline WHO performance status 0-1, and longest tumor diameter of less\n      than 5 cm, who achieve partial response (PR) or complete response (CR), receive 1 additional\n      course of chemotherapy. Patients then undergo involved-field radiotherapy once daily 5 days\n      a week for 3.5-4 weeks.\n\n      Patients with stage I or II NHL, a baseline LDH elevation, and/or baseline WHO performance\n      status 2-4, and/or longest tumor diameter of at least 5 cm, who achieve PR or CR, receive 3\n      additional courses of chemotherapy. Patients then undergo involved-field radiotherapy once\n      daily 5 days a week for 3.5-4 weeks.\n\n      Patients with stage III or IV NHL who achieve CR or PR receive 3 additional courses of\n      chemotherapy. Patients then undergo consolidative radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for\n      2.5-3 weeks.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after the third chemotherapy course, at the end of\n      chemotherapy, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 29-56 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
