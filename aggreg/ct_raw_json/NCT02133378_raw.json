The investigators compared such\n      hemostatic agent (Hemopatch; Baxter Inc, Deerfield, IL) with traditional optimized\n      hemostasis routine.\n\n      Following sample size calculation, in a prospective randomized study design, 100 patients\n      will be treated with Hemopatch and 100 patients will receive traditional optimized\n      hemostasis routine (comparison group).\n\n      To make the two cohorts as comparable as possible  enrollment will be restricted to\n      moderately bleeding vascular anastomosis of Dacron grafts to ascending aorta or moderately\n      bleeding transversal aortotomy.\n\n      Study endpoints are the following: rate of successful intraoperative hemostasis (identified\n      by cessation of bleeding in less than 3 minutes from application) and time required for\n      hemostasis; overall postoperative bleeding; rate of transfusion of blood products; rate of\n      surgical revision for bleeding; postoperative morbidity; and intensive care unit stay."
