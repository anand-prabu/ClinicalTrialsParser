            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      During recent years, cancer-testis (CT) antigens (CTA), particularly those encoded by genes\n      on the X chromosome (CT-X genes), have emerged as attractive targets for cancer\n      immunotherapy. Whereas malignancies of diverse histologies express a variety of CTAs, immune\n      responses to these proteins appear uncommon in cancer patients, possibly due to low-level,\n      heterogeneous antigen expression, as well as immunosuppressive regulatory T cells present\n      within tumor sites and systemic circulation of these individuals. Conceivably, vaccination\n      of cancer patients with tumor cells expressing high levels of CTAs in combination with\n      regimens that deplete or inhibit T regulatory cells will induce broad immunity to these\n      antigens. In order to examine this issue, patients with primary lung and esophageal cancers,\n      pleural mesotheliomas, thoracic sarcomas, thymic neoplasms and mediastinal germ cell tumors,\n      as well as sarcomas, melanomas, germ cell tumors, or epithelial malignancies metastatic to\n      lungs, pleura or mediastinum with no evidence of disease (NED) or minimal residual disease\n      (MRD) following standard multidisciplinary therapy will be vaccinated with H1299 tumor cell\n      lysates with Iscomatrix    adjuvant. Vaccines will be administered with or without\n      metronomic oral cyclophosphamide (50 mg PO BID x 7d q 14d), and celecoxib (400 mg PO BID).\n      Serologic responses to a variety of recombinant CTAs as well as immunologic responses to\n      autologous tumor or epigenetically modified autologous EBVtransformed lymphocytes will be\n      assessed before and after a six month vaccination period.\n\n      Primary Objectives:\n\n      1. To assess the frequency of immunologic responses to CTAs in patients with thoracic\n      malignancies following vaccinations with H1299 cell lysate/Iscomatrix(TM) vaccines alone in\n      comparison to patients with thoracic malignancies following vaccinations with H1299 cell\n      lysate/Iscomatrix    vaccines in combination with metronomic cyclophosphamide and celecoxib.\n\n      Secondary Objectives:\n\n        1. To examine if oral metronomic cyclophosphamide and celecoxib therapy diminishes the\n           number and percentage of T regulatory cells and diminishes activity of these cells in\n           patients with thoracic malignancies are at risk of recurrence.\n\n        2.

Pre and post\n           vaccination serologic and cell mediated responses to a standard panel of CT antigens as\n           well as autologous tumor cells (if available) and EBV-transformed lymphocytes will be\n           assessed before and after vaccination.\n\n        -  Numbers/percentages and function of T regulatory cells in peripheral blood will be\n           assessed before, during, and after vaccinations.\n\n        -  Patients will be followed in the clinic with routine staging scans until disease\n           recurrence.\n\n        -  The trial will randomize 28 evaluable patients per arm to either receive vaccine alone\n           or vaccine plus chemotherapy in order to have 80% power to determine if the frequency\n           of immune responses on the combination arm exceeds that of the vaccine alone arm, if\n           the expected frequencies of immune responses on the two arms were 20% and 50%, using a\n           one-sided 0.10 alpha level Fisher   s exact test.\n\n        -  Approximately 60 patients will be accrued to this trial."
