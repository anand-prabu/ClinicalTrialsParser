  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MOST is a phase II trial conducted in adult patients with an advanced solid tumor in
      progression after at least 1 prior treatment regimen. The study aims to assess whether a
      12-week treatment with a targeted therapy selected based on the alteration(s) detected in
      the tumor is sufficient to stabilize the disease compared with a longer treatment, for all
      patients presenting this alteration, regardless of the primary disease site or cancer type.
      All the targeted therapies administered in MOST study already obtained a marketing
      authorization (MA) but will be evaluated in indications other than those defined in their
      MA.

      Each patient enrolled will receive the matching targeted therapy during 12 weeks (induction
      treatment). At the end of this period:

        -  patients with a tumor response will continue the targeted therapy,

        -  patients in progression will discontinue the targeted therapy and will be withdrawn
           from study and oriented towards standard treatments

        -  patients with a stable disease at 12 weeks will be randomized in order to determine if
           they continue or stop the targeted therapy.

      About 80 patients will be treated in each of the 5 treatment groups opened to enrollment,
      each group corresponding to an available targeted therapy.

    <description>Targeted treatment received during induction period will be discontinued until a first radiologically-documented off-treatment disease progression occurs (according to RECIST 1.1). At progression, treatment reintroduction may be proposed to the patient (left at the investigator's appreciation, and upon patient approval) and treatment may be continued until on-treatment disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or for a maximum of 136 weeks from the date of patient's first study drug intake following inclusion. If the investigator considers that the treatment cannot be safely reintroduced (regarding patient's condition and/or laboratory results), the patient will be withdrawn from study.</description>

          -  Life expectancy of at least 4 months

          -  Specific toxicities related to any prior anti-cancer therapy must have resolved to
