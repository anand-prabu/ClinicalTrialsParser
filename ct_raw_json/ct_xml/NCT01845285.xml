    <textblock>
      The purpose of this postmarket Registry is to assess the standard of care and clinical
      outcomes of the Direct Flow Medical Transcatheter Aortic Valve System used in clinical
      routine according to the approved commercial indications. Procedures and assessments
      required by this registry are generally considered standard of care for Transcatheter Aortic
      Valve Replacement patients.

      Evaluation criteria will be the incidence of mortality/morbidity and adverse events clinical
      performance, and hemodynamic performance of the DEVICE via ultrasound (echo) and
      angiographic imaging.

      The patient population will include patients who are candidates for transcatheter aortic
      valve replacement (TAVR). According to routine practice, the heart team (interventional
      cardiologist and cardiothoracic surgeon) makes a choice to use the Direct Flow Medical
      Aortic Valve System, compared to other available TAVR prostheses, on the basis of clinical
      and surgical considerations. Therefore, the valve is implanted when the heart team decides
      that this product is best suited to the specific patient.

      In order to be enrolled in this Registry, the patient must be a candidate for the
      implantation of the Direct Flow Medical Transcatheter Aortic Valve System, based on the
      commercial indications as stated in the Instructions for Use.

      Therefore, candidates for this study must meet the following criteria (Indications for Use):

        1. Age &gt; 70 years old

        2. Severe aortic valve stenosis determined by echocardiogram and Doppler:

             -  mean gradient &gt;40 mmHg or peak jet velocity &gt;4.0 m/s

             -  aortic valve area ≤0.8 cm2 or aortic valve area index ≤0.5 cm2/m2 All the Registry
                clinical evaluations and tests performed are generally considered standard of care
                for TAVR patients. When these recommendations conflict with the standard of care
                at the Registry site, the standard of care should prevail. In addition to the
                standard of care, the Sponsor recommends one brief additional evaluation (the
                EQ-5D quality of life measure) be conducted. Failure to perform this evaluation
                shall not be considered a protocol deviation.

      Baseline Clinical Evaluation

        -  Medical History and Physical Exam

        -  12 lead ECG and Arrhythmia Assessment

        -  Logistic EuroSCORE/STS Score

        -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional status

        -  Modified Rankin Score Assessment (mRS)

        -  EQ-5D Quality of Life measure

        -  Current Cardiac Medications Baseline Imaging Studies

        -  Transthoracic Echo (TTE)

        -  CT Scan (ECG triggered, contrast enhanced)

        -  Aorto-Iliac Angiogram:

             1. Peripheral Evaluation

             2. Coronary Evaluation

        -  Chest X-Ray

      All patients will have clinical follow-up at hospital discharge, 30 days, 12 months and
      annually to 3 years and undergo the following evaluations:

        -  Physical Exam

        -  12 lead ECG and Arrhythmia Assessment

        -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional status

        -  Modified Rankin Score Assessment (mRS) if symptomatic for stroke

        -  EQ-5D Quality of Life measure

        -  Current Cardiac Medications

        -  Transthoracic echo (TTE) Patients in whom the heart team has planned to use the Direct
           Flow Medical Transcatheter Aortic Valve System valve, are informed of the DISCOVER
           Registry and their consent to participate is required. This study intends to monitor
           the clinical condition of the patient for a period of 3 years after the operation. By
           agreeing to participate, the patient agrees to undergo clinical assessments and
           specific tests at certain intervals (prior to the procedure; during the implantation;
           at hospital discharge, at 30 days after the procedure, and at 1 year, 2 and 3 years
           later); the patient also agrees to the collection of these daThe purpose of this
           Registry is to monitor outcomes data for the Direct Flow Medical Transcatheter Aortic
           Valve System in the Post Market phase.  The primary outcome of interest is freedom from
           all-cause mortality at 30 days. The results from the pivotal CE mark study (IP 010)
           yielded a 30 day freedom from all-cause mortality rate of 97%.  Should the &quot;true&quot; rate
           be 97%, then N=250 patients would provide an estimate of the rate with a margin of
           error of 2%, with 95% confidence.
