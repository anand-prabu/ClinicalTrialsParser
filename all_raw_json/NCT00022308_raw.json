Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy and radiation\n      therapy in treating patients who have locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer."

Determine the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan when administered with\n      cisplatin and radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma.\n      II. Determine the toxic effects, especially acute and long-term esophagitis and pneumonitis,\n      of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the response rate, duration to\n      progression, and sites of relapse in patients treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of irinotecan. Patients receive\n      irinotecan IV over 90 minutes and cisplatin over 1 hour on day 1. Patients also undergo\n      radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 7 days for 7 courses in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive\n      escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD\n      is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience\n      dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 3 months for\n      1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-27 patients will be accrued for this study within 3\n      years."
