      This study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PKs) of raltegravir (RAL) given to
      HIV-1-exposed newborns at high risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection. (Pharmacokinetics  are the
      various interactions between a drug and the body.) This study will also evaluate the
      appropriate dose of RAL to give to an infant to prevent the infant from getting HIV
      infection from its mother.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Significant progress has been made in the use of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs for the
      prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV, but new pediatric HIV infections
      continue. If the diagnosis of HIV infection in a pregnant woman goes unrecognized and ARVs
      have not been used during pregnancy and labor, ARVs can be used to lower the risk of HIV
      transmission to the infant. However, it is important to develop new and more effective
      regimens for post-birth PMTCT.

      The integrase inhibitor raltegravir (RAL ) has the potential to play an important role in
      both the prevention  and treatment of HIV in infants at high risk of HIV-1 infection. This
      study will evaluate the safety and PKs  of RAL given to HIV-1-exposed newborns at high risk
      of acquiring HIV-1 infection. The study also seeks to determine the appropriate dosing
      regimen of RAL that can be safely given to newborns and infants in the first 6 weeks of
      life.

      The study will enroll 50 mother-infant pairs from the time of delivery through 48 hours of
      life. Mothers will be followed until discharge from the labor and delivery unit, and infants
      will be followed for 24 weeks after birth.

      Newborns will be assigned non-randomly to 1 of 2 cohorts. A minimum of 12 newborns will be
      enrolled into Cohort 1. These newborns will receive RAL as oral granules for suspension as a
      single dose within 48 hours of birth, in addition to standard of care ARV drugs for PMTCT,
      and a second dose of RAL at 7 to 10 days of life. All newborns in Cohort 1 will undergo a
      medical history, physical exam, and blood draw at entry and at the Day 3 to 4, Day 7 to 10,
      Week 2, Week 6, and Week 24 study visits. Cohort 1 newborns will have 3 PK samplings: an
      intensive PK at the time of the first dose, a random PK at Day 3 to 4, and a limited PK at
      the time of dose 2.

      All data from Cohort 1 will be reviewed and analyzed before any participants are enrolled
      into Cohort 2. Based on ongoing analyses of PK data and safety information, dosing may be
      modified.

      A minimum of 20 newborns will be enrolled into Cohort 2. These newborns will receive daily
      RAL starting within 48 hours of birth for 6 weeks, in addition to standard of care ARV for
      PMTCT. After analyses of PK and safety data from Cohort 1 (as well as ongoing analyses),
      dosing frequency in this cohort may be changed from once to twice daily, and dosing (amount)
      may also be changed. All newborns in Cohort 2 will undergo a medical history, physical exam,
      and blood draw at all study visits. Study visits will occur at entry, Day 3 to 4, Day 14,
      Day 28, Week 6, Week 8 to 10, and Week 24. Cohort 2 newborns will have four PK samplings: a
      random PK sample at Day 3 to 4, intensive PK samplings at Day 14 and Day 28, and a random PK
      sampling at Week 6.
