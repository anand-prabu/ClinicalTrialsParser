  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with endothelial dysfunction and the development
      of cardiovascular disease. It is unclear how OSA results in endothelial dysfunction, but
      given the association between OSA and obesity, adipose-derived hormones (adipokines) are
      likely to be involved. Leptin, an adipokine upregulated in patients with OSA, has been shown
      to be associated with deleterious effects on vascular function resulting in impaired
      endothelial function. This proposal is directed at investigating the molecular mechanisms of
      endothelial dysfunction in OSA patients.  We hypothesize that endothelial dysfunction
      associated with OSA is a result of molecular alterations within endothelial cells. As a part
      of these studies we will look at NO signaling pathways in adipose tissue and microvessels
      from normal and OSA subjects.

    <description>Endothelial function test - Arterial endothelial function will be assessed non-invasively by ultrasound examination of the arterial endothelium dependent vasodilation response to reactive hyperemia. The right brachial artery, proximal to the antecubital fossa, will be imaged longitudinally using a linear-array transducer. Flow-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilation will be assessed by measuring the brachial artery diameter at baseline and during reactive hyperemia. Reactive hyperemia will be induced by deflating a cuff previously inflated to 200 mmHg for 5 minutes in the forearm. Variables will be measured for three consecutive cardiac cycles and the average will be taken.</description>
