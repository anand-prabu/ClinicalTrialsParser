Patients\n      are stratified according to histology (non-small cell lung cancer vs small cell lung\n      cancer), and type of treatment (radiotherapy vs radiotherapy and non-cisplatin-containing\n      chemotherapy vs radiotherapy and cisplatin-containing chemotherapy). Patients are randomized\n      to one of two treatment arms.\n\n      All patients undergo thoracic radiotherapy beginning on week 1 and continuing for a total of\n      5-7 weeks.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral megestrol once daily beginning within the first 3 days of\n           radiotherapy and continuing until 12 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily beginning within the first 3 days of\n           radiotherapy and continuing until 12 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy.\n\n      In both arms, quality of life is assessed at baseline, at the completion of radiotherapy,\n      and at 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 and 8 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 98 patients (49 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
