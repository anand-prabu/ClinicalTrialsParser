        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is currently enrolled in a Novartis-sponsored, Oncology Clinical Development
             &amp; Medical Affairs study receiving imatinib and has fulfilled all their requirements
             in the parent study. 2.Patient is currently benefiting from the treatment with
             imatinib, as determined by the investigator. 3. Patient has demonstrated compliance,
             as assessed by the investigator, with the parent study protocol requirements.4.
             Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans and any
             other study procedures. 5. Written informed consent obtained prior to enrolling in
             roll-over study.

             Exclusion Criteria:

               -  1. Patient has been permanently discontinued from imatinib treatment in the
                  parent study due to unacceptable toxicity, non-compliance to study procedures,
                  withdrawal of consent or any other reason.

          2. Patient has participated in a Novartis sponsored combination trial where imatinib was
             dispensed in combination with another study medication and patient is still receiving
             combination therapy.

          3. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive hcG laboratory test.

          4. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             during the study and for 30 days after the final dose of imatinib. Male patients must
             use highly effective contraception during the study and for 30 days after the final
             dose of imatinib.

        Highly effective contraception is defined as either:

          -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
             post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

          -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
             hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In
             case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been
             confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.

          -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to enrolling). For female patients on the
             study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.

          -  Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c, or b+c):

               1. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other
                  forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate
                  &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.

               2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

               3. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository
                  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they
                  have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have
                  had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal
                  ligation at least six weeks prior to enrolling. In the case of oophorectomy
                  alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by
                  follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing
                  potential.

        If a study patient becomes pregnant or suspects being pregnant during the study or within
        30 days after the final dose of imatinib, the investigator needs to be informed
        immediately and ongoing study treatment with imatinib has to be stopped
