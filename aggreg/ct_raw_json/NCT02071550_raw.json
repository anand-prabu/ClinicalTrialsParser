Sensors of INVOS and FORESIGHT devices were placed on the\n      right side forehead region. Totally 11 evaluation periods were formed, respectively:\n      Pre-induction (1st Period), post-induction (2nd period), abdominal insufflation outset (3rd\n      period): post-insufflation 5-minute intervals (4th, 5th, 6th, 7th 8th period), end of\n      insufflation (9th period), end of operation (10th period) and end of anaesthesia (11th\n      period). While one of the groups was not applied PEEP(ZEEP), the other group was applied 10\n      cmH2O simultaneously with the abdominal insufflation proceeding. Demographic data,\n      hemodynamic values and rSO2 values were recorded for both groups at all 11 periods."
