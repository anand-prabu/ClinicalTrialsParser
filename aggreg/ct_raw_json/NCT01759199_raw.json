However, the realization of\n      the 6MWT requires a 30m-long corridor, according to the American Thoracic Society\n      Guidelines. Lack of sufficient space can prevent the realization of 6MWT, especially for\n      private practitioner pulmonologists, and also in hospitals. The six-minute stepper test\n      (ST6) which can be performed in a normal room, should be an interesting alternative."
