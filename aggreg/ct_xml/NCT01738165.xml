  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to collect data on the safety and effectiveness of  the
      KineSpring System in patients with primarily unicompartmental medial knee osteoarthritis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The KineSpring System is indicated to treat symptoms of pain and loss of knee function in
      patients with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis or post-traumatic osteoarthritis in the medial
      compartment of the knee. The KineSpring System is indicated for patients with osteoarthritis
      of severity that does not require knee joint replacement.
