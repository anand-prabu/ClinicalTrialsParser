The program, \"Nutrition Navigation on-Line Edge,\" or NnoLEDGE, will be used\n      by community consortiums for weight loss and diabetic health interventions within their\n      communities.\n\n      The Specific Aims are:\n\n        1. Recruitment of local community organizations to participate as a community health\n           consortium\n\n        2. Development of a comprehensive community health web portal consisting of a web portal,\n           impediment profiler, community toolbox, and rewards system\n\n        3. Final evaluation of the system with regard to participants' attitudes and perceptions\n           of using NnoLEDGE as a tool for weight control and diabetes prevention to determine\n           feasibility."
