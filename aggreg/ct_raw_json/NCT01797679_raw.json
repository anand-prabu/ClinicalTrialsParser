The main purpose in this component of the study is to evaluate the efficacy\n      of aerobic exercise and strength training on the T2 and T1 rho relaxation times of the\n      articular cartilage. It has been proven that exercise can improve function and reduce the\n      need for analgesics in patients with osteoarthritis. With this study, we wish to investigate\n      if different kinds of exercise can cause measurable improvements in T2 and T1 rho relaxation\n      times of the articular cartilage, and also if this improvements are transient or permanent."
