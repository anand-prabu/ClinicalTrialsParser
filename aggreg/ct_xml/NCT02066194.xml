  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has evolved to become an important diagnostic tool and its
      interventional role is rapidly expanding. In order to improve patient's comfort and
      satisfaction during and after procedure, the use of sedation is usually recommended.
      However, sedation may be associated with serious adverse events of including hypotension,
      aspiration and respiratory depression. Moreover, the cost of performing the procedure would
      be increased due to the costs of the medications and the need of additional personnel in
      monitoring of the patient. As a result, the drive to seek alternative and safer approaches
      of pain-relief during EUS is ever present. Electroacupuncture (EA) has been used in
      Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for more than 2000 years. The benefits and success of EA
      in treatment of acute and chronic pain of various origins have been well-recognised. Many
      researches have been performed to address the role of EA in treating pain and anxiety during
      OGD and colonoscopy. However, only limited data is availabe in the Chinese and the Western
      literature concerning the use of EA in EUS. Therefore it is worthwhile to conduct a
      well-designed study to evaluate the role of EA in treating pain during EUS.
