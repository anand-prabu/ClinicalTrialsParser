            "textblock": "This proposal is in response to RFA-AA-12-008, Evaluation of NIAAA's Alcohol Screening Guide\n      for Children and Adolescents. Of particular interest to the agency are evaluation of the\n      Screener in clinical and/or other settings to predict alcohol-related consequences including\n      use disorder; its use as an initial screen for drug use, cigarette smoking, conduct\n      disorder, and unprotected sex; and its performance in making predictions concurrently and\n      prospectively. This proposal targets these areas of interest. In addition, the investigators\n      will study implementation of the Brief Intervention (BI) associated with the Screener. There\n      is a great need for both screening and BI in juvenile probation settings as many of these\n      youths have great need but are underserved.Many probation departments are turning to BI to\n      work with probationers and parolees. Screening and BI has demonstrated efficacy in these\n      settings, and yet no randomized control trials have been conducted to evaluate effectiveness\n      in juvenile probation settings. Probation Officers (POs; n=40) are randomized to Screener\n      (S), Screener+BI (SBI), or coaching (CSBI). Youths (N=1000) are randomized to 1 of these 3\n      conditions, and all receive usual services (US). US consist of regular check-in with PO and\n      access to referral services as needed (counseling, academic tutoring, etc.). Research\n      staffers conduct in-depth assessment at baseline, 6- and 12- months. Sensitivity,\n      specificity, and positive and negative predictive powers (SN, SP, PP, NP) are calculated to\n      predict alcohol risk and consequences, as well as other risky behaviors concurrently and\n      prospectively across age-groups. A 1-way design (S vs SBI vs CSBI) will be used to determine\n      whether SBI and CSBI enhance youth services-use and reduce risks (e.g., alcohol use, risky\n      sex). We examine moderators of outcomes (youth age, PO characteristics) and whether coaching\n      (an important consideration in implementation science) in use of BI improves outcomes. This\n      study will be the first randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of SBI in a\n      juvenile probation setting."
