We will examine the patient's history, perform lung and heart auscultation, and obtain a blood pressure in order to ensure the patient has no contraindications to using Definity\u00ae. If there are no contraindications, routine ocular ultrasonography, both A and B scans, will be performed using an Ellex Eye Cubed ultrasound machine. Definity\u00ae will be prepared per package instruction and the dose calculated according to the following formula:\nPatient weight (kg) X 10 microliters = Definity\u00ae dose\nIf necessary, a second 10 microliter/kg dose may be give 30 minutes after the first IV injection"

It is contraindicated for use in patients with pulmonary hypertension,\n      unstable cardiopulmonary conditions, and cardiac shunts (right-to-left, bi-directional, or\n      transient right-to left).  After informed consent is obtained, a cardiologist  will examine\n      the patient's history, perform lung and heart auscultation, and obtain a blood pressure in\n      order to ensure the patient has no contraindications to using Definity\u00ae.

After that, Definity\u00ae\n           will be administered as a slow IV bolus followed by a normal saline 10cc flush.
