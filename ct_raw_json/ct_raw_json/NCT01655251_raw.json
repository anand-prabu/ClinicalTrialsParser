Parents\n      assigned to the video group watched the DVD in the emergency department (ED) and take it\n      home along with the written instructions.  At 72 hours both groups received a phone call\n      asking whether they returned to the ED and the usefulness of discharge instructions (DVD\n      and/or written).  Critically ill children and those with chronic medical conditions were\n      excluded.   The primary outcome is a return ED visit for fever confirmed in our electronic\n      medical record and questionnaire response.  The secondary outcome is reported parental\n      usefulness of the discharge instructions."
