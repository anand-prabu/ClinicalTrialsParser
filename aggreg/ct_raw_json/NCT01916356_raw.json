Participants will then be directed to a short video on\n      infertility. One week later, participants will return to the site to complete the\n      infertility test questions a second time in order to test memory retention. The focus of\n      both the questionnaire and educational video will be basic reproductive biology, infertility\n      risk factors, etiologies and treatments and fertility myths."
