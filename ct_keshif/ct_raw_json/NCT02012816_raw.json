The peer-referral program offers several advantages over traditional\n      demand-creation approaches that rely on employing mobilizers or community health workers\n      (CHWs). The amount of the monetary incentive will be analogous to the amount of incentive\n      that CHWs might receive for comparable effort, making the program suitable for large-scale\n      expansion. The effect of the peer-referral program on uptake of VMMC services will be\n      evaluated using a rigorous methodology proposed by UNC researchers."

In approximately 10 randomly selected intervention clinics, all\n      men who reside in the catchment area of the clinic and come for male circumcision services\n      will be eligible to receive 5 referral vouchers that will entitle them to receive monetary\n      compensation for each voucher that is subsequently presented by a man who comes to the\n      clinic and undergoes male circumcision. In 10 remaining clinics (control group), VMMC\n      services will proceed as per the current standard of care, without peer referral incentives.\n      All clinics including those allocated to the control group will have the standard\n      mobilization and promotion activities that are used by CIDRZ.\n\n      In intervention clinics:\n\n        -  All eligible men seeking VMMC in intervention clinics will be asked if they want to\n           participate in the study. This can happen on the day of the circumcision or within 7\n           days after the circumcision.\n\n        -  If yes, a file is open for them as \"referring person\". They receive 5 vouchers. They\n           also receive MC brochures to distribute to friends.\n\n        -  As his friends or relatives come in as referrals, they are written in his file He can\n           then claim reimbursement any time between the time a referred friend comes for VMMC and\n           the expiration of the voucher. The referring person needs to bring the voucher in order\n           to receive reimbursement.\n\n        -  Friends who come as referrals are given the possibility to become referring persons\n           too, if within the intervention period.
