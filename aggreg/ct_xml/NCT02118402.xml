  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency and anemia are health issues affecting mainly infants and women in
      developing countries. Iron deficiency in infancy can have long-lasting impact on cognitive
      and motor development of the child. Iron fortification has shown to be effective against
      anemia. However, in areas with a high burden of infectious diseases iron may increase the
      risk of unfavorable gut microbiota composition possibly influencing diarrhea prevalence.
      Therefore we want to assess the effects of home fortification of complementary food with two
      iron-containing micronutrient powders (MNPs) with and without the addition of a prebiotic
      (galactooligosaccharides, GOS) compared to a control on the composition of the gut
      microbiota of Kenyan infants. In this study we will use an MNP with a moderate iron dose (5
      mg, 2.5 mg NaFeEDTA and 2.5 mg ferrous fumarate). There will be 3 study groups MNP, MNP+Fe
      and MNP+Fe+GOS. The infants will be enrolled in the study at the age of 6-10 months and will
      consume a home-fortified maize porridge for four months. At baseline and endpoint (after 4
      months), we will collect blood samples of the infants in order to assess anemia, iron
      status, and inflammation. fecal samples will be collected at baseline, 3 weeks and at
      endpoint in order to evaluate the changes in gut microbiota and gut inflammation.

      Fifty infants per group will be enrolled (n=150) and randomLy divided in three groups, from
      those identified in selected villages in the catchment area of the Kikoneni Health Clinic in
      southern coastal Kenya, about 2 hours south of Mombasa. All children of whose parents agree
      to participate in the study will have their iron status assessed (Hemoglobin, ZPP, Serum
      ferritin and soluble serum transferrin receptor). Enrolled subjects will be randomized into
      three groups, stratified for iron status (Hemoglobin and Zinc Protoporphyrin), and will
      receive four types of identical sachets (color matched) containing all a mixture of
      micronutrients. For group 1 will receive the MNP alone, group 2 will receive an identical
      MNP with iron (2.5 mg Fe as NaFeEDTA and 2.5 mg ferrous fumarate), and group 3 will get the
      MNP with iron (2.5 mg Fe as NaFeEDTA and 2.5 mg ferrous fumarate) and 7.5 mg of
      galactooligosaccharides (GOS). Each household will receive 2 kg of maize meal per week and
      the mothers of the participating children will be shown how to prepare the food at home and
      will be engaged in discussions regarding childcare. These micronutrient powders will be
      added by the parents to finely-ground maize meal porridge, the locally used complementary
      food. This maize meal will be provided free-of-charge to all participating families Kikoneni
      Clinic will serve as the collection point for the micronutrient powder, the monitoring
      center for surveillance of infant health, as well as the blood and stool collection point.

      At baseline, and at endpoint of the intervention (4 months), a blood sample will be
      collected the measurement of hemoglobin (Hb). To define anemia; serum ferritin (SF),
      C-reactive protein (CRP) and zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) will be measured to assess iron
      status. Two baseline stool samples will be collected for determination of colonic
      microbiota. At the weekly visits to the health center during the study, the mother will
      bring in their infant's stool sample of the same day, where it will be labeled and kept in a
      fridge. The mothers will be trained to collect the stool samples at home in a provided
      container with a tight, screw-top lid, that includes an Anerocult® sachet to create an
      anaerobic environment. The samples will be transferred to the lab in Msambweni, filled in 2
      ml Eppendorf tubes, labelled and frozen at - 20°C.

      In addition compliance and morbidity will be assessed weekly during the distribution of the
      MNPs. The children will be checked and referred to the health center clinicians whenever
      indicated by the clinical history. In the case of fever, a rapid malaria test (RTD) kit will
      be performed according to local guidelines. If the test results positive, the child will be
      treated for presumptive malaria, mild malaria cases will be treated at Kikoneni clinic as
      per WHO Integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) guidelines. Cases of diarrhea will
      be treated with oral rehydration solution (ORS). If deemed necessary by the Kikoneni
      clinical management, the study team will support the clinic in re stocking ORS, iron
      supplements and antimalaric drugs for the study duration.

      Anthropometry (weight, height, age and sex) will be recorded at baseline and endpoint using
      standardized procedures to calculate the prevalence of child stunting. The measurements will
      be done twice and the average used for data analysis. The data analysis software WHO Anthro
      (WHO, Geneva Switzerland) will be used to calculate the prevalence of stunting among this
      infant population.
