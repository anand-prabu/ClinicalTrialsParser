            "textblock": "Rationale: Approximately 800 abdominoperineal resections (APR) are performed for rectal\n      cancer each year in the Netherlands. The extralevator approach (eAPR) reduces the rate of\n      positive margins and improves oncological outcome in distal rectal cancer. However, wider\n      excisions increase wound healing problems and development of perineal hernia. This has\n      resulted in a progressive increase of the use of musculocutaneous flaps and biological\n      meshes associated with a substantial increase of costs, which is not supported by proper\n      data.\n\n      Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the cost-effectiveness of pelvic floor\n      reconstruction using a biological mesh after standardized eAPR with neo-adjuvant\n      (chemo)radiotherapy.\n\n      Study design: This is a multicenter study in which patients undergoing an eAPR are\n      randomized between standard care using primary closure of the perineum and the experimental\n      arm with assisted closure using a biological mesh.\n\n      Study population: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of primary rectal cancer who are\n      scheduled for eAPR after neo-adjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy. A total number of 104 patients\n      will be randomized.\n\n      Intervention: The intervention in the experimental arm consists of suturing a biological\n      mesh derived from porcine dermis in the pelvic floor defect, followed by perineal closure\n      similar to the control arm.\n\n      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is the percentage of uncomplicated\n      perineal wound healing (Souphampton wound score less than II at day 30). Secondary endpoints\n      are hospital stay, incidence of perineal hernia, quality of life, and costs.\n\n      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group\n      relatedness: Both primary perineal closure and biological mesh assisted closure are being\n      performed in daily clinical practise. The potential benefit resulting from participation of\n      the study in patients randomized for biological mesh assisted closure may be a higher chance\n      of uncomplicated perineal wound healing and lower perineal hernia rate. On the other hand,\n      the use of a biological mesh has been associated with increased postoperative pain and\n      seroma formation."

The extent of excision of perineal skin and ischioanal fat will be as limited as oncologically justified. Preferably, an omental plasty is positioned in the pelvic cavity following resection. Closure of the perineum in the control arm consists of stitching the perineal subcutaneous fat together using interrupted Vicryl sutures in one or two layers.
