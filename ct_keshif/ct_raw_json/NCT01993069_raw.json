The yoga will be provided in\n      the form of 6 weekly yoga sessions aimed at providing direct instruction and immediate\n      feedback on postures, breathing, and relaxation techniques in a small group format. The\n      sessions will be led by an experienced yoga instructor who is a part of the study team and\n      have worked with medical patients. A post-yoga 2-month follow-up assessment of self-reported\n      symptoms, mood, and quality of life will also be assessed.\n\n      This is a feasibility study to determine if a yoga treatment is received favorably and can\n      be successfully delivered to veterans seeking treatments for post-traumatic and chronic\n      tension-type headaches. This study does not include a comparison group; therefore, we can\n      only make conclusions based on pre to post differences in subjects who participate in the\n      yoga. Our aim for this study is to collect data on the potential benefits of a targeted yoga\n      treatment for symptoms experienced by these subjects, and to then utilize these data to\n      implement a larger study with a comparison group."
