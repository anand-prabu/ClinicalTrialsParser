    <textblock>
      This is a study of INCB047986 given to patients with advanced malignancies that has two
      parts.

      Part 1 (Dose Escalation Phase) of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of INCB047986 when given as described to patients with advanced
      malignancies.  A goal of Part 1 will be to identify the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of
      INCB047986 and/or dose(s) that are tolerated doses that produce substantial pharmacologic
      target inhibition at trough. These doses will be used in Part 2 of the study.

      Part 2 (Expansion Phase) of the study will further explore the safety, tolerability, PK, and
      preliminary clinical activity of INCB047986 at the doses identified in Part 1,in subjects
      with advanced malignancies.
