We hypothesized that repletion\n      of nitric oxide (NO) during and after the surgical procedure on CPB may protect against\n      endothelium dysfunction and organ failure caused by plasma-Hb induced NO scavenging. There\n      are three possible beneficial mechanisms of delivering NO:\n\n        1. Nitric oxide reduces ischemia-reperfusion injury (such as in acute myocardial\n           infarction, stroke, and acute tubular necrosis).\n\n        2. Nitric oxide has anti-inflammatory properties. As antioxidants, exogenous NO may reduce\n           injury by counteracting the cytotoxic effects of reactive oxygen species, modulating\n           leukocyte recruitment, edema formation and tissue disruption.\n\n        3. Exogenous nitric oxide prevents noxious effects of hemolysis-associated NO\n           dysregulation. During hemolysis, nitric oxide gas oxidized of plasma oxyhemoglobin to\n           methemoglobin, thereby inhibiting endogenous endothelium NO scavenging by cell-free Hb.\n\n      NO depletion during hemolysis and its sequelae. The release of plasma free Hb (with Fe2+\n      iron) by hemolysis avidly scavenges nitric oxide (NO) by the dioxygenation reaction.\n      Elevated plasma ferrous Hb levels can induce a \"NO deficiency\" state. Reduced vascular\n      nitric oxide levels can contribute to vasoconstriction, inflammation, and thrombosis,\n      potentially contributing to systemic endothelial dysfunction after cardiac surgery with CPB."
