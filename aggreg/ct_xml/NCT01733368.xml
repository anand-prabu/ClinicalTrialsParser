    <description>Optimization method. The primary endpoint of this study is to evaluate the usual management (according to the different methods of optimisation used) of patients undergoing Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT), that have a QuartetTM quadripolar lead with a CRT-D Device implanted during the 6 months post-implant.
Information about the optimization method used, parameters and variables used with them and number of optimization during 6months post-implant will be collected.</description>
