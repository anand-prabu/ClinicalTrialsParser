        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject must be able to read, understand, and sign the statement of informed
             consent and receive a fully executed copy of the form.

          2. The subject be able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in this
             clinical protocol.

          3. The subject must be 18 and less than 39 years of age.

          4. The subject must be an adapted soft contact lens wearer in both eyes (Defined as
             having been a full times lens wearer for at least 3 months).

          5. Subjects must be current full time daily wearers of Acuvue Oasys lenses (defined as,
             at least 6 hours per day, 5 days per week).

          6. The subject's spherical equivalent distance refraction must be in the range of 0.00
             to -6.00D in each eye.

          7. The subject must present at visit 1 with a current copy of their spectacle
             prescription.

          8. The subject must have the best corrected visual acuity of 0.18 or better in each eye
             as assessed by LogMAR chart.

          9. The subject must have normal eyes (i.e., no ocular medication, or infections of any
             type)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Wear Acuvue Oasys with Hydraclear Plus on an extended wear basis.

          2. Wear Acuvue Oasys with Hydraclear Plus for astigmatism.

          3. History of epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis); vaccinia,
             active or recent varicella, viral disease of the cornea and/or conjunctiva; chronic
             bacterial disease of the cornea and/or conjunctiva; mycobacterial infection of the
             eye; and/or fungal disease of the eye.

          4. Use of concomitant ocular medications during the study period. Topical artificial
             tears or contact lens lubricants are allowed, but no instillation on the day of
             examinations.

          5. Any systemic disease, autoimmune disease, or use of medications, which may interfere
             with contact lens wear.

          6. Subjects using medications influencing tear production such as steroids,
             immunosuppressive agents and/or anti-cholinergics (e.g. cold and allergy medications,
             tricyclic antidepressants) for treatment of autoimmune connective tissue disease may
             not be enrolled in this study if they  have not been on a stable dosing regimen for
             30 days prior to the Eligibility Visit. Subjects may use birth control medications
             since there is inconclusive evidence relative to the influence on tear film.

          7. Any infectious disease (e.g. Hepatitis, tuberculosis) or a contagious
             immunosuppressive disease (e.g. HIV, by self report).

          8. Subjects reporting discomfort at screening visit related to fit or care system
             abnormalities (both determined by the investigator), ocular conditions such as
             conjunctival infections, iritis.

          9. Currently pregnant or lactating (subjects who become pregnant during the study will
             be discontinued).

         10. Any ocular or systemic allergies or diseases that may  interfere with contact lens
             wear.

         11. Entropion, ectropion, extrusion, chalazia, recurrent styes, glaucoma, history of
             recurrent corneal erosion,aphakia, or moderate or above corneal distortion by
             keratometry.

         12. Any previous, or planned, ocular or intraocular surgery (radial keratotomy, LASIK,
             ETC.)

         13. Any grade 3 or greater slit lamp findings (e.g. edema, corneal neovascularization,
             corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival injection) on the FDA
             classification scale, any previous history or signs of a contact lens-related corneal
             inflammatory event (e.g. past peripheral ulcer or round peripheral scar), or any
             other ocular abnormality that may contraindicate contact lens wear.

         14. Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact
             lens wear.

         15. Monovision or multi-focal contact lens correction

         16. Participation in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 30 days
             prior to  study enrollment

         17. History of binocular vision abnormality or strabismus

         18. History of serious mental illness

         19. History of seizures
