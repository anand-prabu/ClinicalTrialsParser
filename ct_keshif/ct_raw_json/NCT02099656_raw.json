Patients will subsequently be randomized to receive\n      lebrikizumab or placebo by subcutaneous injection (SC) on Day 1, Day 8, Week 4, and Week 8.\n      Patients will continue their standard of care therapy throughout the study. End of treatment\n      assessments will be taken at Week 12. Total study period, including screening and follow-up,\n      is expected to last 23 weeks."
