            "textblock": "Consolidation chemotherapy with high dose cytarabine usually causes myelosuppression for 14\n      to 21 days after each treatment. Patients have low blood counts for days or weeks before the\n      bone marrow resumes function. This may result in e.g., hospitalization, treatment with\n      antibiotics, and transfusions with blood and/or platelets. In addition, this may cause a\n      delay in treatment and reduction in dose. To achieve the best outcome from treatment, dose\n      reductions and delays in treatment must be avoided.\n\n      The incidence and duration of decreased white blood cells (neutropenia) and neutropenic\n      complications have been reduced by the use of growth colony stimulating factors.\n      Additionally, the use of erythropoietin-stimulating factors has reduced anemia and the need\n      for red blood cell transfusions. Thrombocytopenia remains an important limiting factor in\n      administration of chemotherapy and maintaining dose intensity in some patients.\n      Additionally, the risk of bleeding secondary to low platelet counts may increase sickness or\n      even death in patients undergoing cancer treatment.\n\n      Thrombopoietin (TPO) is the principal cytokine involved in the regulation of\n      megakaryopoiesis and platelet production. Eltrombopag is an orally bioavailable, small\n      molecule, TPO-receptor agonist that stimulates platelet production by a similar, but not\n      identical, mechanism to endogenous TPO. Eltrombopag has been approved in the U.S. for the\n      treatment of chronic Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura. Eltrombopag is also under\n      development for other indications such as Hepatitis C Virus-associated thrombocytopenia,\n      Myelodysplastic Syndrome/AML, and oncology related thrombocytopenias. This agent appears to\n      possess many of the desirable properties for a treatment for chemotherapy induced\n      thrombocytopenia, including oral administration.\n\n      The Phase I portion of this study will be conducted using a dose escalation/de-escalation\n      strategy for patients in either the first or second complete remission. Dose escalations are\n      planned in the form of both acceleration of date of initiation of eltrombopag relative to\n      the start of consolidation chemotherapy as well as increasing daily dosing.\n\n      The Phase II portion will be conducted using the dose and schedule selected from the Phase I\n      portion of the study for those patients in first complete remission. Patients will be used\n      as their own controls, e.g., a two-period two-treatment cross-over design. Patients will be\n      randomly allocated 1:1 to one of two sequences. Patients randomized to Sequence A will\n      receive eltrombopag with their first cycle of consolidation and placebo with Cycle 2.\n      Patients randomized to Sequence B will receive placebo with their first cycle of\n      consolidation and eltrombopag with Cycle 2. The treatment assignment will be blinded to the\n      patient and all study/sponsor personnel.\n\n      Patients will undergo blood sample collection for Thrombopoietin(TPO)/ Erythropoietin(EPO)\n      and pharmacokinetic analysis of eltrombopag in Phase I and pharmacokinetic analysis of\n      eltrombopag in the Phase II portion of the study."
