The purpose of this study is to\n      investigate whether a group-based Memory Specificity Training (MEST) programme improves\n      outcomes in depression, and how this compares to an education and support control group. The\n      primary aim is to examine whether MEST, which involves repeated practice retrieving specific\n      autobiographical memories reduces depressive symptoms immediately post-treatment, and\n      whether this is maintained 3 months after treatment. The secondary objective of this trial\n      is to examine the role of hypothesised cognitive processes (ie., rumination, executive\n      control, cognitive avoidance) which may underlie improvements in depression and memory."
