            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxic effect profile and maximum tolerated dose of\n      interleukin-12 (rhIL-12) in women with advanced breast cancer who have undergone high dose\n      chemotherapy with stem cell rescue. II. Determine the effect of rhIL-12 on cellular and\n      humoral immune systems following high dose chemotherapy. III. Explore the effect on\n      treatment failure of rhIL-12 after high dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of interleukin-12 (rhIL-12). RhIL-12 therapy begins\n      3-5 weeks after discharge from the chemotherapy/stem cell transplant hospitalization or 2-3\n      weeks after completion of posttransplant radiation. Patients receive rhIL-12 subcutaneously\n      twice a week for 12 consecutive weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated at each dose level\n      of rhIL-12. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6\n      patients experiences dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 2 months after\n      treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 6-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2\n      years."
