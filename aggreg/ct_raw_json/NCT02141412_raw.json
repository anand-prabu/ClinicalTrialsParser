Shivering has been reported to occur in up to 65% of\n      patients recovering from general anesthesia, and has been shown to cause detrimental effects\n      to the patient. Previous studies have shown that dexmedetomidine 1\u00b5g/kg at the end of\n      surgery significantly reduces the incidence of postoperative shivering and improves quality\n      of emergence from anesthesia. However, this beneficial effect of dexmedetomidine is at the\n      expense of prolonged time to extubation and awakening. The aim of this study is to find the\n      optimal dose of dexmedetomidine that would be beneficial without delaying recovery from\n      general anesthesia."
