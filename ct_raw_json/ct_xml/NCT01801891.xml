  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine if the use of surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation,
      applied to various motor points on the lower limb to elicit muscle contraction when combined
      with compression bandaging accelerates the rate of venous leg ulcer healing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With an increasingly ageing population the incidence of venous ulceration is likely to rise.
      The negative impact of leg ulceration on patients' quality of life and on healthcare costs
      is well recognised. Increased prevalence combined with poor reported healing rates and high
      incidence of ulcer recurrence makes the development of a new treatment which could
      accelerate healing rates beyond that currently achieved using compression bandaging most
      desirable. Surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation in combination with compression
      bandaging may provide such a treatment.

      Surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation (SNMES) is the application of an electrical
      stimulus to motor points in the body using electrodes placed on the surface of the skin to
      elicit a muscular contraction. It has been shown that SNMES of the calf muscles, when used
      in conjunction with compression therapy, provides improved venous flow velocities over
      compression therapy alone. Furthermore, the week-long effect of SNMES and compression
      therapy on healthy participants was found to be well tolerated by all participants and
      resulted in increases in stimulated venous flow and muscle strength. A combined SNMES and
      compression treatment protocol which stimulates peripheral venous blood flow may help to
      alleviate harmful venous pressures in venous leg ulcer patients and provide some degree of
      strengthening of the calf muscles, thus helping to accelerate the healing rates of venous
      ulcers.

    <description>Patients randomised to the control group will, in addition to their routine compression bandaging, be given muscle stimulators for home use and instructed to apply 3x 30 minute sessions of comfortable electrical stimulation daily for 12 weeks. The stimulators given to the control group will be set to provide minimal stimulation resulting in no visible muscular contraction.</description>

    <description>Patients randomised to this group, in addition to their routine treatment with compression bandaging, will be given muscle stimulators for home use and instructed to apply 3x 30 minute sessions of comfortable electrical stimulation daily for 12 weeks.

    <description>The VASGARD device is a 2 channel muscle stimulator system designed for increasing venous blood flow. Controlled electrical stimuli are delivered to the patient through adhesive gel electrodes placed over the motor points of muscles on the lower leg. This elicits artificial muscular contractions which in turn increases lower limb venous haemodynamics.</description>
