  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the additive effect of brinzolamide
      1%/brimonidine 0.2% (SIMBRINZA™) in subjects with either open angle glaucoma or ocular
      hypertension who are currently on a prostaglandin analogue (PGA) monotherapy (TRAVATAN Z®)

    <textblock>
      This study is divided into 2 sequential phases. The Screening/Eligibility phase includes one
      screening visit and two eligibility visits, during which subjects will washout of all other
      IOP-lowering medications and dose with TRAVATAN Z®, 1 drop instilled in each eye once daily
      for 28 days. Subjects who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized at the
      second eligibility visit. The Treatment phase consists of two on-therapy visits (Week 2 and
      Week 6).

    <description>Diurnal IOP is defined as the mean of the four timepoints measured (8 AM, 10 AM, 3 PM, and 5 PM). IOP will be measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry and reported in millimeters mercury (mmHg). A higher IOP can be a greater risk factor for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage).</description>

             pseudoexfoliation or pigment dispersion) or ocular hypertension;

          -  Mean intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements in at least 1 eye (study eye) of ≥ 21
             mmHg and &lt;32 mmHg at 8 AM while on travoprost monotherapy at 2 consecutive visits
             (Eligibility 1 and Eligibility 2);

          -  Able to understand and sign Informed Consent Document;

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

          -  Any form of glaucoma other than open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension;

          -  Severe central visual field loss;

          -  Chronic, recurrent, or severe inflammatory eye disease;

          -  Ocular trauma within the past 6 months;

          -  Ocular infection or ocular inflammation within the past 3 months;

          -  Best-corrected visual acuity score worse than approximately 20/80 Snellen;

          -  Eye surgery within the past 6 months;

          -  Any condition, including severe illness, which would make the subject unsuitable for
             the study in the opinion of the Investigator;

          -  Use of any additional topical or systemic ocular hypertensive medication during the
             study;

          -  Patients who, in the opinion of the Investigator, cannot discontinue all IOP-lowering
             ocular medication(s) per the appropriate washout schedule prior to Eligibility 1
             Visit;

          -  Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.
