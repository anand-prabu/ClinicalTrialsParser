Preliminary data from a pilot study involving 25 subjects with T2DM that underwent\n      a combined treatment using ASC+HBO showed a significant progressive and consistent reduction\n      in plasma glucose and HbA1c with an increase in C-peptide in conjunction with a decrease in\n      the number and dose of oral agents and/or insulin. These encouraging preliminary results\n      require confirmation in a controlled, randomized prospective trial."
