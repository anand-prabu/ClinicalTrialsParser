Combining vaccine therapy with sargramostim may kill\n      more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy plus sargramostim in\n      treating patients who have myelodysplastic syndrome."

Determine whether a specific T-cell response can be induced in patients with\n      myelodysplastic syndrome treated with mutant N-, K-, or H-ras peptide vaccine (limited to\n      the specific N-, K-, or H-ras peptide mutation in their bone marrow) and intradermal\n      sargramostim (GM-CSF). II. Determine whether HLA type or the ability to respond\n      immunologically to common recall antigens correlates with the induction of anti-ras immune\n      responses in these patients treated with this regimen. III. Assess toxicity of mutant N-,\n      K-, or H-ras peptide vaccine in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) intradermally on days 1-10. Patients receive\n      mutant N-, K-, or H-ras peptide vaccine (limited to the specific N-, K-, or H-ras mutation\n      in their bone marrow) intradermally on day 7. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 5\n      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are\n      followed at 2 and 6 weeks after the last vaccination.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-70 patients will be accrued for this study over 12-15\n      months."
