The Cerenkov imaging could be used as a guide for\n      surgical resections.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to use the Cerenkov light from FDG or Iodine-131 tracers to\n      image tumors and its sizes in the head, neck, breast, axillary and pelvic regions with a\n      highly sensitive camera. The investigators will be trying to see if we can get another\n      picture of the tumor using the Cerenkov light as part of the standard clinical scan or\n      therapy."
