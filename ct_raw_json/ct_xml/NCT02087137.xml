  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Normal aging is associated with decline in some aspects of memory, and this can be a risk
      factor for reductions in everyday functioning. The Baycrest Memory and Aging Program teaches
      positive adaptation to age-related memory changes, including strategies for minimizing the
      everyday impact of normal memory change and positive lifestyle change to maximize brain
      health. Prior research has shown that the Memory and Aging program is effective in
      increasing participants' knowledge about memory, use of memory strategies, and confidence in
      memory function, as well as adoption of healthier lifestyle practices and reduction in
      intention to use unneeded health care resources.

      Although not one of the stated goals of the program, informal feedback from participants
      suggests that the educational content and skills training in the Memory and Aging Program
      has led some participants to change behaviours in ways that lead to significant improvements
      in their everyday functioning. For example, graduating participants often volunteer examples
      of how they have applied what they have learned to succeed in everyday memory tasks such as
      learning a new name or keeping track of future plans.  Based on this participant feedback,
      it is hypothesized that the knowledge, skills, and confidence gained by Memory and Aging
      Program participants may lead to positive behaviour changes that, in turn, lead to improved
      everyday functioning.  The present study will test this hypothesis using a randomized
      controlled pretest-posttest design.

    <description>The Memory and Aging Program intervention consists of five 2-hour sessions conducted over five consecutive weeks. The content of the program includes: (a) the provision of factual information (i.e., about memory, age-related memory changes, lifestyle factors affecting memory, and memory strategies) in an informal lecture format; and (b) memory intervention (i.e., practice and application of several evidence-based memory strategies) in a hands-on interactive format.</description>
