            "textblock": "Background: Care for pregnant and delivering women is a field where unexpected emergencies,\n      as for example emergency caesarean sectio, postpartum bleeding or severe preeclampsia, that\n      may potentially harm both mother and baby, occur. Obstetric emergencies are rare and hence\n      by nature difficult to learn in real life. Therefore, it can be relevant with\n      simulation-based medical education, i.e., training with mannequins and scenarios. In\n      non-systematic reviews it is concluded that repetitive medical simulations are associated\n      with improved learner outcomes. However, many questions on how simulation can optimise\n      learning in emergencies remain unanswered; e.g., how different kinds of simulation settings\n      as 'in situ simulation' versus 'off site simulation' impact learning at the individual and\n      the team level.\n\n      Objectives: In a randomised trial on authentic obstetric-anaesthesia teams to study the\n      effect of 'in situ simulation' versus 'off site simulation' on participants learning\n      outcome, safety-attitudes, team performance plus motivational and stress inducing effect of\n      different simulation settings and the potential association with learning and performance.\n\n      Interventions: The experimental intervention is training in 'in situ simulation' which means\n      training in the actual patient care unit, in this situation the labour suite and operation\n      theatre. The control group will receive the same training 'off site simulation', i.e., in\n      training rooms away from the actual patient care unit. In the two different simulation\n      settings, the same scenarios will be conducted and the participants will comprise of\n      authentic teams of specialised obstetricians or obstetric trainees in their final training\n      year, trainee obstetricians, midwifes, auxiliary nurses, specialised anaesthetists or\n      anaesthesia trainees in their final training year, trainee anaesthetists, anaesthesia\n      nurses, and surgical nurses.\n\n      Design and trial size: Single-centre investigator-initiated randomised superiority trial. We\n      have chosen to calculate the required sample size based on experiences about knowledge\n      tests. We assume a standard deviation at 24%, and a difference in the experimental and\n      control means at 17%. With alpha set at 0.05, beta set at 0.80 and intraclass correlation at\n      0,05 the sample size added up to 93 participants. It is planned to include 100 participants.\n\n      Outcomes: Primary outcome: 1) Knowledge by written test as multiple choice questions.\n\n      Exploratory outcomes: 1) Safety Attitudes Questionnaire SAQ). 2) Team performance score\n      measured by Team Emergency Assessment Measure (TEAM). 3) Clinical performance in the\n      simulated setting. 4) Salivary cortisol. 5) Validated stress inventory (Stress-Trait Anxiety\n      Inventory (STAI-1) and cognitive appraisal). 6) Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). 7)\n      Questionnaire to evaluate participants' perceptions of the simulation, the debriefing, and\n      changes needed at the organisational level.\n\n      Time schedule: 2 years with start planning 1st of April 2012. Randomisation will start after\n      approval from the Regional Ethics Committee and the Danish Data Protection Agency. The\n      intervention with 'in situ simulation' versus 'on site simulation' described in this\n      protocol will be scheduled spring 2013."
