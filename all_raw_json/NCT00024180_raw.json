Patients are stratified according to\n      disease (chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma vs acute myeloid\n      leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia).\n\n      Patients receive FR901228 (depsipeptide) IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment\n      repeats every 4 weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 10 patients per stratum receive decreasing doses of FR901228 until the minimal\n      active dose is determined. If 5 or more patients show clinical or biological response, the\n      subsequent cohort is treated at a lower dose. If fewer than 5 patients respond, the\n      subsequent cohort is treated at a higher dose.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 20 patients (10 per stratum) will be accrued for this study."
