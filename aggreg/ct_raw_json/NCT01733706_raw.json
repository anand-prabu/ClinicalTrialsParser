Study participants will be\n      randomized to electronic cigarette added to standard counselling or only standard\n      counselling. A calendar will be given to the patient to remember the dates of visits or\n      telephone counselling. After the first visit patient will be followed every ten days for the\n      first two month through outpatient clinic visits and telephone counselling. After the first\n      two months patient will return at institute for a last outpatient clinic visit at sixth\n      month."

It's formed by a filter which contains distilled water and food flavorings, an atomizer and a battery. On the opposite end to the filter there is a diode that lights up during aspiration. During the suction is generated hot air which, in contact with the liquid of the filter, generates steam which simulates the smoke of a traditional cigarette. The smoker has the sensation of smoking, but he does not suck the carcinogenic substances in traditional cigarettes and he does not assimilate nicotine.",
