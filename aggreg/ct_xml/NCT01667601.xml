      Only a few intervention studies have also focused on changing patients' negative thoughts
      and feelings towards the illness and their relationship to the suffering caused by those
      thoughts, which is evidenced to empower psychosocial functioning and control of distressing
      thoughts in severe depression and psychotic disorders by using the Mindfulness-Based Stress
      Reduction program. This controlled trial is designed to test the effects of a
      mindfulness-based Illness management program (MBPP) for Chinese patients with schizophrenia
      on their symptom severity, illness insight and psychosocial functioning.

      Objectives: This study is to test the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based illness
      management program for Chinese outpatients with schizophrenia over an 18-month follow-up.
      The program is an integrated, insight-inducing educational program that addresses patients'
      awareness and knowledge of schizophrenia and skills of illness management.

      Methods: A multisite controlled trial will be conducted with 108 Chinese patients with
      schizophrenia in Hong Kong. They will be randomly assigned to either the mindfulness-based
      illness management program, conventional psychoeducation group, or usual psychiatric care.
      The patients' mental and psychosocial functioning, insights into illness, and their
      re-hospitalization rates will be measured at recruitment and at one week and 9 months and 18
      months after the interventions.

      Hypothesis: The patients in the psychoeducation program will report significantly greater
      improvements in their illness insights, symptom severity and length of re-hospitalizations
      over the 18-month follow-up, compared with those in psychoeducation group or usual care.

      Conclusions: The findings will provide evidence whether the mindfulness-based illness
      management program can improve Chinese schizophrenia sufferers' psychosocial functioning and
      reduce their illness relapse.
