These 69\n      subjects will then be randomized to 3 treatment arms: clonidine (0.1 mg/day),\n      hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/day) or placebo for 4 weeks in years 1 and 2. All tablets will be\n      encapsulated by to look identical. Subjects will randomly (1:1:1) receive one of the\n      following combinations in a double-blind, placebo-controlled design:\n\n        1. Oral clonidine (0.1 mg twice/day)\n\n        2. Oral hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg twice/day)\n\n        3. Oral placebo\n\n      In addition to 69 healthy young men and women, we will also enroll 15 obese adults with\n      'normal/optimal' systolic blood pressure (<120mmHg) who will undergo baseline testing only\n      (Visits 1, 2 and 3).\n\n      Years 3 and 4: A 2nd cohort of subjects (n=42) will be randomized to aliskiren (150 mg/day),\n      hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/day) or placebo for 4 weeks. All tablets will be encapsulated to\n      look identical. Subjects will receive one of the following in a randomized, double-blind,\n      placebo-controlled design:\n\n        1.
