  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the possibility of using jaw-tapping training as a
      self-exercise for developing memory and preventing dementia in elderly subjects with memory
      disturbances using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

    <textblock>
      Right-handed female volunteers over the age of 50 years with subjective memory complaints
      are included in the study. Volunteers with dentures, psychoactive medication, history of
      stroke, or other neurologic disorders are excluded.

      The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of university-based hospital.

      After administering the Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery (SNSB), Mini-Mental State
      Examination (MMSE) scores above 24 and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) scores of 0 are
      considered subjective memory complaints (SMC), and MMSE scores above 23 and CDR scores of
      0.5 are considered MCI.

      All subjects undergo two MRI scans. After the first MRI, the subjects are trained to tap
      their jaws vertically at 1.6 Hz at home twice a day for 30 seconds every day during four
      weeks.
