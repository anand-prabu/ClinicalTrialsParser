Here a novel powered ankle foot\n      orthoses which can provide ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion assistant using electric\n      motor is proposed in this paper. The mechanical structure of the orthoses includes wearing\n      parts, ankle joint hinged part, driving unit, transmission mechanism and sensing units. This\n      study provides a new method for ankle foot orthoses design and has great significance for\n      ankle rehabilitation."
