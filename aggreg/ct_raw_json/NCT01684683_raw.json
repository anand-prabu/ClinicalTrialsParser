Currently the treatments for bronchiectasis are\n      mostly based on experience gained from the treatment of COPD and cystic fibrosis(CF). The\n      aims of treatment for bronchiectasis are to improve the health-related quality of life, to\n      slow down the decrease of lung function, to reduce the exacerbation frequence and the\n      mortality. The mechanism of treatment are including: treating the underlying disease;\n      improving drainage of sputum; anti-infection; anti-inflammation; treating airway\n      obstruction. A review written by Peter J. Barnes describes that as a bronchodilator in COPD,\n      theophylline may relax human airways smooth muscle, have an anti-inflammation rols, and have\n      an additional effect on mucociliary clearance. Besides, theophylline can improve the\n      activity of histone deacetylase, which will reverse the resistant of corticosteroids. We\n      hypothesis that theophylline will have the same effect in subjects with NCF-bronchiectasis\n      as in subjects with COPD. Our trial may give an evidence of using theophylline in treatment\n      of bronchiectasis."
