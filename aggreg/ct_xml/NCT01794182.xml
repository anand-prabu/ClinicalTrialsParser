  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multi-center, prospective, double blind, two-stage, adaptive study.
      The primary objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of RP-1127 compared to placebo in
      subjects with a severe anterior circulation ischemic stroke who are likely to develop
      malignant edema. This objective will be addressed by comparing the proportion of RP-1127
      treated patients and placebo treated patients with a Day 90 modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤ 4
      without decompressive craniectomy (DC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population consists of subjects with a clinical diagnosis of acute severe anterior
      circulation ischemic stroke, a baseline diffusion weighted image (DWI) lesion between 82 and
      300 cm3, age 18-80 years, and time from symptom onset to start of study infusion of ≤10
      hours. The study will enroll both patients that do not receive IV rtPA and those that
      receive IV rtPA within 4.5 hours of stroke.

      Stage 1 of the study will enroll and treat up to a maximum of 50 subjects (25 per arm) who
      meet all inclusion/exclusion.

      Enrollment will be randomized controlling for site, age ≤60 (yes/no), and IV rtPA treatment
      at baseline (yes/no). Subjects will be randomized equally between RP-1127 and placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A clinical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke in the MCA territory (PCA and/or ACA
             territory involvement in addition to primary MCA territory stroke is acceptable).

             to carry out all usual duties and activities).

             be ≤ 25 at the time of rtPA administration).

          -  The time to the start of infusion of Study Drug must be ≤ 10 hours after time of
