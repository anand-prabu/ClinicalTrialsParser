      Patients will be approached to participate in this PAS after the HeartWare® Ventricular
      Assist System receives PMA approval for the indicated use as a bridge to cardiac
      transplantation.

      Patients who participated in prior trials will be approached for this PAS as follows:

        -  Patients who are on continued HeartWare® System support, (original or exchange device)

        -  Patients who have been explanted for transplant or recovery and have not yet completed
           6 months of follow-up

      Patients who participated in prior trials who will not be approached to participate in this
      follow-up study include:

      • Patients who have been explanted for transplant or recovery and have completed at least 6
      months of follow-up (documented in the prior IDE trial).

      No new patients are being screened or implanted with the HeartWare® System for this trial,
      it is a follow-up trial only.
