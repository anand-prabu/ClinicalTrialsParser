The purpose of\n      this study is to determine the influence of low dose steroids given 3 times in a 24 hour\n      period on thrombotic markers (markers that are associated with increased risks of clotting,\n      a possible complication of surgery), IL-6 cytokine release (part of the stress response seen\n      with surgery), and urine desmosine levels (a marker of lung injury) in a randomized placebo\n      controlled trial patients undergoing total hip replacement."
