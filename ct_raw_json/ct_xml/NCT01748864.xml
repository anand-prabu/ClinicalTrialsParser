  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase 1, single-center, open-label, single arm, baseline-controlled (for safety) study in
      normal volunteers.  Study will determine biodistribution and excretion of the radioactive
      drug substance and evaluate the safety and tolerability of 99mTC-Etarfolatide in normal
      volunteers.

          -  Subject must provide informed consent prior to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Subject is simultaneously participating in another investigative drug or device
             study.

          -  Subject must have completed the follow-up phase of any previous study at least 30
             days prior to enrollment in this study.

          -  Subject has a known history of chronic abuse of drugs or alcohol or tests positive in
             pre-study urine drug abuse screen.

          -  Subject is currently taking folic acid supplements and cannot stop taking the
             supplements for a period of 8 days (7 days prior to the study and one day after last
             imaging procedure).

          -  Subject's physical condition unsuitable for radionuclide imaging.

          -  Subject has been administered another radiopharmaceutical that would interfere with
             the assessment of the biodistribution of 99mTc-etarfolatide.
