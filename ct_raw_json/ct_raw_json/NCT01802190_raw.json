            "textblock": "DFNA are characterized as progressive bilateral deafness. To date, 21 genes and 57 loci are\n      involved in these dominant deafness, with an unknown prevalence.A 22nd gene responsible of\n      the disease has been found. This SLC17A8 gene encodes for the VGLUT3 protein which is\n      specifically expressed in sensorial cells of the audition. VGlut3-/- mice present a deep\n      deafness due to a deficiency of neurotransmitter release, although sensorial cells and\n      neurons are intact. This kind of deafness is an ideal candidate for a genetic therapy\n      because of the cells integrity.Mutations of SLC17A8 gene have been found in 2 american\n      families that suffer from progressive deafness.The study aims to look for european families\n      from the Mediterranean basin, which carry SLC17A8 gene mutations, and may benefit in a\n      medium-term from genetic therapy. The study will allow to identify the prevalence of the\n      SLC17A8 gene mutations in patients suffering from deafness. This phenotype also corresponds\n      to DFNA15 deafness caused by POU4F3 : mutations of this gene will be screened as well."
