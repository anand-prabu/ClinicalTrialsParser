During the pre-operative visit, the study will again be discussed with the\n      parents.  Our nurse practitioners will be trained on this study and will obtain written\n      consent at this time. If the parents would like to further discuss the study directly with\n      the PI, this will be arranged prior to surgery.\n\n      The PI will be notified by the NPs of all parents who give permission for their child to\n      participate in the study, and he will notify the on service medical team.  On the day of\n      surgery, a computerized order for the study will be entered to notify the pharmacy to\n      randomize the subject to the control or treatment group.  Randomization will be stratified\n      based on whether the child has DS, as children with DS are known to have a heightened pain\n      response and require large doses of medication to treat pain.
