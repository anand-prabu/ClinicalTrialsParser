        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients of Caucasian origin, aged between 18 to 65 years, inclusive,
             at the time informed consent is obtained.

          2. Physician based (according to GINA 2011) diagnosis of asthma for at least 6 months
             prior to the date informed consent is obtained and confirmed by 1 of the detailed
             respiratory criteria stated in the CSP

          3. Morning prebronchodilator (ie, after abstinence from short-acting and long-acting
             ß-agonist treatment for ≥ 6 and ≥ 12 hours, respectively) FEV1 of ≥70% of predicted
             normal (PN) for age, sex and height at enrolment

          4. Increased number of neutrophils in induced sputum samples at baseline, with a
             relative neutrophil count of  ≥ 50% of total sputum cell count

          5. Physician prescribed daily use of medium or high dose ICS (≥ fluticasone 250 μg to ≤
             1.000 µg or the equivalent daily, as defined in GINA 2011; see CSP Appendix E) plus
             LABA.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of clinically relevant allergies or idiosyncrasies to AZD5069 or other
             investigational CXCR2 antagonists, or any inactive ingredient(s) of the IMP, or
             tool-substances (eg, salbutamol, local anaesthetics) used for the purpose of this
             study

          2. History of severe asthma exacerbation requiring hospitalization within the last 12
             months before screening.

          3. Asthma exacerbation requiring a treatment course of systemic (ie, oral or parenteral)
             corticosteroids within the 3 months before screening or ≥ 3 courses within the last
             12 months before screening.

          4. Moderate to severe airflow limitation (FEV1 &lt;70% PN)

          5. Any chronic lower respiratory disease other than asthma (see CSP for details) that,
             as judged by the Investigator or Medical Monitor, would interfere with the evaluation
             of the IMP or interpretation of patient safety or study results.
