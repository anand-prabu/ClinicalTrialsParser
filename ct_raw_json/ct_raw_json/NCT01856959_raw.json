However, the use of\n      intravenous MgSO4 administered is not common in clinical practice, because it's prone to\n      have adverse effects and side effects such as nausea, vomiting, facial flushing,\n      hypotension, decreased tendon reflexes and so on with this treatment. The aerosolised route\n      offers the advantage of lower dosage, a shorter time of drug being delivered to the airway\n      smooth muscle and lower incidence of side effects when compared to the intravenous route. At\n      present, there are only a few studies about the effects of nebulized MgSO4 in the treatment\n      of acute asthma in children, and the conclusions are controversial."
