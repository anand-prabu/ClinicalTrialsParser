  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity has become a global epidemic, and treating and preventing obesity appears to be one
      of the world's greatest challenges. The disorder is associated with a wide range of
      metabolic and hormonal changes, including the development of insulin resistance, changes in
      adipose tissue function, increased levels of blood lipids, cardiovascular disease and
      obesity induced fatty liver. Obesity is characterized by inflammation in adipose tissue,
      altered fat storage capacity and increased exchange of lipids between adipose tissue and
      blood, and increased secretion of cytokines from adipose tissue. Cytokines are believed to
      play a central role in the regulation of adipose tissue, the size of adipocytes and other
      metabolic conditions.

      The hepatic synthesis of lipoproteins and interaction with adipose tissue is essential for
      the body's energy storages. The central role of the liver in energy supply, fat storage and
      normalization of blood values implies the importance of investigating the interaction
      between adipose tissue and liver to increase knowledge about the morbidity of obesity.
      Central obesity and insulin resistance are clear risk factors for the development of fatty
      liver, but the importance of diet is unclear. The common perception is that fatty liver
      condition can be improved by a reduction in dietary fat and cholesterols, but the
      relationship is unclear, and contradictory findings occur in epidemiological studies. It is
      therefore necessary to better understand the impact of the different macro-nutrients.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether two weight reducing diets with equal
      calorie levels that contain high or low fat differentially affects the adipose tissue
      function, distribution of body fat, as well as tissue, blood and urine levels of
      inflammatory markers, lipids, vitamins, hormones and other substances that may be related to
      metabolically health.
