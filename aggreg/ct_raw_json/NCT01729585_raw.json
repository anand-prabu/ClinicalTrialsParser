Initially, dosing will be more frequent. Treatments will be spaced out to determine the ability of the body to maintain a more efficient musculoskeletal system, especially related to respiratory and postural efforts.  Each session will end with resting hands and relaxation strokes to signal the end of the session. This protocol invites increased mobility in the musculoskeletal system.  The ultimate goal is to return connective tissue (including muscles and fascia) to a more relaxed and neutral state, thus allowing expansion and ease of movement of the areas of the musculoskeletal system being worked."

Massage\n      therapy (MT) is defined as hands on manipulation of the soft tissue of the body with the\n      intent to produce therapeutic, physiologic effects and to promote health and well-being\n      (Oawriter - OAC - codes.ohio.gov, 2010; American Massage Therapy Association, 2010). Quality\n      of life is defined as a self-description (child or adult) or parent's description of the\n      child's perceived health and well-being based on satisfaction with physical, emotional,\n      psychosocial and school/role functioning (Varni et al., 2002). Additional measures for this\n      study which may influence QOL include pain, pulmonary function, ease of breathing and\n      thoracic excursion.\n\n      Research Questions:\n\n      i. What differences in changes of QOL scores, as measured by the Peds QL 4.0 (Pediatric\n      Quality of Life Inventory) and the CFQ-R (Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire - Revised) are found\n      in youth and young adults with CF between the group receiving MT and control group? What\n      changes in QOL scores in each group are found over time? ii. What differences in changes of\n      musculoskeletal pain, as measured by the Numeric Rating Scale for pain are found in youth\n      and young adults with CF between the group receiving MT and the control group? What changes\n      in pain scores in each group are found over time? iii. What differences in changes of the\n      pulmonary function  are found in youth and young adults with CF between the group receiving\n      MT and the control group in terms of  the following:\n\n        1. Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1) and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) scores,\n\n        2. Single breath counting score, measuring ease of breathing, and\n\n        3. Thoracic excursion as measured by the cloth tape measure technique? What changes in the\n           above pulmonary function in each group are found over time?"

Based on expert opinion in the field of MT, following a series of massage treatments administered over time, one can anticipate tissue changes. By adding time between treatments, data will describe the ability of subjects to maintain changes over progressively longer periods of time.  Treatment protocol will be based on the application of myofascial trigger point therapy (Timberlake, 1999) to musculoskeletal areas of the body often affected by disease progression in CF.",
