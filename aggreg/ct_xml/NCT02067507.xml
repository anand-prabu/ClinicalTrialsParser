      Purpose:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate, in a randomized trial, a theoretically driven
      intervention to increase receipt of the HPV vaccine among low-income, ethnic-minority girls
      in Los Angeles County.  The primary outcome of interest is HPV vaccine uptake at 3 months
      following the multi-component intervention.  The study also seeks to characterize
      HPV-related knowledge, beliefs, and barriers in the target population, and understand
      mediators (e.g. knowledge, barriers reduction) and moderators (e.g. level of acculturation)
      of the intervention effect.

      The multi-component intervention consists of a brief individually-tailored telephone
      education session, referral to a clinic offering low cost/free vaccine, and a mailed
      brochure tailored to each participant's ethnicity, language, and insurance status.  The
      effect of the intervention will be tested in 1000 low-income, ethnic-minority women in Los
      Angeles County.

      All women screened for participation in the study will be recruited through the Los Angeles
      County Department of Public Health's Office of Women's Health (OWH) telephone hotline and
      invited to complete the screening questions.

      Immediately following the screening, all eligible participants will be asked to complete the
      baseline survey. Randomization will occur at the level of the week. Participants calling
      during weeks assigned to the intervention condition will receive the intervention
      immediately following the baseline survey. Participants calling during control weeks will
      receive the baseline survey and be mailed a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
      (CDC)-developed brochure about the HPV vaccine in English and their preferred language.

      All participants will be interviewed at 3 and 9 months after completion of the baseline
      survey to assess self-reported HPV vaccine status of their youngest age-eligible girl.

      The primary study hypothesis is that the intervention group will have a higher rate of HPV
      vaccine uptake at 3-month follow-up based on self-report compared to the control group.

      Secondary hypotheses are:

      The intervention group will have a higher rate of HPV vaccine completion at 9-month
      follow-up compared to the control group.

      The intervention group will have higher knowledge of HPV and the HPV vaccine than the
      control group.

      The intervention will exert its effect on vaccine receipt by increasing knowledge and
      reducing barriers.
