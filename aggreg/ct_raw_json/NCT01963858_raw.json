Several methods have been used to\n      minimize patient discomfort, including the use of paediatric colonoscopes, variable\n      stiffness colonoscopes, gastroscopes, music, audio distraction, or simply allowing the\n      patients to participate in administration of medication. Although a potential benefit from\n      some of these methods has been suggested, no clear recommendations have been made so far. We\n      hypothesized functional relaxation reduces discomfort during colonoscopy."
