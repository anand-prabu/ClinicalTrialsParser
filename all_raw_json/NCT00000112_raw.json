Excess adiposity is\n      more than just a cosmetic problem, having substantial metabolic consequences.

In this study the prevalence of impaired glucose (carbohydrate)\n      tolerance in lean children with a family history of diabetes and obese children with\n      acanthosis nigricans with or without a family history of diabetes mellitus will be studied."
