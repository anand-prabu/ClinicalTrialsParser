            "textblock": "Postoperative delirium is a common complication in critically ill patients after surgery.\n      Its occurrence is associated with poorer prognosis of the patients. The pathophysiology of\n      delirium remains poorly understood. A universal phenomenon is that delirium was frequently\n      identified in elderly patients after major complicated surgery, but was rarely noted after\n      minor ambulatory surgery (such as cataract surgery). This indicated that stress response\n      produced by surgery might have an important role in the pathogenesis of delirium. It has\n      been reported that, when compared with general anesthesia and postoperative intravenous\n      analgesia, neuraxial anesthesia and analgesia reduced the occurrence of postoperative\n      complications and mortality in high risk patients. Combined epidural-general anesthesia is\n      frequently used in clinical practice. This anesthesia method provides advantages of both\n      epidural and general anesthesia, i.e. it blocks the afferent pathway of nociceptive stimulus\n      by neuraxial blockade during and after surgery, and allows patients to endure lengthy\n      complicated operations without any awareness. The investigators hypothesize that combined\n      epidural-general anesthesia and postoperative epidural analgesia can decrease the incidence\n      of postoperative delirium and, thus, improve the prognosis of critically ill elderly\n      patients undergoing major surgery. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of\n      combined epidural-general anesthesia/postoperative epidural analgesia and general\n      anesthesia/postoperative intravenous analgesia on the incidence of postoperative delirium in\n      elderly patients undergoing major surgery."

            "textblock": "Delirium is a transient mental syndrome of acute onset characterized by global impairment of\n      cognitive functions, reduced level of consciousness, abnormalities of attention, increased\n      or decreased psychomotor activity, and disordered sleep-wake cycle. Postoperative delirium\n      is a common complication in critically ill patients after surgery. Dyer et al reviewed 80\n      primary studies and found that the mean incidence of postoperative delirium is about 36.8%\n      (range 0%-73.5%) after surgery. It occurred in up to 80% of patients in the ICU. Our recent\n      studies found that the incidence of postoperative delirium occurring in patients at the SICU\n      was 51.0% after cardiac surgery and 44.5% after non-cardiac surgery.\n\n      The occurrence of postoperative delirium is associated with poorer prognosis of the\n      patients. Studies showed that delirious patients had prolonged ICU stay, increased incidence\n      of complications, prolonged hospitalization, high mortality rate, and increased health care\n      costs. Delirium is also associated with increased risk of long-term cognitive decline and\n      poor quality of life. A recent follow-up study (mean follow-up time 27.9 \u00b1 3.1 months) by\n      our research group found that, after adjusting factors such as age, occurrence of\n      postoperative complications, and stage of malignant tumors, etc, the occurrence of\n      postoperative delirium still remained an independent predictor of long-term mortality in\n      patients.\n\n      The pathophysiology of delirium remains poorly understood. A universal phenomenon is that\n      delirium was frequently identified in elderly patients after major complicated surgery, but\n      was rarely noted after minor ambulatory surgery (such as cataract surgery). Studies also\n      found that postoperative pain was an independent risk factor of delirium, and effective pain\n      relief may help to reduce the incidence of delirium. Our recent studies of patients\n      undergoing cardiac or non-cardiac surgeries both showed that high serum cortisol level was\n      an independent predictor of postoperative delirium. In addition, inflammatory response may\n      also contribute to the pathogenesis of delirium. Trauma, pain, cortisol secretion and\n      inflammation are all important components of surgical stress response. The above results\n      indicated that stress response produced by surgery might have an important role in the\n      pathogenesis of delirium.\n\n      Previous studies demonstrated that, when compared with general anesthesia, neuraxial\n      anesthesia attenuated the hypersecretion of cortisol, and decreased the intensity of\n      inflammatory response more effectively after surgery. And epidural analgesia provided better\n      postoperative pain relief than intravenous analgesia. It was also reported that, when\n      compared with general anesthesia and intravenous analgesia, neuraxial anesthesia and\n      analgesia reduced the occurrence of postoperative complications and mortality in high risk\n      patients. Combined epidural-general anesthesia is frequently used in clinical practice, and\n      is performed in about 1/4 of patients undergoing surgery in the applicant's hospital.\n      Theoretically, this anesthesia method provides advantages of both epidural and general\n      anesthesia, i.e. it blocks the afferent pathway of nociceptive stimulus by neuraxial\n      blockade during and after surgery, and allow patients to endure lengthy complicated\n      operations without any awareness. However, because of the limitations of study methods and\n      sample size, there were no clear answers to date on the difference between the incidences of\n      postoperative delirium after general versus regional anesthesia. And there is no evidence\n      whether combined epidural-general anesthesia can decrease the incidence of postoperative\n      delirium and, thus, improve the prognosis of critically ill elderly patients undergoing\n      major abdominal surgery.\n\n      The objective of the study is to compare the effects of combined epidural-general anesthesia\n      and general anesthesia on the incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly patients\n      undergoing major surgery."
