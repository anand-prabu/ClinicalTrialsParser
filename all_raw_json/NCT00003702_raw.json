Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I: Patients receive methotrexate intramuscularly once weekly in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      ARM II: Patients receive dactinomycin IV over 15 minutes every 2 weeks in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All patients continue on treatment until 1\n      beta human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) titer is below the institutional normal.
