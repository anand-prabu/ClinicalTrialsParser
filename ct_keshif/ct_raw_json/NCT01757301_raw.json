            "textblock": "Pain is the most common presenting symptom in medical outpatients, and depression and\n      anxiety are the two most common mental disorders.  All three conditions are often\n      inadequately treated and result in substantial disability, reduced health-related quality of\n      life, and increased health care costs and utilization.  Additionally, pain, anxiety, and\n      depression (PAD) are frequently comorbid with one another and have reciprocal negative\n      effects on treatment response and additive effects on adverse health outcomes.  The PAD\n      triad is especially burdensome in Veterans, with their high prevalence of chronic pain,\n      depression, PTSD, and other anxiety disorders. The Comprehensive vs. Assisted Management of\n      Mood and Physical Symptoms (CAMMPS) study is a randomized comparative effectiveness trial\n      designed to test the relative effectiveness of a lower-resource vs. a higher-resource\n      enhancement of usual primary care in the management of veterans suffering from with pain\n      plus comorbid anxiety and/or depression."

Patients followed in primary care\n      clinics at the Roudebush VAMC will be eligible if they have clinically significant levels of\n      pain plus comorbid anxiety and/or depression.  A total of 300 eligible patients who provide\n      informed consent will be randomized to one of two treatment arms.  One group (n=150) will\n      receive assisted symptom management (ASM) consisting of automated symptom monitoring by\n      interactive voice recording or Internet and prompted pain self-management guided by symptom\n      levels. The second group (n=150) will receive comprehensive symptom management (CSM) which\n      combines ASM with optimized medication management delivered by a nurse-physician specialist\n      team and facilitated mental health care. This team will partner with both VA primary care\n      physicians and psychologists embedded in primary care to monitor and adjust treatments using\n      evidence-based analgesic and antidepressant algorithms, reinforced self-management, and care\n      coordination. We postulate that although both interventions are likely to be beneficial, CSM\n      will be superior to ASM.\n\n      In short, this trial compares: 1) usual care plus assisted symptom management (ASM) vs. 2)\n      usual care plus ASM plus optimized medication and care management and facilitated mental\n      health care (CSM).  Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The\n      primary outcome is a composite pain-anxiety-depression severity score. Secondary outcomes\n      include individual pain, anxiety, and depression scores; functional status and\n      health-related quality of life; treatment satisfaction; and perceived barriers and\n      facilitators of the CSM and ASM interventions.  The rationale for ASM is preliminary\n      evidence of its effectiveness and its lower use of resources. The rationale for CSM is that\n      the addition of optimized medication management, facilitated mental health care, and\n      coordination with both primary care physicians/PACTs and psychologists for the PAD symptoms\n      should substantially enhance the benefits of ASM."
