Physical activity module was based on a theoretical approach of physical activity benefits and risks for health, children's physical fitness and activity patterns, physical education and change behavior models. In each meeting the PE professionals, performed PE classes with the classroom teachers as students, focusing in strategies to keep them in movement for the most of PE class time to stimulate students' joint participation instead of individual participation or games."

The videotapes analysis set the level of student's physical activity, teacher's attitude, and the class context.

We analyzed and discussed the change in children's Physical Activity Level and Energy Expenditure before and after the Educational Intervention to classroom teachers, with a six weeks interval.",
