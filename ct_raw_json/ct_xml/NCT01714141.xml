  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study's main goal is to develop and preliminarily test a technology-based
      intervention to improve asthma medication adherence in urban African American emerging
      adults (ages 18-29).  It is hypothesized that youth randomized to MCTI for adherence will
      show improvements in motivation to adhere to asthma medications and self-reported adherence
      compared to the comparison condition at 1- and 3- month follow up.

      This study is collecting pilot data with a sample of 80 African American emerging adults
      with asthma with suboptimal medication adherence. Half of the sample are randomized to
      receive a multi-component technology-based intervention (MCTI) targeting adherence to daily
      controller medication. The MCTI consists of two components: 1) 2 sessions of
      computer-delivered motivational interviewing targeting medication adherence, and 2)
      individualized text messaging focused on medication adherence between the sessions. Text
      messages are individualized based on Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). The remaining
      half of participants complete a series of computer-delivered asthma education modules
      matched for length, location, and method of delivery of the intervention session.  Control
      participants also receive text messages between intervention sessions. Message content is
      the same for all control participants and contain general facts about asthma (not tailored).

        self-report of &lt;80% medication adherence in the past 30 days, self-report of emergency
        room visit/hospitalization for asthma in the past 6 months, or a poor score on the Asthma
        Control Test.

        Participant must be able to complete questionnaires in English Participant must own or
        have access to a cellular phone for the duration of the study No exclusions will be made
        due to co-morbid mental health problems (i.e. ADHD, depression) except thought disorders
        (i.e. schizophrenia, autism), suicidality or mental retardation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Individuals with other chronic health conditions requiring ongoing medical intervention (
        e.g., HIV, Type II Diabetes) will be excluded.
