  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxford Pharmascience (the sponsor) is developing a new formulation of Ibuprofen (OXP001 -
      the study drug) which it is proposed will have less of the side effects than are currently
      reported with standard prescription strength Ibuprofen.

      This study will compare the study drug to an already marketed formulation of  prescription
      strength Ibuprofen (the reference product) by looking at how the drug is taken up by the
      body and also by performing a specialist procedure called an endoscopy (or more specifically
      a gastroscopy). The safety and tolerability of the study drug will also be assessed.

      The study will involve approximately 44 healthy male and female subjects. Subjects will be
      randomly assigned to receive either the study drug or reference product for 8 days. On Day
      1, subjects will receive a single 800 mg dose of ibuprofen. On Days 2 to 9, subjects will
      receive 800 mg ibuprofen three times a day.
