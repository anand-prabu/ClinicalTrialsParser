Chief among these is the delay between initiation of pharmacologic therapy\n      and clinical improvement in symptoms. Recently ketamine, an NDMA-receptor antagonist has\n      been shown to rapidly and effectively reverse the symptoms of MDD.  Nitrous oxide, another\n      NMDA-receptor antagonist, may produce the same effect with a cleaner side-effect profile and\n      perhaps without the need for intravenous access and anesthesia personnel. Therefore, we\n      propose conducting a pilot randomized placebo controlled double-blind crossover study in\n      which patients will receive up to 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen or up to 50% oxygen in air for\n      a period of one hour in addition to standard medical therapy. Depression severity will be\n      assessed by a blinded observer pre-treatment, 30 minutes and 2 hours post treatment using\n      the Hamilton depression rating scale."
