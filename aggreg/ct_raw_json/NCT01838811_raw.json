            "textblock": "This pilot study will document the efficacy of a behavioral intervention for Processing\n      Speed (PS) in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Speed of Processing Training (SPT), which has\n      been successful used in the aging population in several studies. This study will (1) apply a\n      treatment protocol for PS impairments, well-validated in aging, to persons with TBI with\n      impaired PS, and document its efficacy on standard neuropsychological (NP) tests (2) assess\n      the effectiveness of the intervention utilizing global measures of daily life, including an\n      objective measure (TIADL) (3) examine the long term impact of SPT. This study is unique in\n      that it will be the first to evaluate the efficacy of a highly-manualized structured\n      behavioral treatment for processing speed deficits in persons with TBI utilizing the optimal\n      methodology for carrying out such studies, a randomized clinical trial. Given the prevalence\n      of PS deficits in the TBI population and the significant impact such deficits have on\n      everyday functioning, public safety, and overall quality of life, the identification of an\n      effective intervention for PS deficits in TBI could have a profound impact on the population\n      and society as a whole."
