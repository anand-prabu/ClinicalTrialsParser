  <brief_summary>

      The null hypothesis of no difference in CR% at 3 months between the arms will be tested
      against the alternative of a difference in CR% at an alpha level of .05 by assessing the
      odds ratio for arm yielded by this model.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a superiority trial aiming to increase the 3 month complete response rate. The
      sample size is calculated on the hypothesis that the experimental treatment will increase
      the 3 months response rate up to 21% (by 3 folds, based on the 7% reported in Scheinberg et
      al [17]). Under these assumptions, the sample size to reject the null hypothesis is n=96
      patients for each treatment arm, increased by 4% for possibly not evaluable patients (total
      number of 200 patients, 100 each treatment arm). Statistical design for sample size
      calculation: increase from 7% (control arm) to 21% (investigational arm) in 3 month complete
      response rate (two-sided binomial test); alpha-error 0.05; power 0.8.

             Absolute neutrophil counts &lt;0.5 x 109/L (severe) or &lt;0.2 x 109/L (very severe)
             Platelet counts &lt;20 x 109/L Reticulocyte counts &lt;60 x 109/L Hypocellular bone marrow
             (&lt;30% cellularity), without evidences of fibrosis or malignant cells

          2. Male or female age &gt; 14 years;

          3. Written informed consent

          4. Willing and able to comply with all of the requirements and visits in the protocol

          5. Understands that they can be randomised to either treatment arm

          6. Negative pregnancy test for women of child bearing age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior immunosuppressive therapy with ATG (horse of rabbit) or any other lymphocyte
             depleting agent (i.e., alemtuzumab)

          2. Eligibility to a sibling allogeneic stem cell transplantation

          3. Evidence of a myelodysplastic syndrome, defined by the presence of myelodysplastic
             features, excess of blasts or karyotypic abnormalities typical of MDS (according to
             revised WHO 2008 criteria) [30],, as well as other primitive marrow disease. Patients
             with diagnosis of AA with cytogenetic abnormalities which are recurrent in MDS
             (according to revised WHO 2008 criteria) [30] should be included in this category,
             and are not eligible for the study; patients with del(20q), +8 and -Y are not
             included in this category, and thus are eligible for this study. The list of
             karyotypic abnormalities which qualifies for the diagnosis of MDS are listed in the
             Appendix.

          4. History or clinical suspect of constitutional aplastic anemia (i.e. Fanconi Anemia
             with positive DEB/MMC test or Dyskeratosis Congenita)

          5. History of malignant tumors with active disease within 5 years from enrollment,
             and/or previous chemo-radiotherapy

          6. Previous history of stem cell transplantation

          7. Treatment with cyclosporin A &lt;2 weeks before enrollment

          8. Treatment with G-CSF &lt;2 weeks before enrollment

         10. WHO performance status ≥3

         11. Pregnant or breast feeding patients

         12. Patients with hepatic, renal or cardiac failure, or any other life- threatening
             concurrent disease

         13. Patients with HIV infection

         14. Patients without social health care assistance

         15. Patients for whom there is no availability of horse-ATG (ATGAM)

         16. Participation in another clinical trial within 1 month before the start of this trial

         17. Patients and/or female partners of male patients not using highly effective method of
             birth control i.e. intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal (oral pill, injection,
             implants), tubal ligation or partner's vasectomy

         18. subjects with known hypersensitivity to any of the component medications

        The presence of a Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria clone is not an exclusion criterion.
