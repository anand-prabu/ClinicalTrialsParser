    <textblock>
      Age-related hearing loss, or presbyacusis, is one of the most common chronically handicapped
      conditions for the elderly. Many factors including genetics, diet, diseases, drugs,
      socioeconomic factors and environmental variables were considered to be related to the
      development of presbyacusis. Evidences have shown that genetic factors play an important
      role on presbyacusis. However, which genes or their genotypes are associated with
      presbycusis remain unknown.

      The aim of this project was to evaluate the association between the genotype of candidate
      genes and presbyacusis by cross-section and case-control study. In the first stage, the
      investigators plan to select 700 healthy subjects older than 50 with symmetric,
      sensorineural hearing loss. The subjects will receive basic otologic examination, pure tone
      audiometry, questionnaire, and genotype analysis. Because gender and age would affect
      hearing loss significantly, The investigators will convert the hearing level of all subjects
      into a gender and age independent Z-score according to ISO 7029 standard. And, The
      investigators define subjects within higher 30 % of Z-score as the presbyacusis group, and
      subjects within lower 30% of Z-score as the control group. Finally, The investigators
      perform Chi square analysis to test the association between genotype of candidate genes or
      their combinations in both groups, and calculate the odds ratio for presbyacusis between
      different genotype of candidate genes. Further more, we will evaluate the effect of genotype
      of candidate genes, environment factors, and gene-environmental interaction on the severity
      of presbyacusis by multivariate logistic regression.

      In the second stage, The investigators wish to know the pattern of genotype and hearing
      level in the high risk families, according to results from the first stage, by description
      and case-control study. The investigators will perform t-test to evaluate the difference of
      Z-score in both groups. Besides, The investigators try to evaluate the effects of genotypes,
      environment factors, and gene-environmental interaction on hearing level in high risk
      families by multivariate logistic regression.
