  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the Western
      World. The etiology and pathogenesis of this disease remain largely unknown. In Europe about
      two million people suffer from AMD. According to the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS)
      the disease can be classified into early, intermediate and late. Early age-related macular
      degeneration is characterized by the presence of small or medium-sized drusen and/or retinal
      pigmentary abnormalities. Intermediate age-related macular degeneration is characterized by
      large drusen or numerous medium-size drusen and/or geographic atrophy not extending to the
      center of the macula. Late age-related macular degeneration can be either atrophic with
      extension to the macula or neovascular. The late form of the disease is associated with a
      pronounced loss of visual acuity.

      In the recent years several studies focused on risk factors for late AMD and a recent
      systematic review and meta-analysis reported risk factors for AMD based on 16 studies in
      almost 114000 subjects. Strong and consistent associations with late AMD for found for
      increasing age, current cigarette smoking, previous cataract surgery, and a family history
      of AMD. Consistent associations between late AMD and higher body mass index, history of
      cardiovascular disease, hypertension and higher plasma fibrinogen were also found, but the
      association was weak. Inconsistent associations were found for gender, ethnicity, diabetes,
      iris color, history of cerebrovascular disease, serum total and HDL cholesterol and
      triglyceride levels.

      Evidence has also accumulated that other factors influence the risk for AMD. Several genetic
      risk factors have been identified in the last years including genes in the alternative
      complement pathway and the RMS2/HTRA1 region. In addition, post-hoc analysis of data from
      the AREDS study has indicated that reduced intake of the omega-3 free fatty acids
      eicosapentaenoic acid and docsahexaenoic acid are associated with the risk of late AMD
      thereby supporting previous population based studies. The AREDS study also revealed that
      reduced intake of the macular pigment lutein and zeaxanthin may be associated with late AMD,
      again supporting previous population-based studies. Finally, 2 small studies indicate that
      reduced choroidal blood flow is associated with an increased risk of developing late AMD.

      Less data are available for the progression of early or intermediate AMD and the associated
      risk factors. This is at least partially related to the problems in quantifying progression
      of drusen size and volume. In the recent years, however, significant efforts have been
      achieved in optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based methods for quantifying drusen
      progression and drusen volume. Polarization-sensitive OCT is the most promising of these
      approaches and will be used to quantify drusen area and volume in the present study.
