The prevalence has\n      been overcome the epithelial ovarian cancer because of the change of life style to western\n      style recently. Most patients with endometrial cancer are stage I & II, the most histology\n      is still \"endometrioid adenocarcinoma\" (type I endometrial cancer). In statistics, advanced\n      stage (FIGO stage III and IV) is approximately 16% of all cases.\n\n      Most patients has good outcome of endometrial cancer because their surgical stage is\n      belonged to \"early stage\". However, the recurrence, distant metastases and mortality are\n      high if the diseases is confirmed to be advanced stage. The adjuvant therapies after\n      staging/debulking operation are systemic chemotherapy and whole pelvic radiation therapy/\n      brachytherapy. Whether the adjuvant therapy can cure the disease of not is still\n      controversial.\n\n      Because of the rarity of the advanced endometrial cancer, varies adjuvant therapeutic\n      modalities, eg. chemotherapy only, pelvic radiation therapy only, combination of\n      chemotherapy and radiation therapy or sequential \"sandwich\" therapy were ever used for such\n      group patients in each medical center. But the case number is insufficient and limited to\n      show the survival or progression free benefit during the statistics. Besides, the surgical\n      procedures and adjuvant therapy for early endometrial cancer is still remained to be\n      determined. The investigators are also interested to analyze the factors affecting their\n      survival.\n\n      The investigators will perform a retrospective study to review the data of patients with\n      endometrial cancer in Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology in Far Eastern Memorial\n      Hospital."
