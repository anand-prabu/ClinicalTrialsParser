  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Transeuro Transplant study is a trial which will involve grafting foetal tissue into the
      brain of patients with Parkinson's disease, who are already been followed in the
      observational study. The tissue inserted in the brain is to help replace and rebuild lost
      dopamine from the brain due to Parkinson's disease. Only 20 patients will be selected for
      the transplant.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must meet ALL of the following criteria to be considered for the enrolment
             into this study:

               -  PD as defined using Queen's Square Brain Bank criteria.

               -  Disease duration ≥ 2 years and ≤ 11 years.

               -  Aged ≥ 30 years and ≤ 68 years at the time of grafting.

               -  Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage 2.5 or better when 'on'.

               -  On standard anti PD medication without significant LIDs defined as a score of &gt;2
                  on the AIMS dyskinesia rating scale, in any body part.

               -  Patients must be right handed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any of the following will exclude patients from being enrolled in the study:

               -  Atypical or secondary parkinsonism including F-DOPA PET patterns consistent with
                  this.

               -  Clinically significant response to Levodopa (as evaluated by the clinician)
                  and/or apomorphine challenge.

               -  Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of less than 26.

               -  Unable to do normal copying of interlocking pentagons and semantic fluency score
                  for naming animals of less than 20 over 90 seconds as these have recently been
                  associated with the earlier onset of dementia in PD.

               -  Ongoing major medical or psychiatric disorder including depression and
                  psychosis.

               -  Other concomitant treatment with neuroleptics (inc. Atypical neuroleptics) and
                  cholinesterase inhibitors.

               -  Significant drug induced dyskinesia defined as a score of &gt;2 on the AIMS
                  dyskinesia rating scale, in any body part.

               -  Previous neurosurgery, cell therapy or organ transplantation.

               -  Unable to be imaged using MRI.

               -  Any contraindication to immunosuppression therapy.

               -  Patients on anticoagulants

               -  Patients who are left handed
