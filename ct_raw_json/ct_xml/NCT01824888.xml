    <textblock>
      JUC is a commercially available wound care spray. It is evaluated for the efficacy when
      using as a hygienic hand rub following the protocol described in the European standard EN
      1500:1997 &quot;Chemical disinfectants and antiseptics - Hygienic handrub - Test method and
      requirement (phase 2/step 2)&quot;. A crossover study to compare the JUC solution with 60% (v/v)
      propan-2-ol by using Escherichia coli K12 NCTC strain 10538 as test organism.

    <textblock>
      Before the intervention, the bactericidal activity of JUC was validated in accordance with
      the prEN 12054. A total of 15 volunteers were recruited, hands were washed immediately prior
      to the intervention. Then, both hands of each volunteer were immersed into a contamination
      fluid of E. coli. Then, hand rub was performed with JUC or alcohol. Culture samples were
      collected before and after the hand rub by rubbing the fingertips and thumb tips of each
      hand ont he base of a Petri dish containing appropriate medium. The culture inoculation,
      incubation, appropriate dilutions, and colony count were performed.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Colony forming units on hands from pre-value (baseline) to post-value</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-value (baseline) as 0 minutes: at the time after handwashing and before application of JUC or alcohol;  Post-value at 5 minutes after the baseline: as after hand contamination, application of JUC or alcohol and drying of hands</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Pre-value and post-value were collected by rubbing the fingertips and thumb tips of each hand for 1 minute on the base of a Petri dish containing medium. Then the samples with appropriate dilutions were plated onto agar plates for incubation, and colony forming units of the plates were counted.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of colony forming units on hands from baseline to 8 hours after hand rubbing with JUC</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-value (baseline) at 0 hour: at the first time after applicaiton of JUC and challenged by the bacteria; Post-values measured at each hour (1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and 8 hours) after the initial application of JUC and bacterial challenge at every hour</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>JUC was applied after handwashing, an invisible protective frame will be formed on treated hands. Samples were collected for culture each hour after the challenge of the E. coli contamination fluid.Pre-value and post-value were collected by rubbing the fingertips and thumb tips of each hand for 1 minute on the base of a Petri dish containing medium. Then the samples with appropriate dilutions were plated onto agar plates for incubation, and colony forming units of the plates were counted.</description>
