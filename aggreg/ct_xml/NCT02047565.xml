    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 study consists of 2 parts.  Part 1 will be an open-label, randomized, 2
      treatment, 2-way crossover study.  Part 2 will be a double-blind (Sponsor unblinded),
      randomized, placebo controlled, sequential descending prothrombin complex concentrate dose,
      2 sequence, 2 period crossover study.  In both parts of the study, the assessor of BD and BV
      will remain blinded.  In Part 2 of the study, both the subject and the clinic staff involved
      in study conduct will be blinded (with the exception of the pharmacist or nurse who prepares
      the blinded individual treatments from open-label supplies).  The study programmer and
      statistician will also be blinded to treatment assignment.  The Sponsor will remain
      unblinded for both parts of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy subjects between 18 and 45 years of age, with a body mass index between 18
             and 30 kg/m2, and weighing ≤ 110 kg.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of childbearing potential without proper contraceptive measures and women who
             are pregnant or breastfeeding.  Women of childbearing potential who participate in
             the study must agree to use proper contraceptive measures from screening through 13
             weeks after the last dose of study drug.

          -  Subjects with history of unexplained syncope.  Subjects who have prior clearance of
             vasovagal events may be included.

          -  Subjects who have used any drugs or substances known to be strong inhibitors or
             strong inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4/5 enzymes or P-glycoprotein within 28
             days prior to the first dosing.

          -  Subjects who have used any other nonprescription drugs (including herbal
             supplemental), except acetaminophen (up to 3 g/day) within 14 days prior to check-in.

          -  Subjects with history of major bleeding, major trauma, or major surgical procedure of
             any type within 6 months of dosing.

          -  Subjects with history of peptic ulcer, gastrointestinal bleeding (including
             hematemesis, melena, and rectal bleeding), or bleeding from hemorrhoids.

          -  Subjects with history of minor bleeding episodes such as epistaxis, rectal bleeding
             (spots of blood on toilet paper), and gingival bleeding within 3 months before the
             first dose.

          -  Subjects who have any family history, suspected or documented, of coagulopathy.

          -  Subjects who have participated in a previous edoxaban study within 6 months prior to
             the first dose.

          -  Subjects who used anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, low molecular weight heparin),
             antiplatelet agents (eg, clopidogrel), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and/or
             acetylsalicylic acid 30 days prior to punch biopsy or who expect to use these during
             the study.

          -  Subjects with hemoglobin levels below 12 g/dL (men) or 11 g/dL (women) at screening.

          -  Subjects with creatinine clearance ≤ 80 mL/min (based on the Cockcroft-Gault
             equation).

          -  Subjects who are considered inappropriate for the punch biopsy procedure based on
             inability to visualize surface blood vessels, and history or likelihood of forming
             keloid scars.

          -  Subjects with known heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

          -  Subjects who have a platelet count, PT, or INR outside of the normal range at
             baseline.

          -  Subjects with history or current evidence of clinically significant cardiac, hepatic,
             renal, pulmonary, endocrine, neurologic, infectious, gastrointestinal, hematologic,
             or oncologic disease as determined by screening history, physical examination,
             laboratory test results, or 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG).

        In addition, for Part 2:

          -  Subjects who are deficient in Factor V Leiden mutation.

          -  Subjects who are deficient in protein S, protein C, antithrombin, or factor II, or
             have prothrombin 20210A mutation.

          -  Subjects with known anaphylactic or severe systemic reactions to Beriplex P/N or any
             components in Beriplex P/N including heparin; FII, FVII, FIX, and FX; proteins C and
             S; antithrombin III; and human albumin.

          -  Subjects with current or history of disseminated intravascular coagulation.
