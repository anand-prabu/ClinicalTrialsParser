            "textblock": "Acute pain service (APS) was introduced in 1990s at Queen Mary Hospital (QMH) as other\n      countries. With accumulation of experience and clinical evidence, APS has been well\n      established. A study conducted in 1997 suggested that monitoring, management protocol and\n      nursing experience were mandatory to the safety for APS. Our recent study showed that pain\n      relief of our post-operative patients using patient controlled analgesic with morphine was\n      still not adequate. The results has driven us to continue the improvement of post-operative\n      outcomes for our surgical patients. Tolerability and safety are always our concerns for\n      patients using our APS. Therefore, the investigators aim to conduct this retrospective study\n      in order to assess if the tolerability and safety of our present APS are adequate or not.\n      The study results will help us to further improve our APS at QMH if necessary."
