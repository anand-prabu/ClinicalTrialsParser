  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study of CUDC-907 in patients with refractory
      or relapsed lymphoma or multiple myeloma. CUDC-907 is a multi-targeted agent designed to
      inhibit phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)and histone deacetylase (HDAC). The study is
      designed to assess the safety, including the maximum tolerated dose, the pharmacokinetics,
      and the anti-cancer activity of CUDC-907.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, multi-center dose-escalation trial evaluating the safety and
      tolerability of CUDC-907 as a single agent administered orally, once daily, to patients with
      relapsed or refractory lymphoma or multiple myeloma.  Multiple dosing schedules will be
      examined in parallel study arms, including: (i) continuous once daily, (ii) once daily on
      Mondays and Thursdays (M-Th), and (iii) once daily on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays (MWF).

      Sequential dose escalation cohorts of oral CUDC-907 are planned.  Subject enrollment and
      dose escalation will proceed according to a standard 3+3 design.  In the absence of DLT,
      each subject will be treated for a minimum of 21 days of continuous daily dosing, and may
      continue to receive additional treatment until disease progression has been documented or
      other treatment discontinuation criteria have been met. No intrasubject dose escalation will
      be allowed.  An MTD expansion cohort of up to 12 evaluable subjects may also be enrolled in
      order to better define the safety, tolerability and activity of the study treatment.

      Safety and tolerability will be assessed by the incidence and severity of adverse events as
      determined by NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.03).

      The antitumor activity of study treatment will be assessed according to standard response
      criteria as appropriate for each individual subject's tumor type (e.g., Revised Response
      Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma and the International Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple
      Myeloma).

      Exploratory biological markers of activity will be assessed in PBMC, plasma and tissue
      specimens (hair follicle, skin, tumor and bone marrow samples, where available).
