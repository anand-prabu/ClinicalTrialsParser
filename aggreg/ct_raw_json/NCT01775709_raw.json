            "textblock": "Otitis media is the most common illness in children and 5% to 10% of their symptom cause by\n      fluids in their middle ear . The OME can cause hearing loss included poor development of\n      speech and poor communication.\n\n      The surgical procedure is considered simple and relatively safe, but several complications\n      may occur after Pressure Equalizing tube insertion. The most prevalent complications are\n      otorrhea, biofilm and formation of retraction pockets. Otorrhea occurs in 30% to 83% of\n      children with tube and is mainly due bacterial contamination of the middle ear either from\n      external ear canal or impaired Eustachian tube. Swimming can facilitate the entry of\n      bacteria into the middle ear from the ear canal through the PE tubes, and this assumption is\n      reinforced by the statistically significant association between the rate of otorrhea and the\n      non-utilization of ear plugs in children who swim (from 47% in children who used ear plugs\n      to 56% in those who did not)."
