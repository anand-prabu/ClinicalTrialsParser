    <description>Each whole body vibration session will consist of a 20 min timed stand on the vibration platform where participants will stand with their knees in a slightly flexed position (120°) while the plate oscillates.  The vibration frequency will be set at ranges between 20-40Hz and the amplitude set at 2mm displacement.</description>

    <description>Participants will perform a video-delivered stretching and relaxation routine designed to relieve tension and stress.  This class will consist of a variety of floor-based stretching exercises (involving upper body, trunk, and lower extremities), breathing techniques, progressive relaxation, and exercise related to visualization and imagery.</description>
