To date, no clinical data are available on\n      the interaction of concomitant tumor treating fields with radiation therapy either with or\n      without bevacizumab. TTF and radiation both have the potential to enhance the other's\n      therapeutic ratio though synergistic mechanisms of action.  The addition of bevacizumab to\n      this regimen has both therapeutic and improved-toxicity implications. A trial combining\n      NovoTTF-100A with the proven regimen of HFSRT and bevacizumab for recurrent glioblastoma\n      affords an avenue to demonstrate safety in a population who may more readily derive a\n      benefit from novel multimodality therapy and explore the potential for synergistic effect.\n      The endpoint of efficacy would clearly need to be more definitively addressed in a future\n      categorical trial, which would be the logical positive outcome of this pilot study."
