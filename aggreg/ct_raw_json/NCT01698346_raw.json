Different strategies are possible to close the gap of susceptibility\n      between the loss of maternal antibodies and protection by vaccination. The main aim of the\n      present study is to measure the influence of an adult pertussis booster in pregnant women,\n      on the titer and duration of maternal antibodies in their infants. Early humoral immunity\n      will be assessed and the influence on vaccine response of the infant measured. The present\n      study offers the  opportunity to have new insights in neonatal immunological mechanisms\n      against pertussis and a better understanding in strategies to protect infants against\n      pertussis."
