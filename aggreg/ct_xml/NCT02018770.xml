  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to evaluate the effect of phototherapy with the combination of
      different sources of light on pain, activity of temporal and masseter muscles, bilateral and
      joint mobility in subjects with TMD. It will be  made a  randomized, placebo-controlled and
      double-blind clinical trial. Individuals participate with myogenic temporomandibular
      disorder, being allocated into 4 groups randomly and stratified by the method of sealed
      envelopes. The results will be evaluated using: RDC/TMD, digital caliper, electromyography,
      and visual analog scale and algometry. The protocols will be used in a single session and
      will be evaluated in four different moments. The variables that will be investigated are
      pain, muscle activity and joint mobility. The analyses of the data will be performed by
      adopting a significance level of 5%.
