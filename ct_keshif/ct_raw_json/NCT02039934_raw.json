            "textblock": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial metabolic disease that is characterized by\n      reduced insulin sensitivity and insulin production leading to impaired glucose tolerance.\n      Overweight and low physical activity are the main risk factors for the development of type 2\n      diabetes. Increased physical activity has shown to improve insulin sensitivity, hence,\n      exercise plays a significant role in the prevention and therapy of type 2 diabetes. This\n      study aims at investigating the acute and chronic effects of high-intensity low-volume\n      training, that consists of brief bursts of very vigorous exercise separated by recovery\n      periods, on metabolic function in patients with type 2 diabetes, people at high risk for the\n      disease and healthy, lean individuals. Study participants take part in 30 min training\n      session three times a week for a period of 12 weeks. Participants are studied on four\n      occasions, prior to the intervention, after an acute bout of exercise as well as after 6 and\n      12 weeks of training in order to assess physical fitness, body composition, insulin\n      sensitivity, energy metabolism in muscle, adipose tissue inflammation and neurological\n      function. It is hypothesized that this type of exercise leads to significant improvements in\n      insulin action and oxidative phosphorylation in muscle"
