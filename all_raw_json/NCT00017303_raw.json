IM-862 may kill tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor\n      and by stimulating a person's white blood cells to kill tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy\n      and IM-862 may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy\n      and IM-862 in treating patients who have resected stage III ovarian cancer or primary\n      peritoneal cancer."

Determine the complete pathologic response rate at second-look surgery in\n      patients with optimally resected stage III ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer\n      treated with adjuvant paclitaxel, carboplatin, and IM-862. II. Determine the safety profile\n      of this regimen in this patient population. III. Determine the incidence of infectious and\n      hematologic complications in patients treated with this regimen. IV. Determine the\n      progression-free survival of patients with no disease or minimal disease burden after\n      initial therapy, when treated with IM-862 consolidation therapy. V. Correlate angiogenesis\n      markers and immunologic parameters with response in patients treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified\n      according to participating center. Patients are randomized to one of three IM-862 doses.\n      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1.\n      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Treatment with IM-862 begins within 10 days of chemotherapy\n      initiation and continues until clinical evidence of disease progression or until 3 days\n      before second-look surgery. Arm I: Patients receive a low-dose of IM-862 and 2 placebo doses\n      intranasally daily. Arm II: Patients receive a medium-dose of IM-862 and 2 placebo doses as\n      in arm I. Arm III: Patients receive higher-dose IM-862 intranasally three times daily.\n      Patients undergo second-look surgery within 4-8 weeks after completion of the last course of\n      chemotherapy. Patients with a complete pathologic response or only microscopically\n      detectable residual disease receive consolidation therapy with IM-862, according to their\n      original treatment arm. Consolidation therapy begins within 3-14 days after second-look\n      surgery and continues for 24 weeks in the absence of disease progression. Patients are\n      followed at 6 and 12 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients (60 per arm) will be accrued for this study\n      within 1 year."
