The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of ramosetron for the prevention\n           of emesis and the control of nausea and vomiting despite of the prophylactic antiemetic\n           treatment during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation\n\n        2. The study hypothesis is that ramosetron is effective for the prevention of emesis and\n           control of emesis and/or vomiting that develop after the prophylactic antiemetic\n           therapy in the setting of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation"
