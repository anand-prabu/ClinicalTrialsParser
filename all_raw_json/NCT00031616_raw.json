Treatment repeats every 28\n           days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n           toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of NB1011 until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n        -  Phase II: Additional patients receive NB1011 at the MTD as in phase I. Patients are\n           followed at day 30 and then for 5 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 25 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of this\n      study. A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of this study."
