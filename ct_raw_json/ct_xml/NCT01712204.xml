  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Initiation of ULT for gout increases the occurrence of acute gouty arthritis flares due to
      mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. IL-1β plays a key role in mediating the
      inflammatory response in gouty arthritis. The efficacy of IL-1β blockade in the prophylaxis
      of gouty flares during initiation of ULT has been validated in multiple trials of IL-1β
      inhibitor therapies. Therefore, it is believed that IL-1β is a relevant therapeutic target
      for gout flares. AC-201 is an IL-1β modulator indicated for the treatment of osteoarthritis
      with good safety record and very few contraindications to the co-morbidities commonly among
      gout patients. AC-201 has also been demonstrated to have uric acid-lowering effects in
      clinical trials. The favorable product profile of AC-201 overall provides a strong rationale
      for investigating its clinical utility as prophylaxis against flares when initiating ULT.

    <textblock>
      Clinical trials have demonstrated that anti-IL-1 agents (IL-1Ra, IL-1 Trap, and anti-IL-1β
      monoclonal antibody) can reduce the frequency of gout flares during the initial period of
      treatment with urate-lowering therapy and prevent of gout flares in gout patients with
      frequent flares. AC-201 is an oral IL-1 modulator but with a mechanism distinct from that of
      existing anti-IL-1 agents. The active metabolite of AC-201 has been shown in vitro and in
      vivo to inhibit the production and activity of IL-1, down-regulate IL-1 receptors, and
      increase IL1-Ra. Molecular research further suggests that these effects are mediated
      upstream via inhibition of MAPK signaling pathways and binding of NF-κB and AP-1
      transcription factors that encode for a range of pro-inflammatory factors, including IL-1β,
      TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, iNOS, and MMPs, which have been implicated in gout flares. AC-201 has
      also been demonstrated to have uric acid-lowering effects in clinical trials. The favorable
      product profile of AC-201 overall provides a strong rationale for investigating its clinical
      utility as prophylaxis against flares when initiating ULT.
