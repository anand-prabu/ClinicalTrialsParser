            "textblock": "Restriction of dietary cholesterol, and thus the avoidance or restriction of egg intake, is\n      routinely recommended to patients at increased risk for CVD, including those with diabetes.\n      However, the relative importance of dietary cholesterol to serum lipids and the role of egg\n      ingestion in cardiovascular risk are increasingly suspect. Further, the exclusion of eggs\n      from the diet may lead to increased consumption of high-glycemic carbohydrate foods of\n      particular potential harm to individuals with diabetes. The examination of how food-specific\n      recommendations translate into effects on other food choices and overall diet quality, and\n      in turn health effects, is a neglected area of research. Eggs provide a complete profile of\n      amino acids and an array of micronutrients, and are low in total fat.  Although\n      epidemiological and clinical studies largely suggest a lack of association between egg\n      intake and harmful effects, the evidence is somewhat more ambiguous with regard to glycemic\n      control for diabetes, or the risk for CVD among individuals with diabetes. Our own prior\n      work shows no adverse effects of egg ingestion in healthy adults, hyperlipidemic adults, or\n      adults with established coronary artery disease.  As a satiating and protein-rich food, eggs\n      have potential to foster calorie and weight control, and to reduce the dietary glycemic\n      load, offering potential advantages in Type 2 diabetes. We propose a prospective,\n      randomized, single-blind controlled crossover study to assess the effects of daily egg\n      inclusion versus egg exclusion, on glycemic control, anthropometric measures, and overall\n      diet quality in adults with Type 2 diabetes."

The PAR provides detail regarding the duration, intensity, and volume (energy expenditure) of physical activity and can therefore be used for a variety of applications. Because it utilizes a one-week time frame, the data from the PAR is often considered representative of typical activity patterns. While it requires considerable cognitive effort by the participants, the interviewer administered version can be completed in a reasonable amount of time (~20 minutes).
