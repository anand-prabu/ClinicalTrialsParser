  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic diseases such as overweight and cardiovascular diseases represent important threats
      to women's health. Pregnancy and lactation are associated with changes in weight, body
      composition and lipid metabolism and affect the risk of developing these chronic illnesses.
      Our group has conducted a randomized clinical trial (LEVA) to evaluate overweight/obese
      women's ability to make longterm lifestyle changes during the postpartum (pp) period, under
      ideal study conditions. Physiological mechanisms for weight reduction were investigated with
      precise methodology. However, effectiveness studies under different conditions are crucial
      for the development of effective programs for the Primary Health Care sector. Hence, the
      interest for translational research that brings results from clinical trials to the Primary
      Health Care sector has increased. The aim of this effectiveness-study is to investigate if
      dietary restrictions pp lead to significantly greater weight reduction among
      overweight/obese women, compared to no intervention, in a longterm perspective. In total 106
      women will be recruited 10 wk pp and randomized into 1) control group; 2) dietary
      restrictions in individualized intervention during 12 wks. One and two years pp long term
      effects are evaluated. Positive results may be integrated into usual practice after the
      study ends.
