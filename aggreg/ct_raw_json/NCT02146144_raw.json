            "textblock": "The epimacular membrane (EMM) is a degenerative condition associated with age, with a\n      variable impact on vision. Treatment is surgery based and consists of a vitrectomy followed\n      by a peeling of the epimacular membrane using a microgripper. Peeling of the internal\n      limiting membrane (ILM) is an adjuvant action that is now frequently practiced and which is\n      expected to increase the success rate of EMM surgery by reducing the risk of recurrence of\n      EMM. Although ILM peeling does not seem to have an adverse effect on visual acuity, it is\n      not totally without consequence, it involves the risk of histological disorganization of the\n      retina at the origin of one or several microscotomas, which are themselves responsible for a\n      final visual discomfort. These microscotomas, resulting in the perception of somewhat black\n      spots visible near the fixed point or the fixed image, may be highlighted by microperimetry\n      and would be a loss of functional opportunity for the patient.\n\n      In addition, recurrence of EMM, which the ILM peeling is supposed to diminish, does not\n      alter the vision in half the patients. Furthermore, for those patients who are functionally\n      affected by any such recurrence, a second epimacular membrane peeling surgery can be done.\n\n      The main objective of this study is to compare the difference in microscotoma(s) before\n      surgery and 6 months later, between an \"active ILM peeling\" group and a \"no ILM peeling\"\n      group. Given the more invasive nature of ILM peeling, the investigators believe that the\n      rate of microscotomas in these patients is higher than those without peeling."
