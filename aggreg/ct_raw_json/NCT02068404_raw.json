            "textblock": "Preterm birth is the leading cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity. According to WHO,\n      15 million children are born prematurely (gestational age < 37 weeks) in the world each year\n      while 7% of them die because of complications associated with prematurity. Despite constant\n      improvement of obstetrical care, the number of preterm births has increased over the last\n      decades and prematurity is still the most frequent cause of prenatal hospitalization in\n      industrialized countries.\n\n      The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists as well as the Royal College of\n      Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommend nifedipine as a first-line tocolytic in case of\n      acute threatened preterm labour. Clinical experience show however an important variability\n      in treatment response among pregnant women. In spite of its large use in obstetrics as a\n      tocolytic agent, nifedipine is prescribed off-label. As a consequence no international\n      consensus on optimal dose schedule has so far been proposed.\n\n      Small sample size and heterogeneousness of tocolysis administration protocols make it\n      difficult to compare the little data available on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine in\n      pregnant women. Nevertheless an important interindividual variability in concentrations has\n      been identified (CV=12-76%) but very few studies have investigated the possible reasons of\n      this variability in pregnant women. Genetic and environmental factors involved in drug\n      distribution and metabolism (e.g. enzymatic activity, CYP 3A5 genotype) might partially\n      explain variability in drug levels and therefore differences in treatment response.\n\n      The goal of this study is to quantify the variability in nifedipine pharmacokinetics and\n      identify potential genetic and non-genetic sources of variability in nifedipine\n      pharmacokinetics in pregnant women. The relationship between concentration and treatment\n      response will be evaluated and will serve to propose optimal dosage regimen to improve\n      efficacy and reduce side effects associated with this treatment."
