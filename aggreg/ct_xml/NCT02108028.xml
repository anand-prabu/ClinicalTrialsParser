  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - There are very few documents to help young adults living with advanced cancer discuss
      their concerns and end-of-life preferences. A new document, Voicing My CHOiCES, allows young
      adults to explain what kind of care they would want if they became unable to communicate or
      make medical decisions on their own. Researchers want to study if this document is helpful.

      Objective:

      - To study if Voicing My CHOiCES     can reduce anxiety, improve sense of support, and
      improve communication about advanced care planning.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults 18 to 39 years old being treated for cancer.

      Design:

        -  Participants will answer questions about their age, gender, employment, religion,
           health, and marital status. They will also complete several brief questionnaires:

             1. General Anxiety Short Form

             2. Peace, Equanimity and Acceptance in the Cancer Experience

             3. Functional Assessment of Social Support

             4. Quality of Communication

             5. Prior Communication about Advanced Care Planning

        -  Then a health care professional will introduce Voicing My CHOiCES   . Participants will
           review the document and comment on parts they find relevant. They will also say if any
           important items are missing. Participants will complete 3 pages of the document with
           the assistance of a health care provider. They will be asked for positive and negative
           observations.

        -  The second stage of the study will take place about 1 month later. Participants will
           repeat the brief questionnaires listed above. They will be asked if they shared any of
           the preferences they described when completing the 3 pages of Voicing My CHOiCES
           during visit 1 with a family member, friend, or health care provider. Research staff
           will ask the participant for permission to contact the people they spoke with in order
           to learn whether their conversations about the document were helpful. They will ask for
           feedback on how to make Voicing My CHOiCES    more helpful.

      Background:

        -  Discussing end-of-life (EoL) care is very challenging for young adults (YA) living with
           a life threatening disease.

        -  While many helpful documents exist to facilitate EoL conversations with adults, few
           resources exist to aid YA in understanding and accepting their changing physical,
           emotional and social needs when treatment is no longer effective.

        -  Between 2007-2011, the Pediatric Oncology Branch (07-C-0085) explored the helpfulness
           of Five Wishes with adolescents and young adults living with HIV or advanced cancer.
           This research led to the development of a new advance care planning (ACP) guide,
           Voicing My CHOiCES    (VMC). However, Voicing My CHOiCES    has not been empirically
           examined in its completed form.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To determine the perceived helpfulness of VMC.

        -  To determine whether engaging in advanced care planning using VMC is associated with
           reduced anxiety, improved social support, increased acceptance of illness, and/or
           improved communication about ACP with family, friends, and/health care providers.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To examine the helpfulness of VMC by living status (independent living vs. with family
           of origin) and parental status.

        -  To examine the perceived benefit and burden of completing VMC.

        -  To assess whether further revisions are needed to VMC for use with YA.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patient Participants:

        -  Age: 18 through 39 years

        -  Known metastatic, progressive or recurrent cancer and enrolled on an NIH protocol or
           treated at one of the participating sites.

        -  No prior experience using Voicing My CHOiCES

        -  Patients and family/friend and health care providers must be English speaking

      Design:

        -  Each subject will complete a baseline assessment of their anxiety pertaining to advance
           care planning, quality of social support, and quality of communication with family,
           friends and health care providers. They will be asked to review the advance care
           planning document, Voicing My CHOiCES   , and to comment on each section as to whether
           it can provide an opportunity to address ACP needs themselves and for other YA their
           age living with a serious illness.

        -  To obtain the perspectives of different YA, the study cohort will include up to 10
           participants, with a minimum of 25 YA who are living independently and 25 YA who have a
           child(ren) of their own. In addition, up to 100 family/friends and health care
           providers of the participants will participate in the follow up assessment. A total of
           up to 200 individuals may participate in this study.

        -  A 1-month pre-post design will be used to assess the utility of the document, anxiety,
           quality of social support, communication about EoL planning, and whether the patient
           participant has shared any of the work completed in the document with a family member,
           friend, or health care provider.

        -  If the participant had shared the ACP preferences that were documented in Voicing My
           CHOiCES    with a family member or friend, and had consented for u to contact that
           person, we will obtain the family member or friend   s consent and complete a brief
           interview assessing the helpfulness and limitations of Voicing M CHOiCES    for ACP. If
           the participant had shared the ACP preferences that were documented in Voicing My
           CHOiCES    with their health care provider and had consented for us to talk with that
           health care provider, a brief interview assessi the helpfulness and limitations of
           Voicing My CHOiCES    for end-of-life planning

      and whether any changes in the participants    health care was made in response to Voicing
      My CHOiCES   , will be documented
