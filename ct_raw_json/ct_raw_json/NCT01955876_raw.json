And also if at the time of 12 months after\n      administration of Lanthanum carbonate the dialysis is not conducted, extending its'\n      administration will be continued until conduction of dialysis, or until Sept. 30, 2015. The\n      efficacy of fosrenol is evaluated by observing the serum P(phosphorus) level and serum PTH\n      (parathyroid hormone) level change."
