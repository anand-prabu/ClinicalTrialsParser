To address this question,\n      the investigators have designed this pilot study with the aim to investigate the effect of\n      community-based group walks among Joslin adults with diabetes on the development of a\n      physically active lifestyle and glycemic level. The investigators hypothesize that\n      participation in group walking events helps Joslin adults with diabetes engage in physical\n      activity and improves glycemic control."
