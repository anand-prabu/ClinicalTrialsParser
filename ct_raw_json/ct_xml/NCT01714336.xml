      Does tranexamic acid improve the perioperative care of those patients treated surgically for
      hip fracture by decreasing the proportion of patients requiring transfusion and decreasing
      total perioperative bleeding.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antifibrinolytic medications such as tranexamic acid, aprotinin, and aminocaproic acid have
      proven to be useful in decreasing blood loss and the proportion of patients who require
      transfusion after a number of surgical procedures.  In orthopedic surgery, tranexamic acid
      (TXA) is the best studied of these medications and a recent Cochrane Database review
      determined that tranexamic acid was effective in decreasing perioperative bleeding and
      post-operative transfusion after elective hip replacement and knee replacement surgery.  At
      Mayo Clinic Rochester, the routine administration of tranexamic acid has evolved over the
      past decade to become part of the typical protocol for more than 3,000 elective hip and knee
      replacement procedures each year.  Recent administrative data provides fairly compelling
      evidence of the efficacy of tranexamic acid in decreasing transfusion at the Mayo Clinic
      Rochester practice with 2010 data showing 2% and 7% prevalence of transfusion in patients
      treated with tranexamic acid versus 18% and 33% prevalence in those knee and hip replacement
      patients, respectively, who were not treated with tranexamic acid.  A recent analysis of the
      Mayo Clinic Rochester orthopedic practice showed that patients treated for hip fracture
      remain at substantial risk of perioperative transfusion (30% prevalence) after operative
      management.  This raises the question as to whether tranexamic acid could improve the
      perioperative care of those patients treated surgically for hip fracture by decreasing the
      proportion of patients requiring transfusion and decreasing total perioperative bleeding.
