Complete a pre-visit questionnaire querying\n\n             1. Baseline satisfaction with knowledge of their presenting bulge symptoms (\"pelvic\n                anatomy\")\n\n             2. Anxiety related to their presenting symptoms\n\n        2. Undergo a new patient history and physical exam, including a pelvic organ prolapse\n           quantification (POPQ) exam as per practice standard.\n\n        3. Patients will then be randomized and will either receive:\n\n             1. Group 1: \"usual practice\" counseling regarding pelvic organ prolapse\n\n             2. Group 2: \"usual practice\" counseling in addition to interactive patient/provider\n                counseling using the pelvic organ prolapse web-based tool (iPad)\n\n        4.

The physician members of the project personnel team will\n      perform either the \"usual practice\" or \"usual practice\" plus \"interactive, web-based\n      tool-facilitated\" patient counseling. Patient and provider questionnaire data will also be\n      collected by the project personnel team.\n\n      Number and duration of subject contact: All data will be collected over the course of a\n      patient's single \"New Patient\" visit.
