      Primary aim:

        1. To  compare  the  effects  of  customary  care  and  an  interventional  Home-based
           Palliative Renal Program (HBPRP) for ESRF patients

        2. To compare the effects of customary  care  and Home-based Palliative Program (HBPP) for
           ESRF patients

           Secondary aim:

        3. To explore the lived experiences of patients with ESRF. Hypothesis The transitional
           renal palliative care model is associated with decreased in unscheduled hospital
           readmission, reduce length of stay as well as improved quality of life for patients
           with end-stage renal failure.

      Objectives

      Related to the primary aim:

        1. Are there differences in healthcare utilization between the ESRF patients in the
           customary care group and those in the HBPRP group; in the HBPRP group and HBPP group?

        2. Are there differences in evaluated health outcomes (functional status, symptom
           intensity, and satisfaction with care) between the customary care group and the HBPRP
           group ; in the HBPRP group and HBPP group?

        3. Are there differences in perceived health outcomes (quality of life, caregiver burden)
           between the customary care group and the HBPRP group; in the HBPRP group and HBPP
           group?

           Related to the secondary aim:

        4. How are the lived experiences compared and contrasted between the customary care group
           and the HBPRP group; in the HBPRP group and HBPP group?

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Healthcare utilization composite - The dates of re-hospitalizations, length of stay, and number of other hospital services used, including clinics and emergency room visits, will be extracted from the hospital administrative systems.</measure>
    <time_frame>for 12 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluated health outcomes composite (functional status, symptom intensity) - The functional status will be measured by the Palliative Performance Scale (PPS )(appendix 6).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>The PPS is a clinical tool commonly used in the local settings. The level of physical performance is rated on a scale of 100 (normal) to 0 (death), measured in 10 % decrement levels. The scale has been validated and the inter-rater reliability between doctors and nurses maintained at .85 with strong kappa values of .97 (Myers J, Gardiner K, Harris K et al., 2010).</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Quality of life will be measured by an ESRF-specific quality of life measure. The caregiver burden will be measured by the Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale (ZCBS). Satisfaction with care will be measured by the 15-item questionnaire</description>
