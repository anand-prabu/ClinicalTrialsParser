Blood pressure and pulse will be measured after 3 minutes resting in a\n             sitting position.\n\n          -  Body mass index between 18.5 and 30.0 kg/m2 and body weight in the 50 - 95 kg range.\n\n          -  No need for regular concomitant medication\n\n          -  Subjects with partners of childbearing potential have to use adequate contraception\n             during, and for at least the four weeks after administration of study medication.\n             Adequate contraception is defined as usage by at least one of the partners of a\n             barrier method of contraception, together with usage by the female partner,\n             commencing at least three months prior to Screening, of a stable regimen of any form\n             of hormonal contraception or an intra-uterine device.
