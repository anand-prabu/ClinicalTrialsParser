Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells\n      and slow the growth of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It is not yet known whether combining more\n      than one chemotherapy drug with interferon alfa is more effective than chemotherapy alone in\n      treating patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy\n      with or without interferon alfa in treating patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."

Compare the remission induction rates and toxicity of chlorambucil plus\n      dexamethasone with or without idarubicin in patients with stage II-IV low grade\n      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Assess the additional value of a period of\n      consolidation/maintenance treatment utilizing low dose interferon alfa or standard dose\n      interferon alfa versus no further treatment in relationship to the duration of event-free\n      survival in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, controlled, multicenter study. Patients are\n      randomized into one of two arms for induction chemotherapy. Arm I: Patients receive oral\n      chlorambucil three times daily for 3 consecutive days, oral idarubicin daily for 3\n      consecutive days, and oral dexamethasone twice daily for 5 consecutive days every 21 days.\n      Arm II: Patients receive oral chlorambucil three times daily for 3 consecutive days and oral\n      dexamethasone twice daily for 5 consecutive days every 21 days. Treatment for both arms\n      continues for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. After 6 courses of chemotherapy, patients are reassessed. If they have achieved\n      maximal complete response or good partial response, patients are randomized into one of\n      three arms. Arm I: Patients receive no further treatment until disease progresses. Arm II:\n      Patients receive low dose interferon alfa subcutaneously three times per week for a maximum\n      of 3 years in the absence of disease progression. Arm III: Patients receive standard dose\n      interferon alfa subcutaneously three times a week for a maximum of 3 years in the absence of\n      disease progression. Patients are followed every 8-12 weeks for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 200 patients accrued into this study with approximately 150\n      patients entering the second phase of this study."
