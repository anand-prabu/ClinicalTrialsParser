Management of this\n      multisystem disorder is highly challenging.\n\n      The Lead Applicant has spent 20 years working on this rare disease, and identified multiple\n      areas where more evidence is required to assist clinicians and patients with this lifelong\n      condition. A particular issue is whether the diet influences HHT or its complications in any\n      way.\n\n      In this study, people will fill in two questionnaires, one giving details of their diet, and\n      another details of their nosebleeds.  They will also be asked to consider participating in\n      an accessory study arm which includes weighing food for one week and providing a food diary,\n      in addition to having a single set of blood test."
