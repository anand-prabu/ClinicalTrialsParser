            "textblock": "Self-reported sleep complaints are common in peri- and postmenopausal women and have been\n      identified as a key symptom of the menopausal transition. The MsFLASH study, A Pilot Trial\n      of Telephone-Based Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Midlife Women with Menopause-related\n      Sleep Disturbance, is a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, two arm clinical\n      trial.  The target population will include women in general good health, aged 40-65 years,\n      who report symptoms of insomnia (trouble sleeping) and who are bothered by hot flashes. We\n      plan to enroll 100 women from Seattle, Washington and surrounding areas into the trial.\n      Half of the women will be randomly assigned to receive the behavioral intervention and half\n      to receive the behavioral control.\n\n      The intervention arm participants will receive 6 sessions of a telephone-based,\n      cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention for insomnia (CBT-I), based on state-of-the-art\n      methods and specifically targeted to women with menopause-related sleep disturbance (CBT-I).\n       The control arm participants will receive telephone-based Menopause Education Control (MEC)\n      that includes elements of sleep hygiene.  Assessments for both groups will be collected at\n      baseline (pre-randomization), 8-week post-randomization, and 6-month post-randomization.\n\n      The inclusion/exclusion criteria are designed to target broadly those midlife women who have\n      menopause-related sleep disturbance and also report being bothered by vasomotor symptoms.\n      This target population defines the clinical population seeking treatment for relief of\n      menopause-related sleep problems.  Exclusion criteria are kept minimal and intended only to\n      exclude women with significant medical problems likely to account for their sleep problems\n      (instead of menopause), or likely to interfere with their ability to participate in the\n      intervention.  We include women taking hormone therapy or other medication who meet these\n      criteria because they are part of the population seeking clinical care for relief of sleep\n      disturbances.\n\n      Our primary objective is to develop an intervention that is generalizable to the greatest\n      number of women and maximally translatable into real-world primary care practice."
