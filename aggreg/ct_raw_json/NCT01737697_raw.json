There will be a one-time randomization to assign the Acute Phase\n      treatment and the Subacute Phase treatment. The Subacute Phase will include subjects who\n      became normokalemic on active drug and those who became normokalemic on placebo. The former\n      will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio between the same dose of ZS they received during the acute\n      phase but only administered once a day (qd) or placebo, qd. Subjects on placebo during the\n      Acute Phase who are normokalemic in the morning of Study Day 3, will be randomized to\n      receive either 1.25 or 2.5 g ZS, qd as Subacute Phase treatment.\n\n      Safety and tolerability will be assessed on an ongoing basis by an Independent Data Safety\n      Monitoring Board (DSMB). Each active dose group will consist of 150 patients per treatment\n      group including the placebo control group for a total of 750 patients; the 1:1:1:1:1\n      allocation helps to optimize the multiple active dose comparisons to the respective placebo\n      controls for the Subacute Phase."
