Tumors need blood vessels to grow and\n      spread.  Tivozanib is an anti-angiogenesis medicine that fights cancer by cutting off a\n      tumor's blood supply so that it does not get the blood and nutrients it needs to grow.\n\n      In this research study, the Investigators are looking to see whether tivozanib works as a\n      maintenance therapy for ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma in\n      participants who have achieved a complete response following chemotherapy.  Maintenance\n      therapy is given after a disease has responded to previous treatment.  It is given to help\n      prevent the spread or recurrence of the tumor."
