  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common but under-diagnosed medical condition that occurs
      when a thrombus forms in one of the large veins, usually in the lower limbs, leading to
      either partial or complete blocked circulation. The condition may progress to severe health
      complications, such as pulmonary embolism (PE), if not diagnosed and treated in a timely and
      effective manner.

      The goal of the therapy for lower-extremity DVT is to prevent the extension of thrombus and
      pulmonary embolism in the short term and to prevent recurrent events in the long-term.
      Although anticoagulant therapy decreases the risk of recurrent thrombosis, the treatment
      also increases the risk for major hemorrhage.

      This trial aims to optimize the current medical knowledge on the effectiveness and safety of
      two low molecular weight heparins, bemiparin and enoxaparin in the treatment of deep vein
      thrombosis.

      The aim of this study is to demonstrate the therapeutic non-inferiority of bemiparin sodium
      (LMWH) versus enoxaparin sodium (LMWH) during a 7±2 days treatment period and a follow up of
      11 weeks observation period.

      Primary endpoint:

      The percentage of patients with an improvement in thrombotic burden at Visit 3 (Day 83)
      defined as a ≥4-point reduction in thrombus score (or at least halving the thrombus score,
      when the total score is ≤ 6), without confirmed symptomatic extension of recurrence of DVT,
      confirmed symptomatic PE, or VTE-related death at Visit 3 (Day 83 / Month 3), as measured by
      complete compression ultrasound (cCUS) by Duplex sonography according to a standardized
      protocol.

      Secondary endpoint:

      The secondary efficacy endpoints are defined as the:

      • Incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolic events (VTE) at Visit 3 (Day 83:

        -  Recurrent DVT

        -  Pulmonary embolism

      Incusion criteria:

      Patients with acute deep-vein thrombosis of the leg (DVT) with symptoms of less than 14
      days, confirmed by complete compression ultrasound (cCUS) within 48 hours prior study start.

      Patients who have given their signed declaration of consent and data protection declaration
