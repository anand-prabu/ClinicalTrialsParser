            "textblock": "Rationale Acute ischemic stroke due to atrial fibrillation (AF) carries a high risk for\n      early recurrence. In acute stage, guidelines recommend aspirin, but do not recommend\n      anticoagulation due to the increased risk of intracranial bleeding. Since, aspirin has a\n      limited efficacy of preventing recurrent stroke in AF, expert consensus suggests early\n      anticoagulation in non-severe stroke with AF. The current practice for acute ischemic stroke\n      patients with AF is delayed warfarin administration with aspirin use for non-minor stroke or\n      immediate warfarin administration (sometimes with heparin bridging) for minor stroke.\n      However, conventional anticoagulation with warfarin in acute ischemic stroke with AF has the\n      following limitations: 1) risk of intracranial bleeding particularly in acute stage, 2)\n      delayed action and transient paradoxical thrombogenic tendency due to the inhibition of\n      protein C, resulting in the risk of early recurrent embolic stroke, and 3) prolongation of\n      hospitalization waiting for full anticoagulation. In contrast, as compared to warfarin,\n      rivaroxaban is advantageous for reduced risk of intracranial bleeding and immediate\n      anticoagulation efficacy.\n\n      Goal The current trial will examine whether early initiation (within 5 days from stroke\n      onset) of rivaroxaban as compared to conventional warfarin would reduce intracranial\n      bleeding, recurrent embolic stroke, and hospital stay in patients with acute ischemic stroke\n      due to AF."
