Hypoactivation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is\n      associated with this deficit. In this study the investigators assess the effect of a\n      decrease of dlPFC activity in healthy subjects by cathodal transcranial direct current\n      stimulation (tDCS) on cognitive control.\n\n      In a double-blinded, balanced randomized, sham-controlled crossover trial the investigators\n      determine the effect of a single-session of cathodal tDCS to the left dlPFC on cognitive\n      control in healthy subjects. To assess the cognitive control the investigators use a delayed\n      response working memory task (DWM)and an arithmetic inhibition task (AIT) with pictures of\n      varying valence."
