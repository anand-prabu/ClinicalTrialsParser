Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

Patients are stratified by center, stage\n      (I or II vs III), creatinine (less than 2.0 mg/dL vs 2.0 mg/dL or greater), and intention to\n      use prophylactic bisphosphonate (yes vs no).\n\n        -  Induction: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.\n\n             -  Arms I and II: Patients receive induction comprising oral prednisone followed by\n                oral melphalan on days 1-4.\n\n             -  Arms III and IV: Patients receive induction comprising oral melphalan and oral\n                dexamethasone (DM) on days 1-4 of all courses and DM on days 15-18 of courses 1-3.\n\n      Induction for arms I-IV continues every 4 weeks for 12 courses in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease after\n      induction proceed to maintenance therapy.\n\n        -  Maintenance:\n\n             -  Arms I and III: Patients undergo observation.\n\n             -  Arms II and IV: Patients receive oral DM on days 1-4. Maintenance therapy\n                continues every 4 weeks for arms II and IV and every 3 months for arms I and III\n                in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients on arms\n                I-IV who develop disease progression proceed to reinduction.\n\n        -  Reinduction: Patients restart induction on the arm to which they were originally\n           randomized. Reinduction continues every 4 weeks in the absence of stable response\n           lasting 16 weeks, disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a\n           stable response lasting 16 weeks restart maintenance therapy. Patients who experience\n           further disease progression during reinduction are taken off study.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, on day 1 of courses 1-3 and then every 3 courses\n      during induction, and then every 3 months during maintenance therapy.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 600 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 years."
