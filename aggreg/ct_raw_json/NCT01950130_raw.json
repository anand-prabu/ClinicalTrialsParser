The perioperative mortality in these patients is \u2265 5%. The\n      perioperative and operative management for these patients has to be optimized in order to\n      reduce their perioperative morbidity and mortality. One of the central aspects is\n      perioperative maintenance of hemodynamic stability. The use of prophylactic IABP is a partly\n      established, but not sufficiently evidence-based measure to reduce ventricular afterload and\n      improve coronary perfusion pre-, intra- and postoperatively. Yet, it is an invasive\n      procedure with potential complications. The planned trial should give an explicit answer,\n      whether preoperative prophylactic IABP decreases 30-day all-cause mortality (primary\n      endpoint) and long-term mortality (3, 6, 12 months; secondary endpoints) compared to\n      preoperative conservative treatment in high-risk patients undergoing CABG."
