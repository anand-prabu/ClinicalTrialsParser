    <textblock>
      This is an open-label flexible-dose pilot study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and
      tolerability of Pristiq (desvenlafaxine) in outpatient subjects diagnosed with Generalized
      Anxiety Disorder (GAD) with or without comorbidities that are secondary to the GAD. Primary
      trial objective is to evaluate the efficacy of Pristiq (desvenlafaxine) SNRI treatment 50 to
      100 mg once daily in the treatment of GAD with or without comorbidities. Secondary trial
      objective is to determine whether or not treatment outcome in GAD is related to changes in
      cortical prefrontal activity of norepinephrine.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has provided signed informed consent.

          -  Patients with a primary diagnosis of GAD according to DSM IV (300.23) criteria
             (diagnosis to be made      using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview;
             MINI Version 6.0.0). Patients with co-morbid anxiety disorders will be permitted, as
             long as GAD is judged to be the primary diagnosis.

          -  Patients who score a HAM-A of ≥ 20 at both Screening and Baseline, and  ≥ 10 on the
             psychic and somatic anxiety factors.

          -  On the basis of physical examination, medical history, and basic laboratory
             screening, patient is, in the investigator's opinion, in a suitable condition.

          -  Willing and able to attend study appointments in the correct time windows.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any other axis I diagnosis that was a primary disorder in the previous six months.

          -  Alcohol or drug abuse as defined in the DSM IV (300.23) within the last six months.

          -  Mania, hypomania as defined in the DSM IV (300.23).

             treatment resistance.

          -  Patients, who have been on an antidepressant or other anxiolytic prior to the study,
             will have discontinued it more than two weeks prior to entry into the study. Those
             who have been on fluoxetine, will have been off of it for at least 5 weeks.

          -  Patients who have been on a herbal or alternative treatment judged to be potentially
             anxiolytic or with psychobiological activity (e.g. St. John's Wort,
             S-adenosylmethionine), will have terminated usage of the agent more than two weeks
             prior to entering the study.

          -  Scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) &gt; 15, at screening visit 1

          -  Laboratory values at screening or in medical history that may be considered through
             clinical interpretation to be significant.

          -  Diseases that could through clinical interpretation interfere with the assessments of
             safety, tolerability and efficacy.

          -  Serious illness: Liver or renal insufficiency, cardiac, vascular, pulmonary,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurological, infectious, neoplastic or metabolic
             disturbance.

          -  The subject has received electroconvulsive therapy, vagal nerve stimulation, or
             repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation within 6 months prior to Screening.

          -  The patient is, in the opinion of the investigator, unlikely to comply with the
             clinical trial protocol or is unsuitable for any reason.

          -  Known allergy or intolerance to desvenlafaxine or its excipients.
