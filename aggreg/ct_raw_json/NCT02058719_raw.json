Even though\n      antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically decreased the number of opportunistic\n      infections and deaths in HIV infected patients, pulmonary complications (including chronic\n      obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] development and pneumonias resulting in decreased lung\n      function) of HIV/AIDS continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in this\n      population. The mechanisms underlying the increased risk of COPD and decreased lung function\n      in HIV infected individuals is not well understand and needs to be studied.\n\n      We hypothesize that the immunoregulatory consequences and immunosuppressive lung milieu\n      secondary to HIV and cigarette smoke combine to increase the risk of lung infection and\n      injury in HIV infected smokers, hastening the development of COPD. The mechanisms will be\n      directly tested using blood and bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) cells from smokers and\n      nonsmokers with and without HIV infection."
