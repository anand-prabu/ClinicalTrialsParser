Approximately 140 persons will be enrolled in this study over a period of five\n      years.  Individual participation will last approximately 16 weeks.  Study participants will\n      be chosen randomly to receive either the study medication (sertraline) or cognitive behavior\n      therapy for 16 weeks.  Sertraline is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n      Subjects who receive cognitive behavior therapy will be provided with a one-hour individual\n      session with a licensed clinical psychologist each week for 15 weeks.  All study\n      participants will attend scheduled clinic visits every 4 weeks for 16 weeks."
