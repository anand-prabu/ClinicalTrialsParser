  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DFNA are characterized as progressive bilateral deafness. To date, 21 genes and 57 loci are
      involved in these dominant deafness, with an unknown prevalence.A 22nd gene responsible of
      the disease has been found. This SLC17A8 gene encodes for the VGLUT3 protein which is
      specifically expressed in sensorial cells of the audition. VGlut3-/- mice present a deep
      deafness due to a deficiency of neurotransmitter release, although sensorial cells and
      neurons are intact. This kind of deafness is an ideal candidate for a genetic therapy
      because of the cells integrity.Mutations of SLC17A8 gene have been found in 2 american
      families that suffer from progressive deafness.The study aims to look for european families
      from the Mediterranean basin, which carry SLC17A8 gene mutations, and may benefit in a
      medium-term from genetic therapy. The study will allow to identify the prevalence of the
      SLC17A8 gene mutations in patients suffering from deafness. This phenotype also corresponds
      to DFNA15 deafness caused by POU4F3 : mutations of this gene will be screened as well.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Patients with a

               1. suggestive neurosensory Deafness: The characteristics of the deafness will be
                  determined from the data of the questionnaire, of the interrogation, the
                  examination and results of the tonal audiometry.

                  *Neurosensory deafness: Audiometrics measurement(difference between the tonal
                  audiometric average loss for the frequencies 0,5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz in air
                  conduction and in osseous conduction) &lt; 15 dB for each of both ears.

                    -  Bilateral symetric: difference between the audiometric thresholds of both
                       ears &lt; or = 15 dB for at least two frequencies.

                    -  Light to severe: The degree of deafness is defined according to the
                       following classification (moderate hearing loss calculated on the
                       frequencies 500 Hz, 1, 2 and 4 kHz): light hearing deficiency from 20 to 40
                       dB, moderate hearing deficiency of 40 to 70 dB, severe hearing deficiency
                       of 70 in 90 dB and deep hearing deficiency beyond 90 dB.

                    -  Whose thresholds frequency by frequency in tonal audiometry (air
                       conduction) are superior to the thresholds of the 90th percentile of the
                       standard ISO 7029.

                    -  Without environmental exposition factors.

               2. Dominant autosomal transmission diagnosed from one of the following elements:

                    -  Deafness at a father and his son

                    -  Deafness at a father and his daughter outside a suggestive context of a
                       dominant form X-related. (deep deafness at the father and light to moderate
                       deafness in daughter)

                    -  Deafness at a mother and her daughter

                    -  Deafness at a mother and her son outside a suggestive context of a dominant
                       X-related(light to moderate deafness at the mother, and deep deafness at
                       the son)

                    -  Deafness at a patient whose a dead parent had a sure or likely deafness
                       according to the criteria of diagnosis mentioned previously
