Two capsules administered together were the single\n      dosage.\n\n      The study was prospective, open-label, randomized, crossover, single dose, with 02\n      treatments, 02 sequences and 02 periods, under fed conditions.\n\n      The population was composed of 36 healthy volunteers, male adults between 18-45 years.\n\n      The comparative bioavailability of the two formulations was evaluated based in statistical\n      comparisons of relevant pharmacokinetic parameters, obtained from data of drug\n      concentrations in blood."
