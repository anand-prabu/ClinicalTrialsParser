Treatment continues every 3\n      weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients with a\n      complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses after documented CR. Patients with a\n      partial response receive 2 additional courses after documented maximal tumor shrinkage.\n      Patients with stable disease receive a maximum of 4 courses.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months until relapse or death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24\n      months."
