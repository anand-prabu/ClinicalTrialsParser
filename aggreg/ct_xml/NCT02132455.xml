  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of colonoscopy (colon examination with flexible tube and a camera) is to find
      early precancerous growth in the colon (polyps) and remove them before they turn into
      cancer. The doctor performing the procedure will first advance the colonoscope to the end of
      the colon (cecum) and then he will examine the colon for polyps while he is withdrawing the
      colonoscope. The period of time that the doctor spent examining the colon called &quot;withdrawal
      time&quot;. Usually doctors will spend at least 6 minutes examining the colon after he reached
      the cecum. The investigators are proposing that dedicating half of the withdrawal time
      during colonoscopy in examining the right side of the colon, will increase the detection of
      polyps in the right side of the colon.

      Research design: This is a prospective, randomized trial comparing the ADR between patients
      undergoing a screening colonoscopy in four different groups: 1) at least 3 minutes from the
      total withdrawal time dedicated to the right side of the colon, 2) at least 4 minutes from
      the total withdrawal time dedicated to the right side of the colon, 3) 6 minutes total
      withdrawal time regardless of time spent in any segment, 4) 8 minutes total withdrawal time
      regardless of the time spent in any segment. Randomization will be done in blocks after
      stratification. Four gastroenterologists and two fellows matched base on similar ADR and
      stratified on each arm of the study (segmental versus non-segmental withdrawal) will be
      performing the procedures. The estimated sample size of the four arms of the study is 400
      patients.
