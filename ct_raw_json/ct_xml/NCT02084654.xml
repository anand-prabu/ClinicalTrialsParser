  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with prediabetes have a high risk to be insulin resistant and at risk for type 2
      diabetes. Weight loss has been known to decrease insulin resistance and risk for diabetes as
      well as other metabolic abnormalities. Diet alone does not provide a long term solution for
      most individuals, as weight regain is common.  Exenatide, a GLP-1 agonist approved for
      lowering blood glucose concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes, has been associated
      with restoration of the first-phase insulin response when administered intravenously to
      patients with type 2 diabetes. In longer clinical trials, it is associated with progressive
      decreases in body weight, and improvement in the dyslipidemia that characterizes insulin
      resistance, although insulin resistance was not quantified. Given these favorable metabolic
      effects, and the fact that continued use might allow for longer-term weight loss or
      prevention of weight regain,  it would seem that this drug might yield even better diabetes
      prevention than dietary weight loss alone. We will compare 2 groups of prediabetic insulin
      resistant individuals, all on a weight loss diet and one group on exenatide and the other on
      placebo.  We will evaluate restoration of first phase insulin response, reversal of
      prediabetes, and improvement in insulin resistance, in addition to amount of weight loss.
