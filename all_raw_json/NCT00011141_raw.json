However, previous\n      studies indicate that autoimmunity may be a result of dysfunction of natural killer T cells\n      (NK-T cells).  Newly diagnoses patients with IMD have been shown in our laboratory to have\n      significantly lower NK-T cells than normal controls.  Other studies have shown that oral\n      administration of lactobacillus can boost NK-T cell activity in children with HIV without\n      side effects.  Our objective is to evaluate the effect of lactobacillus administration on\n      NK-T cell activity in patients with IMD"
