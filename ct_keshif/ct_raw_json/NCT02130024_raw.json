Any type of systemic disease or its treatment, including any medical condition\n             (controlled or uncontrolled) that could be expected to progress, recur, or change to\n             such an extent that it may bias the assessment of the clinical status of the patient\n             to a significant degree or put the patient at special risk.\n\n          5. Stroke or myocardial infarction less than 3 months prior to Screening.\n\n          6. Uncontrolled blood pressure defined as systolic value of >160 mm Hg or diastolic\n             value of >100 mm Hg at Screening or Baseline.\n\n          7.
