Furthermore,\n      the safety and feasibility of implanting ABSORB BVS in patients with STEMI is assessed.\n\n      It is hypothesized that acutely and at 6 months follow-up implantation of the ABSORB fully\n      bioresorbable everolimus-eluting scaffold is at least as safe as implantation of metallic\n      drug-eluting stent, and that at late follow-up the ABSORB scaffold could improve the\n      arterial healing process and potentially reduce late stent thrombosis in patients presenting\n      with STEMI.\n\n      This is a preparatory trial in anticipation of a major outcome study."
