      This project is a research study investigating the effects of a worksite diet and exercise
      intervention on weight loss in overweight postpartum women. Weight loss programs have been
      shown to be effective in reducing postpartum weight retention. However, high attrition rates
      in these studies suggest that the added responsibility of a new infant at home and returning
      to work may limit a woman's ability to follow a diet plan and exercise regularly. We hope
      that by offering a weight loss program at the workplace, we can increase participant
      retention and maximize weight loss in this population. Our primary aim is to promote weight
      loss while preserving lean body mass during the 12 week intervention. Secondary aims include
      increasing cardiovascular fitness from baseline and improving cardiovascular biomarkers,
      including total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, insulin, and markers of
      inflammation and metabolism.

    <description>Participants will be prescribed a reduced calorie diet and  asked to track their diet three days per week using the online USDA MyPlate SuperTracker. This record will be accessed by the RD in order to provide diet recommendations sent by email.
Participants will be given an exercise prescription, and encouraged to walk briskly with a provided pedometer or exercise at the campus Recreation Center every day. Participants will be asked to record the number of steps and other physical activity in a log book.
Participants will meet with the research staff every other week to measure weight, waist and hip circumference, and record the steps from the pedometer.
Participants will be encouraged to breastfeed their baby and provided with resources for pumping breast milk at work.</description>
