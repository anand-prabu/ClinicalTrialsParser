  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine safety profile, initial response rates and
      progression free survival for the combination therapy of neoadjuvent system ipilimumab
      followed by ILI with melphalan in patients with in transit melanoma.

      Hypothesis:

      The combination of regional LPAm plus systemic ipilimumab will lead to a larger response
      rate than either therapy alone.

      The combination of regional LPAm plus systemic ipilimumab will cause larger changes in
      immune cell populations than are seen with either therapy along.

      Changes in immune cell populations will predict progression free survival.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient must have histologically proven primary or recurrent extremity melanoma,
             stage IIIB, IIIC,  (AJCC staging must be documented in patient's medical record, as
             determined by CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, and/or whole body PET scan, and
             MRI of the brain within 4 weeks prior to administration of study drug)

          2. Patient must be greater than 18 years of age.

          3. Patient must have an ECOG/Zubrod status of 0-1.

               -  Creatinine less than 2.0 x ULN

          7. Patient must have a palpable femoral/radial pulse in the affected extremity.

          8. Patients must have a life expectancy of &gt; 6 months.

          9. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of
             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 26 weeks after
             the last dose of investigational product, in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy
             is minimized. WOCBP include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not
             undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation,
             or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not post-menopausal. Post-menopause is defined as:

               -  Amenorrhea greater than12 consecutive months without another cause, or

               -  For women with irregular menstrual periods and taking hormone replacement
                  therapy (HRT), a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level 35
                  mIU/mL.

             Women who are using oral contraceptives, other hormonal contraceptives (vaginal
             products, skin patches, or implanted or injectable products), or mechanical products
             such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides)
             to prevent pregnancy, or are practicing abstinence or where their partner is sterile
             (eg, vasectomy) should be considered to be of childbearing potential.

             WOCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or
             equivalent units of HCG) within 72 hours before the start of ipilimumab.

             Men of fathering potential must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid
             conception throughout the study [and for up to 26 weeks after the last dose of
             investigational product] in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized.

         10. Patient must provide a signed and dated written informed consent prior to
             registration and any study-related procedures.

         11. Patient must provide written authorization to allow the use and disclosure of their
             protected health information at any institution subject to US HIPAA regulations.

         12. Ability to read and understand English and the ability to complete paper +/-
             electronic survey assessments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             not have unstable angina (angina symptoms at rest) or new onset angina (began within
             the last 3 months) or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months

          2. Autoimmune disease: History of or current active autoimmune diseases, [e.g. including
             but not limited to inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD], rheumatoid arthritis,
             autoimmune thyroiditis, autoimmune hepatitis, systemic sclerosis (scleroderma and
             variants), systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis, autoimmune
             neuropathies (such as Guillain-Barre syndrome). Vitiligo and adequately controlled
             endocrine deficiencies such as hypothyroidism are not exclusionary.]

          3. Prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

          4. Patients who have had a history of acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess, GI
             obstruction and abdominal carcinomatosis which are known risk factors for bowel
             perforation.

             irradiation].

          6. Psychiatric conditions or diminished capacity that could compromise the giving of
             informed consent, or interfere with study compliance; any underlying medical or
             psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the investigator will make the
             administration of ipilimumab hazardous or obscure the interpretation of AEs, such as
             a condition associated with frequent diarrhea.

          7. A history of prior treatment with ipilimumab or prior CD137 agonist or CTLA 4
             inhibitor or agonist, or anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 therapy.

             immunotherapy regimens; cytotoxic chemotherapy; immunosuppressive agents; other
             investigation therapies; or chronic use of systemic corticosteroids (used in the
             management of cancer or non-cancer-related illnesses). However, during the course of
             the study, use of corticosteroids is allowed if used for treating irAEs, adrenal
             insufficiencies, or if administered at doses of prednisone ≤ 7.5mg daily or
             equivalent.

          9. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), defined above in Section 5.1, who:

               -  are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of contraception to avoid
                  pregnancy for their entire study period and for at least 26 weeks after
                  cessation of study drug, or

               -  have a positive pregnancy test at baseline, or

               -  are pregnant or breastfeeding.

         10. Persons of reproductive potential must agree to use an adequate method of
             contraception throughout treatment and for at least 26 weeks after ipilimumab is
             stopped.

             Sexually active WOCBP must use an effective method of birth control during the course
             of the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized. Before study
             enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during
             study participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy.
             All WOCBP MUST have a negative pregnancy test before first receiving ipilimumab. If
             the pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not receive ipilimumab and must not
             be enrolled in the study.

         11. Known brain metastasis.

         12. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or chronic Hepatitis B or C.

             ischemic attacks within the past 6 months.

         15. Pulmonary hemorrhage/bleeding event greater than CTCAE Grade 2 within 4 weeks of
             study entry.

             study entry.

         17. Evidence or history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.

         18. Antineoplastic therapy, radiotherapy, or any other investigational drug within 30
             days prior to first study drug administration.

         19. Current treatment, or treatment in the previous 24 months, for another non-melanoma
             malignancy, with the exception of adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the
             cervix.

         20. Unable to return at the regular required intervals for reassessment, or study drug
             administration.
