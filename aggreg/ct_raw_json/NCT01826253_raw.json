However, the goal of fluid expansion was to increase the oxygen delivery, which\n      consider cardiac output, but also Haemoglobin which decrease during a fluid challenge. The\n      maximalization of cardiac output could decrease the oxygen delivery if the haemodilution was\n      too wide. The aim of this study was to describe the oxygen delivery during a fluid expansion\n      conducted for cardiac output maximalization, following actual guidelines."
