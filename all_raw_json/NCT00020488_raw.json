Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. Once the MTD of irinotecan has been determined, additional cohorts\n      receive escalating doses of fluorouracil until the MTD is determined. The MTD is defined as\n      the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting\n      toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 20\n      months."
