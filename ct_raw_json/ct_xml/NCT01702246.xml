  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether simvastatin is effective in reducing the
      frequency and intensity of vaso-occlusive pain episodes in patients with sickle cell
      disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by recurrent vaso-occlusive episodes and a
      chronic inflammatory state leading to progressive multi-organ injury. The pathophysiology of
      SCD is related to endothelial dysfunction driven largely by  impaired nitric oxide (NO)
      homeostasis and chronic inflammation. Through multiple mechanisms, including upregulation of
      NO, statins have been shown to confer protection from endothelial injury, independent of
      their cholesterol-lowering properties.

      By inhibiting inflammation and several common pathways leading to vascular
      damage,simvastatin may help prevent the acute and chronic complications of SCD. The
      objective of this study is to determine whether our preliminary results showing
      simvastatin-associated reductions in plasma markers of vascular injury will translate into a
      reduction in vaso-occlusive pain episodes in patients with SCD. A web-based,
      smartphone-accessible electronic pain diary will be used to monitor frequency and intensity
      of vaso-occlusive pain in SCD patients treated with a single daily dose of simvastatin.
