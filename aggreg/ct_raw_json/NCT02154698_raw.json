The standard needle has one bevel (angled\n      side of the needle formed when it is sharpened to make a point), while the ProCore needle\n      has 2 bevels. The standard needle is more commonly used and we are doing this study to see\n      if the ProCore needle would be more useful.\n\n      The investigator in charge of this study is Dr. Nichole T. Tanner. This study is being done\n      at four sites and will involve approximately 200 volunteers."

Subjects with suspected sarcoidosis, lymphoma, or metastatic cancer from other sites\n             (i.e. those without a known or suspected lung primary)\n\n          5. Subjects on anticoagulation (other than Aspirin) whom cannot have their\n             anticoagulation held for the procedure due to other clinical reasons (i.e. recent\n             cardiac stent placement)."
