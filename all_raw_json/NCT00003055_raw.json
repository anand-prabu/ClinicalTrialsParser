Evaluate the response rate of combined cisplatin and irinotecan in patients\n      with metastatic or locally advanced (inoperable or recurrent) esophageal or gastric cancer.\n      II. Evaluate the toxic effects both qualitatively and quantitatively of cisplatin and\n      irinotecan in these patients. III. Estimate the disease free and overall survival of these\n      patients. IV. Assess whether the response proportion differs between squamous cell and\n      adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. V. Evaluate quality of life issues using the Memorial\n      Symptom Assessment Scale, the FACT-G questionnaire, and the dysphagia scale.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive cisplatin and irinotecan on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 for 4 weeks,\n      followed by a 2 week rest period. Each treatment course lasts 6 weeks. Patients receive at\n      least 3 courses of therapy if the treatment is well tolerated and no disease progression is\n      documented. Patients attaining a complete response receive additional courses of therapy at\n      the discretion of the investigator. Tumor status is reassessed at 6 weeks and every 12 weeks\n      thereafter. Patients are followed until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-50 patients will be accrued within 12-18 months. Accrual\n      for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus is complete."
