    <description>The OSDI is a 12-question validated questionnaire (resultant overall 0-100 score) used to measure ocular symptoms, visual function, and environmental factors that may affect a patient's vision, where 0 = normal and 100 = severe. The OSDI questionnaire will be administered at both visits and completed by the patient with no assistance from the office staff, physician, or anyone else. The Baseline (Day 0) OSDI score will be subtracted from the Day 30 OSDI score and reported as change. A negative number will represent a perceived improvement in ocular health.</description>
