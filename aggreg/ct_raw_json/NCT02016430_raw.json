Specific aims include:\n\n        1. To investigate the proportion of subjects with persistently elevated circulating TMAO\n           levels.\n\n        2. To compare the amount of TMAO generated from gut flora using stable-isotope-labelled\n           choline, carnitine, and betaine in subjects with elevated versus normal circulating\n           TMAO levels.\n\n        3. To evaluate the effect of dietary interventions on the amount of TMAO generated from\n           gut flora using stable-isotope-labelled choline, carnitine, and betaine in subjects\n           with elevated circulating TMAO levels."
