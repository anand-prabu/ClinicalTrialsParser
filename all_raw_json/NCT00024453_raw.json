Patients are stratified according to\n      participating center and number of central venous catheter lumens (1 vs 2). Patients are\n      randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive teicoplanin IV bolus every 12 hours for 3 doses and then once\n           daily for 5 doses (total of 7 days).\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive teicoplanin IV over 2 hours and/or by antibiotic lock every 12\n           hours for 3 doses and then once daily for 5 doses (total of 7 days).\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 490-1,360 patients will be accrued for this study within\n      2.2-6.2 years."
