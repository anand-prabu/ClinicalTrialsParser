The\n      investigators hypothesize that snacking on nutrient-dense, highly satiating snack foods\n      (i.e. KIND snacks with almonds) as compared to snacking on nutrient-dilute, energy-dense\n      foods (i.e., conventional snack foods) will contribute to satiety, weight loss, and health\n      improvements.

Finally, the\n      investigators hypothesize that these effects will be seen even when study participants are\n      given clear guidance about the calorie content of snack items, and how to make room for\n      those calories in their diets.\n\n      Hypotheses:\n\n        1. Snacking on nutrient-dense, highly satiating snack foods (i.e. KIND snacks with\n           almonds) as compared to snacking on nutrient-dilute, energy-dense foods (i.e.,\n           conventional snack foods) will contribute to satiety, weight loss, and health\n           improvements.\n\n        2.
