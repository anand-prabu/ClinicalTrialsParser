To demonstrate the feasibility of using telemedicine to deliver specialty care into the\n           homes of individuals with Parkinson disease who have limited access to care;\n\n        2. To show that such an approach can improve quality of life;\n\n        3. To establish that the telemedicine can enhance the quality of care; and\n\n        4. To demonstrate that this remote approach to care saves time, reduces travel, and\n           decreases care partner burden."

Approximately 200 individuals with Parkinson disease (who due to\n      distance, disability, disparity, or doctor distribution have limited access to care) will be\n      randomized to one of two arms in this comparative effectiveness study.  The first (control)\n      arm will be the individual's \"usual care\" supplemented by educational materials on their\n      condition.  This usual care may include care from a generalist, care from a neurologist, or\n      in-person care from a Parkinson specialist. The care received by the control group will vary\n      but will be an accurate reflection of usual care in this country. The second (intervention)\n      arm will be usual care supplemented by educational materials and care from a Parkinson\n      disease specialist delivered via web-based video conferencing into the patient's home. The\n      participants will also be asked with they have a primary care partner, and care partners\n      will be invited to enroll, for a total of approximately 400 participants."
