In Stage 1, patients are randomized to receive placebo or 1\n      of 2 doses of AZT. Stage 1 lasts for 4 months. In Stage 2, patients who were initially\n      treated with placebo are randomized again and all patients receive AZT. Stage 2 lasts an\n      additional 12 months, during which time there are periodic medical and neurologic\n      evaluations. Before beginning treatment, all patients have a lumbar puncture and a\n      computerized tomographic (CT) scan of the brain. The lumbar puncture is repeated twice\n      during and once at the end of Stage 1; the CT scan is also repeated at the end of Stage 1.\n      Patients receiving AZT in either stage 1 or Stage 2 are seen by their physicians every week\n      for the first 4 weeks and every other week thereafter for the first 4 months of receiving\n      the drug. After 4 months, patients are seen by their physicians at 4 to 12 week intervals."
