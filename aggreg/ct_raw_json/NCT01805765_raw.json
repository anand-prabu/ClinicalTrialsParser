One is treatment group with 12 weeks of\n      Qing'E pills (well-controlled), the other is controlled group with 12 weeks of placebo. The\n      treatment outcome measures include: 1) the severity of menopausal symptoms: self-recording\n      of daily frequency of vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes), the Kupperman index. 2) NEI network\n      indices. 3) Urine metabolomics. All measures are conducted at baseline and endpoint except\n      the self-recoding of vasomotor symptoms, Kupperman index and urine metabolomics. Tyhe\n      investigators expect this research will provide an effective and safe therapy for menopausal\n      symptoms."
