Mostly, adolescent health programmes tend to focus on\n      unidirectional interventions aiming at a single determinant of adolescents\u00b4 sexual and\n      reproductive health. However, evidence exists that a complex health problem should be\n      addressed by an equally nuanced and multipronged response. Knowledge is lacking on how to\n      develop a comprehensive approach to promote adolescents' sexual health.\n\n      The CERCA study will conduct an implementation based on the hypothesis that a comprehensive\n      strategy of community-embedded interventions helps to improve the sexual health of\n      adolescents. We will test this hypothesis and describe the development, implementation and\n      testing of interventions in three Latin American cities: Cochabamba (Bolivia), Cuenca\n      (Ecuador) and Managua (Nicaragua).\n\n      The research methodology has been designed based on the methodological frameworks of action\n      research, community based participatory research and intervention mapping.\n\n      The interventions are complex addressing different target groups (adolescents, parents,\n      authorities and health providers) and focussing on various behaviours that are related to\n      communication about sexuality, information seeking, access to health care and safe sexual\n      intercourse.\n\n      For the evaluation of effectiveness a randomised and non-randomised controlled study was\n      developed for respectively Managua and the two other cities. Furthermore a process\n      evaluation is conducted.\n\n      This research will result in a framework that will contribute to the planning of\n      interventions that are effective and responsive to adolescents' sexual health needs."

The SCT helped to find out strategies to improve communication about sexuality, to promote openness towards adolescents' sexuality among parents, community members and health providers and for health providers to adopt a more adolescent friendly attitude.The development of the strategies in the different countries is a dynamic process that is continuously being adapted. The target groups  were \"driving\" the process of identifying, selecting and implementing interventions. Therefore, local institutions were involved in the intervention. Attention was paid to ensure that the interventions were in line with the existing local structures/policies and reinforce the local health system.Primary health care services had a key role in the interventions.
