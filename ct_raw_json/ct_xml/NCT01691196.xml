  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study addresses the following research question: What is the role of obesity in
      modulating inflammation and innate immune function, as well as the overall responsiveness of
      innate immune cells (such as macrophages, neutrophils, and other peripheral leukocytes) in
      patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis?

      The investigators hypothesize that obesity will lead to increased inflammation in patients
      undergoing peritoneal dialysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic inflammation is highly prevalent in ESRD and associated with adverse outcomes.  For
      example, chronic exposure of the peritoneal cavity to PD solution leads to induction of
      cytokines and other inflammatory mediators, generating peritoneal membrane inflammation
      which results in functional decline of ultrafiltration.  Obesity is characterized by a state
      of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation stemming from expanded adipose tissue mass.
      Animal studies from our group and others suggest that obesity is associated with exacerbated
      prolonged inflammatory responses in the peritoneal cavity.  The shifting demographic
      characteristics of the ESRD population, with a rise in elderly patients and those with
      obesity, is as a significant challenge for management of dialysis patients. Specifically, a
      2-fold increase in the percentage of obese patients in the ESRD population has been
      reported. The caloric burden of PD glucose-containing solutions adds an additional risk for
      development or exacerbation of obesity and diabetes in patients using this dialysis
      modality.  Few studies have directly evaluated the association between degree of adiposity
      and inflammation in PD patients.  Data obtained from the proposed experiments will help
      clarify the connection between obesity and risk factors for cardiovascular and infectious
      diseases in the PD population.  These data will also further our knowledge of the basic
      pathophysiology of both obesity and ESRD and enhance our understanding of factors involved
      in successful delivery of PD.  Results may lead to enhanced nutritional recommendations for
      PD patients and/or the use of low-glucose or non-glucose alternatives, with a resultant
      reduction in local and/or systemic inflammation and CVD and other risk factors.

    <description>Peritoneal dialysate effluent (PDE) and peripheral blood will be obtained from peritoneal dialysis (PD) subjects.  Levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adipokines, and acute-phase reactants will be evaluated in PDE and plasma.  The ability of peripheral leukocytes to respond to microbial stimuli will be studied using whole blood cultures.  We predict percentage of body fat will be significantly associated with higher levels of pro-inflammatory factors both systemically and locally and with reduced ability of peripheral leukocytes to respond to microbial stimuli.</description>

    <description>The composition of leukocytes from peritoneal dialysate effluent (PDE) will be analyzed to evaluate the absolute and relative amounts of leukocyte subclasses.  The phenotype of peritoneal macrophages (pMac) will be evaluated by flow cytometry, by real time RT-PCR, and by measurement of mediators characteristic of each activation type following ex vivo culture. We predict that we will observe a significant shift from an anti- to a pro-inflammatory pMac phenotype as adiposity increases</description>

    <description>DXA (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) will be conducted at UIC body composition laboratory using Hologic 4500 W Elite Scan.

      Blood Collection: Venous blood after overnight fast will include: (1) heparinized tube
      (green top) for whole blood (WB) cultures; (2) EDTA tube (lavender top) for CBC and
      measurement of cytokines and adipokines, and (3) serum-separator (red top) for determination
      of lipid panel, glucose, insulin, and hemoglobin A1c. Glucose and insulin will be used to
      calculate HOMA-IR (index of insulin resistance).

      Collection of peritoneal dialysis effluent (PDE): To minimize variability, 2.5% glucose
      peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution and 4h dwell time will be used for all patients on test
      day.  Immediately after collection, PDE will be chilled before further processing.
