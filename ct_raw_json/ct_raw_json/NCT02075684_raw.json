            "textblock": "The purpose of this research study is to create a prospectively maintained, multicenter\n      database of patients undergoing renal biopsy for renal masses performed percutaneously\n      (through skin), via an 18 gauge biopsy needle (.048 inches). In this database, the\n      investigators will collect and maintain the data from the biopsy procedure. This will allow\n      us to evaluate our experience with this procedure as well as to participate in\n      multi-institutional collaborative studies in the future. At University of California Irvine,\n      the investigators routinely biopsy patients with renal masses under real-time ultrasound\n      control. Percutaneous renal biopsy under ultrasound guidance is a routine procedure\n      performed to diagnose renal mass histopathology. The safety and efficacy of this procedure\n      has been well documented in the literature. The indications for percutaneous renal biopsy\n      have expanded as there has been a substantial increase in the number of renal masses that\n      are being diagnosed, and the acceptance of percutaneous biopsy continues to expand in\n      parallel. The biopsy procedure is part of your normal standard of care and if not being done\n      for this research project."
