This study will look at glycemic control in people who take\n      TAK-875 in addition to metformin.\n\n      The study will enroll approximately 620 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by\n      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups\u2014which will remain\n      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent\n      medical need):\n\n        -  TAK-875 50 mg\n\n        -  Sitagliptin 100 mg\n\n      All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the\n      study. All participants will be asked to self-monitor their blood glucose levels and\n      document any increases in blood glucose or symptoms of hypoglycemia in a diary.\n\n      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States, Latin America, Europe and\n      Asia. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 42 weeks and participants will\n      make up to 15 visits to the clinic.\n\n      Due to potential concerns about liver safety, on balance, the benefits of treating patients\n      with fasiglifam (TAK-875) do not outweigh the potential risks.\n\n      For this reason, Takeda has decided voluntarily to terminate the development activities for\n      fasiglifam."
