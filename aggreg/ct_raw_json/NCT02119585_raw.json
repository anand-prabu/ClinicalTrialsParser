In particular, reperfusion syndrome is\n      characterised by the release of several inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and oxygen\n      free radicals which may contribute to alveolar endothelial barrier dysfunction. The object\n      of this study is to investigate the respiratory system mechanics impairment in its\n      partitioning between lung and chest wall.\n\n      We hypothesize that impairment of respiratory system mechanics (of both lung and chest wall)\n      occurs after reperfusion phase of liver. This impairment is associated with the systemic\n      inflammatory response following liver reperfusion."
