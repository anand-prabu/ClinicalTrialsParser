        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients suffering from a gradually evolving painful condition in the Achilles tendon
             located at the midportion for at least 3 months (Diagnosis based on clinical
             examination showing a painful thickening of the Achilles tendon located at a level of
             2 to 6cm above the tendon insertion, and confirmed by ultrasonography: local
             thickening of the tendon, irregular tendon structure with hypoechoic areas and
             irregular fiber orientation).

          -  Men and non-pregnant women aged 18-70 years

          -  Be informed of the nature of the study and provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical suspicion of insertional disorders (pain at the site of the insertion of the
             Achilles tendon on the calcaneum)

          -  Clinical suspicion of an Achilles tendon rupture (Thompson test abnormal and palpable
             &quot;gap&quot;)

          -  Clinical suspicion of plantar flexor tenosynovitis (posteromedial pain when the toes
             are plantar flexed against resistance)

          -  Clinical suspicion of n.suralis pathology (sensitive disorder in the area of the
             sural nerve)

          -  Clinical suspicion of peroneal subluxation

          -  Suspicion of internal disorders: spondylarthropathy, gout, hyperlipidemia, Rheumatoid
             Arthritis and sarcoidosis.

          -  Condition that prevents the patients from executing an active exercise programme

          -  Patient has already performed eccentric exercises, according to the schedule of
             Alfredson et al (12 weeks)

          -  Patient has already received an injection of PRP for this injury

          -  Patient does not wish, for whatever reason, to undergo one of the two treatments

          -  Known presence of a pregnancy

          -  Condition of the Achilles tendon caused by medications (arising in relation to moment
             of intake), such as quinolones and statins
