            "textblock": "For this pilot feasibility study, combat veterans whose PTSD has been associated with severe\n      symptomatic suffering and functional impairment, despite treatment with all currently\n      available pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments, will be recruited from clinics\n      at a large, academically affiliated VA facility. An extensive screening over an extended\n      baseline by the study psychiatrist and neurosurgeon will be conducted using standard\n      interviews and clinical rating scales. Eligible subjects are required to have a cohabiting\n      significant other willing to participate in safety and function monitoring throughout the\n      study.\n\n      After successful completion of baseline eligibility requirements, comprehensive\n      neuropsychological testing will  be performed, as will structural MRI and FDG PET/CT of the\n      amygdala, insula and medial Prefrontal cortex. PET/CT will be performed and analyzed by a\n      nuclear medicine specialist collaborator familiar with this type of imaging research. Six\n      consenting subjects meeting all eligibility criteria will then receive bilateral basolateral\n      nucleus of the amygdala (BlnA) implantation of Medtronic Activa Primary Cell (PC)\n      implantable deep brain stimulator systems (purchased through the VA Merit Review Grant) by\n      functional neurosurgeons specialized in the procedure. This will be done during a 3-4 day\n      inpatient stay on the VA Greater Los Angeles Neurosurgical Service. After a month of weekly\n      safety monitoring with stimulators off, subjects will be will be hospitalized for 1 day on\n      the Neurology Service's electroencephalography (EEG) telemetry unit, under the care and\n      supervision of an epilepsy specialist neurologist who is a co-investigator in the study, for\n      stimulator initiation. Stimulator settings will be adjusted by the study clinical\n      neurophysiologist while patients are monitored by the study neurologist and psychiatrist.\n      Only stimulator settings that do not cause epileptiform discharges, or potentially\n      significant adverse psychiatric or medical (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate) changes will\n      be used over the subsequent long-term follow-up.\n\n      After the EEG telemetry safety check, subjects will be randomized (3/3) to either have their\n      stimulators turned on then (Week 0), or 3 months later (week 12). This staggered onset\n      double-blind design has been used in other DBS trials in psychiatry. After week 0, for the\n      next 2 years, subjects will be followed at regular intervals (weekly for 5 months, then\n      monthly for 7 months, then quarterly for 12 months) by a psychiatrist, neurosurgeon,\n      neurologist and neurophysiologist who will conduct an extensive battery of psychiatric and\n      neurological testing (including periodic EEG recordings), as well as significant other\n      interviews, while stimulator settings are adjusted based on standardized rating scale\n      outcomes and adverse effects so as to optimize treatment outcome. The principal study\n      hypothesis is that the symptomatic and functional benefits of chronic stimulation will\n      outweigh the risks and adverse-effects, and that symptomatic improvement will be greater,\n      without unacceptable adverse effects, in subjects with week 0, compared to week 12\n      stimulator initiation. Neuropsychological testing will be repeated after 6 months of\n      stimulation to assess changes in cognitive function. Functional neuroimaging with PET/CT\n      will be repeated after a year of stimulation to assess changes in the activity of brain\n      regions known to function abnormally in PTSD."

No instructions are given as to how to match the response cards to the stimulus - by color, design or quantity of symbols.  Feedback is given each time a correct or incorrect selection is made.  During the test the matching rules are altered and the subject must adjust by learning the new rules.  The approximate time to complete this test is 15-30 minutes.

It is based upon the fact that we can read words faster than we can name colors. There are 3 parts to the test. In Part 1 (Color Reading), the subject has to read the word of the colors, (red, green, blue) which are printed either in black ink or in the color that corresponds to the printed word.  In the Part 2 (Color Naming), the print color of the words does not correspond to the color name and the subject must name the printed word.  In Part 3, the subject must name the color in which the color names are printed and disregard reading the word. An increased interference effect can occur in a variety of disorders which include mental disease.  The entire test can be completed in about 5 minutes.

The provocation will consist of re-exposure of the patient to the initial trauma that caused PTSD using script-driven imagery as in prolonged exposure therapy. Baseline and 15 month scans will be compared both for resting and post-provocation metabolism. The hypothesis is that DBS reduces amygdala hyperactivity in PTSD patients. The PET CT scan data will be processed with a statistical parametric mapping method using SPM99 (Wellcome Department of Neurology, London, England). PET data in each voxel will be normalized and fitted in a linear statistical model. Hypotheses will be evaluated as contrasts where the linear compounds of the model parameters will be evaluated with t-tests  transformed into a z-score. We will consider z>3.09 (P<0.001 one tail, uncorrected) as statistically significant.",
