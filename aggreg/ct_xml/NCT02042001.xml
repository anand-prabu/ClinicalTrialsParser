  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite long-term use in clinical practice, chronic treatment with efavirenz (EFV) has been
      associated with persistent central nervous system symptoms or mild or even asymptomatic
      neurocognitive impairment. Whether switching to rilpivirine (RPV) containing regimen is
      beneficial among patients who experience mild or asymptomatic
      neurocognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse events during EFV has not been explored yet.

      The proposed pilot study will examine whether switching from EFV-based regimen to single
      tablet regimen TDF/FTC/RPV is associated with neurocognitive/neuropsychiatric improvement
      among HIV-infected patients with mild/asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment or
      neuropsychiatric symptoms during EFV-containing antiretroviral treatment.

      Patients under stable treatment with EFV, confirmed HIV-1 RNA viral load &lt; 50 copies/mL and
      altered scores in depression, quality of sleep or anxiety tests and/or alteration in 1 or
      more domains as assessed by neuropsychological assessment, will be randomized to immediate
      or deferred (12 weeks) switch to TDF/FTC/RPV. Neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric tests will
      be repeated after 12 and 24 weeks of follow-up and variations will be compared between
      groups.
