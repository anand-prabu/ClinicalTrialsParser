Postoperative pulmonary complications are a major factor, which increase\n      patient morbidity and mortality (PERISCOPE study). This study is designed to evaluate the\n      effects of management of neuromuscular blockade on postoperative pulmonary complications in\n      a general unrestricted anaesthetized population across Europe. The investigation will be a\n      continuation of the European EUSOS and PERISCOPE studies. Based on a well-recognised body of\n      surrogate data, it is hypothesized that incorrect approaches to the use, monitoring, and\n      reversal of muscle relaxants will increase the incidence of in-hospital postoperative\n      pulmonary complications and prolong hospital stay.\n\n      The investigators will not modify a participating centre's customary management of patients.\n      Patients with postoperative pulmonary complications will be identified by postoperative\n      assessment and consulting medical records for events that fulfil the definition of\n      postoperative pulmonary complications."
