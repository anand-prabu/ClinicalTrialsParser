  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It was well known that aspiration is the primary cause of an aspiration pneumonia among the
      dysphagia patients.

      In order to predict the degree of an aspitation,video-fluoroscopic-swallowing study and
      fiberoptic-endoscopic swallowing evaluation have been developed, but those evaluations are
      invasive and allowed only in a limited condition.

      In this study, as a precedent study for the non-linear analysis, voice analysis using LPC
      method will be evaluated. The superiority of LPC method will be compared with a spectral
      analysis using Jitter and Simmer as a positive control.

      This clinical study will be performed prospective, positive-controlled, single-blind (i.e.
      assessor-blind),and single cohort clinical trial for efficacy
