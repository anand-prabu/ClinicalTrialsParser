  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A few PhA cut-off points have been proposed to define malnutrition in cirrhosis, and they
      have proven to be useful in prognosticating severity of the disease and mortality. However,
      PhA needs specific validation in different ethnic groups. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the PhA cut-off value that would best define malnutrition and predict mortality in
      patients with liver cirrhosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is a frequent complication of cirrhosis, and it has been associated with a more
      severe disease and decompensating events. Despite its relevance, there is no gold standard
      for nutritional assessment in cirrhosis, and intrinsic pathophysiologic changes make
      biochemical markers and traditional methods used to evaluate malnutrition unreliable. Phase
      angle (PhA) obtained from bioelectrical impedance has been successfully used as a
      nutritional marker in several diseases such as chronic renal failure, cancer, and HIV, where
      it has been associated with prolonged in-hospital stay and mortality. In cirrhosis, research
      linking malnutrition to increased mortality has yielded conflicting results, likely due to
      the lack of a gold standard. A few PhA cut-off points have been proposed to define
      malnutrition in cirrhosis, and they have proven to be useful in prognosticating severity of
      the disease and mortality. However, PhA needs specific validation in different ethnic
      groups. The aim of this study was to evaluate the PhA cut-off value that would best define
      malnutrition and predict mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis.
