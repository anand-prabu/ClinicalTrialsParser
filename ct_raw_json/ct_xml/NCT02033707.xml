      This non-treatment study will investigate the effects on mood and performance caused by
      hallucinogens and other psychoactive compounds.

    <textblock>
      Twenty volunteers between 21-50 years old will each participate in 16 total sessions,
      including sessions for: screening, preparation, experiment/drug, immediate follow-ups, a
      1-month follow-up and 1 post completion urine collection. On each of five experimental
      session participants will orally ingest capsules of either a placebo or varying doses of one
      of 18 different psychoactive compounds.

      Subjective drug effects will be examined with methods previously used by this laboratory for
      characterizing the effects of psychoactive substances from a variety different classes.
      Volunteers will swallow capsules containing various doses of drugs, complete tasks during
      the session, and rate effects of the drug and complete questionnaires at the end of each
      session as described below.

    <description>One of the following or placebo will be given:
Hallucinogens: DMT, 4-phosphoryloloxy-N-diethyltryptamine, dipropyltryptamine (DPT), ketamine, dextromethorphan, mescaline, PCP, psilocybin, salvinorin-A, LSD, d-lysergic acid amide (LSA), MDMA, cannabis
Sedatives/anxiolytics: alprazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, secobarbital, temazepam, triazolam, zolpidem
Antihistamines: diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine
Stimulants: d-amphetamine, caffeine, ephedrine, methylphenidate, diethylproprion
Opioids: heroin, morphine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, methadone, codeine
Other: alcohol, scopolamine, nicotine
Each volunteer will receive a hallucinogen on at least one of five sessions. More drugs are listed than will be administered to increase the degree to which volunteers are &quot;blind&quot; to the drugs being studied. It is important that the volunteer and research staff be blinded to specific drug conditions to minimize confounding the results with expectations about the nature of drug effects.</description>
