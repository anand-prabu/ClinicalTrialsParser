            "textblock": "The manifestation of weakness and involuntary reflexes following motor incomplete spinal\n      cord injury (SCI) may be partly a result of damage to descending pathways to the spinal cord\n      that release serotonin. In models of SCI, for example, application of agents that simulate\n      serotonin has been shown to modulate voluntary motor behaviors, including augmentation of\n      walking recovery. In humans following neurological injury, the effects of 5HT agents are\n      unclear. Few previous reports indicate improved motor function following administration of\n      agents which enhance the available serotonin in the brain, although some data suggests that\n      decreased serotonin may be beneficial. In this application, the investigators propose to\n      study the effects of clinically used agents that increase or decrease intrinsic serotonin\n      activity in the brain on strength and walking ability following human motor incomplete SCI.\n      Using detailed electrophysiological recordings, and biomechanical and behavioral measures,\n      the investigators will determine the effects of acute or chronic doses of these drugs on\n      voluntary and involuntary motor behaviors during static and dynamic conditions. The novelty\n      of this proposed research is the expectation that agents that enhance serotonin activity may\n      increase abnormal reflexes in SCI, but simultaneously facilitate motor and walking recovery.\n      Despite potential improvements in voluntary function, the use of pharmacological agents that\n      may enhance spastic motor behaviors following SCI is in marked contrast to the way in which\n      drugs are typically used in the clinical setting."

Voluntary and reflexive motor behaviors in 120\n      subjects with SCI will be assessed. These interventions will be applied to individuals with\n      acute (< 6 months post injury) chronic (> 1 year post injury) motor incomplete SCI to\n      determine both the rate and extent of changes in volitional motor performance and\n      involuntary spastic behaviors.   For the training portion of the study (referred to as\n      subproject 2 below), a portion of the acute and chronic subjects will be evaluated every 2\n      weeks for up to16 weeks and participate in locomotor training, to investigate and better\n      understand changes in motor function and recovery in individuals with spinal cord injuries.\n      Following 2-4 weeks of this training, individuals will be given either the study drug, or\n      placebo and continue evaluation and training.  Following an additional 4 weeks, subjects\n      will be given either the placebo or study drug (whichever they did not receive during the\n      prior 4 weeks).  The order will be randomized."
