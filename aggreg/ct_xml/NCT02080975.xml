  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Successful radio frequency (RF) cardiac catheter ablation requires the creation of lesions
      by delivering energy while maintaining adequate catheter contact with the endocardium.
      Unfortunately, it is difficult to identify contact intraoperatively as a typical RF ablation
      catheter lacks clear indications of contact. We propose to use the Boston Scientific
      IntellaTip MiFi catheter to explore whether characteristics of the electrograms produced by
      the mini-electrodes on the ablation tip could help confirm tissue contact. Using an
      ultrasound catheter to define instances of clear contact and non-contact, we will determine
      whether the micro-electrodes produce sufficient information to confirm catheter contact. We
      propose that the MiFi catheter produces sufficient signal characteristics that can be used
      as an effective surrogate for adequate tissue contact.

    <description>All enrolled patients are clinically indicated for an atrial flutter ablation. The patients who consent for this study will have additional electrocardiograms taken during their procedure for future review, as well as ultrasound images form inside their heart. This will lengthen the ablation by approximately 10 minutes, but is not a separate procedure.</description>
