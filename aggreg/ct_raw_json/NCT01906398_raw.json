This will be an open label\n      study comparing seizure frequency during 4 months of prospective baseline observation period\n      with seizure frequency during 4 months of add-on KD treatment. 18-65 year old men and women\n      with refractory epilepsy, defined as seizures persisting in spite of past/present treatments\n      with \u2265 3 AEDs, with seizure frequency of \u2265 0.5/month, will be evaluated. Subjects with both\n      primary generalized and localization-related epilepsy (PGE, LRE) will be recruited. Subjects\n      will have had epilepsy for at least 2 years prior to enrollment. Following initial\n      screening, subjects will be observed for 4 months, with no change in AEDs except when deemed\n      necessary by the patient's neurologist according to standard clinical care. Patients will\n      then start ketogenic diet. Evaluations will include seizure frequency using a seizure diary,\n      adverse events, treatment compliance using urine and plasma ketone levels. Quality of life\n      will be evaluated with a standardized questionnaire of Quality Of Life In patients with\n      Epilepsy, QOLIE-31-P. Level of alertness will be evaluated with Epworth Sleepiness Scale.\n      These questionnaires will be administered at each visit."
