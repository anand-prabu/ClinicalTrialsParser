             Clinical Interview for DSM-IV  (SCID).

          3. Live within a commutable distance of the Treatment Research Center (TRC) at the
             Penn/VA Center for Studies of Addiction, University of Pennsylvania.  We define this
             to be a distance within the service area of Septa, within an hour drive, or a
             distance that both the patient and Principal Investigator (PI) find acceptable.

          4. Understands and signs the informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             alcohol, or nicotine dependence, as determined by the SCID.

          2. Subject is, in the investigator's opinion, at risk of requiring medical
             detoxification for alcohol dependence during the study.

          3. Concomitant treatment with psychotropic medications.

          4. Current gambling problems. This will be assessed by the patient's self-report.

          5. Patients mandated to treatment based upon a legal decision or as a condition of
             employment who will use participation in this study to fulfill to their court
             mandated treatment requirement.This will be assessed by the patient's self-report.

          6. Current severe psychiatric symptoms, e.g., psychosis, dementia, suicidal or homicidal
             ideation, mania or depression requiring antidepressant therapy in the opinion of the

          9. Current use of naltrexone, disulfiram, modafinil, stimulants, haloperidol,
             benzodiazepines or anticonvulsants.

         10. Known hypersensitivity to varenicline.

         11. Patients with known AIDS or other serious illnesses that may require hospitalization
             during the study.

         12. Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating, or female subjects of child-bearing

             of birth control include:

               1. barrier (diaphragm or condom) with spermicide

               2. intrauterine progesterone contraceptive system

               3. levonorgestrel implant

               4. medroxyprogesterone acetate contraceptive injection

               5. oral contraceptives

               6. tubal ligation.

         13. Patients with impaired renal function as indicated by corrected creatinine clearance
             below 60 ml/min as determined by the modified Cockcroft equation (CDC, 1986).

         14. Clinical laboratory tests (CBC, blood chemistries, urinalysis) outside normal limits
             that are clinically unacceptable to the Medical Director.  EKG 1st degree heart
             block, sinus tachycardia, left axis deviation, and nonspecific ST or T wave changes
             are allowed; liver function tests [LFTs] &lt;5 x ULN are acceptable).
