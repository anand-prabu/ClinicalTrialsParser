            "textblock": "Lung disease is the predominant cause of morbidity and mortality in Cystic Fibrosis (CF)\n      with 80% of deaths resulting directly or indirectly from pulmonary disease. Abnormal airway\n      clearance causes retention of mucus resulting in frequent chest infections. Physiotherapists\n      use different techniques to help clear mucus from the lungs of patients with CF. Inhaled\n      medications and airways clearance techniques (ACTs) are central to a CF patient's daily\n      treatment and are often coordinated.\n\n      Burden of treatment is a common reason for non-adherence in this patient group, and\n      streamlining of treatment timings is sought to optimize adherence whilst ensuring efficacy\n      to an often complex daily regimen of inhaled bronchodilators, nebulizers and ACTs. A gap in\n      the research exists as to the optimal timing of Hypertonic Saline (HTS) and ACT within the\n      daily regimen. A study to show whether the timing of HTS around ACT is significant, can\n      better inform patients and potentially allow more flexibility around their treatment\n      regimen.\n\n      Lung Clearance Index (LCI) has shown good sensitivity to abnormalities in lung function\n      compared with spirometry and has demonstrated a treatment effect in other trials. LCI may be\n      a suitable tool therefore, to assess intervention strategies aimed at airways clearance in\n      CF. This study aims to compare the effects ACTs after HTS inhalation versus ACTs during HTS\n      inhalation as measured by LCI.\n\n      It is a randomized, crossover trial of ACTs after HTS inhalation compared with ACTs during\n      HTS inhalation in adult CF patients during day 10-14 of a hospital admission for treatment\n      of a pulmonary exacerbation. Patients will be randomized to receive 1 of the treatment\n      session options on the first day and the reverse on the second day.\n\n      The primary objective of this study is to compare the change in LCI (a measure of lung\n      function) at 90 minutes post treatment with ACTs after HTS inhalation compared with ACTs\n      during HTS inhalation in adult CF patients.\n\n      LCI (lung clearance index) ACT (airway clearance technique) HTS (hypertonic saline)"
