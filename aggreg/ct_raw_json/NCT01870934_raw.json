            "textblock": "Diabetic foot ulcers are deep wounds that occur as a result of nerve damage in the feet\n      (peripheral neuropathy). Amputation is a common consequence of diabetic foot ulcers;\n      approximately 85% of all diabetes-related amputations are caused by foot ulcers. The ulcer\n      treatment is extensive, resource demanding and highly specialized and necessitates\n      involvement of patient, hospital and local in-home care personnel.\n\n      The 3D photo optic camera project aims at a much more efficient and precise method for\n      diagnosis and treatment of foot ulcers. The Department of Endocrinology and the section for\n      LEAN and Innovation at Odense University Hospital has developed a prototype for a 3D camera\n      that takes pictures and measurements of the ulcer that can provide the basis for correct\n      diagnosis and treatment of the ulcer. The camera was developed in close cooperation with\n      TECCLUSTER A/S, Svendborg Municipality, Team Online and ComMed."
