The study will consist of two parts: Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion. In the\n      Dose Escalation, each patient will have at least two lesions: a first index lesion for the\n      Induction treatment and a second lesion for repeated Induction treatment and Maintenance\n      treatment. The Dose Escalation consists of four periods: First induction treatment (up to 6\n      weeks of LTX-315) in the first index lesion; Second induction (up to 6 weeks of LTX-315) and\n      Maintenance treatment (up to 20 weeks of LTX-315) in the second index lesion; Follow-up.\n\n      In the Dose Expansion each patient will have at least two lesions: a first index lesion for\n      Induction and Maintenance treatment and a second lesion as a target (reference) lesion. The\n      Dose Expansion will be done as determined by the Safety Review Committee and the Sponsor.\n      The the optimal regimen will be based on the results of the Dose Escalation from the\n      following information:\n\n        1. Safety parameters including blood samples and cardiovascular effects\n\n        2. Immunohistology and ultrasound confirmation of necrosis and tumour infiltrating\n           lymphocytes\n\n        3. Systemic inflammatory response such as total lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP)\n           or cytokines\n\n        4. Evidence of clinical responses\n\n      Cohorts may be utilised to:\n\n        1. Evaluate different doses of LTX-315\n\n        2. Explore potential modifications to the Induction and/or the Maintenance phases\n\n        3. Evaluate the potential to include appropriate combination therapies with LTX-315\n\n        4. Gain further information on clinical efficacy\n\n      Maintenance treatment may be extended for patients who have not progressed according to\n      immune-related response criteria (irRC), as long as it is considered beneficial to the\n      patient. Only adverse events and efficacy data will be collected on the extended Maintenance\n      treatment."
