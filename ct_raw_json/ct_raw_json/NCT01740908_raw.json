Control subjects will have their blood drawn at the same time as the treatment subjects, in ordert to establish a non-treatment baseline.  The stem cell population that is resident in the peripheral blood will be analyzed using the cell sorting and cell identification system at Aldagen.  Mononulcear cells will be gated on the basis of forward and side laser light scatter, and 250,000 events will be analyzed to determine the percentage of ALDHbr cells, and the expression of additional stem cell markers, such as CD45, CD34, and CD105.",
