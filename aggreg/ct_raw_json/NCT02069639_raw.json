PET (positron-emission tomography) -positive patients after alloSCT have\n      a dismal outcome. Serum TARC (thymus and activation-regulated chemokine) is produced by\n      Reed-Sternberg cells and may be a marker of disease. Our study was aimed at assessing\n      whether TARC levels after alloSCT were correlated to disease status and whether TARC\n      monitoring could increase the ability to predict relapse."
