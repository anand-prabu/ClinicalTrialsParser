  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will assess the incidence of Overactive Bladder/Detrusor Overactivity
      (OAB/DO) post-operatively in patients post robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) and
      to investigate whether fesoterodine will alter the incidence of OAB/DO in these patients.
      Additionally, the correlation between OAB symptoms and urodynamic DO will be analyzed.
