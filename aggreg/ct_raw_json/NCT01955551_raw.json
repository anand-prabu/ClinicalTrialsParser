            "textblock": "Evidence-based programs aimed at enhancing parenting skills are effective,  and\n      pediatricians identify many parents who could benefit from such programs.   Low-income\n      children have high rates of behavior problems and their family system and environmental\n      exposures often lead to cumulative and daunting levels of risk for poor functional outcomes;\n       their parents are highly likely to benefit from parenting supports.  However, low-income\n      families are the most likely to drop out of parenting interventions,  meaning the families\n      and children with the greatest need receive the least support.  Fewer than 25% of low-income\n      families recruited to parenting programs will participate in even one session, and only\n      about half of these parents will participate in more than half of the sessions offered. The\n      aims of this trial are:\n\n      Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that the provision of motivational interviewing (MI), as\n      compared to an attention control (AC) condition, will increase the engagement of low-income\n      parents of preschoolers in an evidence-based parenting skills group (the Incredible Years\n      Series (IYS)).  For this study, the outcome of engagement is operationally defined as\n      intention to attend IYS sessions, attendance, and satisfaction with the IYS program.\n\n      Aim 2:  To test the hypothesis that the effect of MI on engagement in IYS will be impacted\n      by the following moderators: parenting self-efficacy, child behavior problems, and maternal\n      depression.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that the effect of MI on engagement will be greater among\n      parents with lower parenting self-efficacy and parents of children with more behavior\n      problems, but less among parents with more maternal depressive symptoms.\n\n      The investigators will use a stratified, randomized controlled trial (RCT) design to\n      evaluate the impact of MI on parent engagement in a well-validated preventive parenting\n      skills intervention, the Incredible Years Series (IYS)."
