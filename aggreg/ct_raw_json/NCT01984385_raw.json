After eligibility has been confirmed and informed consent has been obtained,\n      participants will be registered in the study. Troponin level, complete blood counts and\n      serum creatinine level will be collected at day 1 through day 10 post admission. CAM\n      instrument will be employed at admission and once daily post admission day 1 through day 10.\n      FIM Instrument will be administered within 72 hours of admission to establish pre-fracture\n      functional independence and disability. Patients will be contacted by research personnel by\n      telephone 30 days after study registration."

Mechanism of injury consistent with either:\n\n               1. A fall from a standing height or;\n\n               2. Another mechanism of injury which, in the clinical judgment of an orthopedic\n                  surgeon, would impart the same or less traumatic energy as a fall from a\n                  standing height\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Patients with fractures isolated to the proximal femoral shaft, with no involvement\n             of the intertrochanteric, femoral neck, or subcapital region\n\n          2. Patients with hip fractures resulting from high energy mechanisms, such as motor\n             vehicle accidents or falls from a substantial height\n\n          3. Patient who refuse 30-day or 6-month follow up\n\n          4. Patients who refuse to consent either by themselves or through a substitute\n             decision-maker (for patients unable to consent, we will use a deferred consent\n             process, as described below)."
