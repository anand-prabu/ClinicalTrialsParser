The current treatment given to individuals\n      who are diagnosed with LPR is a course of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medication. This\n      medication reduces the amount of gastric acid that is produced and generally leads to\n      symptom relief. In order to study whether the pH probe can help physicians predict if the\n      patient will respond to PPI therapy, the physicians will measure the pH level of patients'\n      throats before they start PPI medication. Subjects who agree to participate in this study\n      will have a small flexible tube (about the width of a piece of uncooked spaghetti) placed in\n      their throat. The physician will place the tube through the nose until the tip is in the\n      back of the throat, high enough so that the patient will not feel it when they talk, eat,\n      drink, or swallow.  This tube measures the pH in the throat over a period of 24 hours and\n      helps physicians study the relationship between pH level, LPR symptoms, and the\n      effectiveness of PPI therapy.
