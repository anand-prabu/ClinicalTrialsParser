            "textblock": "Background: Hypothermia is common during general and regional anesthesia even when active\n      warming measures are taken. The existing literature shows that, in pregnant patients,  the\n      use of forced air-warming during cesarean section under spinal anesthesia does not prevent\n      maternal hypothermia. Therefore, this study aimed to establish the efficacy of a pre-warming\n      system, initiated 30 minutes before the onset of spinal anesthesia and during surgery, in\n      pregnant women subjected to elective cesarean delivery.\n\n      Methods: Forty healthy pregnant patients undergoing elective cesarean section with spinal\n      anesthesia were allocated to the control group (Gcont, n = 20), without the use of a thermal\n      gown, and to the gown group (Ggown, n = 20), with the use of a thermal gown in the\n      preoperative care unit, 30 minutes before spinal anesthesia installation and during surgery.\n      After the anesthesia, the thermal gown was moved from the regular position and placed over\n      the chest and upper limbs, as an upper body blanket, and maintained throughout the study.\n      The following variables were analyzed: preoperative and operative room temperature,\n      hemoglobin saturation, heart rate, arterial pressure, core and peripheral body temperatures\n      in the preoperative care unit room (30 minutes) and at 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after\n      spinal anesthesia. The ANOVA test compared core and peripheral temperatures of each group\n      according to the intervals between time-points."

            "textblock": "Introduction Body temperature decreasing following the onset of general or regional\n      anesthesia is caused by a core-to-peripheral redistribution of heat, as demonstrated by\n      several previous studies. Perioperative hypothermia and its complications have been widely\n      studied in patients subjected to non-obstetric surgery; however, literature on the obstetric\n      population is rare, although the incidence of intraoperative shivering can be as high as 60%\n      in these patients. A previous study based on the use of forced air-warming unit during the\n      preoperative and intraoperative periods in patients subjected to cesarean delivery observed\n      a lower incidence of hypothermia and shivering in patients given epidural anesthesia when\n      compared to those given spinal anesthesia.\n\n      The forced air system is by far the most commonly used intraoperative warming approach and\n      has an admirable safety record. However, the problem with blanket-forced air warming,\n      circulating-water garments, or water mattresses is that it is impossible to change their\n      position on the bed, which can be uncomfortable, especially if the patient is waiting in a\n      sitting position.\n\n      The Bair Paws Gown\u00ae presents an air warming system that provides patient-controlled comfort\n      warming in the pre and postoperative setting. The same gown offers effective clinical\n      warming during surgery involving the head, neck, knees or extremities. The air-warming flows\n      through the gown, from knees to head or from head to knees, and allows the patient to be\n      seated with gown covering the area between knees and neck.\n\n      Therefore, we designed a study to establish the efficacy of a pre-warming system initiated\n      30 minutes before the onset of spinal anesthesia and continuing during the surgery for\n      pregnant women subjected to elective cesarean delivery. The primary goal of this study was\n      to test the hypothesis that the use of a thermal gown 30 minutes before spinal anesthesia\n      and during surgery prevents maternal hypothermia. The secondary goals of this study were to\n      assess the effects of this warming method on hemodynamic variables and to evaluate thermal\n      comfort, incidence of shivering, and degree of satisfaction with the anesthetic procedure.\n\n      Methods After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval (record 388/08) and written\n      informed consent, 40 healthy ASA physical status I or II pregnant women presenting for\n      scheduled cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia were enrolled in this prospective,\n      randomized study.\n\n      Randomization (1:1) was based on a random computer generated code that was maintained in\n      sequentially numbered opaque envelopes.\n\n      Eligible participants were pregnant women between 18 and 40 years of age, with singleton\n      pregnancy and gestation longer than 37 weeks, scheduled for elective cesarean section.\n      Patients with fever and/or infectious conditions, a familial history of potential malignant\n      hyperthermia, body mass index (BMI) values below 18.5 kg.cm-2 or above 36 kg.cm-2, thyroid\n      disorders, dysautonomia, Raynaud's syndrome, and those in labor were excluded.\n\n      Participants remained seated in the preoperative care unit until they were allocated to one\n      of the following groups: control group (Gcont n = 20), in which surgery was performed\n      without the use of a thermal gown, or gown group (Ggown n = 20), in which surgery was\n      performed while the patients were covered with a thermal gown (Bair Paws Standard Warming\n      Gown 810 model with a Bair Hugger, model 850 warming unit) with forced-air flow at 40\u00baC in\n      the preoperative care unit 30 minutes before the spinal anesthesia. When the patients were\n      transferred to the operative room, the warming gown was switched off for the gown group;\n      however, the gown was maintained in place and, when the pregnant women arrived in operative\n      room, the system was switched back on and the gown was moved to the anterior part of the\n      body, covering chest and upper limbs as an upper body blanket, which was maintained until\n      the end of surgery.\n\n      In the operative room, a venous cannula was inserted into the forearm, and an infusion of\n      Ringer's lactate solution fluids at 37\u00baC was initiated. Spinal anesthesia was administered\n      using 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine, combined with 10 \u00b5g of fentanyl and 80 \u00b5g of\n      morphine. Puncture was performed at level L1-L2 or L2-L3 of the lumbar vertebra, and surgery\n      began when the sensory blockage reached a level between the T4 and T6 thoracic vertebra, as\n      established by the loss of sensitivity to needle pricks. Intraoperative hydration used 500\n      ml of 40\u00baC Ringer's lactate solution before fetal extraction and 800 \u00b5g metaraminol was\n      provided via slow infusion or 400 \u00b5g was delivered as an IV bolus whenever the arterial\n      pressure decreased by more than 25% of the baseline value. Following fetal extraction but\n      before the end of surgery, 1,000 ml of Ringer's lactate solution with 20 IU of oxytocin was\n      infused.\n\n      The following variables were collected for all patients: age, weight, height, BMI,\n      hemoglobin peripheral saturation (SpO2), heart rate (HR), systolic arterial pressure (SAP),\n      diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), core temperature (tympanic membrane) determined by means\n      of a digital thermometer (Techline Model TS 201) and peripheral temperature with a skin\n      temperature probe, placed on the forearm contralateral to the arm where the warmed\n      crystalloid solution was infused. Ambient temperature was maintained near 22\u00baC.\n\n      Maternal data, including SpO2, HR, SAP, DAP (25% above baseline), and core and peripheral\n      temperature, were assessed at the following time-points: T30min (30 minutes before spinal\n      anesthesia); T0min (immediately after the spinal anesthesia); and T15min, T30min, T45min,\n      and T60min (15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes following the onset of spinal anesthesia,\n      respectively).\n\n      In addition, the following postoperative data were assessed in the postanesthesia care unit\n      (PACU): thermal comfort or discomfort when wearing a thermal gown (questionnaire with items\n      ranging from very uncomfortable, uncomfortable, neither comfortable nor uncomfortable,\n      comfortable, to very comfortable); shivering according to Wrench's scale (0 - no shivering;\n      1 - one or more symptoms of piloerection, peripheral vasoconstriction, and peripheral\n      cyanosis without any other cause and without visible muscular activity; 2 - visible muscular\n      activity confined to one muscle group; 3 - visible muscular activity in more than one muscle\n      group; and 4 - gross muscular activity involving the entire body); thermal discomfort\n      according to Horn's verbal numerical scale (0 - worst imaginable cold, 100 - insufferably\n      hot); degree of satisfaction with the anesthetic procedure according to a verbal numeric\n      scale (0 - extremely unsatisfied, 100 - extremely satisfied); and adverse effects during the\n      immediate postoperative period. Moreover, patients were given 12.5 - 25 mg meperidine\n      whenever their shivering scores were equal to or greater than three.\n\n      In this study, hypothermia was defined as < 36.0\u00baC. For ethical reasons, active warming was\n      instituted when core temperature was 35.9 \u00baC or less in the PACU.\n\n      Sample size was calculated to be 20 participants to ensure that a difference of 0.5\u00baC could\n      be detected at significance level of 5%, with a statistical power of 80%, assuming the\n      standard deviation of differences to be 0.5\u00baC.\n\n      Statistical significance was established at p < 0.05, and the statistical analysis was\n      performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) software version 15."
