The rate of\n      progression is gradual and variable over the course of 10-20 years or longer. There is a\n      need to better understand the disease-specific features of HIBM to heighten disease\n      awareness; facilitate early diagnosis; identify patients; expand knowledge of the clinical\n      presentation, progression and variation of the disease; identify and validate biomarkers and\n      other efficacy measures; inform on the design and interpretation of clinical studies of\n      investigational products; and eventually to optimize patient management."
