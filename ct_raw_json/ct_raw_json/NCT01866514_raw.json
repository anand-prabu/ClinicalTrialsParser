An alternate proximal humerus IO\n      insertion technique has been developed to meet the needs of anesthesia patient positioning\n      that uses a slightly more distal insertion site and a superior angle of insertion. However\n      infusion flow rate in the proximal humerus using the anesthesia technique has not been\n      measured. This study is needed to evaluate the anesthesia proximal humerus IO insertion\n      technique to determine if the IO infusion flow rates remain unchanged by the alternate\n      method."

With the 45mm IO needle placed perpendicular to the plane of the skin, the IO needle is inserted into the surgical neck using a slightly superior angle of insertion and the needle is inserted to the hub. The stylet will be removed and an EZ-Connect primed with 2% preservative-free lidocaine will be attached to the catheter hub.
