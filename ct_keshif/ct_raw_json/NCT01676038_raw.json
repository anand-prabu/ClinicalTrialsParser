Optimal placement of the implants within 3\u00b0 of the mechanical axis of the lower\n      limb has been proven to reduce wear and early implant failure.\n\n      Compared to conventional techniques, computer-Aided Navigation total knee arthroplasty has\n      been widely used in the last decade and have been proven to improve the accuracy of\n      prosthesis placement and lower limb alignment by reducing the number of outliers with more\n      than 3\u00b0 deviation from the mechanical axis. However, its use also involves a steep learning\n      curve, high initial capital cost and longer duration of surgery.\n\n      Traditional computer-navigated TKA using optical tracking systems also requires fixation of\n      the femoral and tibial reference arrays to bone using anchoring pins. Complications reported\n      with the use of these pins include either femoral or tibial fracture, pin site pain, pin\n      site infection and osteomyelitis. The investigators study aims to investigate the accuracy\n      of a new pinless navigation system for TKA that will avoid these complications."
