For patients in group 1 autologous mesenchymal cells\n      will be obtained from the bone marrow and infuse immediately after the time necessary for\n      their production. For patients in group 2, bone marrow cells will be frozen for later\n      procedure of mesenchymal cells and their infusion after six months.\n\n      Patients will be evaluated by clinical, radiological, and electrophysiological as well as\n      detailed in section 8 corresponding to Development Test and Evaluation of Response.\n\n      It is estimated that the inclusion period is approximately 12-18 months, and each patient\n      tracking another twelve months. Therefore the total duration of the study will be about 24\n      to 30 months from the inclusion of the first patient to completion follow-up period of the\n      last patient included.\n\n      Study objectives:\n\n        -  Main objectives: 1. To evaluate the safety of intravenous infusion of autologous bone\n           marrow mesenchymal cells in multiple sclerosis patients diagnosed by evaluating\n           complications and adverse effects of the therapy itself and study procedures.\n\n           2. Assessing the difference in the number of lesions on magnetic resonance image with\n           gadolinium, between the groups undergoing treatment at weeks 4, 12 and 24.\n\n        -  Secondary objectives: 1. To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of the indication of\n           the treatment by analysis comparative results and exploratory clinical variables of\n           patients at baseline (pretreatment) and at 6 and 12 months follow-up.\n\n           2. Compare the results of safety, feasibility and efficacy between the administration\n           initial cell therapy treatment (day 0) and that delayed (day +180).\n\n           3. Evaluating the immunomodulatory effect of treatment by quantifying cell subsets and\n           cytokines, functional analysis of the immune response. Cerebrospinal fluid metabolomic\n           profile of gene expression of the cells present in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, with\n           the aim of identifying new biomarkers with  diagnosis of interest, prognosis or\n           monitoring, and potential therapeutic targets that can be derived from it.\n\n           4.
