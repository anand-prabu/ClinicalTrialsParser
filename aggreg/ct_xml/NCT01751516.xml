  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, single center pilot study of 40 patients with uT3N0 or uT1-3N+ rectal
      cancer receiving pre-operative chemoradiation.  Subjects will undergo PET/MRI scans before
      and after surgery.

      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the negative predictive value of PET/MRI
      for determining pathological complete response from neoadjuvant chemoradiation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Low-lying, low- to moderate-risk pathologically-confirmed rectal cancer (stage uT3n)
             or uT1-3N+

          -  Negative workup for distant disease

          -  &gt; 18 years of age

          -  Pre-treatment workup completed including:

          -  history and physical

          -  CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis

          -  endoscopic tumor evaluation (biopsy, blood work to assess CEA and hematopoietic,
             renal and liver function)

          -  if female of child-bearing age, negative pregnancy test

          -  Recommendation to undergo preoperative concurrent chemoradiation, as determined by

          -  Informed consent reviewed and signed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Not deemed a candidate for preoperative chemoradiation for medical reasons, such as

          -  Creatinine ≥ 1.5 times ULN

          -  Not deemed a candidate for concurrent preoperative chemoradiation for social reasons,
             such as psychiatric illness

          -  Not deemed a surgical candidate

          -  Currently active second malignancy, except non-melanoma skin cancer, non-invasive
             bladder cancer, low risk adenocarcinoma of the prostate and carcinoma in situ of the
             cervix

          -  Previous pelvic radiation therapy

          -  History of severe reaction to gadolinium

          -  Inability to tolerate MRI (e.g., inability to lie flat for &gt; 1 hour)

          -  Presence of a pacemaker, intracranial aneurysm clip, bladder stimulator, cochlear
             implant or metal near eyes

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 35
