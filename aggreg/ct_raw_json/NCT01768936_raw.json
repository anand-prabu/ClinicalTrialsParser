These patients need surgical intervention for focus elimination. This operative intervention aims to eradicate all infectious material and is intended to remove the leaking intestinal lesion. Whether this focus is eliminated or not can be controlled by either planned relaparotomy (normally within 48h after the first operation) or on demand relaparotomy in case of clinical deterioration. The focus can be assumed to be eliminated in all cases where either relaparotomy reveals no ongoing infection or persisting focus and whenever a patient recovers rapidly after initial surgery.",
