EGFR mutation will be prospectively\n      tested in all the participants' biopsy samples and confirmed in surgical resected samples.\n      Eligible patients will be given gefitinib 250mg for 42days followed with surgical resection\n      of tumor. Efficacy of preoperative gefitinib is based on radiographic (CT response/ORR),\n      pathologic (pathologic response), surgical (complete resection) evaluations, and safety is\n      based on adverse effect evaluations."
