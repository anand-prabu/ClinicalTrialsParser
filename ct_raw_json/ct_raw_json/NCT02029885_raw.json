Candidate subjects will be recruited by the investigator from\n      his patient population. The research protocol does not require withholding or postponing any\n      medically indicated health care.\n\n      After completing screening testing, the Kona Medical Surround Sound Treatment will be\n      administered.  Both the left and right side will be treated sequentially during the same\n      treatment session. Safety and functional evaluation occurs three weeks, six weeks and three,\n      six, twelve, eighteen, and twenty-four months after completion of the treatment."
