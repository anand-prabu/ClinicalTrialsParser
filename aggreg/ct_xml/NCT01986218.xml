             hormonal, or immunotherapy)

          -  At least 4 weeks must have elapsed from last dose of prior anti-cancer therapy and
             the initiation of study therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

             or severe asthma, excluding inhalation steroids for maintenance.

          -  Uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease

          -  History of medically significant thromboembolic events or bleeding diathesis within

             limit of normal (ULN) (except known Gilbert's syndrome); Alanine transaminase (ALT)
             or aspartate transaminase (AST) &gt; 2.5 times the institutional ULN. ALT or AST up to 3
             times the institutional ULN permitted if total bilirubin is normal

             (3.42 mmol/L))

          -  Inadequate renal function (Blood creatinine &gt; 1.5 times the institutional ULN)
