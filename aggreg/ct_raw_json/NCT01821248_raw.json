            "textblock": "Biliary tract cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide, with surgery\n      representing the only potentially curative treatment for this disease. However, many\n      patients are diagnosed as far advanced stage, which is too late for curative resection, and\n      even if surgery can be performed, the likelihood of relapse is very high. Lymph node\n      metastasis is the most powerful prognostic factor in biliary tract cancer, which makes\n      accurate preoperative assessment of lymph node metastasis important for indication of\n      resection. However, the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of conventional\n      imaging techniques, including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),\n      seem to be insufficient for accurate detection of lymph node metastasis. Previously, the\n      investigators reported FDG-PET is useful for prediction of lymph node metastasis.\n\n      On the other hand, gemcitabine has been widely used to treat the patients with unresectable\n      or recurrent biliary tract cancer. In the ABC-02 study, the first prospective multicenter\n      phase III study in this field, the combination of gemcitabine/cisplatin was compared with\n      gemcitabine monotherapy and found that the combination regimen significantly prolonged MST\n      (from 8.1 to 11.7 months; P < 0.001). Gemcitabine/cisplatin combination therapy is now\n      considered to be the standard regimen for advanced biliary tract cancer. S-1 is an oral\n      fluoropyrimidine prodrug that has confirmed efficacy against various solid tumors, both\n      alone and in combination with other cytotoxic drugs. S-1 monotherapy has yielded good\n      results against advanced biliary tract cancer and gemcitabine/S-1 combination therapy has\n      yielded promising results with acceptable toxicity levels for patients with advanced biliary\n      tract cancer.\n\n      Furthermore, the investigators reported the safety and efficacy of adding S-1 to\n      gemcitabine/cisplatin combination regimen (GCS) for advanced biliary tract cancer.\n\n      In this study, the investigators evaluate the efficacy and the safety of pre-operative\n      chemotherapy with Gemcitabine/ Cisplatin /S-1 for biliary tract cancers with lymph node\n      metastasis by FDG-PET"
