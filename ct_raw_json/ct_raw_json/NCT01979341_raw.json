The use of GnRH agonist as ovulation trigger\n      has been shown to reduce the risks for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), but its\n      sole use results in reduced embryo implantation due to luteal phase insufficiency. The\n      combination of GnRH agonist and variable doses of hCG for final oocyte maturation has been\n      shown to overcome the luteal phase insufficiency effecting endometrial receptivity.\n\n      In this study the investigators will test the hypothesis that using GnRH agonist (0.2mg\n      Triptorelin) and a full dose of hCG (6500IU Ovitrelle) for final oocyte maturation in\n      normoresponders will increase oocyte maturity, embryo quality and embryo implantation and\n      reduce ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, as compared to the traditional hCG (full dose)\n      alone trigger."
