    <textblock>
      Demonstrate a response to stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve using the Biowave device
      and a microneedle patch electrode in patients with overactive bladder symptoms.  The
      investigators hypothesize that after at least 6 weekly treatments there will be modest
      improvements in overactive bladder symptoms trending toward more improvement.

      Women 18 years old and over with a score of equal to or greater than 4 on the OAB-q short
      form for urgency and average daily urinary frequency equal to or greater than 10 times based
      on a 3-day voiding diary plus other inclusion criteria will be reviewed for possible
      enrollment in this study.  Outcomes measured include Global Response Assessment (GRA) for
      overall bladder symptoms, a change in the 3-day voiding diary parameters and adverse events.
