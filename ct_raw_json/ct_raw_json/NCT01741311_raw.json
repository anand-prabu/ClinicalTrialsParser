Though\n      numerous evidence-based HIV risk reduction interventions are now widely available as\n      complete intervention packages, few evidence-based interventions have been designed for\n      implementation within common drug treatment community-based organizations (CBOs), such as\n      methadone maintenance programs (MMPs), where many high-risk HIV-infected drug users seek\n      treatment. Moreover, the few evidence-based interventions that are applicable to drug\n      treatment CBOs are not designed to be \"community-friendly\" and, hence, are unlikely to be\n      implemented as intended or durable within these critical settings.\n\n      The investigators have developed a significantly shortened version of the comprehensive\n      evidence-based Holistic Health Recovery Program (HHRP; Avants et al., 2004; Margolin et al.,\n      2003). This shortened version, Holistic Health for HIV (3H+), has demonstrated feasibility\n      and acceptability as well as preliminary evidence of effectiveness in an uncontrolled study\n      within a resource-limited drug treatment CBO. Therefore, this randomized controlled\n      comparative effectiveness trial (RCT) will test the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of 3H+\n      versus the original gold standard evidence-based intervention(EBI), Holistic Health Recovery\n      Program for HIV+s (HHRP+), targeting HIV+ drug users (DUs)."
