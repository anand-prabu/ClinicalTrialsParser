However, premature infants reveal a high\n      risk of other acute complications, including brain injury (e.g., intraventricular\n      hemorrhage; IVH), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and neonatal respiratory distress\n      syndrome (RDS), as well as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia\n      (BPD). Therefore, prematurity is considered one of the main causes of neonatal deaths. The\n      preterm neonates need transfusion of allogenic whole peripheral blood or any of its\n      components at a time of anemia of prematurity development. In contrast, other prematurity\n      complications do not have effective treatment nor preventive strategies. We will enroll\n      premature neonates born premature (<34 weeks of gestation) who developed anemia of\n      prematurity and had their own autologous cord blood collected for subsequent transfusion.\n      Next, we will test tolerability, safety and efficacy of autogenic whole cord blood infusion\n      and evaluate the frequency of premature complications in neonates after transfusion.\n      Besides, this pilot study will test feasibility of technical collection, preparation and\n      infusion of a neonate's own umbilical cord blood within the first 5 days after birth."
