      The purpose of the ISCHEMIA-CKD trial is to determine the best management strategy for
      patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD), at least moderate ischemia and advanced
      chronic kidney disease (CKD; estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt;30 or on
      dialysis). This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with a target randomization of
      ~1000 patients with advanced CKD and at least moderate ischemia on stress testing.
      Participants will be assigned at random to a routine invasive strategy (INV) with cardiac
      catheterization (cath) followed by revascularization plus optimal medical therapy (OMT) or
      to a conservative strategy (CON) of OMT, with cath and revascularization reserved for those
      who fail OMT. The trial is designed to run seamlessly in parallel to the main ISCHEMIA trial
      as a companion ancillary trial.

      SPECIFIC AIMS

      A. Primary Aim. The primary aim of the ISCHEMIA-CKD trial is to determine whether an
      invasive strategy of routine early catheterization followed by optimal revascularization, in
      addition to OMT, will reduce the primary composite endpoint of death or nonfatal myocardial
      infarction in SIHD patients with advanced CKD and at least moderate ischemia over an average
      follow-up of approximately 4 years compared with an initial conservative strategy of OMT
      alone with catheterization reserved for those who fail OMT. The primary endpoint is time to
      centrally adjudicated death or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI).

      B. Secondary Aims. Major: To compare angina-related quality of life between the INV and CON
      strategies. Other secondary aims include: comparing the incidence of the composite of
      cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or
      hospitalization for unstable angina or heart failure; composite of cardiovascular death or
      nonfatal myocardial infarction; cardiovascular death; non-fatal myocardial infarction;
      all-cause death; stroke; hospitalization for heart failure or unstable angina

      BACKGROUND:

      Among patients with advanced CKD, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death,15-30
      times higher than the age-adjusted cardiovascular mortality rate in the general population.
      The projected 4-year mortality is &gt;50% in patients with advanced CKD  and is worse than that
      for patients in the general population who have cancers, heart failure, stroke or MI.
      Participants with advanced CKD are 5-10 times more likely to die than to reach end stage
      renal disease (ESRD).  Despite this, ~80% of contemporary coronary artery disease (CAD)
      trials exclude participants with advanced CKD. Most of the treatments aimed at reducing
      cardiovascular events in advanced CKD are therefore extrapolated from cohorts without
      advanced CKD. Participants with advanced CKD and cardiovascular disease are undertreated
      with less frequent use of statins and revascularization therapies, and the optimal
      management approach to these patients is unknown. Participants with advanced CKD are notably
      underrepresented in contemporary trials comparing revascularization with medical therapy in
      SIHD patients, such as the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes
      (BARI 2D) trial or the Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug
      Evaluation (COURAGE) trial,making any assessment about the efficacy of revascularization
      plus medical therapy vs. initial medical therapy alone in this cohort problematic.

      Participants with advanced CKD are at increased risk for complications of the assigned
      invasive procedure, specifically contrast-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), dialysis, major
      bleeding and short-term risk of death. However, there is controversy in the medical
      literature regarding the incidence (&lt;1% to &gt;30%), effective treatment (saline hydration,
      N-acetyl cysteine, or sodium bicarbonate) and prognosis of contrast induced AKI (&lt;0.5% to
      &gt;5% requiring dialysis). In addition although contrast induced AKI have been associated with
      increase in short-term mortality residual confounding in these studies makes interpretation
      difficulty. Moreover it is unknown if these short-term increased risks are offset by
      long-term benefits. Limited observational study in the CKD cohort suggests a survival
      benefit of revascularization when compared with medical therapy alone long-term, despite
      increase in short-term risks. However, the medical therapy in these trials was not
      optimized, drug eluting stents were rarely used and there is undoubtedly inherent selection
      and ascertainment bias with observational studies. The above has resulted in substantial
      clinical equipoise in the management of these patients with the rates of revascularization
      of only around 10-45%. The results of ISCHEMIA-CKD will have profound implications for
      guidelines, health policy, and clinical practice.

    <description>Narrowed blood vessels can be opened without surgery using stents or can be bypassed with surgery. To determine which is the best approach for you the doctor needs to look at your blood vessels to see where the narrowings are and how much narrowing there is. This is done by a procedure known as a cardiac catheterization.</description>

    <description>Artery narrowing is bypassed during surgery with a healthy artery or vein from another part of the body. This is known as coronary artery bypass grafting, or CABG (said &quot;cabbage&quot;). The surgery creates new routes around narrowed and blocked heart arteries. This allows more blood flow to the heart.</description>
