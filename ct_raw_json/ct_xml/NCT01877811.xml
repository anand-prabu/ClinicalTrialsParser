    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, multicenter, open-label study consisting of 2 phases. Phase 1 is a
      dose escalation study of CEP-32496 in patients with advanced solid tumors aimed at defining
      the RP2D and schedule for administration. In Phase 2 patients with advanced unresectable
      melanoma and metastatic colorectal cancer with BRAF V600E or BRAF V600K mutation will be
      treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) determined in Phase 1.

      The primary objective of Phase 1 is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      CEP-32496. The primary objective of Phase 2 is to evaluate the antitumor activity of
      CEP-32496 at the RP2D, as assessed by objective response rate (complete response [CR] or
      partial response [PR]) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1
      (RECIST v1.1) in patients with advanced unresectable melanoma and metastatic colorectal
      cancer with BRAF mutation. Four groups of patients will be treated in Phase 2:

        -  group A: patients with advanced unresectable melanoma with acquired resistance to BRAF
           inhibitors (ie, patients who have achieved a CR or PR as a best response to treatment
           with a prior BRAF inhibitor and subsequently became resistant) and patients who
           discontinued treatment with a BRAF inhibitor due to intolerance

        -  group B: patients with advanced unresectable melanoma with primary resistance to BRAF
           inhibitors (ie, patients who maintained stable disease or had progressive disease as a
           best response to treatment with a prior BRAF inhibitor)

        -  group C: patients with advanced unresectable melanoma who are naïve to treatment with
           BRAF inhibitors

        -  group D: patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who are naïve to treatment with
           BRAF inhibitors

      Each phase of this study will consist of a 28-day screening period. Patients will be treated
      in 28-day treatment cycles until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of
      consent, or protocol specified parameters to stop treatment. Patients in Phase 1 will be
      followed for a minimum of 6 months after the last dose of study treatment, and patients in
      Phase 2 will be followed to collect further anticancer information for up to 12 months after
      the end-of-treatment visit for the last discontinued patient on the study.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Phase 1 only: Patients must have histological or cytological evidence of a solid
             tumor which is refractory to available therapy or for which no effective standard
             therapy exists. The patient may have received monotherapy with 1 or more BRAF
             inhibitors.

          2. Phase 2 only: Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced
             unresectable cutaneous melanoma (Stage IIIC and IV per American Joint Committee on
             Cancer [AJCC]) and BRAF V600E or BRAF V600K mutation or relapsed/refractory
             metastatic colorectal cancer and BRAF V600E or BRAF V600K mutation.

               -  Previously existing BRAF V600E or BRAF V600K mutation results using a test
                  approved by the FDA or from an accredited laboratory (CLIA certified or
                  equivalent) will be accepted.

               -  If documented results are not available, then archived or fresh tumor tissue
                  samples suitable for biomarker analysis must be available for testing by an
                  accredited laboratory (CLIA certified or equivalent).

          3. Patients may have received any number of prior systemic treatments for their cancer.
             However, for patients in Phase 2, groups A and B, prior treatment with only 1 BRAF
             inhibitor or MEK inhibitor monotherapy is permitted. Phase 2 patients with metastatic
             colorectal cancer (group D) must have received 1 or more fluoropyrimidine,
             oxaliplatin, or irinotecan based chemotherapy.

          4. The patient has measurable disease and documented progression on or after last prior
             treatment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version
             1.1

          5. The patient must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
             of 0 or 1 for Phase 1 or 0, 1, or 2 for Phase 2.

          6. Other inclusion criteria apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. For patients in Phase 1 only, the patient has primary brain tumor or ocular melanoma.

          2. For patients in Phase 2 groups C or D only, the patient received previous treatment
             with a selective BRAF inhibitor or MEK inhibitor (prior treatment with sorafenib
             allowed).

          3. The patient was treated with systemic anticancer therapy or investigational agent
             within 3 weeks prior to start of study drug treatment (6 weeks for bevacizumab and
             immunotherapy).

          4. The patient had major surgery within 21 days or less prior to starting of the study
             drug or who have not recovered from adverse effects of such therapy.

          5. The patient had radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to start of study drug treatment.

             Patients must have recovered from all radiotherapy-related toxicities.

          6. The patient has known central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Patients with any
             clinical signs of CNS metastases must have a CT or MRI of the brain to rule out CNS
             metastases in order to be eligible for participation in the study. Patients who have
             had brain metastases treated with radiotherapy or surgically removed with no residual
             disease confirmed by imaging should be clinically stable and off corticosteroid
             treatment at least 3 weeks prior to start of study drug treatment.

          7. The patient has a QTc interval greater than 470 msec.

          8. The patient has a major active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics.

          9. The patient has a severe or unstable medical condition such as congestive heart
             failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class III or IV), ischemic heart disease,
             uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, psychiatric condition, as
             well as an ongoing cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication (≥grade 2, according to
             NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] v4.03), myocardial
             infarction within 6 months prior to starting study treatment, or any other
             significant or unstable concurrent medical illness that in the opinion of the
             investigator would preclude protocol therapy.

         10. Other exclusion criteria apply.
