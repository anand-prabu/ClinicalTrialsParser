  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to: i) confirm and improve the accuracy of the correlation
      between levels of Zinc in prostate tissue and the grade of prostate cancer in that tissue as
      determined through pathology; and ii) determine the levels of zinc in prostate tissue
      declared as non-cancerous by pathology and located in the vicinity of tissue declared as
      cancerous by pathology, and verify that the Zinc levels for the declared non-cancerous
      tissue are lower (statistically significantly) than the levels for benign tissue not in the
      vicinity of cancerous tissue.
