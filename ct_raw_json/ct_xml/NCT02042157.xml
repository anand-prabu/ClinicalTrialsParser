  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our expectations (hypotheses) are:

      Primary outcome

        1. Regular bidet use will improve quality of life around elimination in adults with
           impaired functional status as measured by activities of daily living (ADL).

        2. Regular bidet use by adults with impaired functional status will improve the quality of
           life around toileting for their caregivers.

           Secondary

        3. Regular bidet use will reduce the incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) adults
           with impaired functional status as measured by ADL.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the use of a bidet (a device that is attached to the toilet which
      allows a person to wash their genitalia after elimination) in improving toilet related
      quality of life for functionally impaired individuals as measured by ADLs and caregivers of
      functionally impaired adults. We also want to see if bidet use is effective in lowering the
      incidence of urinary tract infections in this high risk population.

      Functional impairment around toileting has been shown to negatively impact quality of life
      (QOL) for both patients and their caregivers. We hope to learn if the use of bidet will
      improve QOL in this population.

      Urinary tract infections increase the risk of morbidity and mortality in these populations.
      Specifically the risk of hospitalization, sepsis, kidney failure and other complications.
      There are not currently effective forms of non-pharmaceutical prevention. Bidets are safe,
      inexpensive and hygienic. Individuals with functional impairment often have difficulty
      maintaining their hygiene due to frailty and functional limitations. It is our hope that
      addressing these issues will lead to a reduced incidence of UTI.
