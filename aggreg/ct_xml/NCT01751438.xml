  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if treatment with standard systemic
      therapy in combination with surgery or radiation therapy is more effective at controlling
      prostate cancer than standard systemic therapy alone.  The safety of this treatment
      combination will also be studied.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned
      (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups based on when you join this study.  You
      will have an equal chance of being assigned to each group.

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will continue to receive standard of care systemic
           treatment.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive standard of care systemic treatment in addition
           to surgery to remove your prostate or radiation therapy to the prostate.  You and your
           treating physician will decide if surgery or radiation therapy is the best choice for
           you.  Your treating physician will explain the surgery or radiation therapy and their
           risks to you in more detail, and you will be asked to sign a separate consent form for
           the procedure.

      Study Visits:

      Within 60 days after screening:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a digital rectal exam (DRE).

        -  You will be asked how well you are able to perform the normal activities of daily
           living (performance status).

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your
           prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, and testosterone levels.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will complete a questionnaire about how you are feeling.  It should take about 15
           minutes to complete.

        -  You will have a bone scan, 2 CT scans of your abdomen and pelvis, and a chest X-ray or
           a computed tomography (CT) scan of chest to check the status of the disease.

        -  You will have a endorectal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of the prostate to
           check the status of the disease.

        -  You will have a ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate to check the status of the
           disease. To perform an ultrasound-guided biopsy, a needle is inserted into the affected
           area using ultrasound imaging to collect cells or tissue from the tumor.   The doctor
           will use the imaging to guide the needle into the area.  Two (2) types of samples may
           be collected.  It will either be a fine needle aspirate (FNA) that collects cells
           and/or a core biopsy that collects a small piece of tissue.

      Every 12 weeks while on study (starting at month 9):

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a DRE and any updates to your medical history
           will be recorded.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs or treatments you may be receiving, including
           over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, vitamins, and/or supplements.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your liver
           function, and to measure PSA and testosterone levels.

        -  You will complete a questionnaire about how you are feeling.  It should take about 15
           minutes to complete.

        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have CT/MRI imaging scans to check
           the status of the disease.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue your participation in this study for as long as the doctor thinks it is in
      your best interest.  You will be taken off the study treatment if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your active participation on the study will be over after the long-term follow-up phone
      calls/emails (described below).

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      Within 14 days after your study treatment is stopped, the following tests and procedures
      will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a DRE.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs or treatments you may be receiving, including
           over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, vitamins, and/or supplements.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your liver
           function, and to measure PSA and testosterone levels.

        -  You will complete a questionnaire about how you are feeling.  It should take about 15
           minutes to complete.

        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have CT/MRI imaging scans to check
           the status of the disease.

        -  If you did not have surgery to remove your prostate and the disease has gotten worse,
           you will have an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate to check the status of the
           disease and to help plan the next steps in your treatment. This biopsy will be standard
           of care.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      Every 6 months after your end-of-treatment visit, you will be contacted by phone or e-mail
      and you will be asked questions about how you are feeling.  Each phone call should last
      about 5 minutes.  If you are not able to be contacted by phone or email, the study doctor
      will review and record any updates to your medical record.

      This is an investigational study. Using standard of care systemic treatment with surgery,
      and/or radiation therapy are both groups FDA approved and commercially available.

      Up to 120 patients will take part in this study.  All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
