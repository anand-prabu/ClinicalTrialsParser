    <textblock>
      This study will compare how well a new radiolabeled imaging agent ECDG compares to the
      current testing for coronary artery disease (radiolabeled Sestamibi)  during a rest and
      stress cardiac test as documented from results of a coronary angiogram (if performed).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective, open-label, multi-center study assessing the efficacy and
      safety of 99mTc-EC-DG compared to 99mTc-SPECT MPI imaging for detecting the presence,
      location, and severity of CAD as established by coronary angiography. Approximately 60
      patients will be enrolled in the study.

      Group 1 will be patients who have been evaluated for CAD within 3 to 30 days by any
      cardiovascular diagnostic imaging method (nuclear, ultrasound, CTA, MRI, etc.) and their
      physician has planned for coronary angiography but angiography has not yet been performed.
      In addition, the patient has not had coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). These patients can
      be enrolled.

      Group 2 will be patients who have been evaluated for CAD within 3 to 30 days by any
      cardiovascular diagnostic imaging method (nuclear, ultrasound, CTA, MRI, etc.) and the
      patient has already had coronary angiography performed but has not received any coronary
      intervention subsequent to the procedure.

      The following sequence of imaging procedures will be performed for both Group 1 and 2
      patients: The first procedure will be a 99mTc-EC-DG rest study. This will be followed within
      24 hours to 3 days with a 1-day protocol 99mTc-SPECT MPI rest/stress study. This will be
      followed within 24 hours to 3 days with a 99mTc-EC-DG stress study.

      For both Group 1 and 2, if 1 of the diagnostic imaging procedures performed to evaluate the
      presence of CAD was a traditional 99mTc-SPECT MPI rest/stress study, this procedure must be
      repeated as 1 of the 3 SPECT imaging procedures required by the trial protocol.

      The modality for provocative stress testing (exercise, pharmacologic, or
      exercise/pharmacologic) will be matched between the 99mTc-SPECT study and the 99mTc-EC-DG
      study. All prospectively performed 99mTc-EC-DG and 99mTc-SPECT studies will be conducted
      using regadenoson as the pharmacologic stress agent. All imaging studies (99mTc-EC-DG,
      99mTc-SPECT, coronary angiography) will be over-read by blinded, trained reviewers. The
      consensus blinded read will determine and record the location of the CAD by relating the
      wall of the myocardium affected to include: anterior, Inferior, lateral, septal and apex.
      The angiography study will identify the arteries associated with the CAD; namely, left
      anterior descending, circumflex or right coronary arteries. The study will also determine
      the severity of the CAD by visually comparing the size and intensity of the ischemic signal
      on rest and stress images obtained approximately 15 and 60 minutes post injection.

      The results from the  consensus blinded read of coronary angiography will be considered
      truth for the presence, location, and severity of obstructive CAD and degree of stenosis.

    <description>1. Determine efficacy (sensitivity and specificity) of 99mTc-ED-DG: i. Compare efficacy of a rest and stress study at approximately 15 minutes post injection compared with efficacy of a standard 99mTc-SPECT rest/stress perfusion study for detecting the presence of CAD using invasive coronary angiography as the truth standard.* ii. Compare efficacy of a rest and stress study at approximately 60 minutes post injection compared with a standard 99mTc-SPECT rest/stress perfusion study for detecting the presence of CAD using invasive coronary angiography as the truth standard.*
* Images will be displayed using the standard Cedars Sinai tomographic display software which projects images in the short axis, vertical long, and horizontal long axis displays.</description>
