This may be performed at other times if participant's doctor thinks\n      it is needed.\n\n      As part of the study, participant will be enrolled on a special program called REMS that\n      will inform them about the risks of lenalidomide and pregnancy.  As part of this program,\n      participant will be required to have regular pregnancy tests if they are a female who is\n      able to have children.\n\n      Length of Treatment:\n\n      Participant may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in\n      their best interest.  Participant will no longer be able to take the study drug if the\n      disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study\n      directions.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Lenalidomide is FDA approved and commercially available\n      for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and multiple myeloma (MM).  Its use in\n      participants with high risk AML that is in remission is investigational.\n\n      Up to 110 participants will be enrolled in this multicenter study.
