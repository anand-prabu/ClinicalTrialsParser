Eyes that have central-involved DME with \"good\" visual acuity (20/25 or\n      better) have not been addressed systematically by recent studies for treatment of DME.\n      Baseline cohort characteristics from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)\n      suggest that a substantial percentage of eyes with central-involved DME may retain good\n      vision. The investigators do not know definitively whether eyes with central-involved DME\n      and good vision do better with anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) (e.g.\n      aflibercept) therapy initially, or focal/grid laser treatment or observation initially\n      followed by anti-VEGF only if vision worsens.\n\n      The primary objective of the protocol is to compare the % of eyes that have lost at least 5\n      letters of visual acuity at 2 years compared with baseline mean visual acuity in eyes with\n      central-involved DME and good visual acuity defined as a Snellen equivalent of 20/25 or\n      better (electronic-ETDRS letter score of 79 or better) that receive (1) prompt focal/grid\n      photocoagulation + deferred anti-VEGF, (2) observation + deferred anti-VEGF, or (3) prompt\n      anti-VEGF.\n\n      Secondary objectives include:\n\n        -  Comparing other visual acuity outcomes between treatment groups, such as the percent of\n           eyes with at least 5, 10 and 15 letter losses in visual acuity from baseline mean\n           visual acuity, percent of eyes with at least 5 letter gain in visual acuity from\n           baseline, mean visual acuity, mean change in visual acuity, adjusted for baseline mean\n           visual acuity\n\n        -  For eyes randomized to deferred anti-VEGF, the percentage of eyes needing anti-VEGF\n           treatment\n\n        -  Comparing optical coherence tomography (OCT) outcomes, such as the mean change in OCT\n           central subfield (CSF) thickness, adjusted for baseline mean thickness\n\n        -  Comparing the number of eyes with PDR at randomization, proportion of eyes avoiding\n           vitreous hemorrhage or panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) or vitrectomy for PDR between\n           treatment groups\n\n        -  Comparing safety outcomes between treatment groups\n\n        -  Comparing associated treatment and follow-up exam costs between treatment groups"

If blood\n             pressure is brought below 180/110 by anti-hypertensive treatment, individual can\n             become eligible.\n\n          7. Systemic anti-VEGF or pro-VEGF treatment within 4 months prior to randomization.\n\n             These drugs should not be used during the study.\n\n          8.

Macular edema is considered to be due to a cause other than DME.\n\n             a) An eye should not be considered eligible if: (1) the macular edema is considered\n             to be related to ocular surgery such as cataract extraction or (2) clinical exam\n             and/or OCT suggest that vitreoretinal interface abnormalities (e.g., a taut posterior\n             hyaloid or epiretinal membrane) are contributing to the macular edema.\n\n          2. An ocular condition is present such that, in the opinion of the investigator, any\n             visual acuity loss would not improve from resolution of macular edema (e.g., foveal\n             atrophy, pigment abnormalities, dense subfoveal hard exudates, nonretinal condition).\n\n          3.
