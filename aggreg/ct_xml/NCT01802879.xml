      The study allows continued use of single agent panobinostat in patients who are on single
      agent panobinostat treatment in a Novartis-sponsored study which has met its endpoint and
      are benefiting from the treatment as judged by the investigator.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center open label study to provide continued use of single agent oral
      panobinostat to patients currently treated in a Novartis-sponsored study (parent study)
      which has met its endpoint and are benefiting from continuation of the treatment with
      single-agent panobinostat as judged by the investigator. Patients from multiple parent
      studies will be transferred over to this protocol and will be continuing to receive single
      agent panobinostat at the last assigned dose and regimen of the parent protocol. There will
      be no screening period, and patients will have to visit the study center at least on a
      quarterly basis. During these visits limited information on study treatment and occurrence
      of SAEs will be collected for the clinical database. SAEs will be only reported to the
      Novartis safety database.Other assessments and possibly more frequent visits will occur as
      per standard of care at the site. Patients will continue treatment until they are no longer
      benefiting from panobinostat treatment develop unacceptable toxicities, withdraw consent,
      are non-compliant to the protocol, the investigator feels it is no longer in the best
      interest to continue, the patient dies, or for other administrative reasons. An end of
      treatment visit and a safety follow-up for 30 days after the last dose will be performed.
      The study is expected to remain open for 5 years or until such time that enrolled patients
      no longer need treatment with panobinostat, whichever comes earlier.
