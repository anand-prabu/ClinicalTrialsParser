The 1st phase of the\n           study is meant to collect data during the grass-pollen season in patients with allergic\n           rhino-conjunctivitis and without any Allergen ImmunoTherapy treatment (AIT).\n\n        2. nd Phase: Longitudinal Study\n\n             -  Treatment-start visit (V1):\n\n      Investigators will include in the 2nd Phase of the study all patients of the 1st phase\n      starting a treatment with ORALAIR\u00ae, approximately 4 months before the 2015 grass-pollen\n      season for patients included in the 1st phase during the 2014 grass-pollen season, and\n      should the case arise, 4 months before the 2016 grass-pollen season for patients included in\n      the 1st phase during the 2015 grass-pollen season. For every else patients of the 1st phase\n      not included in the 2nd phase of the study, therefore not continuing the study, the\n      investigator will record them in the Patient Log.\n\n      - Follow-up visits: Patients will be followed-up, in accordance with the normal course of\n      patient care. Follow-up visits are routinely performed approximately twice a year (depending\n      upon each physician's current practice and local specificity of the country). Patients will\n      remain in the study even if a visit is not performed, unless they have explicitly requested\n      to be withdrawn from the study.\n\n      - Additional visit-s: Should the patient come for a visit not considered in the visits\n      hereby presented, the physician will complete an additional visit form of the e-CRF.\n\n      - Direct patient follow-up: During the follow-up period, the patient (and/or, in the case of\n      a minor, his/her parents or legally acceptable representatives) will receive 3 Patient\n      Booklets sent by ProClinica\u2122 by post mail at the beginning of each grasspollen season. The\n      patient (and/or, in the case of a minor, his/her parents or legally acceptable\n      representatives) will be asked to complete a Patient Booklet respectively at 2 weeks, 3\n      weeks and 4 weeks after the beginning of the grasspollen season, and to send them back to\n      Mapi after the last booklet is completed.\n\n      As an observational study, the decision of subjects to take part in this study will not have\n      any impact on the patient/investigator relation, nor influence the investigator's drug\n      prescription or therapeutic management of the patient. Therefore the patient's reported\n      outcomes will not be communicated to the investigators during the course of the study."
