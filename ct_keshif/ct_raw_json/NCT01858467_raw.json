It has a double aperture design that facilitates the\n      introduction of an orogastric tube to aspirate gastric contents. The current practice is to\n      use endotracheal intubation with rapid sequence induction in general anaesthesia for\n      Caesarean section.\n\n      The primary study hypothesis is the first attempt insertion success rate of SLMA and\n      endotracheal intubation are equivalent with a difference of less than 3%."
