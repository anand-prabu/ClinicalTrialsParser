This\n      study will investigate the effect of switching subjects taking levothyroxine to a new\n      levothyroxine sodium formulation.\n\n      The results of this study will be used to provide instructions to general practicioners and\n      endocrinlogists assisting patients on levothyroxine hormone substitution in performing the\n      switch to the new formulation.\n\n      The study will enroll approximately 90 patients. Patients receiving the same daily dose of\n      L-Thyroxine Christiaens\u00ae during the past 6 weeks and with serum thyroid stimulating hormone\n      (TSH) levels between 0.4-2.5 mU/L will be switched to the equivalent daily dose of the new\n      formulation of levothyroxine. After the switch, patients will be followed up after 2 (\u00b1 2\n      weeks) and 4 months (\u00b1 4 weeks).\n\n      All participants will be asked to take a daily dose at the same time each day throughout the\n      study.\n\n      This study will be conducted in Belgium. The overall time to participate in this study is\n      about 3 to 7,5 months. Participants will make 3 to 4 visits to the clinic."
