            "textblock": "The ReSource Project is a unique, large-scale study on the effects of mental training\n      techniques. Over a period of eleven months, participants practice a wide range of mental\n      exercises that are designed to enhance attentional control, body- and self-awareness,\n      emotion regulation, self-care, compassion, empathy, and perspective taking. Overall, the aim\n      of the training is to improve mental health and social skills. It may reduce stress, improve\n      mental clarity, increase life satisfaction, and lead to a better understanding of others'\n      views, values and actions.\n\n      The ReSource Project is a secular program developed by a team of experienced meditation\n      teachers, scientists, and psychotherapists.\n\n      Over the last decades, isolation, stress, and psychological tensions have been steadily\n      increasing in our society. Mental training can alter stress responses, physical health,\n      resilience, attention, perception, emotional experience, and social behavior. Evidence for\n      these results is based on previous studies showing behavioral changes, as well as observed\n      changes in brain function and structure. Moreover, health factors, such as peripheral\n      autonomic responses, stress hormones, and immune parameters were significantly changed after\n      training.\n\n      In contrast to most previous studies of just a few months, the ReSource Project will be\n      conducted over a period of one year for each experimental group (2 groups with shifted\n      design), and will cover a wide range of practices intended to enhance cognitive and\n      socio-affective skills.\n\n      The ReSource Project consists of three consecutive modules: called \"Presence\",\n      \"Perspective\", and \"Affect\". The Presence module trains mindful attention to internal mental\n      and physical processes. The Perspective module focuses on socio-cognitive abilities, such as\n      insight into the nature of the mind and self, and also the ability to assume the perspective\n      of others. The Affect module focuses on constructive ways of dealing with difficult\n      emotions, and works to cultivate prosocial motivations and positive emotions such as\n      compassion."
