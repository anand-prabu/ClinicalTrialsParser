    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine how vaginal estrogen cream given for several weeks before
      pelvic reconstructive therapy will effect elastic fiber assembly in the muscularis layer of
      the vaginal wall.  Postmenopausal women with at least Stage 2 pelvic organ prolapse will
      receive either estrogen vaginal cream or placebo cream 6-8 weeks prior to reconstructive
      surgery.  At time of surgery, full thickness biopsies will be obtained from a standardized
      location at the top of vagina.  The investigators will measure the thickness of the vaginal
      muscularis, elastic fiber number and morphology, and analyze if elastic fiber synthesis or
      degradation is affected by estrogen therapy.  The results will provide important data to
      support a larger clinical trial to determine if preoperative and maintenance estrogen
      therapy alter long-term success rates of pelvic reconstructive surgery for pelvic organ
      prolapse.

          -  Prior steroid hormone replacement therapy of duration &gt;1 month (oral or vaginal
             estrogen, testosterone or corticosteroids)

          -  History of vaginal radiation

          -  Contraindications for estrogen replacement therapy (current, or history of,

             endometrial cancer)

          -  Concurrent use of steroid cream for treatment of Lichen sclerosis
