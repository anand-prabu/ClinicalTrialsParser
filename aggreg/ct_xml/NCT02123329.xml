  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thirty seven percent of adult male population smoke cigarettes in Qatar. The Global Youth
      Tobacco Survey also stated that 13.4% of male school students aged 13 to 15 years in Qatar
      smoke cigarettes. Smoking cessation is a key to reducing smoking related diseases and
      deaths. Health care providers are in an ideal position to encourage smoking cessation.
      Pharmacists are the most accessible health care providers and are uniquely situated to
      initiate behavior change among patients. Many western studies have shown that pharmacists
      can be successful in helping patients quit smoking. Studies demonstrating the effectiveness
      of pharmacist delivered smoking cessation programs are lacking in Qatar. This proposal aims
      to test the effect of a structured smoking cessation program delivered by trained ambulatory
      pharmacists in Qatar. A prospective, randomized, controlled trial will be conducted at 8
      ambulatory pharmacies in Qatar. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a
      4-session face-to-face structured patient-specific smoking cessation program conducted by
      the pharmacist or 5 to 10 minutes of unstructured brief smoking cessation advice given by
      the pharmacist. Both groups will be offered nicotine therapy if feasible. The primary
      outcome of smoking cessation will be confirmed by exhaled carbon monoxide test at 12 months.
      If proven to be effective, this smoking cessation program will be considered as a model that
      Qatar and the region can apply to decrease smoking burden.

    <description>The first session will be time-intensive taking around 30 minutes. In this session, the study pharmacist will facilitate the participant's preparation to quit. The participant will select a quit date within the next 2-4 weeks. The pharmacist will discuss with the participant the benefits of smoking cessation and will provide him or her with tailored behavioral and lifestyle strategies.
To prevent nicotine withdrawal symptoms, the participant will be offered nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) The first follow-up session will be scheduled after 1 week of the participant's quit day and will take around 20 minutes. In this session, the pharmacist will determine the participant's smoking status and assess the NRT tolerability.
â€¢ If the participant fails to quit smoking, the pharmacist will carefully review the participant's experience during the attempt to quit and will work through the identified problems</description>
