To evaluate the association between standardized phase angle measured at the start of\n      therapy and treatment-related outcomes including treatment related mortality (defined as\n      60-day mortality) III. Evaluate the association of the day 14 standardized phase angle and\n      treatment related outcomes, 30-day mortality, length of hospitalization, transfer to\n      intensive care unit during induction, treatment response (14 day bone marrow response,\n      complete remission), receipt of post-remission therapy, overall survival.\n\n      IV. An exploratory analysis investigating associations with the primary and secondary\n      outcomes using different ways to categorize the baseline standardized phase angle and, for\n      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, the standardized phase angle measure obtained just\n      prior to the nadir marrow.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients undergo bioelectrical impedance phase angle measurement on day 1 of treatment.\n      Patients with AML undergo a second measurement prior to the nadir marrow. Patients also\n      undergo bioelectrical impedance measurements prior to any invasive procedures (bone marrow\n      biopsy, leukapheresis, peripherally inserted central catheter [PICC] line placement, etc.).\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for two years."
