  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Mirabilis High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) Treatment System delivers therapeutic
      focused ultrasound energy to the uterus under integrated ultrasound imaging guidance to
      offer non-invasive treatment for uterine fibroids.  The purpose of this clinical study is to
      assess the initial safety and performance of the Mirabilis HIFU Treatment System for
      transabdominal treatment of uterine fibroids in eligible women who are scheduled to undergo
      hysterectomy following treatment with the device.

    <description>Preliminary efficacy of the intervention will be determined by evaluating the dimensions and position of nonviable tissue observed in each fibroid specimen via pathological processing following hysterectomy and/or by assessing the non-perfused volume (NPV) observed on post-treatment contrast-enhanced MRI.</description>
