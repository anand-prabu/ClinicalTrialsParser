      Cyclophosphamide has been one of the most successful therapies for severe Systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE). However, cyclophosphamide can cause severe side effects, including bone
      marrow suppression, infection, gastrointestinal reaction, hemorrhagic cystitis, and the etc.
      Significant variation in efficacy and toxicity of CPA has been observed. Since the
      development of applicable therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of cyclophosphamide has been
      reported, it will help to improve the efficacy and reduce toxicities in SLE treatment.
      However, the TDM is a passive strategy which usually lags behind the appearance of
      toxicities. Therefore，it is especially crucial to give individuals genotype-based personal
      prescription of cyclophosphamide in order to gain the most effective therapies. Thus, the
      purpose of this study is to compare the genotype-based personal prescription of
      cyclophosphamide with the traditional prescription, in order to verify the efficacy of the
      genotype-based personal prescription.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The American College of Rheumatology established eleven criteria in 1982,which were
             revised in 1997 as a classificatory instrument to operationalise the definition of
             SLE in clinical trials.

               1. Malar rash (rash on cheeks).

               2. Discoid rash (red, scaly patches on skin that cause scarring).

               3. Serositis: Pleurisy (inflammation of the membrane around the lungs) or
                  pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane around the heart).

               4. Oral ulcers (includes oral or nasopharyngeal ulcers).

               5. Arthritis: nonerosive arthritis of two or more peripheral joints, with
                  tenderness, swelling, or effusion.

               6. Photosensitivity (exposure to ultraviolet light causes rash, or other symptoms
                  of SLE flareups).

               7. Blood—hematologic disorder—hemolytic anemia (low red blood cell count) or
                  leukopenia (white blood cell count&lt;4000/µl), lymphopenia (&lt;1500/µl) or
                  thrombocytopenia (&lt;100000/µl) in the absence of offending drug.
                  Hypocomplementemia is also seen, due to either consumption of C3 and C4 by
                  immune complex-induced inflammation or to congenitally complement deficiency,
                  which may predispose to SLE.

               8. Renal disorder: More than 0.5 g per day protein in urine or cellular casts seen
                  in urine under a microscope.

               9. Antinuclear antibody test positive.

              10. Immunologic disorder: Positive anti-Smith, anti-ds DNA, antiphospholipid
                  antibody, and/or false positive serological test for syphilis. Presence of
                  anti-ss DNA in 70% of cases (though also positive with rheumatic disease and
                  healthy persons).

              11. Neurologic disorder: Seizures or psychosis. For the purpose of identifying
                  patients for clinical studies, a person has SLE if any 4 out of 11 symptoms are
                  present simultaneously or serially on two separate occasions. In the meantime,
                  the case has one of the following conditions or more;

               1. HIV (-);

               2. Signed the informed consent;

               3. Taking contraceptive measures during treatment period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Poor compliance;

          -  With lupus mental damage complication, occurrence of epilepsy or unable to express
             subjective symptoms during the observation period.

          -  Taking drugs that affect CYP2B6, CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, except corticosteroids.

          -  Abnormal liver function.
