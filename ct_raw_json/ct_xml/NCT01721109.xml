      This study is to evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) and confirm the dose of the
      elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF)
      single tablet regimen (STR) in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral (ARV) treatment-naive
      adolescents. Safety, tolerability, and efficacy will also be evaluated through Week 48.

      A total of 50 adolescent participants (12 to &lt; 18 years of age) will be enrolled to receive
      EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF as follows:

        -  Part A: Twelve to 16 eligible participants will be enrolled to evaluate steady-state
           PK, and confirm the dose, with the intent to enroll at least 4 participants 12 to &lt; 15
           and at least 4 participants 15 to &lt; 18 years of age.

        -  Part B: Following confirmation of EVG exposure in at least 12 participants from Part A,
           34 to 38 participants in addition to those enrolled in Part A will be enrolled to
           evaluate the safety, tolerability and antiviral activity of EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF STR.
