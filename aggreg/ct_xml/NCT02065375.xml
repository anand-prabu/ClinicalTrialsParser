  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assesses the efficacy and safety of two concentrations of RTA 408 Ophthalmic
      Suspension in the treatment of patients who have inflammation and pain following ocular
      surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following ophthalmic surgery, the current standard of care includes a topical ophthalmic
      corticosteroid or other anti-inflammatory agent to treat ocular inflammation and improve
      patient comfort. If left untreated, inflammation of the eye may result in further ocular
      complications including scarring, vision loss, or blindness. Although the exact dosing
      regimen is physician-dependent, patients are typically prescribed a topical corticosteroid
      for a period of 2-4 weeks following surgery, being tapered over the course of delivery as
      the inflammation subsides. Topical anti-inflammatory agents are usually administered
      multiple times per day, particularly in the early period following ophthalmic surgery.
      Continuing  efforts  in  drug  development  aim  to  identify  alternatives  to  ophthalmic
      corticosteroid use, due to their well-known local and systemic negative side effects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be greater than or equal to 18 years of age of either sex or any race;

          2. Have undergone unilateral cataract extraction via phacoemulsification  on  the  day
             prior  to  study enrollment/randomization;

          3. Have  a  grade  of  ≥2  in  anterior  chamber  cell score on day after surgery (Day
             1);

          4. Have a potential post-operative pin-hole visual acuity (VA) of greater than 1.0
             logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) in the operative eye and fellow
             eye as measured using an  Early  Treatment  for  Diabetic  Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)
             chart;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have any intraocular inflammation present in the study   eye   during   the
             screening   slit   lamp examination;

          2. Have a score greater than &quot;0&quot; on the Ocular Pain Assessment at Screening in the study
             eye;

          3. Have   an   immunosuppressive   disease   or   an autoimmune disease that in  the
             opinion of the Investigator could affect the quality of the ocular surface;

          4. Have   active   or   chronic/recurrent   ocular   or systemic  disease  that  is
             uncontrolled  and  will likely affect wound healing;

          5. Have an IOP  ≤ 5 mmHg in either eye;

          6. Require the use of a contact lens or a collagen shield  within  72  hours  of
             investigational  drug treatment or during the study period in the study eye; be
             unwilling to discontinue use of contact lenses during study period in the study eye;

          7. Require     use     of     non-diagnostic     topical ophthalmic  solutions  (other
             than  perioperative mydriatics,      anesthetics      and      antiseptics,
             prophylactic   antibiotics,  lid  scrubs  for  mild blepharitis, or artificial tears
             for the management of dry eye) in the study eye for the duration of the study;
