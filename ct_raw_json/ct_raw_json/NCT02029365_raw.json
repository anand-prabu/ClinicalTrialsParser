            "textblock": "In France , 15% of couples seek help for problems conceiving . In 10% of cases, infertility\n      remains \" unexplained\" . Among the causes of female infertility , there are the eating\n      disorders, as well as sexual disorders , these two cases may be linked. In addition, data\n      from the literature seem to suggest that beyond a diagnosis of eating disorders, the feeding\n      behavior of infertile women is more often disturbed than the general population. Moreover,\n      the notions of desire for a child and maternal representations seem essential to address in\n      the comprehensive care of women with infertility but also TCA integrating all conflicting\n      issues reactivated at the time of motherhood. However, little work has been done on this\n      subject. Thus, we propose a study on the desire for children and the eating disorders to\n      infertile women, to update epidemiological data, but also to better characterize this\n      particular patient population. Perspectives of this work are to improve screening measures\n      and support through a joint work of doctors reproductive and psychiatrists."
