  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban compared
      with placebo (inactive medication), in reducing the risk of death, myocardial infarction or
      stroke in participants with chronic heart failure and significant coronary artery disease
      following a recent hospitalization for exacerbation (worsening) of heart failure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither
      physician nor participant knows the identity of the assigned treatment), parallel group
      (each participant group receives different treatments simultaneously), event driven (the
      study duration is determined by the time taken for a specific number of events to occur),
      multicenter study to assess the effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban compared with
      placebo, in reducing the risk of death, myocardial infarction or stroke in participants with
      chronic heart failure and significant coronary artery disease following hospitalization for
      exacerbation of heart failure. Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to
      receive either rivaroxaban or placebo (each in addition to standard of care for heart
      failure and coronary artery disease as prescribed by their managing physician). The study
      will consist of a screening phase, a double-blind treatment phase, and a follow-up after the
      sponsor-announced global treatment end date (GTED, defined as the date when 984 primary
      efficacy outcome events are predicted to have occurred). The double-blind treatment phase is
      estimated to last for 6 to 30 months. Participants will discontinue study drug after taking
      both their morning and evening doses on the GTED and will return to the study center for the
      end-of-study visit between 15 and 45 days (but no sooner than 15 days) after the GTED.
      Patient safety will be monitored throughout the study. The study duration for each
      participant is expected to be approximately 16 months. The study drug, rivaroxaban, is
      approved in the United States and in several countries around the world for the prevention
      and treatment of a number of thrombosis-mediated conditions.
