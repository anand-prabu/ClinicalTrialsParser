    <textblock>
      This is an open label, phase I/IIa, 3 x 3 dose-escalation study of the combination of oral
      5-azacytidine and the histone deacetylase inhibitor romidepsin for the treatment of patients
      with relapsed and refractory lymphoma.

      Patients will take oral 5-azacytidine on Days 1 - 14 (+/- day 21) and romidepsin
      intravenously weekly on Days 8, 15 (+/- 22) on a 28-day treatment cycle.  In all cycles
      romidepsin will be administered first over 4 hours.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Azacitidine was first introduced for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia in adults in
      1976. Azacitidine prevents the body from making DNA and RNA that cells need to grow. This
      stops the growth of cancer cells and causes them to die.

      Romidepsin (also known as Istodax) is another type of chemotherapy known as HDAC (histone
      deacetylase) inhibitors.  This type of drug blocks the function of enzymes that help remove
      the acetyl groups from various proteins in cells.  HDAC inhibitors help stop the growth of
      cancer cells and can help kill the cancer cells.

      This is a Phase I/II study.  Patients will be treated with oral 5-azacitidine and
      romidepsin, administered as follows: oral 5-azacitidine from Days 1-14 or Days 1-21 (Dose
      Cohorts 5 and 6); and romidepsin administered intravenously on Days 8, 15 (and Day 22 in
      dose cohorts 5 and 6) of a 28 day cycle.  Cohorts of 3 patients will be enrolled
      sequentially as outlined in the dose escalation scheme. Once the MTD is reached the Phase II
      part of the protocol will be initiated in patients with T-Cell Lymphoma.
