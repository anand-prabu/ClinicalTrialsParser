Three subjects have been previously implanted in an IDE study at West\n      Virginia University. The subjects continue to be monitored and data is gathered on weight\n      loss, metabolism and any other effects or side effects over time.\n\n      The subjects will be seen as often as every month but no less than every three months at the\n      outpatient clinic.  They will be weighed and asked about changes in their overall health.\n      Their stimulators will be interrogated for use and battery status.  All device related\n      adverse events will be captured as well as any non-device related serious adverse events.\n\n      In addition, each subject will utilize the metabolic chambers and Deltatrac II Metabolic\n      Carts (SensorMedics Corporation, Anaheim, California or Datex-Ohmeda, Helsinki, Finland) at\n      Pennington Biomedical Research Center (PBRC), in Baton Rouge, Louisiana to objectively\n      measure the correlation of their metabolic rate to various novel settings on the DBS for a\n      one week period.\n\n      The schedule for the metabolic testing will include: Day 0 baseline overnight chamber with\n      no stimulation. Days 1-4  Resting metabolic rate (RMR) will be performed hourly with\n      variable LHS DBS settings. The settings will be changed approximately every 15 minutes after\n      the DBS settings are changed. Day 4 overnight chamber at ideal metabolic rate setting.\n      After RMR test on Day 4, the subject will have a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan\n      performed to assess body composition."
