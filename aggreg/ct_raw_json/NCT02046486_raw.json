The liquid is\n      transferred to a dosing cup and another 15 mL of purified water is added to the mortar and\n      stirred, ensuring that all powder has been dispersed and none remained on the mortar and\n      pestle. Again the liquid is transferred to the dosing cup. The same procedure is repeated\n      with 15 ml of purified water.The total contents are stirred for another 30 s to ensure that\n      all remaining tablet particles are dispersed."
