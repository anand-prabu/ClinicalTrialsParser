      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Noninvasive and Continuous Hemoglobin
      Monitoring (NACHO) for Surgical Blood Management affects transfusion decision making
      algorithm in the operating room.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood transfusions are associated with various risks including viral infections, delayed
      wound healing, transfusion related acute lung injury and cardiovascular complications.
      Despite limitations, and ongoing efforts to identify and validate other
      more-physiologically-relevant &quot;triggers&quot; for blood transfusions, hemoglobin-based
      transfusion triggers are still commonly used in practice, as well as in all currently
      available transfusion guidelines, alone, or in combination with other parameters. In the
      operating room the anesthesiologist has to withdraw blood from the patient and send it to
      the lab or the blood gas machine to achieve hemoglobin levels. It may be suggested that the
      ability to continuously monitor hemoglobin levels may help physicians to take more
      appropriate transfusion decisions; i.e, the physicians will either identify critical
      decreases in hemoglobin levels earlier and respond appropriately or avoid over-transfusing
      when hemoglobin levels have not decreased yet. Accordingly, monitors of hemoglobin levels
      are used in the operating theatre in many centers, although their blood-conserving effect
      has not been proven yet.

      We believe that the transfusion decision making algorithm in the operating room  relies less
      heavily on &quot;on spot&quot; measures of hemoglobin levels but rather on patient's comorbidities,
      expected additional bleeding according to the surgery and the surgeon, the course of the
      operation (the operating field is &quot;open&quot; and thus surgeons can tell if it is oozing or frank
      bleeding, if they can control bleeding promptly or not etc..), hemodynamic data available
      from the different invasive and non-invasive monitors, pressure from the surgeon, etc. It is
      therefore suggested that continuous monitoring of hemoglobin levels may be less relevant in
      this environment.

      Specific Aims/Hypothesis:

        1. The primary hypothesis is that continuous noninvasive hemoglobin monitoring will not
           reduce the number of blood transfusions in patients undergoing surgeries associated
           with a significant risk of bleeding.

        2. The secondary hypothesis is that in patients monitored with continuous noninvasive
           hemoglobin, there will not be earlier warning of critical drops in hemoglobin,
           resulting in less frequent complications compared with patients who are not being
           monitored with continuous noninvasive hemoglobin.

        Study population in this study is defined at two levels: 1.Consenting eligible
        Anesthesiologists, and 2. Eligible patients under the case of the consenting eligible
        Anesthesiologist. Each level has its own eligibility criteria.
