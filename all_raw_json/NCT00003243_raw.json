Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. White\n      blood cells from donors may be able to kill cancer cells in patients who have hematologic\n      cancer that has recurred following bone marrow transplantation.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus infusion\n      of donated white blood cells in treating patients who have hematologic cancer that has\n      recurred after bone marrow transplantation."

Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously (SC)\n           or IV daily beginning on day 10 and continuing until blood counts recover.\n\n        -  Cohort 2: In the absence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) on cohort 1, 3-6 patients\n           receive treatment as in cohort 1 and LipoDox IV over 2 hours on day 1.\n\n        -  Cohort 3: In the absence of DLT on cohort 2, 3-6 patients are randomized to 1 of 2\n           treatment arms.\n\n             -  Arm I: Patients receive treatment as in cohort 1 plus a higher dose of LipoDox IV\n                over 2 hours on day 1.\n\n             -  Arm II: Patients receive treatment as in cohort 1 and interleukin-2 (IL-2) SC on\n                days 10-12.\n\n      If DLT is reached on cohort 2, 3-6 patients receive treatment as in arm II.\n\n        -  Cohort 4: In the absence of DLT on arms I and II, patients receive treatment as in\n           cohort 1, LipoDox as in arm I, and IL-2 as in arm II.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of LipoDox until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients\n      experience DLT.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-15 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
