  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the cardiovascular effects of sildenafil on patients with Fontan
      circulation.  Recent studies suggest that sildenafil may improve exercise in patients with
      Fontan circulation.  However, why this occurs is not known.  The study will used specialized
      catheters to measure pressure and volume.  The measure of pressure and volume leads to more
      detailed analysis of heart function.  Patients will receive either sugar pill or sildenafil
      prior to catheterization.  It is believed that sildenafil will improve relaxation and
      contraction of the heart.

    <description>Sildenafil will be given an one time dose 30 to 90 minutes prior to catheterization. Sildenafil will be given at a dose 1 milligram per kilogram with a maximum of 20 milligrams. During the catheterization patients will have specialized catheter placed in the heart that measures pressure and volume simultaneously.  The patients will undergo an infusion of dobutamine up to 10 micrograms per kilogram per minute to mimic exercise for up to ten minutes..</description>
