The\n      investigators have developed a personalized risk estimator for RA based on demographics,\n      family history, biomarkers and behaviors related to RA risk. Eligible participants have a\n      first degree relative with RA but do not have RA themselves. Participants who meet\n      eligibility and consent to the study will be randomized to receive either standard\n      information about RA, the online personalized RA risk tool, or the online personalized RA\n      risk tool with guidance from a health educator. Participants will be followed to measure\n      willingness to change RA risk behaviors. The investigators hypothesize that participants who\n      receive the online personalized RA risk tool and health education will be more willing to\n      change RA risk behaviors compared to participants that receive standard RA information."

A 3-arm randomized trial will be\n      conducted among 222 RA first degree relatives that will be followed for one year.\n      Participants will be surveyed before and after RA education concerning (i) knowledge and\n      attitudes about RA risk, (ii) decisional balance related to behaviors, and (iii) stage of\n      behavior change concerning lifestyle risks.\n\n      At the initial study visit, participants will be randomly assigned to one of three arms. Arm\n      1 participants will receive general education about RA (comparison group). These\n      participants will be followed to assess for willingness to change behaviors associated with\n      RA risk.

Arm 3 participants will receive personalized risk by the online risk tool along\n      with health education and counseling (PRE-RA Plus group).
