Trough FEV1 measurements were taken electronically by spirometry on Days 2, 28, 56, 84, 112, 140, 168, and 169. Baseline is defined as the mean of the assessments made 30 minutes (min) pre-dose and 5 min pre-dose on Treatment Day 1. Trough FEV1 is defined as the mean of the FEV1 values obtained at 23 and 24 hours (hr) after the previous morning's dosing (ie., trough FEV1 on Day 169 is the mean of the FEV1 values obtained 23 and 24 hr after the morning dosing on Day 168). Change from Baseline at a particular visit was calculated as the trough FEV1 value at that visit minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of treatment, Baseline (mean of the two assessmentsmade 30 min and 5 min pre-dose on Day 1), smoking status, center group, day, and day by Baseline and day by treatment interactions.",

            "description": "FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The WM FEV1 was derived by calculating the area under the FEV1/time curve (AUC) using the trapezoidal rule, and then dividing the value by the time interval over which the AUC was calculated. The WM was calculated at Days 1, 84, and 168 using the 0-6-hour post-dose FEV1 measurements collected on that day, which included pre-dose (Day 1: 30 minutes [min] and 5 min prior to dosing; other serial visits: 23 and 24 hours after the previous morning dose) and post-dose at 15 min, 30 min, 1 hour, 3 hours, and 6 hours. Change from BL at a particular visit was calculated as the WM value at that visit minus the BL value. Analysis was performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of treatment, BL (mean of the two assessments made 30 min and 5 min pre-dose on Day 1), smoking status, center group, day, and day by BL and day by treatment interactions.",
