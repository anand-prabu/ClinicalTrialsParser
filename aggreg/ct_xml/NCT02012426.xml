  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the current study is to demonstrate that a commercial weight management diet
      (i.e. low energy density) influences satiation, hunger and satiety and leads to lower energy
      intake during ad-libitum meals and over a full day. We further seek to demonstrate the
      sustainability of this effect following 12- week weight loss on the weight management
      program.

        -  We hypothesise that formulated (low energy) meals will lead to decreased hunger,
           greater fullness and reduced desire to eat compared to standard meals.

        -  We hypothesise that the commercial weight management program will lead to greater
           weight loss compared to control program.

        -  We hypothesise that formulated meals (high consumer acceptance) will improve hedonic
           control over eating (lower wanting for high fat food)

        -  We hypothesise that the commercial weight management program will improve hedonic
           control over eating (reduced experience food cravings)
