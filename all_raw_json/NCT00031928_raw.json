Patients then receive intrathecal mafosfamide once weekly for 4 weeks\n      (consolidation therapy), twice a month for 4 months, and then monthly thereafter\n      (maintenance therapy) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of mafosfamide until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2\n      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3000 patients will be accrued for this study."
