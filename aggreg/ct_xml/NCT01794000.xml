  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the study drug known
      as prasugrel for the reduction of Vaso-Occlusive Crisis events in pediatric participants
      with sickle cell disease. The study will also investigate reduction in daily pain in
      children who have sickle cell disease.
