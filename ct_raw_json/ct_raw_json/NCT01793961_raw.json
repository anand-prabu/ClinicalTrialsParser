            "textblock": "Rates of driving under the influence of cannabis have risen in recent years. Cannabis is\n      involved in 1/3 of motor vehicle collisions. The chronic use of cannabis is known to affect\n      dopaminergic regulation and may thus impair contrast sensitivity. In turn, contrast\n      sensitivity disorders could originate difficulties to anticipate and avoid collision with\n      objects, especially when objects are in movement. The investigators goal is to examine the\n      effects of a chronic intake of cannabis on contrast sensitivity. The observed values will be\n      compared to standard references. In addition, since smoking cannabis is always associated\n      with tobacco, the investigators will  control the effects of tobacco on contrast\n      sensitivity.\n\n      In this study, the investigators will include 36 cannabis addicts, 36 tobacco addicts and 36\n      no smokers. The investigators will present gratings with different spatial frequencies and\n      the investigators will determine contrast thresholds for static and dynamic (moving)\n      gratings. The investigators predict that cannabis addicts will present abnormal contrast\n      sensitivity especially in case of dynamic presentation of gradings."
