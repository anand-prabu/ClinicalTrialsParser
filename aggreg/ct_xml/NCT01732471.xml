    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-comparative, Phase 3 study to evaluate the degree, frequency of
      response and safety of Kuvan® in subjects aged 4 to 18 years who have phenylketonuria  with
      elevated blood phenylalanine level of greater than or equal to 450 micromole per liter.

    <description>Kuvan® oral soluble tablet will be administered once daily in the morning, as 20 milligram per kilogram of the subject's body mass. The therapy duration will depend on the response to treatment - either up to 8 days, (if there will be no response), or up to 7 weeks (if there will be response).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent (for children under 18 years old
             the parent(s)/guardians give informed consent, subjects 14-17 years old give
             additionally their own written informed consent)

          -  Age of 4 - 18 years, inclusive

          -  Confirmed clinical and biochemical Hyperphenylalaninemia due to phenylketonuria
             documented by past medical history with at least 2 blood Phenylalanine  level greater
             than or equal to 400 micromole per liter obtained in 2 separate occasions

          -  Blood phenylalanine level at screening greater than or equal to 450 micromole per
             liter (mean of two measurements)

          -  For women of childbearing potential, a negative urine pregnancy test is required at
             screening and willingness to use a highly effective method of contraception is
             required while participating in the study

          -  Subject and/or the parent/guardian willing and able to comply with study procedures

          -  Subject and/or the parent/guardian willing to continue current diet unchanged during
             the 8 days response test and to adapt the diet according to Phenylalanine therapeutic
             target range during the 6 week treatment period

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject already assessed for responsiveness to sapropterin dihydrochloride or other
             tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)

          -  Used any investigational agent other than Kuvan® within 30 days of screening, or
             required any investigational agent or vaccine prior to completion of all scheduled
             study assessments

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding, or considering pregnancy

          -  Concurrent disease or conditions that would interfere with study participation or
             safety (for example, seizure disorder, asthma or other condition requiring oral or
             parenteral corticosteroid administration, insulin-dependent diabetes, or organ
             transplantation recipient)

          -  Concurrent use of required concomitant treatment with any drug known to inhibit
             folate synthesis (e.g. methotrexate), levodopa, phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5)
             inhibitors (such as, sildenafil, vardenafil or tadalafil), medications that are known
             to affect nitric oxide synthesis metabolism or action

          -  Any conditions, that, in the view of the Principal Investigator renders the subject
             at high risk for failure to comply with treatment or to complete the study

          -  Clinical diagnosis of primary BH4 deficiency

          -  Known hypersensitivity to Kuvan® or its excipients or to other approved or
             non-approved formulation of tetrabiopterin
