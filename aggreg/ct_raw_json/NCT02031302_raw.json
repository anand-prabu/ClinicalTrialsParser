Approximately 1000 real-world, consecutive subjects will\n      be enrolled at up to 50 study centers in Europe, Asia Pacific and Central/South America.\n\n      All enrolled subjects will be contacted for follow-up at 30 days, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years\n      post index valve implantation. Follow-up visit at 1 year post valve implantation should be\n      conducted via outpatient clinic visit. Follow-up visits at 30 days and 2 through 5 years may\n      be conducted in person (preferred) and via telephone interview. Subjects who are not\n      implanted with a Lotus Valve will be followed for safety through 30 days after the initial\n      attempted index procedure.\n\n      Collection of safety events will include any serious adverse event (SAE) that led to death,\n      serious adverse device effect (SADE), adverse device effect (ADE), unanticipated serious\n      adverse device effect (USADE), and all Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC) events\n      regardless of seriousness and device relationship through 5 year follow-up.\n\n      The RESPOND study will be conducted in accordance with the International Organization for\n      Standardization (ISO) 14155: 2011; ethical principles that have their origins in the\n      Declaration of Helsinki; the relevant parts of the International Conference on Harmonization\n      (ICH) Guidelines for Good Clinical Practices (GCP); and pertinent individual\n      country/state/local laws and regulations."
