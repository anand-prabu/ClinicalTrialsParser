            "textblock": "The investigators proposes a prospective cohort study in patients with high risk bladder\n      cancer who have opted for radical cystectomy. The investigators aim to correlate\n      pre-operative measures of body composition, cognitive and functional status with impaired\n      survival at 6 months after cystectomy. Impairment in this context will be a compilation of\n      several specific objective measures including: 1) death from any cause, 2) major\n      complication (Clavien score7 \u2265 3), 3) loss of independent living status, 4) performance\n      status, and 5) global well-being. The study team believes that Impairment Free Survival is\n      an important endpoint as it accounts for many aspects of a patient's functional status that\n      might alter a patient's choice to proceed with radical surgery."
