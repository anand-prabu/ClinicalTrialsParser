      Introduction: Colonoscopy is an important tool for colon cancer screening. Proper colon
      cleansing is essential to ensure adequate mucosal examination. Timing of bowel preparation
      administration is now recognized as an important component for achieving superior cleansing.
      Multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have found split-dosing to be
      superior than day-before dosing. Objective: This study aims to compare two types of bowel
      preparations in split-doses to assess for differences in patient tolerability, as well as
      efficacy of colon cleansing. Methods: This is a prospective, single-blinded,
      randomized-controlled trial. Patients who are being referred for a colonoscopy will be
      recruited to participate in the study. They will be randomly assigned to receive either a
      split-dose polyethylene glycol (PEG) or picosalax (P/MC) bowel preparation. Patient
      tolerability will be examined through questionnaires. The endoscopist performing the
      colonoscopy will use two standardized bowel preparation scoring systems to evaluate the
      quality of the cleansing. The investigators propose that P/MC will be superior to PEG in
      patient tolerability and non-inferior in bowel cleansing effects.

    <description>Patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire to assess ease of completion and symptoms. Questionnaire items are weighted on a 5-point Likert scale. Interference with sleep will be assessed through a questionnaire that is based on a modified validated sleep questionnaire (St. Mary's Hospital Sleep Questionnaire). Participants will be asked to complete this questionnaire at the initial appointment and again on the day of their procedure</description>

    <description>The colonoscopist will be blinded to the type of preparation the subject underwent. The colonoscopist will complete a validated questionnaire to assess the quality of the preparation (The Ottawa Scale) and the 4-point Aronchick bowel cleansing scale. The patient's baseline bowel habit will be recorded, as well as the withdrawal time, volume of liquid suctioned and volume of washing fluid used during the colonoscopy.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) group will be instructed to ingest 2L of bowel preparation the night before their colonoscopy (starting at 7PM), as well as 1.5-2L of carbohydrate-electrolyte rehydration solution. The following day they will be instructed to ingest the remaining 2L of bowel preparation and must finish ingesting the entire preparation at least 4 hours prior to the scheduled colonoscopy.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the Picosalax (P/MC) group will be instructed to mix one sachet in 150mL of water and ingest the entire mixture at 7PM the night before their colonoscopy. In addition, they will be instructed to ingest 1.5-2L of carbohydrate-electrolyte rehydration solution after they consume the P/MC sachet. The following day they will mix the second sachet in 150mL of water and must finish ingesting the entire preparation at least 4 hours prior to the scheduled colonoscopy. They will also be instructed to drink additional carbohydrate-electrolyte rehydration solution after they ingest the P/MC sachet.</description>
