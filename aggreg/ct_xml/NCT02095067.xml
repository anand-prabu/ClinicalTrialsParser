  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prehospital resources are limited. The emergency medical dispatch center (EMDC) is
      manned by qualified health care personnel around the clock. We believe that the EMDC is an
      unexploited resource in the prehospital treatment  of patients. By the use of
      videoconferencing we will activate this resource.

      Mobile videoconferencing between ambulances and physician at the EMDC enables patient
      consultation at a distance. Video consultation between patient and the physician at the EMDC
      can take place when the patient is at home or in the ambulance.

      The primary aim of this study is to examine the effect of video consultation between
      physicians at the EMDC and patients receiving treatment by ambulance personnel on the number
      of patients receiving final treatment  on-site in the pre hospital setting.
