      To identify a panel of circulating miRNA markers which could help identify those breast
      cancer patients who are most likely to respond well to neoadjuvant and adjuvant
      chemotherapy, and indeed serve as an overall prognostic factor and stratify patients into
      risk categories which would further guide their management. Similarly, the investigators aim
      to identify a panel of circulating miRNA markers which could monitor patient's response to
      chemotherapy and hormonal therapies. Ideally a suitable panel of markers would show
      significant changes in expression level in good-responders whilst little or no change would
      be observed in miRNA expression in non-responders.

      Primary Objectives:

        1. To identify a panel of miRNAs, detectable in the circulation, which are altered in
           breast cancer patients

        2. To identify specific combinations of miRNAs ('signatures') which associate with breast
           cancer intrinsic subtypes, and thereby could aid in prognostication and treatment
           planning on an individual patient basis.

      Secondary Objective:

      1. To determine if systemic miRNA analysis can be used as a biomarker for monitoring
      response to chemotherapy, in the neoadjuvant setting and in patients who present with breast
      cancer recurrence and are treated with upfront chemotherapy

      This is a prospective cohort studies, involving two study cohorts:

      Cohort 1: Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients, Cohort 2: Recurrent breast cancer patients

      Blood Sampling:

        -  1st (baseline) blood sample at presentation before commencing neoadjuvant (cohort 1) or
           systemic (cohort 2) treatment.

        -  2nd blood sample midway through their chemotherapy treatment (after 2nd cycle if they
           are enrolled in a 4 cycle regimen, or after 4th cycle if they are prescribed an 8 week
           regimen).

        -  3rd blood sample post-chemotherapy and before surgery (if applicable).

        -  4th blood sample 2-4 weeks after surgery, or after last blood sampling if surgery is
           not envisaged

        -  5th blood sample 12-18 month after surgery or after 3rd blood sampling if surgery is
           not envisaged.

      GUH only: Tissue samples will be taken at time of biopsy and/or at time of surgery.

      All samples will be processed for miRNA quantification - a panel of 9 cancer-specific miRNAs
      will be measured in each sample, and the change in each patient's miRNA expression levels
      monitored over the course of their treatment.

      Blood samples will be processed for miRNA analysis, which involves:

        1. Lysis using Trizol

        2. RNA isolation

        3. Assessing concentration and integrity of RNA using Nanodrop spectrophotometry

        4. cDNA synthesis (using miRNA specific stem loop primers)

        5. PCR amplification and relative quantification (using miRNA specific probes)

        Investigators aim to study two populations of breast cancer patients:

          1. Patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer at tertiary referral
             breast cancer centres in Ireland.

             For GUH only: Additionally,investigators wish to evaluate miRNA expression levels in
             patients' diagnostic core biopsies.

          2. Investigators also wish to study the same panel of miRNAs in patients who present
             with disease recurrence or disease progression, and who are commenced on systemic
             therapies (hormonal and/or chemotherapy).
