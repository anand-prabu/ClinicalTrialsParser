  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if investigators can develop a technique to identify
      sentinel lymph nodes in the rectum for rectal cancer patients with the use of a radiotracer
      (Tc-sulfur colloid), a dye (Spot), and imaging, both pre- and intraoperatively.  Eligible
      patients are those with stage I-III rectal cancer undergoing standard low anterior resection
      or abdominoperineal resection.

      Investigators hypothesize that use of a unique intraoperative lymphatic mapping technique
      using a mobile gamma camera will identify the sentinel lymph node in patients with rectal
      cancer with greater than 80% sensitivity.

      Subjects will receive injections of the tracer and dye prior to surgery, have preoperative
      SPECT/CT imaging to be used as a guide to the rectal lymphatic system and then proceed to
      their scheduled surgery.  During surgery, images of the rectum will be taken with a unique
      mobile gamma camera prior to removal and upon resection.

      If surgeons are able to identify the sentinel lymph nodes surrounding the rectal tumor, the
      hope is to combine this technique with a less invasive surgery called transanal endoscopic
      microsurgery (TEM) for early stage rectal cancer patients.

    <description>The primary endpoint is the sensitivity of sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection by the technique which will be estimated by the number of SLNs detected by the technique divided by the number noted at surgery or on final pathology review.  90% confidences interval around the estimate will help guide interpretation of the results.</description>

    <description>Descriptive summaries will be used to list any complications that may have occurred pre-, intra- or post-operatively.  Frequency and location of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) with respect to the tumor prior to surgery will be noted.  In addition the location of the SLN in relation to the tumor will be documented during pathologic examination with the pathologist and surgeon to assess the feasibility of excision with transanal endoscopic microsurgery.</description>

    <description>Subjects will have a preoperative flexible sigmoidoscopy where they will receive an endoscopic injection of 99mTc-sulfur colloid (up to 0.5 mCi)  and 3 to 5 cc of circumferential endoscopic injections of Spot.  A SPECT/CT will be performed prior to surgery to identify lymph nodes in the rectum.  Subjects will proceed to their standard surgery.  Intraoperative mobile gamma camera imaging of the rectum will occur before and after resection in attempt to identify sentinel lymph nodes.</description>
