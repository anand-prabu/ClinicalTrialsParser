  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the success rate of two treatments for infection
      after total hip replacement: single stage arthroplasty exchange (your surgeon will take out
      your original implants and replace them with a complete new set) compared to irrigation and
      debridement with modular exchange (your surgeon will clean your implants with a surgical
      solution and take out the plastic liner and replace it with a new one - the rest of your hip
      implants will stay in place).  The goal is to see if one is better than the other for the
      treatment of hip infection after a total hip replacement.  A successful treatment means that
      you did not have to have another surgery on your hip for an infection-related reason.
