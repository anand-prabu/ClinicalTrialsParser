The patient receives three types of feedback on the mobile phone concerning the amount of activity, the amount of activity in relation to an activity goal, and the response of a nurse based on the measured activity. Practice nurses will use a consultation approach to coach patients in their self-management regarding physical activity based on a \"five A's cycle\" counselling technique (assess-advise-agree-assist-arrange). Motivational interviewing, risk assessment, and goal setting are specific aspects of this approach.The patient comes to the practice four times: in the first week, after 2 weeks, after 8-12 weeks and after 16-24 weeks."

In addition, COPD patients have consultations (15-30 minutes) with the practice nurse once or twice a year. Most patients with diabetes type 2 see the GP ones per year and the practice nurse three times per year for a health check.Normally, physical activity is not high on the agenda during consultations with the practice nurse. Barriers for paying attention are the competition with other topics that should also be covered during consultations, co-morbidity and limitations of patients, and the assumption of most practice nurses that nowadays the patient decides on the topics of the consultation. All interviewees agreed that many patients do not perceive physical activity as an important issue."

            "textblock": "Rationale: Physical activity is an important factor for a healthy lifestyle. Although\n      physical activity can delay complications and decrease the burden of the disease in\n      chronically ill persons, their level of activity is often far from optimal. Many\n      interventions have been developed to stimulate physical activity, with disappointing\n      results. New in this field is the use of technology. Human persuasion (for example guidance\n      by a practice nurse) can be enhanced by technological persuasion. Therefore a monitor and\n      feedback tool, consisting of an accelerometer linked to a smart phone and webserver, has\n      been developed and tested.\n\n      Objective: The main objective of this study is to measure the effects of the monitoring and\n      feedback tool embedded in a Self-management Support Program on physical activity. The\n      secondary objective is to measure the effect on self-efficacy, quality of life and health\n      status. In addition a process evaluation will be conducted.\n\n      Study design: A three-armed cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted with 240\n      patients from 24 general practices. Randomisation level is the practice. The following\n      conditions will be compared: 1) Tool and Self-management Support Program; 2) Self-management\n      Support Program; 3) Care as usual. Outcome measures will be measured at t0 (before the start\n      of the intervention), t1 (after 6 months, at the end of the intervention) and t2 (after 12\n      months).\n\n      Study population: 120 People with COPD and 120 people with Diabetes type 2 (aged 40-70)\n      treated in primary care will be included from 24 GP practices.\n\n      Intervention: Spread over a period of six months patients in condition 1 and 2 have to visit\n      the practice nurse for 3-4 times for physical activity counselling. Specific activity goals\n      will be set that are tailored to the individual patient's preferences and needs. On top of\n      this, patients in condition 1 will be instructed to use the monitoring and feedback tool in\n      daily life. Patients in condition 3 will not be exposed to any intervention.\n\n      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary outcome: physical activity measured with a physical\n      activity monitor (PAM). Secondary outcomes: quality of life, general self-efficacy, exercise\n      self-efficacy and health status."
