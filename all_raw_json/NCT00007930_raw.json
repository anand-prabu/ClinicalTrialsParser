Patients are stratified according to\n      treatment center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo surgical resection with a wide mesorectal excision followed by\n           a straight colorectal anastomosis.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo surgical resection with a total mesorectal excision followed\n           by a colonic J pouch coloanal anastomosis. Patients then receive a temporary ileostomy\n           which is closed 6 weeks later.\n\n      Patients are followed at 6 weeks, every 4-6 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years,\n      and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 800 patients (400 per arm) will be accrued for this study."
