  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to estimate the amount of extra urine produced by natural diuresis
      during 20-minute pad test, and assess the effect of diuresis on the accuracy of using
      20-minute pad test to estimate the severity of SUI. Besides, the above results may be used
      for further refinement of the amount of water infusion used for the 20-minute pad test.

    <textblock>
      Pad testing is an important method to evaluate the severity of women with stress urinary
      incontinence (SUI). The investigators had proved the superiority of the infusion of the
      strong desire amount while using 20-minute pad test for detecting SUI. However, a
      considerable volume of urine may be produced by natural diuresis during the course of
      20-minute pad test with strong-desire amount infusion, and may cause bladder overdistension,
      more urine leakage and overestimate the severity of SUI. Thus, the aim of this study is to
      estimate of the amount of extra urine produced by natural diuresis, and assess its effect on
      the ability of using pad weight to estimate the severity of SUI.

      The investigators will review the clinical data of patients who receiving urodynamic studies
      in the Department of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology of National Taiwan University Hospital between
      January 2008 and March 2014. STATA 11.0 software will be used for statistical analysis.

      The investigators will get the mean values of diuresis, and the factors affecting the amount
      of diuresis. Besides, the investigators can get the influence of diuresis on the accuracy of
      20-minute pad test as a role of estimating the severity of SUI. The above data should be
      important for further refinement of 20-minute pad test.
