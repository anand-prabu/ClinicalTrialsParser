There is need to assess the persistence of dydrogesterone\n      therapy in a post-marketing setting after cessation of treatment and whether the\n      persistence, if any, is related to the duration of dydrogesterone therapy. Hence, in this\n      observational program, the goal is to observe the possible implications of such treatment in\n      terms of treatment length and response pattern."
