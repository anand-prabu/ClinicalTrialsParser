  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare an online 12-module intervention designed to improve
      emotion regulation and social relations via mindfulness training with a 12-module program
      that provides information about health behaviors to individuals with fibromyalgia.  The
      mindfulness training program is expected to produce greater day-to-day improvements than the
      education condition in individuals' efficacy for coping with pain and stress, positive and
      negative affect, and positive engagement in social relations assessed via online diaries
      completed each evening during the intervention period.

    <description>Trajectory of change in positive affect over the course of the trial is assessed via daily diaries. Positive and negative affect are assessed daily with the Positive (10 items) and Negative (10 items) Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson, Clark, &amp; Tellegen, 1988).</description>

    <measure>Pain and Stress Coping Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily over 6-week intervention</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Trajectory of change over the course of the intervention via daily diary reports.  Pain and stress coping efficacy (PCE and SCE) are assessed with 2 items each, with items combined to form a mean score for PCE and for SCE (Johnson, Zautra, &amp; Davis 2006).  &quot;The first was &quot;How satisfied are you with how you coped with your symptoms (stress)?&quot; referring to that day, rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1=very dissatisfied to 5=very satisfied. The second item was &quot;If you had this level of pain (stress) again, how certain are you that you would be able to cope well with its negative aspects?&quot; rated on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1=very uncertain to 5 = very certain.</description>

    <measure>Enjoyment and Stressfulness of Family Relations</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily during 6-week intervention</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Trajectory of change over the course of the trial via daily diaries. Daily family relations were assessed by two items asking how enjoyable (1 item) and how stressful (1 item) individuals found the time they spent with family on that day, with each item rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 1=not at all to 4 = extremely. These items were drawn from the Inventory of Small Life Events scale (Zautra, Guarnaccia, &amp; Dohrenwend, 1986)</description>
