This would include the following:\n\n        1. Ejection fraction: estimates how well the heart is squeezing/functioning.\n\n        2. Segmental wall motion abnormalities: if one wall of the heart is not moving well, this\n           suggests that part of the heart is not getting enough blood supply and could represent\n           a blockage in a blood vessel supplying the heart or in other terms a heart attack.\n\n        3. Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension: allows us to see if the heart is dilated\n\n        4. Inferior vena cava size: the size of this great vein can help estimate if patient has\n           too much fluid in their vascular bed.\n\n        5. Aortic valve pathology: whether or not there is thickening of the valve or impairment\n           of it's opening.\n\n        6. Mitral valve pathology: whether or not the valve is significantly thickened or with\n           impaired closing and opening.\n\n        7. Pericardial effusion: excessive fluid in the sack around the heart.\n\n      The images obtained on the HHE will be evaluated by two experienced echocardiographers as\n      well as two cardiology fellows who have obtained training in image acquisition and\n      interpretation. The readers of the HHE images are blinded to the TTE results, and vice\n      versa.\n\n      A comparison of these individual parameters on HHE and TTE  allows us to validate this new,\n      convenient screening tool in detecting cardiac pathology."
