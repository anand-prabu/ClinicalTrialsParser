    <textblock>
      This non-randomized, single group, open-label study will investigate the mass balance,
      routes of elimination, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of a single oral dose of RO5424802
      and the pharmacokinetics of a 14C-labeled tracer in healthy volunteers

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male adults, 18 to 45 years of age, inclusive

          -  Willingness to abstain from alcohol and xanthine-containing beverages or food
             (coffee, tea, cola, chocolate and &quot;energy drinks&quot;) from 72 hours prior to the first
             dose until discharged

          -  Willingness to avoid prolonged sun exposure and guard against sunburn during study &amp;
             follow-up

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant medical history or findings in physical examination, vital
             signs, or laboratory test results prior to study start

          -  Positive screening tests for hepatitis B or C, HIV, alcohol, drugs of abuse, or
             tobacco

          -  Regular smoking within 6 months prior to first dosing. Subjects should avoid smoky
             environments for at least 1 week prior to each cotinine screen

          -  Excessive alcohol consumption

          -  Use of any metabolic inducers (including herbals such as St. John's Wort) within 4
             weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before the first dose of study
             medication, including but not limited to: rifampin, rifabutin, glucocorticoids,
             carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital

          -  Regular work with ionizing radiation or radioactive material

          -  Subjects enrolled in a previous radiolabel study or who have received radiotherapy
             within 12 months prior to first dosing such that total radioactivity over a 12 month
             period would exceed an acceptable radiation burden &gt; 0.1 mSv

          -  Exposure to radiation for diagnostic reasons (except dental X-rays and plain X-rays
             of thorax and bony skeleton [excluding spinal column]), during work or participation
             in a medical trial in the previous year

          -  Strenuous activity, sunbathing, or contact sports are not allowed from 4 days prior
             to entry into the clinical site until study follow-up

          -  Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 60 days (or 6 months
             for biologic therapies) prior to first dosing
