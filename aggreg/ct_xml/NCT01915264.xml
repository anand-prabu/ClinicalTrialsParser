    <textblock>
      The study is designed as non interventional to collect data on the safety especially, severe
      hypoglycemia or documented symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes and effectiveness of
      acarbose/metformin fixed-dose combination under real-life treatment condition in large
      sample of type-2 diabetes patients in India. The study objective is to evaluate severe
      hypoglycemia or documented symptomatic or asymptomatic hypoglycemic events reported as
      adverse events. The study will begin after the study approval by ethics committee. All
      patients with type 2 diabetes on acarbose or metformin monotherapy and prescribed Glucobay M
      will be included in study after taking the informed consent. Patients will be observed for
      up to 24 weeks (2 weeks).The study involves general examination of patients, collection of
      data like history of disease, concomitant medication, drug dose etc. The study is planned to
      enroll 10000 subjects from multiple study centers spread across India. The study data will
      be analyzed with appropriate statistical methods.
