Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor\n      cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming\n      normal cells. Combining chemotherapy with monoclonal antibody therapy may kill more tumor\n      cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study effectiveness of combining cisplatin, gemcitabine, and\n      trastuzumab in treating patients who have stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer."

Determine the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of cisplatin, gemcitabine,\n      and trastuzumab (Herceptin) in patients with untreated p185-HER2 overexpressing stage IIIB\n      or IV non-small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the pharmacokinetic interactions among these\n      drugs in these patients. III. Assess the pharmacodynamics of these drugs in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Regimen A: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30\n      minutes followed by cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over\n      90 minutes on day 2. Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 90 minutes followed by gemcitabine\n      IV over 30 minutes on day 8 and trastuzumab IV over 90 minutes on day 15. Patients proceed\n      to regimen B on day 22 of regimen A. Regimen B: Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90\n      minutes, gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes, and cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Patients\n      receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes followed by gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on day\n      8 and trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to\n      5 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Maintenance: After\n      completion of 6 courses, patients with stable disease or partial response receive\n      trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes weekly until tumor progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-48 patients will be accrued for this study."
