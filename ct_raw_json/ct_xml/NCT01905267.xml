    <description>This intervention targets rumination and other maladaptive forms of emotion regulation such as suppression and avoidance and provides skills training in effective coping strategies.  Mindfulness is a key component of this intervention as a strategy for disengaging from one's thoughts.  Strategies from Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), such as the use of effective interpersonal skills, are also included as methods for regulating strong emotion.  Rumination-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy is a structured, manual based program designed to be delivered weekly over eight weeks.  Sessions are 60-90 minutes in length.</description>
