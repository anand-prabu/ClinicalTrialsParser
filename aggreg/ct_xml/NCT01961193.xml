      Study Rationale:

      The insertion of a bandage contact lens or punctal plug in a defined group of patients
      admitted to the ICU may be more effective than standard care in decreasing the incidence of
      corneal injuries.

      Study Objectives:

        1. To document the effect of a contact bandage lens and punctal plug in preventing corneal
           injuries in critically ill patients admitted to the ICU.

        2. To assess the safety of a contact bandage lens and punctal plug in critically ill
           patients.

      This is a prospective, randomized study

      Study Population:

      Consecutive patients admitted to the General Intensive Care Unit of the Rabin Medical Center
      and Sharon Hospital Medical Center over a 6-month period who meet criteria for inclusion.

      Procedures:

      Consecutive patients meeting inclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. Patients will
      be randomized to 3 groups: the bandage contact lens group, who will be assigned to insertion
      of a bandage contact lens; the punctal plug group, who will be assigned to the insertion of
      punctal plugs; and the control group, who will be assigned to standard eye care as currently
      practiced in the ICU.

      In addition, patients in the study will be examined every 4 days by a physician from the
      ophthalmology department and at either discharge from the ICU or at time of death.
