  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need for better visualization of polyps during surveillance endoscopy in patients
      with hereditary colon cancer syndromes like Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) and Lynch
      Syndrome (LS), to improve the adenoma detection rate. Optical molecular imaging of adenoma
      associated biomarkers is a promising technique to accommodate this need. The biomarker
      Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is overexpressed in adenomatous colon tissue
      versus normal tissue and has proven to be a valid target for molecular imaging. The
      University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) developed a fluorescent tracer by labeling the
      VEGF-targeting humanized monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, currently used in anti-cancer
      therapy, with the fluorescent dye IRDye800CW. The investigators hypothesize that when
      bevacizumab-IRDye800CW is administered to patients, it accumulates in VEGF expressing
      adenomas, enabling adenoma visualization using a newly developed near-infrared (NIR)
      fluorescence endoscopy platform (NL43407.042.13). This hypothesis will be tested in this
      feasibility study, next to the determination of the best time interval between tracer
      administration and endoscopic imaging.

    <description>The main objective of this study is to determine the sensitivity of the fluorescent tracer bevacizumab-IRDye800CW and the near-infrared fluorescence endoscopy platform in identifying adenomatous polyps during surveillance endoscopy in patients with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP).</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <time_frame>Two years</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>In this outcome meassure, it is determined if there is a correlation between the observed mean fluorescence intensity of a polyp and the VEGF expression in the same polyp, as determined with immunohistochemistry and eventually RNA/DNA analysis. In other words, does the mean fluorescence intensity reflect the VEGF expression of the polyp?</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure the mean fluorescent intensity of adenomas and compare this between the three different subgroups to determine the best time interval between intravenous tracer administration and the fluorescence endoscopy procedure.</measure>
    <time_frame>Two years</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The goal of this outcome measure, is to determine the optimal time interval (1, 2 or 3 days) between intravenous administration of bevacizumab-IRDye800CW and the fluorescence endoscopy procedure to visualize adenomas. The fluorescence intensity of adenomas will be measured in vivo during fluorescence endoscopy and ex vivo (e.g. using confocal fluorescence microscopy, spectroscopy). This will be compared between the three subgroups (patients with different time intervals between tracer injection and endoscopy procedure) to determine the best time interval between tracer injection and endoscopy procedure.</description>
