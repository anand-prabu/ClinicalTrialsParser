  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Integrated Clinical Information Sharing System (ICISS) is an online system designed to
      make it easy for healthcare providers to monitor patients' disease symptoms and functioning
      over time and in between in-person visits (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1vcbx0Ef4).
      Using combined quality improvement and randomized clinical trial methods, we will evaluate
      the impact of ICISS on the health outcomes, patient/family experience of care, and
      healthcare utilization for children and adolescents with ADHD, asthma, autism, depression,
      and epilepsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Integrated Clinical Information Sharing System (ICISS) is a web-based patient management
      and monitoring system designed to track patients' disease symptoms and response to therapy
      over time. ICISS enables clinics to use electronic surveys to gather data remotely from
      multiple responders, including patients, parents/guardians, school personnel and ancillary
      providers, and view the responses in a timely manner via graphical, tabular, and narrative
      summary formats.

      This quality improvement (QI) initiative will implement ICISS as the standard of care for
      all patients who receive care for ADHD, asthma, autism, depression, and epilepsy within
      seven ambulatory specialties at Boston Children's Hospital. Patients and families will use
      ICISS to report on patient health status and will complete clinically-relevant
      questionnaires at routine intervals. Providers will use the information collected through
      ICISS to inform their clinical care of the patient/family.

      To evaluate the effectiveness of ICISS, we will conduct a 24-month phased, cluster
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) where we randomize providers to &quot;active&quot; vs.
      &quot;delayed-start&quot; to ICISS use, with patients clustered by provider (within specialties) for
      analytic purposes. Delayed-start providers will crossover to active ICISS use after 12
      months. Patients/families will complete additional surveys in  order to assess the system's
      actual or potential effects on patient/family-provider interactions, healthcare utilization
      and costs.
