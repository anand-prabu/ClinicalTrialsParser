  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to research a new type of test for cerebral palsy that can be
      performed earlier, at 10-15 weeks of age (after the due date for premature infants).  The
      test involves a standardized video recording of a baby's natural movements for about 10
      minutes.  The video recorded movements are evaluated by a special trained observer and also
      by a computer program.  There are some small studies from Europe that suggest that this type
      of evaluation may be accurate in early diagnosis of cerebral palsy.  However, the
      investigators do not know if this type of evaluation is reliable in large groups of infants,
      including infants from Children's Memorial Hospital, who tend to be sicker and have more
      complicated illnesses than many of the European infants.  The investigators would therefore
      like to evaluate whether this type of video recording could be used in the future for early
      diagnosis of cerebral palsy.
