  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that aspiration will be more prevalent at two to four hours
      post-extubation but will resolve in the majority of patients by 24 to 26 hours
      post-extubation.

      The purpose of the research is to investigate whether there is a difference in swallow
      function two to four hours after extubation (removal of breathing tube) compared to 24 hours
      after extubation. This information will help healthcare providers decide if it is necessary
      for people to wait 24 hours after extubation before they start eating and drinking.

    <description>Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallow (FEES - a measure of swallowing which will allow for the diagnosis of swallowing) will be recorded at between 2 to 4 hour after extubation. If penetration/aspiration is noted during the evaluation between 2 to 4 hours post-extubation, then a second FEES evaluation will be completed between 24 to 26 hours post-extubation.</description>
