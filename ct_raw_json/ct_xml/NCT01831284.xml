      The goal of this study is to learn how injection drug use may affect the immune system. One
      way to measure this is by looking at the blood and the gut, or gastrointestinal tract at the
      same time. It is thought that activating the immune system by injection drug use may
      increase destruction of immune cells in the gut. To test this theory, the investigators are
      enrolling HIV-negative injection drug users, HIV-negative people who do not use drugs and
      HIV-negative former injection drug users.

    <description>Detailed assessments of blood and GI tissue including measurements of HCV viremia in 1) active HIV-1-uninfected IDUs (N=48) 2) a cohort of individuals entering or in drug treatment programs who have stopped injecting for approximately 1 and 3 months (N=48), the majority of whom we anticipate will be infected with HCV; and 3) non-injecting controls (N=48). In addition to obtaining blood and tissue, we will collect behavioral data including injection and other drug use and sexual behaviors.</description>

    <description>This study will isolate specific cell populations from the peripheral blood as well as the GALT that mediate innate and adaptive immune responses. We will perform transcriptional profiling with the goal of identifying gene expression patterns of a-priori defined biological pathways and functional categories that associate with phenotypes of interest. Finally to complement and clarify the results of our in vivo studies, we will examine the in vitro effects of adding morphine and methadone and withdrawing opiates on T cell subsets of interest using a systems biology approach.</description>

        Group 1: HIV-uninfected, active IDU defined as a minimum of 3 injections of heroin per
        week (N=48)

        Group 2: Non-injecting controls defined as no lifetime use of injection drugs and no
        illicit non-injection opiate or cocaine for at least 3 years (N=48)

        Group 3: Former injectors of heroin with or without other agents will be recruited and
        followed longitudinally but if necessary cross-sectionally after approximately 1 month
        (N=48) and 3 months (N=48) from the time of last injection.

        All groups will be matched for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Groups 1 and 3 will be
        matched for Hepatitis C status and HCV RNA levels. Group 1 subjects will be studied twice;
        at baseline and after 1-2 months to assess stability of findings. Group 2 will be studied
        one time, and Group 3 will be studied at 1 month and 3 months after ceasing injection
        behavior.
