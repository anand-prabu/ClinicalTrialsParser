  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneously
      administered RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) as monotherapy or in combination with
      methotrexate or other non-biologic DMARDs in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and
      an inadequate response to non-biologic DMARDs or to one anti-TNF. In Phase 1, all patients
      will receive RoActemra/Actemra 162 mg subcutaneously (sc) weekly for Weeks 1 to 24, with or
      without methotrexate or other non-biologic DMARDs. For Part 2, patients who achieve
      sustained clinical DAS28-ESR remission at Weeks 20 and 24 will be randomized to receive
      RoActemra/Actemra 162 mg sc either weekly or every 2 weeks for Weeks 24 to 48, with or
      without methotrexate or other non-biologic DMARDs. Patients who do not achieve sustained
      clinical remission but achieve low disease activity (DAS-ESR &lt;/= 3.2) will continue the
      initial treatment of RoActemra/Actemra 162 mg sc weekly for Weeks 24 to 48, with or w!
      ithout methotrexate or other non-biologic DMARDs.
