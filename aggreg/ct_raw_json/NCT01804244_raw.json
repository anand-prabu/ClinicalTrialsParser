Participants who meet the\n      selection criteria will be admitted to the investigational institute on two days before the\n      dose (Day -2). All enrolled participants will receive orally (by mouth) a single dose of one\n      TMC278 25 mg tablet on Day 1 within 10 minutes after completion of the standardized\n      breakfast. Enrolled participants will remain in the investigational institute for the entire\n      duration of the inpatient phase. Participants will be discharged on Day 8 after the\n      completion of all required assessments. Blood samples for determination of plasma\n      concentrations of TMC278 will be collected over a period of 168 hours (7 days). The maximum\n      study duration for each participant is 45 days, including the screening phase, in-patient\n      period, and follow-up visit."
