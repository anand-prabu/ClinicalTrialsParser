  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A self- or parent-reported history of penicillin allergy excludes approximately 10% of the
      US population from receiving penicillin (Kerr 1994, Kagy, Blaiss 1998, Solensky et al. 2000,
      Neugut et al. 2001). Yet approximately 80% of patients labeled as allergic to the
      penicillins can safely take these antibiotics without fear of a life-threatening reaction
      (Gadde et al. 1993, Macy et al. 1997). The outcomes of this erroneous classification of
      patients include unnecessary denial of an effective and well-tolerated class of antibiotics,
      which are often the treatment of choice.

      The primary aim of skin testing with the Penicillin Skin Test Kit is to identify subjects at
      very low risk of developing acute IgE-dependent reactions when given a penicillin or
      cross-reacting drug. The negative predictive value (NPV) of skin testing is assessed by oral
      challenge with a penicillin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label investigation of skin testing with the Penicillin Skin
      Test Kit in subjects at least 2 years of age with a self-reported history of possible
      IgE-dependent penicillin hypersensitivity.

      At screening on Day 1, subjects and their parents/legal guardians (if applicable) will sign
      the informed consent form/ pediatric assent form. Following consent/assent, demographic
      information and medical history will be obtained, including prior and current medication
      use. Subjects will also be asked if they have had a respiratory infection in the past 2
      weeks or antibiotics within the past 4 weeks. A physical examination will be performed,
      along with measurements of vital signs and, in subjects &gt;5 years of age with active asthma,
      peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). A urine pregnancy test will be obtained for all female
      subjects of childbearing potential.

      The skin test procedure will first involve puncture testing. Skin test reagents will include
      the Penicillin Skin Test Kit, histamine (positive control), and sodium chloride (negative
      control). Subjects who have negative skin puncture test results to any of the drug antigens
      contained within the Penicillin Skin Test Kit will then undergo intradermal testing in
      duplicate. Subjects who have a positive reaction to one or more puncture or intradermal
      tests contained within the Penicillin Skin Test Kit will be discharged from the study.
      However, subjects with any positive skin test to drug antigens in the Penicillin Skin Test
      Kit will be asked to return for retesting (puncture and intradermal) in 4 weeks.

      Subjects who have negative puncture and intradermal test results will be given the oral
      amoxicillin challenge, which will be comprised of a single, full oral dose of amoxicillin.
      The purpose of the oral amoxicillin challenge is to confirm lack of allergy and confirm the
      NPV (Negative Predictive Value) of skin testing. Subjects will be monitored at the study
      site for 1 hour following oral amoxicillin challenge and then sent home. The study site will
      follow-up by telephone with all subjects (or their parents/legal guardians in the case of
      young children) â‰¥72 hours after administration of the oral amoxicillin challenge.

      Adverse events (AEs) will be recorded from administration of the Penicillin Skin Test
      throughout the 3-day study period as spontaneously reported by subjects or observed by the
      site staff.

      Two normal subjects (i.e., no history of penicillin allergy) will be skin tested at each
      site to provide data on skin test specificity.

    <description>Outcome Measure 1: Negative predictive value (NPV) time frame: up to 72 hours description: The primary endpoint is negative predictive value (NPV), which will be estimated as p = percentage of n history-positive subjects with negative skin tests from the Penicillin Allergy Skin Test Kit (as confirmed with an overall negative result for the Skin Puncture/Intradermal Testing) who do not experience an IgE-dependent hypersensitivity reaction within 72 hours of the oral amoxicillin challenge.
Outcome Measure 2: Reproducibility of skin test time frame: 4 weeks description: A test of reproducibility of skin test results will be performed using the Retest Population. It is expected that the results at 4 weeks will be identical or similar to initial results. Analyses will include comparing all individual skin test results that were positive at the initial testing with the results collected at the 4 week retest.</description>
