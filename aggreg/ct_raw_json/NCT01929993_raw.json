Although cone\n      biopsy is considered adequate for the treatment of endocervical dysplastic epithelium ,\n      using electrosurgery as opposed to the cold knife technique of cone biopsy has been\n      criticized because of the perceived potential for incomplete excision of disease, thermal\n      damage and surgical specimen fragmentation, which might increase the risk of missing early\n      invasive cancer. Also, incomplete excision margin of disease exposes women to an increased\n      risk of residual post-treatment disease.\n\n      The standard procedure, LLETZ - cone, is performed with a large loop electrode of 20-25 mm\n      depth.\n\n      The experimental intervention is SWETZ, a method of excision using a 1cm straight disposal\n      of 0.20 wire to remove the endocervical transformation zone or glandular disease.\n\n      Both procedures were previously studied in another clinical trial(NCT00995020), but the\n      histological analysis were inconclusive for many outcomes. SWETZ were superior to LLETZ cone\n      to acquire complete excision of disease, with no statistical significance, probably due to\n      the small sample size.\n\n      This study objectives a better histological analyses of the surgical specimens related to\n      incomplete excision, thermal damage and fragmentation."
