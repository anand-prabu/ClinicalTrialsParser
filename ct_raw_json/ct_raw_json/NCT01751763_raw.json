However, unintentionally, quite a proportion of\n      these \"radical resection\" actually turned out to be non-radical in nature. For these\n      patients who actually received non-radical resection, their by year survival rates were much\n      lower than those who received radical hepatectomy. In this prospective, non-interventional,\n      multi-center study, we are planning to observe the patient characteristics of Hepatocellular\n      carcinoma (HCC) patients who have residual disease after resection with curative intent, as\n      well as treatment pattern, safety and effectiveness of sorafenib for these patients."
