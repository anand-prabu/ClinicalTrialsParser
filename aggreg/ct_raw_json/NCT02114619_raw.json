Despite the long experience with\n      radioiodine for hyperthyroidism, controversy remains regarding the optimal dose of iodine\n      that is required to achieve long-term euthyroidism. The fixed activity administration method\n      does not optimize the therapy, giving often too high or too low radiation to the gland, but\n      the optimal dose per gram of thyroid mass in calculated activity administration method is\n      also under much debates. This prospective study has been designed in order to compare the\n      effect of different calculated doses of radioiodine on Graves' disease treatment outcome."
