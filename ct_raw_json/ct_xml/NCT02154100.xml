  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that the daily consumption of 480 ml tart cherry juice for
      twelve weeks will improve BP and arterial stiffness by improving endothelial-mediated
      vasodilation and vascular sympathetic activity and favorably altering biochemical markers
      associated with cardiovascular risk. 28 men and women between the ages of 20 and 40 who have
      three of the five features of MetS as defined by the ATP III will be included in the study.
      After a two-week run-in phase, eligible men and women will be randomly assigned to one of
      two treatment groups: 1) 480 ml tart cherry juice or 2) 480 ml control drink daily for
      twelve weeks. After an initial telephone screening, all participants will be requested to
      report to the study site for their first visit. On the first visit (screening), participants
      will be provided with verbal and written explanation of the project. They will then be asked
      to sign an informed consent form, followed by measuring waist circumference, resting
      brachial BP, fasting serum triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and glucose levels to confirm
      MetS. Baseline assessments will be performed for medical history, medication use, dietary
      intake, and physical activity. Qualified participants will be scheduled for their second
      visit two weeks later (actual baseline data collection) and randomly assigned to their
      treatment group. On the second (baseline) visit between the hours of 7-10 A.M., BP and
      vascular function will be measured followed by blood draw. Anthropometrics will be measured.
      Participants will be provided with their assigned treatment and will receive standard
      instructions on how to fill out daily diaries for their treatment, and for food and physical
      activity records. Blood pressure, vascular function, blood draw, and anthropometric, body
      composition, diet, and physical activity assessments will be repeated at 6- (third visit),
      and 12-week (final visit) intervals. All cardiovascular measurements will be performed
      between 7:00 to 10:00 A.M., in a quiet temperature-controlled room in the supine position
      after an overnight fast and 12 hours after the abstinence of caffeine and/or 24 hours after
      the last bout of moderate to heavy physical activity.
