    <description>The patients who had malignant biliary obstruction will be enrolled our study. Enrolled patient will be randomized to three group (uncovered double bare metallic stent (S&amp;G Biotech.) vs. uncovered single bare metallic stent (S&amp;G Biotech.) vs. uncovered single bare metallic stent (Taewoong Medical.)). After metallic biliary stent insertion, enrolled patients will be followed at least one time per one month. Blood test (including total bilirubin, gamma-GT) will be done for follow-up study. During follow-up period, if biliary obstruction is suspected, imaging study (CT or MRCP) will be done. With such follow-up tools, we compare 6-month patency rate and median patency duration among three groups.</description>
