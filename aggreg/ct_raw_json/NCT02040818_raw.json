There are several management options for treatment\n      of such an infection, though the best option is not clearly delineated. Standard of care\n      options include exchanging the catheter for a new one over a guide-wire and instilling a\n      high concentration of an antibiotic directly into the catheter lumen. The investigators are\n      planning to treat hemodialysis catheter bloodstream infections by one of two strategies: 1.\n      Use of a novel antibiotic lock solution Or 2. Changing out the infected catheter for a new\n      one. Both these options have comparable cure rates as shown in the medical literature. After\n      obtaining informed consent, patients will be randomized to either treatment arm and will\n      continue to receive all other standard medical care.\n\n      Specific Aim: To conduct a randomized clinical trial to demonstrate that the use of a novel\n      antibiotic lock solution (consisting of N-acetylcysteine, tigecycline and heparin) is\n      non-inferior to guide-wire exchange in the treatment of hemodialysis catheter-related\n      bacteremia."
