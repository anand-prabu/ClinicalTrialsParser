Patients are stratified by\n      pubertal status.\n\n      There is a 7- to 14-day washout with a placebo prior to treatment for all patients.\n\n      The first group receives oral guanfacine 3 times a day for 8 weeks.  The dose is gradually\n      increased to minimize sedation; by day 14, most patients are stabilized and the dose is then\n      increased as clinically indicated and tolerated.\n\n      The second group receives a placebo 3 times a day for 8 weeks. Patients in either group may\n      be treated with guanfacine for an additional 8 weeks."
