  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the efficacy of
      zinc supplementation vs. placebo among 250 HIV-infected Russians from the Russia ARCH
      Cohort, who are ART-naive at enrollment and have a recent history of heavy drinking.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination of heavy alcohol consumption and HIV infection is associated with increased
      mortality, HIV disease progression, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and a proinflammatory
      state characterized by increased biomarker levels of inflammation. Heavy alcohol use and HIV
      infection are both causes of microbial translocation, the process by which bacterial
      products from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract leak across the GI membrane to the portal
      circulation. Microbial translocation causes immune activation leading to end organ damage.
      Alcohol can cause microbial translocation via zinc deficiency. Zinc deficiency is common
      among HIV-infected heavy drinkers and linked to high mortality rates. Zinc supplementation
      is affordable, available, does not interfere with ART, and has minimal adverse drug
      reactions. In animal models zinc reduces ethanol associated microbial translocation. In
      human studies zinc slows HIV disease progression and reduces levels of inflammatory
      biomarkers which are strongly linked to mortality. Given zinc's potential efficacy we
      propose to conduct Zinc for INflammation and Chronic disease in HIV (ZINC HIV), a
      double-blinded randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of zinc supplementation
      vs. placebo among 250 HIV+ Russians, who are ART-naive at enrollment and have a recent
      history of heavy drinking. We will recruit most of our participants from the Russia cohort
      within the Uganda Russia Boston Alcohol Network for Alcohol Research Collaboration on
      HIV/AIDS (URBAN ARCH) Consortium study. Our specific aims will test the efficacy of zinc
      supplementation, compared to placebo to (1) improve markers of mortality as measured by the
      VACS index; (2) slow HIV disease progression as measured by CD4 cell count; (3) improve
      markers of AMI risk as measured by the Reynolds risk score; and (4) lower levels of
      microbial translocation and inflammation as measured by serum biomarkers. We hypothesize
      that as compared with placebo, patients receiving zinc supplementation will have
      significantly lower AMI and mortality risk as measured by the VACS index and Reynolds risk
      scores; higher CD4 cell counts; lower levels of biomarkers for microbial translocation and
      inflammation. Importantly, if our hypotheses are true, zinc supplementation could ultimately
      become a standard adjunctive therapy complementing alcohol interventions among HIV-infected
      persons even in resource limited environments. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The combination of
      heavy alcohol consumption and HIV infection results in serious health problems and an
      increased risk of death. Although it is not exactly clear how alcohol and HIV do this,
      inflammation appears to play an important role. Zinc supplementation has anti-inflammatory
      properties. This study is designed to see if giving zinc supplementation to HIV infected
      people who are heavy drinkers reduces the risk of serious health problems and death.
