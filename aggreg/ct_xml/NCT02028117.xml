    <textblock>
      This study is a phase I/II open label clinical study in patients with platinum-resistant
      epithelial ovarian cancer. The Phase I part of the study will determine the dose of ColoAd1
      to be recommended for further studies and will examine primarily the safety and tolerability
      but also the pharmacokinetics of administering ColoAd1 intraperitoneally. Once the dose of
      IP ColoAd1 to be used in combination with IV weekly paclitaxel has been determined, the
      phase II stage will begin as an open label dose expansion of that regimen. The phase II
      stage aims to determine whether intraperitoneal ColoAd1 has a risk benefit profile that
      supports further investigation in the treatment of patients with platinum-resistant
      epithelial ovarian Cancer.
