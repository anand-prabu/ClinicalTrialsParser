IOERT is performed on a mobile self-shielded magnetron-driven X-band linear accelerator specifically developed for use in the operating room. This machine produces megavoltage electron beams of energy ranging between 4 and 12 MeV. The radiation is delivered from the device to the tumor bed through an attached applicator. A single dose of 21 Gy calculated to the 90% depth posterior to the tumor bed will be administered and will last approximately 2.5 minutes."
