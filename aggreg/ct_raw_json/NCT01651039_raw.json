The safety of this combination of drugs will\n      also be studied.  Your physical state, changes in the state of your multiple myeloma, and\n      laboratory findings taken while on-study will help us decide if panobinostat combined with\n      dexamethasone and lenalidomide is safe and effective.\n\n      This goal of this study therefore is to determine the activity of the combination of\n      panobinostat thrice weekly every other week, lenalidomide, and weekly dexamethasone in a\n      similar group of subjects. The doses of lenalidomide and dexamethasone will be that which is\n      approved by the FDA for multiple myeloma and you will take each drug at a specific frequency\n      over a 4 week (28 day) period. This period is called a \"study cycle\"."

Panobinostat\n      has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and thus is considered\n      an experimental drug in this research study.  Panobinostat is not available to you \"on the\n      market\" (available for you to buy).  It is only available in clinical trials for patients\n      like you with your medical condition. Panobinostat is a drug that may slow down the growth\n      of multiple myeloma or kill multiple myeloma cells by blocking certain enzymes (proteins\n      produced by cells). Panobinostat has shown effects against cancers such as multiple myeloma\n      in laboratory studies and in studies using animals; however, it is not known if this\n      medicine will show the same activity in humans. As of 31st December 2009, a total of 1116\n      patients have already received treatment with panobinostat.\n\n      Unlike panobinostat, lenalidomide (Revlimid\u00a9) and dexamethasone are approved by the FDA and\n      are already available for purchase on the US market. Clinical trials have shown that\n      lenalidomide, especially taken with dexamethasone, produces positive clinical responses with\n      manageable side effects when given to subjects with multiple myeloma.\n\n      In this study, subjects will take panobinostat capsules, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone all\n      orally. The purpose of this combination is to interfere with the cancerous cells in multiple\n      and different ways as each of these drugs acts differently on cancer cells. By combining the\n      drugs and giving them at the same time, it might be possible to slow the progression of your\n      disease, rather than if study drugs were given separately. Researchers have combined\n      laboratory studies on animals with this drug combination and the combined effect has been\n      shown to be worthwhile to justify clinical trials in humans."
