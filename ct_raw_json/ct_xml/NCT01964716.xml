    <textblock>
      This study will compare the immune responses of the infants who have been given 13vPnC in
      the mutidose vial formulation to the immune reponses of the infants who have been given
      13vPnC in the single-dose syringe formulation.

      It will also evaluate the safety of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13vPnC) in all
      infants who are vaccinated.
