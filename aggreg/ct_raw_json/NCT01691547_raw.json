Study drug will\n      be delivered through a novel single-step activation dry powder inhaler (NDPI) which has a\n      two strip configuration. The NDPI will be configured with different combinations of each\n      compound and also a new blend of UMEC/VI inhalation powder within a single strip of the NDPI\n      device. Study drug will be administered through the inhaled route to healthy subjects in\n      single doses (four inhalations). Each subject will receive treatment in a randomized order\n      Treatment A FF (400 microgram [\u00b5g]) and UMEC (500 \u00b5g)/VI (100 \u00b5g), Treatment B UMEC (500 \u00b5g)\n      and VI (100 \u00b5g), Treatment C FF (400 \u00b5g) and VI (100 \u00b5g) and Treatment D FF (400 \u00b5g) and\n      UMEC (500 \u00b5g) over four treatment periods. Each treatment period will be separated by a\n      washout of 7 to 21 days. After the four treatment periods, a follow up visit will take place\n      7 to 21 days following the final dose of study medication and the maximum duration a subject\n      will be involved in the study is eighteen weeks.\n\n      Pharmacokinetics will be assessed by the measurement of plasma and urine concentrations of\n      FF, UMEC and VI. Safety and PD will be monitored using blood glucose, serum potassium, heart\n      rate, 12-lead ECGs and clinical laboratory tests. Plasma samples for PK will be collected\n      throughout the study, urine, blood glucose, serum potassium, heart rate, 12-lead ECGs and\n      clinical laboratory tests will be assessed on Day 1 only. AEs will be assessed throughout\n      the study."
