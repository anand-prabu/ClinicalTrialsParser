Electroporation therapy may enhance the ability of chemotherapy\n      drugs to enter tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy with electroporation therapy may kill\n      more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of electroporation therapy and bleomycin\n      in treating patients who have locally advanced pancreatic cancer."

Determine the overall and\n      progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive bleomycin intratumorally during laparotomy. Approximately 15\n      minutes after the intratumoral injection, patients receive bleomycin IV over 10 minutes.\n      Approximately 5 minutes after the IV injection, patients undergo electroporation therapy\n      comprising electrical pulses directly to the pancreas and surrounding tissues. Patients are\n      followed weekly for 4-6 weeks and then every 2 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
