Subjects have often symptoms like\n      palpitation and discomfort but especially in elderly population there's significant quantity\n      of persons who don't feel any symptoms and fail to seek for medical care for stroke\n      prevention.\n\n      The main objectives in this study are to find out the prevalence of AF in the elderly\n      population of Lieto, to assess the feasibility and reability of patient education on feeling\n      one's pulse irregularity and the affect to the quality of life of the participating subjects\n      and monitoring the possible increased burden to the public health care system.\n\n      The study contains two office visits with specified learning session and long-term\n      phone-call follow-up."

During\n      followup visits the compliance of the patient and possible new arrhythmias plus quality of\n      life issues are recorded and their ability of pulse palpation is evaluated by artificial\n      hand where various kinds of pulses are transmitted."
