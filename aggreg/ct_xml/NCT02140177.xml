      Background:

      - Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death for U.S. adults. Medically ill people are at an
      increased risk of suicide. Most people who have killed themselves went to a healthcare
      provider within 3 months of their death. More and more, hospitals are being asked to assess
      people for signs of suicide risk so that they can get the help they need. If nurses and
      doctors can find out who is at risk they can make sure these people get help in the
      hospital.

      The asQ   em (Ask Suicide-Screening Questions to Everyone in Medical Settings) is a brief
      questionnaire. It was created to detect suicidal thoughts and behaviors in hospitalized
      people. Researchers would like to further develop this tool and figure out which are the
      best questions to ask patients.

      Objective:

      - To determine the best questions for healthcare providers to ask people with medical
      illnesses to see if they are having suicidal thoughts or planning to hurt themselves.

      Eligibility:

      - NIH Clinical Center patients over age 18.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be asked questions about how they have been feeling in the past few
           weeks. They will be asked questions about depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts
           and behaviors. They also will be asked some background questions.

        -  It will take approximately 15 to 30 minutes to answer the questions.

      This study will initially be comprised of medically ill inpatients at the NIH CC. We plan to
      expand the study to two other sites: the University of North Carolina   s North Carolina
      Cancer Hospital (UNC) and Rhode Island Hospital (RIH). The total sample size will be 540
      (180 per site). We will administer several short measures of suicide risk: the 20 asQ   em
      (Ask Suicide-Screening Questions to Everyone in Medical Settings) candidate items; a
      criterion standard Adult Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire (ASIQ); two questions which assess
      for suicidal behavior from a second criterion standard, the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation
      (BSI); a brief depression screen, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9); and an
      exploratory variable questionnaire, to all eligible inpatients aged 18 years and older. The
      ultimate goal of this project is the development of a validated risk of suicide screening
      instrument that can be administered rapidly by non-mental health clinicians to medical
      inpatients and in turn, connecting those in need with mental health services. Future studies
      will focus on examining the practical implications of nurses administering the asQ   em as
      standard of care during the admission process on a medical inpatient unit and validating the
      asQ   em in non-English speaking patients, addressing a critical gap in suicide prevention
      research. In addition, examining the long-term clinical impact of screening general medical
      patients for suicide risk with the asQ   em and linking those in need with mental health
      services and/or other interventions will be important next steps.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All adult medical inpatients, ages 18 and older, who are admitted to selected medical
        units during data collection weeks will be approached for enrollment. Patients will be
        included if:

          1. they are admitted as an inpatient on the designated medical units;

          2. they are 18 and older;

          3. they are capable of providing consent;

        5) they have not previously been enrolled in this study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients will be excluded if:

          1. they are medically or cognitively unable to participate in the screening or
             assessment (e.g., sustained altered level of consciousness, psychosis, hostile
             behavior, unremitting distress, intubation, persistent vomiting, severe pain, acute
             or worsening medical acuity);

          2. they have been already enrolled during a previous visit;

          3. they are unwilling to provide consent;

          4. the patient is non-English speaking (because ASIQ has not been validated in languages
             other than English).
