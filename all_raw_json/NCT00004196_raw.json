Patients in the randomized portions of\n      Protocols A and B are stratified according to tumor thickness (1-2 mm vs 3-4 mm vs greater\n      than 4 mm) and tumor ulceration (yes vs no).\n\n      All patients undergo wide local tumor excision with lymphatic mapping and sentinel node\n      biopsy. Patients with tumors with ambiguous drainage patterns undergo lymphoscintigraphy\n      prior to tumor excision. Patients with evidence of metastatic melanoma in the sentinel\n      node(s) by routine histology, serial sectioning, or immunohistochemistry and who have\n      undergone a prior regional lymph node dissection proceed to protocol A.\n\n        -  Protocol A: Patients with metastasis in a single sentinel node with no evidence of\n           extracapsular extension and no metastatic disease in nonsentinel nodes are randomized\n           to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n             -  Arm I: Patients receive adjuvant high-dose interferon alfa-2b IV 5 days a week for\n                4 weeks, then subcutaneously 3 times a week for 48 weeks.\n\n             -  Arm II: Patients undergo observation. Patients with metastases in more than one\n                sentinel node with evidence of extracapsular extension or metastasis in any\n                nonsentinel node receive adjuvant high-dose interferon alfa-2b as in arm I.\n\n      Patients with no evidence of sentinel node(s) metastases by routine histology, serial\n      sectioning, and immunohistochemistry and are negative by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\n      analysis are observed.\n\n        -  Protocol B: Patients with positive sentinel node(s) by PCR analysis are randomized to\n           one of three treatment arms.\n\n             -  Arm I: Patients undergo observation.\n\n             -  Arm II: Patients undergo lymph node dissection.\n\n             -  Arm III: Patients undergo lymph node dissection followed by adjuvant high-dose\n                interferon alfa-2b IV 5 days a week for 4 weeks.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months\n      for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3,000 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years."
