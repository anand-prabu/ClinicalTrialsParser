  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether two different embolisation techniques are
      equally  effective, or is there any difference between the two techniques in the treatment
      of the uterine fibroid  controlled with MR examination. Diffusion weighted  MR imaging
      before intervention and  3 months and 12 months after interventions will be analyse as
      potential predictor  of volumetric response after embolization.

      Another purpose  is to determine long-term follow up in all patient treated in period from
      2001-2011 in OUH  analysed retrospectively.

      60 patients randomise in the two groups each group consist of the 30 patients. Group 1: 30
      patients treat with Bead-block  microparticles, 700-900µm until flowstop ( &quot; cut the  tree&quot;
      appearance) .

      Group 2: 30 patient treat with  Bead-block microparticles, combinations of the  1ml -500-700
      µm particle, if a.uterine is  &lt; 3 mm,  follow by  700-900 µm particle until blood flowstop
      or  with 2 ml -500-700 µm particle if arteria uterine has diameter of &gt; 3 mm follow by
      embolisation with  700-900 µm particle until blood flowstop ( &quot; cut the  tree&quot; appearance ).

      Clinical and technical success as well as clinical  and radiological follow up after 3 and
      12 months. MR of the pelvis  examination with contrast, 3 and 12 month after intervention to
      define and  control infraction degree.

      Diffusion weighted imaging- DWI for and after intervention with main goal to examine
      eventually potential of DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient  as predictor of volumetric
      response of uterine fibroid  in a prospective group.

      Retrospective study compromised all patient treated between January  2001 until january 2011
      with follow up to January 2014,  and re-intervention  as well as complications rate
      analysis.

    <description>Comparison between the two techniques. First group will be treated only with microparticles 700- 900  until flowstop and second group depends on diameter of the uterine artery with combinations of 500-700 + 700-900 microparticles. If arteria uterine is &gt; 3mm in diameter  combination of 2ml 500-700 and 700-900 particles until flowstop will be used and if arteria uterine has diameter &lt; 3 mm combination of 1 ml 500-700 + 700-900 microparticles until flow stop will be used.</description>
