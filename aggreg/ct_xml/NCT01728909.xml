    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of intranasal oxytocin administration on
      social cognition in patients receiving methadone maintenance treatment (MMT), examine the
      effects of intranasal oxytocin administration on opioid craving and on the subjective
      effects of methadone, and examine the effects of intranasal oxytocin administration on
      implicit preferences for drug-related and social stimuli in patients receiving MMT.

      Hypotheses 1: Patients will perform better on measures of social cognition (including affect
      recognition and recognition of sarcasm) after administration of oxytocin compared with
      placebo.

      Hypothesis 2: Patients will demonstrate lower craving for opioids and greater subjective
      effects of methadone after administration of oxytocin compared with placebo.

      Hypothesis 3: Patients will demonstrate increased implicit preferences for social stimuli
      and decreased implicit preferences for drug related stimuli after administration of oxytocin
      compared with placebo.

    <description>Participants will undergo computer tasks that measure social cognition, which include the TASIT, RMET, and  the IAT. The  TASIT measures the awareness of social inference, the RMET measures the ability to guess the emotions of others, and the IAT measures implicit associations.</description>
