Our long-term goal is to test\n      resveratrol for the secondary prevention of gestational diabetes and type 2 diabetes.  We\n      have developed six conditions that should be satisfied by the study to justify project\n      expansion.  Therefore, we will be testing hypotheses and computing estimates for the\n      following six outcomes: (1) recruitment numbers, (2) adherence to study treatment, (3)\n      adherence to study visits, (4) insulin sensitivity measured at 12 months post-partum, (5)\n      beta cell function measured at 12 months post-partum, and (6) adverse events.\n\n      The study is a single-site, parallel, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.\n      The study population consists of women recruited during pregnancy who had a confirmed first\n      diagnosis of gestational diabetes, who do not have either diabetes or pre-diabetes when\n      re-tested 3 months post-partum, and who have stopped breastfeeding by 9 months post-partum.\n      They study intervention is resveratrol (or identical placebo) twice daily for a total of 12\n      weeks from 9 months to 12 months post-partum.  Our planned sample size is 112 women based on\n      the hypothesis testing and estimation considerations for the six above-mentioned outcomes."
