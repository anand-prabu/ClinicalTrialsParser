            "textblock": "This is an open label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single arm study\n      to assess the efficacy and safety of TTS-fentanyl in Thai participants with chronic\n      non-malignant pain (except for headaches or central spinal cord mediated pain). The study\n      will consist of 2 phases: stabilization phase (up to 7 days before starting the treatment)\n      and treatment phase (30 days). The first patch will be applied by Investigator then by\n      participants themselves until 30 days. All participants will start the treatment with patch\n      releasing 25 micrograms per hour (mcg/h) of fentanyl . The patches will be replaced every 3\n      days. On Day 3, and every 3 days thereafter, the TTS-fentanyl dose can be titrated (slow\n      increase in drug dosage, guided by participant's responses) as per participant's need. The\n      duration of the treatment will be 30 days after first patch application. The dose of\n      TTS-fentanyl can be slowly increased if needed, by 25 mcg/h to achieve adequate pain\n      control. No increase in TTS-fentanyl dose will be performed within the 72-hour dosing\n      interval. Participants will be allowed the use of oral morphine syrup for the duration of\n      TTS-fentanyl treatment to enable appropriate TTS-fentanyl dose titration. Primary efficacy\n      assessment will be pain control rated by participants. Assessment time points will be Day 0\n      (Baseline), Day 15 and Day 30 (trial end). At the end of study, global preference on\n      efficacy, side effects and overall satisfaction will also be rated by Investigator and\n      participants. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study."
