  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PCOS is a common endocrinopathy affecting 5-10% of women in their reproductive age
      characterized by hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation and polycystic ovaries. This syndrome
      is a serious problem in IVF since there is a high risk of developing ovarian
      hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) during ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins. The
      introduction of GnRH antagonist in IVF has reduced the incidence of severe OHSS, still
      maintaining a good ovarian response and pregnancy rate. Recently, a long acting GnRH
      antagonist, Degarelix, was introduced for prostatic cancer treatment. Furthermore a recent
      paper reported its use also for the induction of multiple follicular growth in a program of
      oocyte donation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of GnRH antagonist
      depot use in a protocol of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in PCOS women at risk of
      developing OHSS in IVF cycles.
