Previous studies have shown that the cardiac output varies\n      widely even among professional helpers. This is especially due to some very different mean\n      frequencies of cardiac compression wich vary from 60 to 160/min for paramedics. Aim of this\n      study is to investigate whether the use of feedback-devices during cardiac-pulmonary\n      resuscitation (CPR) can lead to an improvement of the cardiac output and may improve\n      survival.\n\n      For this, we examine the impact of different feedback-methods on the frequence-variety on\n      manikin by lay rescuers. Overall, we compare three different devices for feedback during\n      CPR. The subjects for this study are lay rescuers who perform a 5 minute\n      chest-compression-only CPR."
