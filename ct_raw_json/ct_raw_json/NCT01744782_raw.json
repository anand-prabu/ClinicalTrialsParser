            "textblock": "This is a long-term, open-label study of the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of RP103\n      in cystinosis patients who are na\u00efve to any form of cysteamine treatment.  Subjects will\n      receive RP103 treatment for at least 12 months and will continue to participate in the study\n      and receive RP103, until it is available through the appropriate marketing approval (In the\n      US, following FDA approval; In Brazil, once it is a regularly registered medication and\n      available at no personal cost), or a subject withdraws or is withdrawn from the study, or\n      the Sponsor terminates development of RP103 for cystinosis.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to gather information about the safety and effectiveness (how\n      well it works to treat cystinosis) of a new drug called RP103.\n\n      In cystinosis, the body builds up cystine.  When taken regularly, the active ingredient of\n      an older, already approved drug called Cystagon\u00ae (cysteamine bitartrate) reduces cystine in\n      the body.  RP103 has the same active ingredient as Cystagon\u00ae and is designed to reduce\n      cystine in a similar way that Cystagon\u00ae does.  RP103 is also different from Cystagon\u00ae:\n      Instead of the cysteamine bitartrate being absorbed from the stomach, RP103 is designed to\n      be absorbed from the small intestine.  This may make the effects of the drug last longer, so\n      that it can be taken twice a day instead of four times a day like Cystagon\u00ae.\n\n      To decide if RP103 is effective, the study will look at two types of blood tests.  One test\n      is pharmacodynamics (PD), which measures the amount of white blood cell (WBC) cystine after\n      taking study drug.  WBC cystine is a laboratory test used to find out if cysteamine\n      bitartrate is reducing cystine levels in the body.  The second test is pharmacokinetics\n      (PK), which measures the amount of cysteamine in the blood after taking the drug."
