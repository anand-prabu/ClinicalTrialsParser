The new YOFiMeter\n      is similar to other glucometers with the exception of built in test cassettes, lancet\n      cassettes with enhanced communications and data reviewing options.\n\n      This evaluation will also collect data from a YSI 2300 Stat Plus Glucose Analyzer reference\n      glucometer.

A trained technician will\n      perform a fingerstick on the subject immediately after and perform the test on the same\n      device. Separate results will be recorded by subject and technician. A trained technician\n      will take another blood sample, within as short of a time as practicable, for a glucose\n      assay on the YSI 2300 Stat Plus Glucose Analyzer."
