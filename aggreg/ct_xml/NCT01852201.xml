  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this randomized trial is to determine the safety and efficacy of
      intra-arterial reperfusion in Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) patients ineligible for IV-tPA as
      selected by physiologic imaging criteria.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration has been shown to be safe
      and effective for treatment of AIS within 3 hours of symptom onset, and newer evidence has
      shown potential benefit out to 4.5 hours.  IAT for AIS patients has been shown in clinical
      trials to be safe up to 8 hours after symptom onset.  The rapid progression of IAT devices
      over the last several years has resulted in faster recanalization times while maintaining a
      high degree of safety.  This has resulted in improved patient outcomes, similar to prior
      randomized trial data showing improved outcomes over medical therapy or earlier devices.
      Data from the MERCI trial suggests that patients &gt; 85 as well as those with a baseline NIHSS
      score &gt; 30 are unlikely to benefit from embolectomy. Patients with rapidly improving
      neurologic deficits likely will have an excellent recovery with conventional care,
      precluding the ability to detect a beneficial treatment effect of embolectomy.

      Pilot data incorporating physiologic imaging has shown that appropriate patients can be
      selected for IAT.  This selection methodology has shown the ability to maintain the same
      level of safety and efficacy as those patients treated in the highly selective environment
      of a clinical trial, despite presenting far beyond accepted time based standards.
      Vertebrobasilar occlusion patients are excluded to maintain a homogenous study population,
      particularly since no data currently is available addressing the comparability of imaging
      penumbral patterns in the anterior vs. posterior circulation.  This has also been shown to
      be reproducible at multiple centers and with different imaging modalities. However, all
      prospective interventional stroke studies performed to date have been restricted by the 8
      hour time window.  Currently there are no active studies assessing the safety and efficacy
      of IAT for patients presenting outside of the IV-tPA selection window when selected by
      physiologic imaging.

      The primary aim of acute ischemic stroke treatment is restoring a patient that is severely
      neurologically impaired due to a blockage of a major brain blood vessel back to their
      previous functional status. Identification and selection of appropriate patients is always
      paramount to good clinical outcomes.  Evidence supports the safety of IAT for patients
      presenting with AIS within 8 hours.  Pilot data support IAT in some patients after 8 hours
      based on selection using physiological perfusion imaging.

      The purpose of this randomized trial is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of mechanical
      thrombectomy over medical therapy (MT) for treating acute ischemic stroke patients
      ineligible for IV-tPA with persistent symptoms within a 12 hour time window from symptom
      onset as selected by physiologic perfusion imaging criteria.
