            "textblock": "Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) is a worldwide leading and still increasing cause of\n      chronic morbidity and mortality. It was estimated that 8.2% of adults population had the\n      disease. Its mortality rate was doubled at 2002 than that of 1970 according to the data from\n      America. COPD is the 4th leading cause of death worldwide. The earlier prediction and then\n      earlier intervention of COPD will be one of the major tasks of pulmonary medicine in the\n      21st Century.\n\n      The important issue of COPD is its delayed diagnosis. Previous studies have found that\n      accelerated loss of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1.0) in an individual is\n      considered an indicator of developing COPD. The rapid decline in spirometry among geriatric\n      population is one of the characteristics of COPD, and usually before the appearance of\n      symptoms. Therefore functional test is still the only objective methods for diagnosis of\n      COPD and guide its prevention and treatment in clinical practice. This functional predictive\n      system, due to lower sensitivity, is very difficult to discover high-risk population and\n      earlier stage of the disease. As ventilation dysfunction appears, the patient's\n      pathophysiologic change would not be reversable completely. It is urgent to search sensitive\n      and specific biomarkers correlating with the decline of pulmonary function and the\n      occurrence of COPD in large-scale prospective epidemiological studies. The core\n      pathophysiologic process of COPD is abnormal inflammatory response of the airway and lungs\n      to the toxic particles or gases. The inflammation occurs earlier than the lung function\n      impairment. Therefore, early detection of the inflammation may theoretically predict the\n      occurrence of COPD and thus may guide early intervention. It is rational to establish a\n      completely new predicting system basing on early inflammation discovery rather than only on\n      function test. Then it is more convenient for large-scale population screening for COPD, and\n      can even be used as high-risk groups of the periodic medical examination project. So as to\n      achieve early intervention to prevent disease progression and improve quality of life, it is\n      crucial to do some research to find out the sensitive and specific biomarkers correlating to\n      accelerating FEV1.0 decline in Chinese population. It will be helpful to establish the early\n      warning model of COPD among Chinese and thus to improve the ealy diagnosis and intervention\n      of COPD. The predicting system may be with great value to prevent the development of the\n      disease, improve the quality of life, reduce its burden and decrease its mortality rate.\n\n      Proteomics techniques and protein chip techniques provides us high throughput screening\n      method to figure out characteristic inflammatory or metabolic markers of a diseases. It can\n      be used for searching the biomarkers relating to lung function loss. EBC is collected from\n      exhaled gas and is a good non-invasive method for exploring the pathologic process of the\n      airways.\n\n      Thus we designed this study.
