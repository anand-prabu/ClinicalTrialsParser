Determine the PSA response, duration of PSA response, disease free survival,\n      median survival, and overall survival in patients with chemotherapy naive hormone refractory\n      adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide with sequential\n      docetaxel. II. Assess for any improvement in pain over time in patients treated with this\n      regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 3-5 minutes and\n      cyclophosphamide IV on days 1, 22, 43, and 64, and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 85, 106,\n      and 127 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients receive\n      filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy\n      infusions and continuing until blood counts recover. G-CSF must be discontinued at least 24\n      hours prior to starting subsequent chemotherapy infusions. Pain and analgesic use are\n      assessed before study, every 3 weeks during study, after completion of study, and then at 3\n      months after completion of study. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6\n      months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 42-105 patients will be accrued for this study over 18\n      months."
