            "textblock": "Acromegaly is a rare disease usually caused by a benign growth hormone (GH) producing\n      pituitary adenoma. In case of inadequate disease control, the condition is associated with\n      significant morbidity and approximately a doubling  of mortality compared to the background\n      population. Medical treatment with somatostatin analogues (SA) has been employed for about\n      20 years and is a well-established treatment in cases where surgery is impossible or\n      inadequate. The treatment with SA still leaves some questions unanswered. Firstly, SA\n      treatment often results in a concomitant suppression of the insulin secretion, which might\n      lead to clinically significant glucose intolerance. Secondly, the traditional evaluation of\n      disease activity by measuring circulating levels of GH and total IGF-I is not reliable\n      enough\n\n      Hypotheses: Treatment of acromegaly with SA versus surgery alone is associated with:\n\n        -  Glucose intolerance despite normalized insulin sensitivity\n\n        -  Modified peripheral GH activity in peripheral target organs assessed on molecular\n           endpoints"
