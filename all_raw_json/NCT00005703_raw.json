            "textblock": "BACKGROUND:\n\n      Investigations into hemostatic abnormalities associated with sickle cell disease have been\n      numerous. The data suggested that thrombin generation and fibrin formation were increased\n      during steady state, with conflicting data whether further activation occurred in\n      vaso-occlusive crisis. Platelet activation during VOC occurred, with variable findings\n      during steady state. A selective, concomitant evaluation of the hemostatic pathways i.e.\n      intrinsic, tissue factor (TF) or extrinsic activation, fibrinolysis, and\n      platelet-endothelial activation had not been reported. Neither had a longitudinal evaluation\n      been performed in infants during the unique transition period when HbF levels fall from 70\n      to 80 percent to less than 10 percent.\n\n      The study was part of an initiative on \"Coagulation, Platelets and Thrombosis in Sickle\n      Disease Pathophysiology\".  The Request for Applications was released in October 1994.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      The studies used appropriate 'negative' and 'positive' control groups. Studies included\n      intrinsic markers [kininogen profiling, high molecular weight kininogen (HK) and low\n      molecular weight kininogen (LK) cleavages, western blotting of HK and LK, and\n      kallikrein-alpha2 macroglobulin; extrinsic markers [TF and factor V11a]; other activation\n      and fibrinolytic markers [prothrombin F1.2, FPA, TAT, tPA, PAI-I, D-dimer and plasma alpha2\n      antiplasmin]; platelet- endothelial markers [evaluation of activation dependent epitopes].\n      Unequivocal demonstration of contact pathway activation during VOC  provided a crucial link\n      between VOC and its accompanying phenomenon including pain, and inflammation. Finally, the\n      studies provided a unique perspective on the continuum of hemostatic changes that unfolded\n      during the course of SCD, and those that developed as vascular insufficiencies supervened in\n      the adult."
