The minimum follow-up of patients is 6 months after\n      transplantation.\n\n      The first 5 patients (group 0) will receive haploidentical transplantation of hematopoietic\n      progenitors without subsequent infusion of allo-depleted lymphocytes and then in cohorts of\n      3 patients, infuse +4 post-transplant day at doses of: 1x105 cluster of differentiation 3\n      (CD3)/kg(group 1), 3x105 CD3/kg (group 2), 5x105 CD3 / kg (group 3), 1x106 CD3/kg (group 4)\n      and 3x106 CD3/kg (group 5).\n\n      Donor: it is performed one leukapheresis at least 30 days (4 weeks) prior to the scheduled\n      progenitors infusion (day 0), in order to obtain effector T cells."
