The first session will be used to introduce the concept of acceptance and its possible benefits in the context of life values and patient-identified barriers to care engagement.  Following a discussion of life values will be a discussion of which, if any, of these values are currently misaligned with the participant's HIV self-care. At the second session, acceptance-based coping skills will be practiced and a behavioral plan will be developed to targets barriers identified in the first session. These discussions will help the participant clarify how best to align their values with decisions on how to manage his/her HIV (e.g. when and how to disclose, what to expect at appointments)."

This project will develop a novel\n      treatment, brief acceptance-based behavior therapy (ABBT), to promote self-acceptance of HIV\n      status as a pathway to reducing engagement barriers.  The clinical and public health impact\n      of this project will be the development of a simple, low-cost, disseminable intervention\n      that enhances longitudinal commitment to care so PLWHA can obtain effective medical\n      treatments that will prolong survival and improve quality of life. We hypothesize that\n      individuals randomized to brief ABBT will showed increased longitudinal attendance of\n      primary care appointments."
