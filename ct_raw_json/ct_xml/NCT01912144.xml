  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phenolic acids are naturally-occurring constituents of plant-derived foods and beverages and
      are characterised by a phenol ring in their structure. The phenolic compounds we are going
      to focus on in this study are the Chlorogenic acids (CGAs), a family of esters conjugates
      formed between a Hydroxycinnamic acid and quinic acid (1) and that show a strong antioxidant
      activity (2).

      HCAs represent about 50% of the total polyphenolic coumpounds intake in a typical UK diet
      (3) and for people who drink it, coffee is a/the major dietary source of/for HCAs (4). A few
      studies suggest protective effects for cardiovascular diseases (5), neurodegenerative
      diseases, type 2 diabetis and liver and kidneys cancer risk. However, many data in the field
      are obtained from in vitro and/or in animal, and it is difficult and dangerous to
      extrapolate between these and risk in humans of development or progression of particular
      health conditions, more human studies are therefore needed.

      We aim to compare people that metabolise the best CGAs from coffee to those that metabolise
      them the least well. This will be achieved by measuring the metabolites in urine. The effect
      of CGAs on the human body does not only depend on the amount ingested, but also on the
      quality of the metabolism, we therefore also want to determine which mechanisms are
      responsible for inter-individual variations in order to identify any link with health
      biomarkers, these including non-cellular inflammation and cardiovascular risk indicators.

      For this cohort study funded by the University of Leeds, approximately 60 healthy volunteers
      will be recruited at the School of Food Science &amp; Nutrition. If they meet the selection
      criteria, participants will be asked to undergo a 36-hour wash-out period. During those 36
      hours, participants won't be allowed to drink coffee, they will be asked to follow a diet
      low in phenolic acids and keep a record of their meals. On the first day of the study, a
      single dose of coffee rich in antioxidants will be given to the participant and urine will
      be collected from that time until 36 hours after coffee consumption. Participants will be
      followed again after 5 to 6 weeks.
