Despite considerable inter-personal variability in\n      responses to glucocorticoids between asthmatics, an insensitivity rate of about 30% and the\n      risk of adverse side effects of glucocorticoid therapy, no assay is currently performed to\n      determine sensitivity in severe and non-severe asthmatics prior to treatment. The purpose of\n      this study is to perform a whole blood ex vivo stimulation assay to interrogate known\n      glucocorticoid receptor (GR) up- and down-regulated genes to indicate glucocorticoid\n      sensitivity and compare the results between severe and non-severe asthmatics."
