  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to see if combining the investigational chemotherapy drug,
      MEDI-551 with the known anti-myeloma drugs, Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone will reduce your
      myeloma cancer stem cells.

    <textblock>
      To explore the effect of Lenalidomide, dexamethasone and Medi-551 on multiple myeloma cancer
      stem cells (CSCs). Myeloma CSCs will be assessed by a clonogenic assay from the bone marrow
      and flow cytometry from peripheral blood.

    <description>Eligible patients will receive Lenalidomide and dexamethasone as per standard of care guidelines for 2 cycles. Patients with a clinical response to lenalidomide and dexamethasone after 2 cycles will proceed to get MEDI-551 for 2 cycles.  MEDI-551 will be dosed at 4mg/kg IV on days 1 and 8 of cycle 3 and 4mg/kg IV on day 1 of cycle 4.</description>

             myeloma

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the patient/legal representative prior to
             performing any protocol-related procedures, including screening evaluations

          -  Patient must agree to take Lenalidomide with low dose dexamethasone as their initial
             therapy.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2.

          -  Life expectancy of &gt;6 months

          -  ANC≥1000

          -  Platelets ≥ 50,000

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 2 x ULN

          -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 3 x ULN

          -  Able to take aspirin (81 or 325 mg) daily as prophylactic anticoagulation (patients
             intolerant to ASA may use warfarin or low molecular weight heparin)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with
             evaluation of the investigational product or interpretation of patient safety or
             study results.

          -  Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study, except for non-interventional,
             observational studies.

          -  Any chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic, investigational, for treatment of multiple
             myeloma other than Lenalidomide and dexamethasone.

          -  Previous monoclonal antibody (mAb) or other treatment specifically directed against
             CD19.

          -  History of serious allergy or reaction to any component of the MEDI-551 formulation
             that would prevent administration.

          -  Previous systemic cancer therapy for myeloma.

          -  Any active secondary malignancy.

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive serology or acquired immune deficiency
             syndrome.

             elevated liver transaminases or other evidence of active hepatitis.

          -  Documented current central nervous system involvement by multiple myeloma.

          -  Previous medical history or evidence of an intercurrent illness that may, in the
             opinion of the investigator, compromise the safety of the patient in the study.

          -  Diagnosis of plasma cell leukemia

          -  Diagnosis of POEMS syndrome
