This is based on the premise that there are\n      three main modifiable reasons why women (and their fetuses/newborns) die due to pregnancy\n      complications: 1) delays by the woman herself in recognizing the seriousness of her\n      condition; 2) delays in her being assessed and then transported to a center capable of\n      providing effective and life-saving interventions; and 3) delays in the health facility in\n      providing those interventions. The treatments for pre-eclampsia that are poorly accessed in\n      LMIC are 1) magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) for prevention and treatment of the grand mal seizures\n      of eclampsia; 2) oral antihypertensive medication to lower maternal BP to reduce the risk of\n      stroke.\n\n      The CLIP pilot and definitive cRCT will investigate whether the community level intervention\n      including implementation of the CLIP package (oral antihypertensive therapy when indicated,\n      intramuscular (i.m.) MgSO4 when indicated; and appropriate referral to an CEmOC facility\n      when indicated) of care will reduce the incidence of all-cause maternal morbidity and\n      mortality."
