            "textblock": "Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States and\n      worldwide. Several studies have demonstrated that fruit and vegetable rich diets\n      significantly reduced blood pressure and reduced the risk of ischemic stroke and\n      cardiovascular disease in general, the exact mechanisms remain poorly understood.\n      Preclinical and clinical research over the last decade has revealed the important\n      vasoprotective effects of nitrates and nitrites with regards to reduction in blood pressure,\n      vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. More recent findings suggest that\n      inorganic nitrate and nitrite therapy may be involved in the regulation of glucose-insulin\n      homeostasis.\n\n      For this reason, development of an oral formulation of nitrate and nitrite salts represents\n      a rational avenue of exploration for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, whereby\n      nitrite would ensure rapid acting effects upon absorption, while the nitrate would\n      continuously provide a slow formation of nitrite over a prolonged period of time via the\n      enterosalivary circulation pathway. In this pathway, about 25% of circulating nitrate is\n      concentrated in the saliva and reduced to nitrite by commensal mouth bacteria with nitrate\n      reductase enzymes. The proposal is the first human study to investigate the inorganic\n      nitrate or nitrite effects (in any form) on insulin sensitivity in a patient population.\n      This will be the third human trial using orally delivered inorganic nitrate capsules in\n      normal volunteers or subjects with hypertension and the second human trial using orally\n      delivered nitrite (previously as aqueous solution)."
