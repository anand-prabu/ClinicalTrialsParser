The participant then logs into the PACR (using a study provided screen name and study identification number).  A game-like experience begins, where the participant is presented with games in a set order.  Each game consists of targeted exercises that contain the core science stimuli and tasks.  The scheduling mechanism ensures that a participant progresses through the exercises in a defined order, generally moving from more simple (early sensory processing) exercises to more complex (multimodal, cognitive control) exercises over the course of the three-month experience."

Cognitive impairment accompanies MS in 40-60% of cases and when\n      present, additional symptomatic treatment combined with DMT is required.  To date no\n      symptomatic pharmacologic therapy has shown a consistent benefit on MS associated cognitive\n      dysfunction. However, non-pharmacologic approaches show promise.  With recent technical and\n      scientific advances, cognitive training is rapidly evolving to become the most effective\n      intervention for the cognitive impairments associated with a wide range of neurological\n      conditions. However, these training programs have not yet been studied in MS.\n\n      This study will be a randomized open-label clinical pilot trial to compare a\n      plasticity-based and adaptive cognitive remediation (PACR) program to an active control\n      (ordinary computer games) in 20 adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) starting Gilenya\n      therapy.  Primary outcome measures will be used as preliminary indicators of effect, with\n      improvements on program task-related measures and changes in cognitive measures.  Secondary\n      outcome measures will determine the feasibility of the use of these programs in patients\n      with MS, as indicated by compliance and patient-reported experience."
