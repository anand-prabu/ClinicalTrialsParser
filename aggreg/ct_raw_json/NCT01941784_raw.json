To determine the feasibility of conducting a weight maintenance intervention, in terms of\n      recruiting and retaining participants.\n\n      II. To obtain preliminary data on the effectiveness of an intervention to prevent weight\n      gain on body composition, self-efficacy, perceived stress, fatigue, depression, exercise\n      capacity, and health-related quality of life (HRQL). Changes in physical activity and\n      dietary intake will also be monitored.\n\n      III. To determine if the weight control protocol requires refinement for use in a randomized\n      controlled trial.\n\n      IV. To determine how many participants opt to enroll in a short-term healthy lifestyle\n      program at completion of the final testing visit.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Participants undergo four 30-60 minute health education sessions and 3 follow-up phone\n      sessions with an interventionist trained in behavioral science, physical activity and\n      nutrition, and positive psychology over 12 months.\n\n      EDUCATION SESSION I: Participants receive information from the interventionist concerning\n      healthy diet choices and exercise and begin to keep a food log.\n\n      EDUCATION SESSION II: Interventionists review information from session I and patient food\n      logs. Participants receive recommendations for exercise and set activity goals.\n\n      EDUCATION SESSION III: Participants receive information on how to determine portion sizes\n      and the importance of strength training and building lean muscle mass.\n\n      EDUCATION SESSION IV: Interventionists review information from the previous 3 sessions and\n      discuss the importance of planning and goal setting with participants. The interventionist\n      also discusses physical and mental barriers to exercise.\n\n      After completion of the education sessions, patients receive 3 phone calls at times\n      convenient to the patient to answer questions about information learned in previous\n      educational sessions.\n\n      After completion of study, participants are followed up for 12 months."
