In addition,\n      patients may be asked to have an echocardiogram (ultrasound scan of the heart) and to\n      perform an exercise stress test.\n\n      These tests are designed to assess the types and causes of patient's heart diseases and to\n      determine if they can participate in other, specific research studies."

Patients with known or suspected\n      cardiovascular diseases are referred to NHLBI cardiologists for consideration of\n      participation in clinical research protocols.  However, eligibility for participation is\n      often uncertain from referral information or even after an outpatient evaluation.  The\n      purpose of this protocol is to permit inpatient evaluation of patients for whom\n      participation in clinical research protocols is under consideration in order to determine\n      protocol eligibility by means of conventional laboratory and cardiovascular testing."
