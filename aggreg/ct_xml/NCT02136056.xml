  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current study is to determine the efficacy of a self-management course
      for workers on sick-leave as an add-on to standard rehabilitation care and follow-up
      (treatment as usual). Outcomes are registry based measures of return to work, and
      questionnaire based measures of well-being and quality of life.

      We thus, hypothesize that the program will improve workers return to work rates and
      self-reported/psychological well-being.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention course is a Danish adaptation of The Chronic Disease Self-Management
      Program (CDSMP), tailored towards workers on sick-leave. The original program has been
      developed by The Stanford Patient Education Research Center. The translation and adaptation
      has been conducted by The Danish Committee for Health Education.

      Previous studies have examined the program with respect to specific chronic diseases (e.g.,
      Arthritis), quality of life, well-being and health-care utilization, though non-otherwise
      specified workers on sick-leave and return work have not been examined before.

      The framework of CDSMP is social-cognitive learning theory in which self-efficacy plays a
      central role.
