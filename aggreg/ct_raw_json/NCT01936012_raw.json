Seven days after the\n      first drug administration (washout period), the procedure was repeated using the alternate\n      drug.\n\n      The pharmacokinetic parameters, including AUCt, AUCinf, Cmax, t max, and t1/2, were\n      determined from plasma concentrations of lisinopril, using liquid chromatography with tandem\n      mass spectrometry detection (LC-MS/MS) method."
