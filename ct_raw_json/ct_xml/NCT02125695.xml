  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objectives of the study are as follows:  To determine if ribonucleic acid (RNA)
      recovery from tape harvesting allows for the identification of a lupus gene signature (e.g.,
      interferon [IFN] signature) or other biomarkers that may differentiate lupus from normal or
      nonlesional skin; To determine if the lupus gene signature is differentially expressed in
      the epidermis from active discoid lesions when compared with unaffected skin from the same
      participants and from the skin of healthy volunteers (HVs);  To correlate the levels of
      transcripts of targeted genes obtained in the skin by tape harvesting with those obtained
      from the blood.

      No study drug is administered as part of this study.  All participants with lupus will be
      treated according to standard clinical practice.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy volunteers must be in good overall health as determined by the Investigator,
             based on medical history, physical examination (per standard dermatology practice),
             and vital signs.

          -  Subjects with lupus must present with active lupus discoid skin disease (with or
             without systemic manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), as defined by
             ≥4 out of 11 classification criteria for SLE, as determined by a board-certified
             dermatologist or rheumatologist, at the time of entry.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any clinically significant medical condition, other than active lupus
             discoid skin disease or SLE, as determined by the Investigator, that may impact study
             analyses, including, but not limited to: History of human immunodeficiency virus;
             History of hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B virus; Symptoms of bacterial or viral
             infection (including skin infection) within 14 days prior to the Day 1 Visit

          -  History of malignancy in the last 5 years (nonmelanoma skin cancer that is considered
             cured by the Investigator will not be exclusionary)

             anesthetics that will be used in the study.

          -  Subjects with discoid skin lesions will be excluded from study entry if Evidence of
             skin conditions other than lupus skin disease (e.g., eczema, psoriasis) that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with the study execution or analysis.

          -  Change in antimalarial or systemic immunosuppressive dosing regimen within 28 days
             before the Day 1 Visit.

          -  Exposure to monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, growth factors, soluble receptors,
             other recombinant products, or fusion proteins for diseases other than SLE within 3
             months prior to the Day 1 Visit.

             regimen must be stable for at least 28 days before the Day 1 Visit.

          -  Treatment with any of the following medications within 3 months prior to the Day 1
             Visit: Cyclophosphamide, Any biologics (e.g., fusion proteins, therapeutic proteins,
             or monoclonal antibodies) for SLE, including but not limited to belimumab or
