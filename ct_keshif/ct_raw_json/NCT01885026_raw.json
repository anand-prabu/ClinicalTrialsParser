The eScreen brief\n      Internet intervention for problematic alcohol and drug use offers self-screening, in-depth\n      self-reporting, personalized feedback and treatment recommendations as well as an electronic\n      diary. Progress over time is shown in diagrams detailing consumption levels.\n\n      Method: This is a two-armed randomized controlled design, measuring outcomes in terms of\n      changes in problematic alcohol use up to one year after study recruitment. Participants with\n      problematic alcohol use (AUDIT >7 for men and >5 for women) and/or problematic drug use\n      (DUDIT > 1 for both men and women) are randomized into one of two groups: T1, eScreen\n      referral or Control group. Outcomes on alcohol and drug use as well as health-related\n      symptoms are assessed after 3, 6 and 12 months.\n\n      The hypothesis is that the group receiving the eScreen intervention will reduce their\n      alcohol/drug use to a larger extent than the control group at follow-up compared to the\n      baseline level."
