      The purpose of this pregnancy registry study is to detect and describe abnormal pregnancy
      outcomes in women intentionally or unintentionally vaccinated with any of GlaxoSmithKline
      (GSK) Biologicals' seasonal Inactivated Influenza Vaccines (sIIVs): Fluarix, FluLaval,
      Fluarix Quadrivalent and FluLaval Quadrivalent.

      This study is a transition of existing ongoing pregnancy registries for Fluarix/
      FluLaval/Fluarix Quadrivalent/ FluLaval Quadrivalent into one post-authorization safety
      study (PASS).

      Pregnancy outcome data will be collected using questionnaires within 3 months of the
      estimated date of delivery (EDD) and approximately 6 months and 12 months after the EDD (for
      all live births) to ascertain the presence of birth defects not diagnosed before, from Q2
      2014 to Q2 2019.

      The intent of the Registry is to prospectively collect data such as vaccination with GSK
      sIIVs during pregnancy or within 28 days preceding conception, potential confounding factors
      (such as exposure to other medications) and information related to the outcome of the
      pregnancy.

        Pregnant women, residing in the US, vaccinated with any of the 4 GSK sIIVs during
        pregnancy or within 28 days preceding conception and who are volunteering to take part in
        the Pregnancy Registry before the outcome of the pregnancy is known.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A subject will be included in the Registry if all of the following criteria are met:

          -  Exposure to GSK sIIVs occurs during pregnancy or within 28 days preceding conception.

          -  Subject is a US resident.

          -  A HCP is identified (name, address and phone number).

          -  Subject can be identified (by GSK or HCP).

        Data from registered subjects will be included in the analyses if the following criterion
        is met:

        • Pregnancy is ongoing and the outcome is unknown at the time of initial report.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Data from registered subjects will not be included in the analyses if the following
        criterion is met:

        • Outcome of pregnancy is known at the time of initial report. Types of known outcomes
        include prenatal testing reports in which the results are abnormal or outside the
        reference range, indicating possible abnormality in the fetus. Pregnancies in which
        prenatal testing indicates a normal pregnancy would also be excluded because inclusion of
        such pregnancies could potentially bias results toward a lower overall estimate of risk
        for defects. Typically pregnancies &gt; 16 weeks gestation will have undergone prenatal
        testing that can identify whether a child has congenital abnormalities.
