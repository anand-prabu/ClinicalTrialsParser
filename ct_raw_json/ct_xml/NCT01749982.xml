  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Roughly 140 million people worldwide are chronically exposed to As-contaminated drinking
      water at concentrations exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) standard of 10 Âµg/L.
      Arsenic is a class I carcinogen known to cause several types of cancer and ischemic heart
      disease.  Metabolism of inorganic As (InAs), which facilitates urinary As excretion, relies
      on one-carbon metabolism and involves two methylation steps; both utilize
      S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as the methyl donor.  SAM biosynthesis relies on B vitamins
      including folate and B12 for the recruitment and transfer of methyl groups, but other
      nutrients, including choline and betaine, also contribute to the methyl pool.  Our recent
      findings from a cross-sectional study of Bangladeshi adults exposed to a wide range of As
      concentrations in drinking water show that plasma choline and betaine concentrations are
      positively associated with As methylation.  These findings suggest that choline and/or
      betaine may play an important role in As methylation and elimination and that simple
      interventions may have therapeutic potential for the many populations at risk for As-induced
      health effects.

      The investigators aim to recruit and follow 60 participants for this pilot study which will
      allow us to 1) assess the acceptance of choline and betaine supplements, 2) monitor
      participants for any potential side effects, 3) identify any difficulties that might be
      encountered in daily follow-up, and 4) generate preliminary data regarding the effects of
      choline and/or betaine supplementation on arsenic methylation.
