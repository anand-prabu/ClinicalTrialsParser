Patients achieving complete response, partial response, or stable disease continue\n      treatment.\n\n      Tumors are measured at least every 8 weeks for 6 months, every 3 months for 1.5 years, every\n      6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 2 years.\n\n      Patients are followed for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
