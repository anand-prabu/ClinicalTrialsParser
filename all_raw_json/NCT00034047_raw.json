            "textblock": "Endometriosis is a significant public health problem affecting 10-15% of women of\n      childbearing age, many of whom suffer persistent pelvic pain and infertility. Therapeutic\n      options include surgery and hormone therapy that are often temporarily effective but produce\n      unwanted side-effects. The present proposal, based on case series reports of the\n      effectiveness of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM: acupuncture and Chinese herbs) for this\n      condition, aims to evaluate whether TCM is as effective as hormone therapy for alleviating\n      endometriosis-related chronic pain.\n\n      Women with laparoscopy-diagnosed endometriosis will be randomly assigned to either TCM or\n      hormone therapy. Women assigned to TCM will be divided into four sub-groups on the basis of\n      the diagnostic categories of endometriosis recognized by TCM. A pre-established acupuncture\n      protocol and herbal formula specific for each sub-group will be followed. This aspect of the\n      research design permits an important feature of the clinical practice of TCM (matching\n      treatment to sub-group diagnosis) to be adopted in a clinical trial. Women assigned to\n      hormone therapy will be treated with the gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa),\n      nafarelin, chosen for this study on the basis of its clinical trial-established efficacy,\n      ease of patient usage via intranasal spray and milder side-effect profile relative to other\n      GnRHa's. Pelvic pain symptoms (patient-scored) and signs (physician-scored) will be assessed\n      at baseline, after 12 weeks of treatment, and at 12- and 24-week post-treatment follow-up.\n      Pelvic examination scores will be determined by a physician blinded to the treatment group\n      assignments. Side effects, including those of pseudomenopause known to result from GnRHa\n      therapy, will be recorded in both groups at 4-week intervals during the 12-week treatment,\n      and at each follow-up time. A further objective is to make a preliminary assessment of\n      whether diagnostic sub-groups of endometriosis recognized by TCM serve as predictors of\n      differential response to hormone therapy. Data obtained from this study, on treatment\n      effectiveness, side effect profiles, recurrence of symptoms, compliance with therapy and\n      drop-out rates, will be used to design a large-scale clinical trial."
