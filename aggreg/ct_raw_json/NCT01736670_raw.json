            "textblock": "Triamcinolone acetonide is a mid-potency, class 4/5 topical corticosteroid that is available\n      in a spray formulation (Triamcinolone Acetonide Spray, T Spray).  It is indicated for the\n      relief of inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses.\n      Unlike more potent steroid products, T Spray has no time limitations on its use; therefore,\n      it is commonly used to treat flares in psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis,\n      and contact dermatitis.\n\n      In contrast to creams and ointments, T Spray can easily cover large and hard-to-reach areas\n      of the body. Its optional nozzle directs application of the medication to precise areas\n      without affecting nearby areas. Patients requiring a mid-potency corticosteroid for lesions\n      on the scalp, back, intertriginous folds, large areas, or areas that require precise\n      application would benefit from the T Spray formulation. In the time since the introduction\n      of T Spray to dermatology, other topical corticosteroids have entered the market, but T\n      Spray remains the only mid-potency corticosteroid available in a spray formulation.\n\n      In a recently published open-label, non-comparator study involving 42 patients with chronic\n      steroid-responsive dermatoses, T Spray was used up to four times a day for 28 days.\n      Improvement of lesions after one week of treatment was experienced by 85% of patients, and\n      95% of subjects preferred the spray over creams and ointment.  Most importantly, 56% of\n      patients reported an anti-pruritic cooling effect which was experienced upon application."
