Motivational impairment is arguably the single most important\n      factor that determines a patient's ability to engage in and adhere to effective treatment.\n      In phase 1 of our study, ten participants will be enrolled in pilot randomized controlled\n      trial comparing the feasibility and tolerability of the two intervention conditions (PRIME\n      with computer games vs PRIME + cognitive training). Participants will use the intervention\n      over a 2 month period. Participants will undergo pre/post testing and a 6 month follow-up,\n      to determine feasibility and efficacy of the interventions. By enhancing motivation,\n      schizophrenia patients would be able to engage more fully with treatment and develop full\n      and productive lives. This study may also pave the way forward for other health conditions\n      in which motivational impairments impede health outcomes."
