            "textblock": "American Urology Association (AUA) considers intradetrusor injection of BTX as a fifth-line\n      treatment of interstitial cystitis due to the seriousness and of adverse events, including\n      dysuria, large post-void residuals, and the need for intermittent self-catheterization.  An\n      appealing alternative for BTX injection is intravesical instillation of BTX since the recent\n      studies suggest that intravesically applied BTX acts through the afferent neuropathway\n      involving sensory mechanism in the urothelium rather than the smooth muscle. TheraCoat core\n      technology is based on a reverse thermal biodegradable gel (TC-3) (low viscosity at 5\u00b0C gel\n      appearance at body temperature) for drug retention in the urinary bladder.  Intravesical BTX\n      instillation using TheraCoat gel is expected to increase treatment efficiency due to\n      prolongation of treatment duration and consequently improving bladder exposure to BTX.\n\n      Prior to instillation, the TC-3 hydrogel, in a liquid state, is mixed with BTX.TC-3 mixed\n      with BTX is instilled to the bladder by a catheter. Following gel insertion to the bladder,\n      the gel solidifies and forms a drug reservoir inside the bladder. Upon contact with urine\n      the gel dissolves and is cleared out from the bladder Post instillation, patients followed\n      at 2, 6, 12 weeks thereafter."
