On a daily basis, all children will consume a defined quantity of\n      pump-water outside of meals. The water offered to children in the first group of\n      intervention will be previously filtered and zinc-fortified by the LSF-filter; the children\n      in the second group will receive water that has been filtered only. A nutrition survey will\n      provide an indication of dietary zinc intake. The effect of enriched water consumption on\n      children's zinc status will be evaluated by analyzing the concentration of zinc in serum at\n      baseline, midpoint and endpoint of the intervention. Diarrhea rates will be monitored by\n      recording episodes of diarrhea."

Zinc fortification is provided by a chamber housing a zinc releasing glass-plate that is placed annexed to the hollow fibre column. It is estimated that the LSF can provide about 5 mg of zinc/l of filtered water. By consuming daily a portion of 0.6 litres of enriched water, >100% of the age-specific estimated physiologic requirement would be covered, assuming a fractional absorption of 40%.",
