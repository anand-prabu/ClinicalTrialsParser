Patients with\n      newly diagnosed PED without choroidal neovascularisations (CNV), will be randomized to\n      either treatment or observation. The treatment group will first be given injections with\n      anti Vascular Endothelium Growth Factor (anti-VEGF). If the injections do not have any\n      effect, Verteporfin Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) will be given. All patients will be followed\n      for a period of 2 years. It is hypothesized that treatment stops the progression of the\n      disease and stabilizes the vision in this subgroup of patients with AMD."
