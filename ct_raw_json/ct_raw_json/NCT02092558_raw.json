From 2005 to 2013, metaplasia was diagnosed in 119 patients - 116 girls\n      and 3 boys. The reasons behind visiting the hospital were non-specific intense pain in the\n      abdomen, recurrent urinary tract infections, and urination disorders. The most common\n      symptoms of urinary bladder dysfunction were pollakiuria and difficulties in initiating\n      micturition and retention of urine (reduced detrusor muscle activity).\n\n      Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: In 20 patients (16.8%), metaplasia was\n      incidentally diagnosed during cystoscopy performed for other causes. Only the children whose\n      bladders showed metaplastic changes on cystoscopy were subjected to a bladder biopsy for\n      collecting specimens for further histopathological examination."
