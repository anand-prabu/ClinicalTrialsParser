The risk of future fracture after a first\n      hip fracture is increased. Several studies reported that patients who suffered from a\n      fracture are not optimally treated and do not receive osteoporosis treatment after the first\n      fracture episode.\n\n      Aim: To evaluate whether a coordinator increases the optimal management of osteoporotic\n      fracture patients and hip fracture patients."
