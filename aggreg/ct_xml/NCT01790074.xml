  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing real and simulated manual treatment of
      trigger points (TrPs) in patients with cervicogenic headache (CeH). The purpose of the
      current randomized clinical pilot trial was to determine the preliminary effects of TrP
      manual therapy in individuals with CeH with sternocleidomastoid muscle active TrPs as
      compared to manual contact over the muscle tissues.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CeH pain has been mostly related to joint, disk and ligament pain from the upper cervical
      spine; however, clinicians should consider that the upper cervical spine also receives
      afferent inputs from muscles. In fact, the role of referred pain to the head elicited by
      muscle TrPs has received particular interest in recent years. No study has investigated the
      effectiveness of TrP manual therapy in patients with CeH exhibiting active TrPs.
      Investigators hypothesized that patients receiving a real TrP treatment will exhibit a
      greater reduction in pain, sensitivity, cervical range of motion and neck endurance than
      those receiving a manual control non-therapeutic intervention.

    <description>The intensity of head and neck pain was separately assessed with an 11-point numerical pain rate scale (NPRS, 0: no current pain, 10: maximum pain). It was recorded as a mean based on headaches experienced in the preceding week.</description>

    <measure>Change in cervical range of motion from baseline to one week after treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and one week after the intervention</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Cervical range of motion was measured using a cervical range of motion (CROM) device. Subjects were asked to move their head as far as they could without pain in a stan¬dardized sequence: flexion, extension, affected/non-affected lateral flexion, and affected/non-affected rotation.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Pressure pain thresholds (PPT), i.e., the amount of pressure where a sensation of pressure first changes to pain  was assessed with an analogical algometer over C0-C1, C1-C2 and C2-C3 zygapophyseal joints on the symptomatic side.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The motor performance of the deep cervical flexor muscles was tested in all patients by using the cervical flexor test (CCFT).</description>
