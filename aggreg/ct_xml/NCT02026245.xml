  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we will compare two electronic goniometric gloves to see if they can be used
      in research on joint movement in arthritis.

      One of the gloves we will use is the commercially available '5DT Ultra 14 glove', the other
      is a glove that we have specially designed and developed for use in people with arthritis.
      Both gloves are 'high-end' gloves with sensors for all of the finger and thumb joints.

      We aim to find out if the gloves are accurate and if they can be worn and used without too
      much discomfort by people with arthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open pilot study to assess the usability and accuracy of two electronic
      goniometric gloves in measuring finger joint movement in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis.

      We will use questionnaires to assess pain, stiffness and disability. We will be using an
      inner disposable glove worn under the electronic goniometric gloves as this will be
      important for infection control in clinical use.

      We will calibrate the electronic goniometric gloves using wooden blocks at predefined angles
      using our own software calibration process to optimise the accuracy of the glove for the
      individual patient.

      The patient will flex and extend their fingers repeatedly to get measurements of the minimum
      and maximum angle of flexion in their joints. During these movements we will also capture
      the dynamic characteristics of movement such as maximum velocity. In this study a laptop
      will be used to capture and record all of the measurements from the electronic goniometric
      glove and record the time at which the measurements were taken.

      Each electronic goniometric glove will be refitted for a second set of tests to assess
      variability due to the fitting process. We will record a full set of data from each set of
      movements for later analysis.

      Finally, we will assess usability and establish if patients have a preference between the
      two electronic goniometric gloves.
