            "textblock": "Endotracheal intubation is a procedure that may cause significant hemodynamic perturbations\n      and can severely impact the outcome of the critically ill.  To ensure a safe outcome during\n      this particular procedure, there are many factors that the clinician is faced with.  One\n      decision that confronts the critical care physician involves the correct combination of\n      medications with which to facilitate such a safe outcome.  Given the reported hemodynamic\n      stability, etomidate is a medication that is chosen by many providers in this particular\n      situation.  However, its association with a possible increase in mortality makes it less\n      than ideal for a number of critical care physicians.  In recent years, an admixture of\n      propofol and ketamine has been studied that demonstrates hemodynamic stability based on the\n      balancing of the hemodynamic effects of these two individual agents alone.  This novel\n      medication combination, sometimes referred to as \"ketofol\", may offer a valuable alternative\n      to the critical care physician.  Therefore, a randomized parallel-group clinical trial of\n      adult critically ill patients admitted to a medical (MB-6B/G) and/or surgical intensive care\n      unit (MB-7D/E) at Mayo Clinic Rochester who meet the criteria designated below for which\n      urgent and/or emergent intubation is needed will receive one of two interventions based on\n      stratified randomization.  The \"active\" intervention arm will receive ketamine/propofol\n      (ketofol) to facilitate endotracheal intubation.  The comparison arm will receive etomidate.\n       The primary outcome will focus on hemodynamic data recorded during the first 15 minutes\n      post-administration with secondary outcomes addressing intensive care unit length of stay,\n      mortality, adrenal function, and vasoactive medication use, among others."
