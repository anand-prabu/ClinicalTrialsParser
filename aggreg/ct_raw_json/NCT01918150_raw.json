As a part of the secondary objectives, a\n      cost-effectiveness study is also planned.\n\n      The comparators are cobalt chromium stents CE marketed and free of any coating (nude BMS).\n\n      All will be used in their authorized indications.\n\n      A total of 1350 patients will be included over a period of a year or more and followed for\n      24 months for the primary endpoint (MACE rate at 24 months in the overall population :\n      cumulative incidence of cardiac deaths, MI and target lesion revascularization (TLR)).\n\n      Patients will also be clinically followed at 6 and 12 months . Medico economic datas are to\n      collect at a similar time point.\n\n      An independent Clinical Event Committee, unaware of the treatment allocation, will be in\n      charge of the adjudication of all the cardiac events including MACE (main\n      objective)collected.\n\n      The calculation of the number of subjects specifies that 1350 patients are needed to meet\n      the primary endpoint of the study.\n\n      Enrolled patient will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 fashion as follows :\n\n        -  900 patients in TITAN2 arm including 360 with ACS (Arm A)\n\n        -  450 patients in Cobalt-chromium arm including 180 with ACS (Arm B) In case of more than\n           one stent needed, the protocol mandated using the same stent than the one assigned in\n           all the lesions treated."
