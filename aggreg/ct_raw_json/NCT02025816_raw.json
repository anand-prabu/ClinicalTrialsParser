Biopsies will\n      be used for standard clinical analysis of bacterial species present or stored for later RNA\n      sequencing. RNA sequencing will identify bacteria that are present within the infection site\n      that may not be detected using standard culture techniques as well as reveal bacterial gene\n      expression profiles within the NSTI site. Medical charts will also be reviewed for basic\n      patient information as well as wound care management practices. We hope to identify\n      bacterial species commonly present in these types of infections as well as risk factors\n      predisposing individuals to NSTI's."
