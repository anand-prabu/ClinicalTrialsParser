This practice is based on data that supports\n      improved response rates with this combination.\n\n      Recent trial data indicates that the addition of vorinostat to bortezomib treatment\n      overcomes treatment resistance to bortezomib. As such this current trial is designed to\n      investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of combination treatment with vorinostat,\n      bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed and relapsed refractory myeloma.\n\n      A comparison of this Phase II trial with the pivotal Phase III trial conducted by MSD (using\n      the labelled bortezomib indication without dexamethasone) will address the impact of\n      dexamethasone in regards to tolerability and additional efficacy in myeloma patients."
