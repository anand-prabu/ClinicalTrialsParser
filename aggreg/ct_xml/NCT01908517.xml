  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been very limited research that has looked at electronic reminders (text messages)
      and its effectiveness in adherence to vaccination among low-income minority populations.
      Results have shown that text messages, among low-income parents and adolescents who were
      identified as having a cellphone, is an effective strategy to increase the likelihood of
      adolescent vaccination adherence.  Hard copy and electronic messaging reminders have also
      been proven to be effective when coupled with other prevention strategies for immunizations
      for influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia and screening for colon, breast, and cervical
      cancer in adults. Additionally, Merck and Co. recommend electronic reminders in their
      patient compliance program as a key strategy for adherence.  To our knowledge, this
      community-based pilot intervention study will be the first to assess electronic reminders
      and HPV vaccine initiation and adherence among rural uninsured and Medicaid populations. The
      investigators hypothesize that adolescent whose parents who receive the intervention will be
      more likely to initiate HPV vaccination and be compliant at 3 months and at 7 months as
      compared to the control group.

    <description>Vaccine adherence will be measured using the CDC's guidelines which state that the second dose be given one to two months after the first, and the third dose be given six months after the first dose.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Parents in the intervention group will receive 4 tailored education messages and 2 tailored reminder/education messages within the 6 month window period for the recommended HPV vaccine adherence guidelines.   In order to assess a 20% increase in knowledge about HPV and the HPV vaccine, parents will take a baseline assessment survey and then a final assessment survey at the 7-month point once the vaccine series is completed.</description>

    <description>The intervention group will receive 4 education messages, 2 reminder/education messages, as well as 1 baseline and 1 final assessment survey.  Control group participants will receive 2 contacts throughout the study, 1 at baseline and 1 at their final assessment survey. Up to two reminder contacts will be used if surveys are not completed for both intervention and control group participants.  Preference for receipt of reminders will be obtained from the information study card parents complete at study enrollment.  Enrollment card content, educational messages and patient- reminders will all be developed with community input.</description>
