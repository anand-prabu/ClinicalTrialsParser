The\n      specific alteration of the mitochondrial function of ischemic skeletal muscle plays an\n      important role, and therapeutic enhancing mitochondrial function are associated with a\n      clinical improvement with increase in the walking distance of the patient.\n\n      In severe ischemia, reperfusion required is accompanied by a deleterious episode through a\n      worsening of endothelial dysfunction (impaired pathway of nitric oxide (NO)), majorant\n      alteration of cellular energy and the hormonal and inflammatory responses. This is\n      reperfusion syndrome, which can lead to grave consequences. Our goal is to limit\n      mitochondrial and endothelial dysfunction (increased by the reperfusion) by stimulating the\n      NO pathway by in situ addition of its precursor, L-arginine. Our working hypothesis is that\n      this cellular improvement  will be accompanied by an increase in systolic pressure index and\n      an improvement in the walking distance.\n\n      Method: This is a trial with direct individual benefit, comparative, randomized,\n      prospective, single-center, double-blind, versus placebo."

The\n      gastrocnemius muscle is biopsied before and 30 minutes after revascularization to analyze\n      mitochondrial respiration and its control. Both femoral and brachial concomitant venous\n      samples will judge the importance of muscle damage (lactate, muscle enzymes) and released\n      mediators (cytokines, NO and endothelin) on the local and general.\n\n      Main clinical implications: L-arginine supplementation in atherosclerotic patients requiring\n      femoropopliteal bypass to limit the initial deleterious effects of reperfusion and improve\n      their walking distance and therefore their quality of life. Then extending this treatment to\n      other patients with peripheral arterial disease."
