            "textblock": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare disease, characterized by microvascular and immunological\n      changes promoting  extra-cellular matrix synthesis and widespread fibrosis. No treatment has\n      yet proven any ability to alter the disease fibrosing process. Specific auto-antibodies are\n      commonly found in this disease, and B lymphocytes are detected in cutaneous and pulmonary\n      infiltrates. Studies derived from murine models suggest a role for B lymphocyte blocking\n      strategies.\n\n      This lead to observational trials of B-cell therapy using rituximab in SSc that provided\n      encouraging results with no particular signal concerning tolerability. These trials included\n      heterogeneous patients with variable disease stages and different involved organs, and were\n      mostly unblinded, which preclude any definitive conclusion. However, they support the\n      continuous development of this therapeutic approach.\n\n      Taking up the early phase of the diffuse form of the disease is complicated by its rarity\n      and the heterogeneous progression of its visceral complications. This raises the question of\n      selecting a homogeneous group of patients to evaluate. The most convincing results for the\n      use of rituximab in autoimmune conditions have been found in rheumatoid arthritis. Joint\n      involvement is common in SSc with 75% of patients complaining about joint stiffness and\n      pain, and 30% presenting with synovitis, tenosynovitis, or flexion contractures. No specific\n      treatment has already addressed this issue, and it is generally proposed to use small doses\n      of oral corticosteroids in association with methotrexate, by analogy with rheumatoid\n      arthritis. We propose to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rituximab in SSc patients\n      having active arthritis despite first line treatment. Improving the articular involvement\n      would improve the quality of life f SSc patients and effectiveness of rituximab on skin and\n      lung fibrotic involvements will be assessed as secondary outcomes to estimate the overall\n      effects of this drug on SSc."
