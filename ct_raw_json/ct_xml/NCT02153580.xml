      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of cellular immunotherapy
      following cyclophosphamide in treating patients with non-Hodgkin lymphomas, chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia or B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia that has come back. Placing a
      modified gene into white blood cells may help the body build an immune response to kill
      cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of adoptive therapy using ex vivo expanded autologous central memory
      T cells (Tcm) that are enriched and genetically modified to express a cluster of
      differentiation (CD)19-specific, hinged optimized, CD28-costimulatory chimeric antigen
      receptor (CAR) as well as a truncated human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
      (CD19R[EQ]28zeta/truncated EGFR [EGFRt]+ Tcm) shortly following lymphodepletion for adults
      with recurrent/progressive/residual CD19 + B-cell lymphoproliferative neoplasms (stratum 1:
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma [NHL], stratum 2: chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL]/prolymphocytic
      leukemia [PLL]) and who are not eligible for or decline City of Hope (COH) Institutional
      Review Board (IRB) Protocol Number (No.) 13277.

      II. To determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study antitumor activity of CD19R(EQ)CD28zeta/EGFRt+Tcm (e.g., detection of Tcm, B
      cells, and tumor burden).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing
      Tcm-enriched T cells (T-cell infusion).

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) 2-7 days before the T-cell infusion.
      Patients receive autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tcm-enriched T cells IV
      over 15 minutes on day 0. Patients with relapsed, residual or progressive disease may
      receive an optional second infusion of autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing
      Tcm-enriched T cells &gt;= 60 days post T cell infusion.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24 hours, weekly for 1
      month, monthly for 1 year, and then yearly for at least 15 years.
