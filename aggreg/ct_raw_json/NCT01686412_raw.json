Autonomic responses have been described in patients\n      with cancer during the exposure of EEFLE. This autonomic response, or biofeedback, due to\n      exposure to EEFLE seems to be associated with a specific set of modulation frequencies when\n      applied to patients with malignancies. Moreover, healthy individuals exposed to modulated\n      EEFLE a specific set of frequency do not appear to autonomic response. Biofeedback is\n      defined by a change in amplitude of the radial pulse during exposure to EEFLE, modulated\n      according to a set of specific frequencies. This phenomenon is not yet fully elucidated. In\n      exploratory survey of one patient was observed a change of the pressure pulse immediately\n      after the start of and during exposure to EEFLE, modulated according to a set of specific\n      frequencies recorded by digital photoplethysmography. This study aims to evaluate an\n      autonomic response in individuals exposed in a single moment, by electromagnetic fields.\n      This study does not intend to study a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure. For this reason,\n      evolutive clinical data will not be considered during and after the study."
