            "textblock": "Renal denervation, a catheter-based approach to reduce renal sympathetic afferent and\n      efferent activity has been used successfully to treat drug-resistant hypertension. Previous\n      studies has demonstrated a reduction of muscle sympathetic nerve activity and renal and\n      total body noradrenaline spillover. In addition, renal denervation seems to improve glucose\n      metabolism and insulin sensitivity, representing the first potential nonpharmaceutical\n      approach for treating insulin resistance. However, the mechanisms are unclear. There is a\n      clear relationship between sympathetic overactivity and insulin resistance. Activation of\n      the sympathetic nervous systems contributes to insulin resistance and metabolic disorders\n      and insulin itself induces sympathetic overactivity. One possible explanation to improved\n      glucose metabolism after renal denervation is altered adipose tissue function (due to the\n      reduction in sympathetic activity). Therefore,15 individuals undergoing renal denervation\n      are recruited. The clinical study includes anthropometry, peripheral blood samples, body\n      composition, heart rate variability and subcutaneous fat biopsies before renal denervation\n      and after 6 months."
