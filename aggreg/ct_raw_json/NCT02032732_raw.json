No single test is sensitive or specific enough to stand alone in\n      determining the presence of joint infection.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to test the usefulness of a chemical test strip to detect\n      infection in fluid that is removed from a joint (intra-articular aspiration) in pediatric\n      patients.  The test strip measures an enzyme called leukocyte esterase, which has been shown\n      to be useful in detecting the presence of infection in fluids from other parts of the body.\n      This study will assess the efficacy of the leukocyte esterase test as a diagnostic tool for\n      evaluating pediatric joint infections.  The hypothesis of the study is that a positive\n      leukocyte esterase test identifies a septic joint in pediatric patients undergoing\n      intraoperative joint aspiration."
