Dutasteride, a widely prescribed medication for benign\n      prostatic hypertrophy, blocks a key step in the production of neuroactive steroids and\n      represents a promising candidate for treatment of alcohol use disorders.  This study will\n      use a 12-week randomized placebo controlled design to examine the safety and efficacy of\n      dutasteride to reduce drinking among a sample of 160 men with hazardous levels of alcohol\n      use.  It will additionally examine the potential moderation of dutasteride treatment effects\n      by a common missense polymorphism in a neuroactive steroid biosynthetic enzyme that we have\n      previously reported to be associated with alcohol dependence.  Identification of genetic\n      predictors of medication response offers the potential for matching alcohol treatment\n      medications with those most likely to respond."
