The music therapy\n      intervention protocol is structured by drum improvisation, rhythm imitation, music cognition\n      and song discussion. Attentive listening and active participation of the music training\n      activities allow participants to utilize their focus of attention and comprehension of\n      informational texts. Music therapy intervention is proposed to provide positive stimulations\n      on emotion and cognitive functions of individuals with dementia. The results of the present\n      study will clarify relationship between the effect of music therapy and the neural substrate\n      of music therapy in anatomical and functional brain data obtained from MRI (fMRI)."

Due to the changes in the frontal and temporal lobes\n      of the brain, individuals with dementia often experience an impaired ability to judge\n      situations. Empirical studies have indicated that cognitive stimulation is essential to\n      facilitate individuals with dementia in thinking, concentration, and memory. Structured\n      music activities provide cognitive stimulation to individuals with dementia through\n      attentive listening and active participation. Additionally, drum improvisation not only\n      reflects the current status of an individual, but also serves as an audio feedback through\n      free play."

All the images are acquired parallel to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure line. To minimize motion artifact generated during the image acquisition, each participant's head will be immobilized with cushions inside the coil. Three kinds of MRI techniques will be performed in this study, including T1-weighted high-resolution anatomical image, resting-state function MRI, and half-sphere diffusion spectrum imaging. Therefore, T1VBM(voxel-based morphology), TBSS(tract-based spatial statistics), functional brain network analysis, and structural brain network analysis will be employed for evaluating the changes of brain functional and structural connectivity in individuals with dementia in experimental and control groups.",
