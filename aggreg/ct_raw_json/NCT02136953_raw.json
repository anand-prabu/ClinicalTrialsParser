Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is considered first line\n      psychological treatment for OCD, but there are a large number of treatment non-responders,\n      and the majority of responders have residual symptoms. Aerobic exercise has shown potential\n      benefit for general mood and anxiety disorders, but has not been widely tested in OCD. This\n      study will examine the additive benefits of a standard 12-week aerobic exercise program to a\n      standard 12-week CBT protocol in the treatment of OCD. The study will test if Exercise+CBT\n      results in significantly better clinical outcomes compared to either treatment alone or no\n      treatment at all. Treatment outcomes will be assessed in relation to symptom and cognitive\n      measures of clinical improvement."

There are 3 broad aims to this\n      study: 1) to compare the relative efficacy of Exercise, CBT, and their combination (CBT+Ex)\n      versus a non-treatment waitlist control (WL), 2) to examine the extent to which\n      neuropsychological features of OCD improve following treatments, and 3) to determine the\n      extent to which the BDNF gene and protein are a) associated with learning and cognitive\n      factors, and b) moderate symptom and cognitive change across treatments.\n\n      The study design allows for a novel, well-powered and potentially landmark study on the\n      impact of exercise on obsessive-compulsive symptom severity and cognitive functioning in\n      OCD, both as a stand-alone treatment and when augmenting CBT.  If this study can demonstrate\n      that a short aerobic exercise program of 12 weeks duration can confer significant clinical\n      gains for those suffering with OCD, then it could easily be translated into highly\n      accessible, routine clinical care. Further, demonstration of improvement in OCD-associated\n      cognitive dysfunction, given the refractory nature of the illness, would provide another\n      avenue into the long-term enhancement of outcomes for this chronically affected population."
