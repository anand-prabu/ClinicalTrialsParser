      To investigate the steady-state pharmacokinetics of once-daily and twice-daily regimens of
      BIA 2-093 and twice-daily regimen of Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal®) in healthy subjects and to
      assess the tolerability of such regimens in healthy subjects.

    <textblock>
      Single centre, open-label, randomised, three-way crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers.
      The study consisted of three 8-day treatment periods separated by washout periods of 10-15
      days. On each of the treatment periods the volunteers received either a daily oral dose of
      BIA 2-093 900 mg once-daily (od), BIA 2-093 450 mg twice-daily (bid), or Oxcarbazepine
      (Trileptal®) 450 mg bid.
