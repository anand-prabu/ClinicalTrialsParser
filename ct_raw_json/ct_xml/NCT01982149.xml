  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer, largely the result of cigarette smoking, is the leading cause of cancer death
      in the United States, killing over 160,000 people in 2010, more than breast, colorectal, and
      prostate cancer combined.  Since only 10% of heavy smokers develop lung cancer and 20% of
      lung cancers develop in nonsmokers, it is thought that genetic predisposition plays an
      important role. This study proposes to examine the genetic correlation between nasal and
      bronchial epithelium and to identify a patient's risk for lung cancer earlier.
