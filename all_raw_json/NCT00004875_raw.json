Determine the patterns of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) release\n      according to tumor type and type of anticoagulation (heparin or enoxaparin) in patients with\n      cancer. II. Determine the incidence of portacath clots and its correlation to TFPI\n      releasability in this patient population. III. Compare these anticoagulation drugs in terms\n      of releasability of TFPI in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy\n      within the past 3 weeks (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n      Arm I: Patients receive a single dose of standard heparin subcutaneously (SQ) followed by\n      evaluation of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) response at 5 and 10 minutes post\n      injection. Arm II: Patients receive a single dose of enoxaparin SQ followed by evaluation of\n      TFPI response as in arm I. Patients are followed monthly for 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-200 patients will be accrued for this study over 6 months."
