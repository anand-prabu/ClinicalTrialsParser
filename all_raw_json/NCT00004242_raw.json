Determine the maximum tolerated dose, recommended phase II dose, and associated toxic\n      effects of the triple combination of continuous infusion fluorouracil, weekly gemcitabine,\n      and oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors.\n\n      II. Define sequence dependent toxic effects, if any, and establish pharmacokinetic and\n      pharmacodynamic relationships in context of this triple combination chemotherapy in this\n      patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of oxaliplatin and gemcitabine.\n\n      For course 1, and then course 3 and beyond, patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on\n      day 1, followed by gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, and then fluorouracil IV\n      continuously on days 1-14. For course 2, patients receive treatment in the same manner as in\n      course 1, except gemcitabine is given initially, followed by oxaliplatin, and then\n      fluorouracil. Treatment continues every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or\n      disease progression.\n\n      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin and gemcitabine until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at\n      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. The recommended phase II dose\n      (RPTD) is defined as the dose preceding MTD.\n\n      Once RPTD is defined, the cohort is expanded to an additional 13 patients. These patients\n      receive a fixed dose of oxaliplatin, gemcitabine, and fluorouracil as determined by the\n      phase I dose escalation portion of this study.\n\n      Patients are followed for disease progression."
