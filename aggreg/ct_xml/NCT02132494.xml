  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relationship between physical activity and academic performance has received widespread
      attention owing to the pressure on schools to graduate pupils who meet accepted academic
      standards. As important, there are global concerns regarding the increased prevalence of
      lifestyle-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs). First, Norway has a history of mediocre
      scores on international comparative academic performance tests such as Trends in
      International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the Programme for International
      Student Assessment (PISA) [1]. It is therefore important to develop and evaluate strategic
      programs that may enhance pupil's academic performance. It is increasingly evident that a
      physical activity strategy that brings about enhanced cognitive function, better blood flow,
      and more, plays a key role in this effort [2]. Second, the prevalence of NCDs, such as
      diabetes mellitus type 2, is increasing worldwide, and such NCDs affect people of all ages
      [3]. Hence, healthcare costs are escalating to unaffordable levels. The best means to deal
      with this immense problem is through primary prevention, and physical activity is a powerful
      common denominator known to play a key role in preventing a host of NCDs [4].

      Consequently, both World Health Organization (WHO) and the Norwegian health authorities call
      for effective primary prevention strategies to promote physical activity in children and
      adolescents [5, 6]. Prop. 90 L (2010-2011) Act on public health work [6] emphasizes that
      physical activity in school can benefit both the learning process and public health
      prevention.

      Therefore, the objective of the ASK-study is to investigate the effects on academic
      performance of 60 minutes of daily physical activity during one school year. Furthermore,
      due to the complexity in the relationship between physical activity and academic
      performance, it is necessary to identify possible mediating and moderating variables as
      cognitive performance, quality of life (QoL), classroom behavior, motor skills and
      motivation. Also, we aim to investigate changes in risk factors related to NCDs and factors
      that influence NSDs, such as physical activity, sedentary behavior and health-related
      fitness.

      In addition a qualitative part of the ASK-Study will be conducted to get an in-depth
      understanding of the children's embodied experiences and the meaning of the social learning
      culture in school physical activity (PA). This will give us an in-depth description of the
      intervention context, offer insight in how the intervention possibly influences children's
      overall development and enables us to estimate potential long term effects of the
      intervention.

      If successful, the ASK cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT) could provide much needed
      solutions to enhancing schoolchildren's academic performance and position the school as an
      effective setting for a massive public health intervention concerning the prevention of
      NCDs.
