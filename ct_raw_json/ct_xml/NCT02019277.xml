  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, phase III study will assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a
      combination therapy of intravenous (IV) Perjeta, subcutaneous (SC) Herceptin, and taxane
      chemotherapy (docetaxel, paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel) as first-line therapy in patients
      with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. All patients will be treated with 3-week cycles
      of Perjeta IV (840 mg first dose; subsequent doses of 420 mg) and trastuzumab SC (600 mg/5
      mL). The taxane treatment regimen will determined by the investigator. Patients will
      continue therapy until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or the patient withdraws
      consent, whicever occurs first. Time on study treatment is up to 2 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female and male patients aged &gt;/= 18 years

             primary tumour or metastatic site

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic breast cancer (mBC) with at
             least one measurable lesion and/or non-measurable disease according to RECIST version
             1.1

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2 for patients who
             will receive paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy and ECOG 0-1 for patients who
             will receive docetaxel chemotherapy

          -  LVEF of &gt;/= 50% measured by echocardiography (ECHO) or multiple-gated acquisition
             (MUGA) scan before the first doses of pertuzumab and trastuzumab.

          -  Previous use of either adjuvant or neoadjuvant anti-HER2 therapy is allowed

          -  Hormonal therapy will be allowed as per institutional guidelines (administered after
             completion of taxane chemotherapy)

          -  Previous systemic non-hormonal anticancer therapy for treatment of mBC

          -  History of other cancers. Patients with curatively treated carcinoma in situ of the
             cervix or basal cell carcinoma and patients with other curatively-treated cancers who

             computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), unless they have been
             treated and have been stable for at least 3 months and do not require ongoing
             corticosteroid treatment

          -  Patients with other concurrent serious diseases that may interfere with planned
             treatment, including severe pulmonary conditions/illness

          -  Inadequate organ function

          -  Serious cardiac illness or medical conditions that would preclude the use of
             trastuzumab

          -  Patients with severe breathing difficulties at rest or requiring supplementary oxygen
             therapy

          -  Concurrent enrolment in another clinical study using an investigational anti-cancer
             treatment, within 28 days before the first doses of Herceptin and Perjeta
