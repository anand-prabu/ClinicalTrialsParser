Treatment repeats every 42 days\n      for 4 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of LipoDox until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional cohort of 12 patients receives\n      LipoDox at the MTD with carboplatin and paclitaxel as above.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 48 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
