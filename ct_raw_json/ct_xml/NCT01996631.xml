  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxidative stress(OS), inflammation, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals(EDC) were all thought
      as important markers that will impact on female reproductive function. However, the
      cause-result correlations between above parameters were still unclear. Investigator plans to
      design a study to evaluate the OS, inflammation, and EDC and their impact on the menstrual
      cycle and reproductive hormone in Taiwanese women. Ferritin is a ubiquitous intracellular
      protein that is essential for the regulation of iron homeostasis. Serum ferritin level is a
      widely available clinical biomarker used to estimate body iron status. Iron is a strong
      pro-oxidant, and high body iron levels are associated with an increased level of OS that may
      elevate the risk of type 2 diabetes. Mildly elevated body iron stores are associated with
      statistically significant elevations in glucose homeostasis indexes. Furthermore, patients
      with elevated iron stores present not only insulin resistance but also metabolic alterations
      that put them at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Increased serum ferritin levels
      have been found in women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome(PCOS). Serum ferritin were highly
      correlated with menstrual cycle and androgens level in women. Homocysteine, a
      sulfur-containing amino acid formed during the metabolism of methionine, exerts cytotoxic
      effects on the vascular endothelium. Hyperhomocysteinemia has been established as an
      independent risk factor for thrombosis and cardiovascular disease, and it may partially
      account for the increased risk of cardiovascular disease associated with insulin resistance.
      Elevated total plasma homocysteine levels have been established as an independent risk
      factor for thrombosis and cardiovascular disease. Studies related to homocysteine and PCOS
      have reported inconsistent results.

      Chronic low-grade inflammation has emerged as a key contributor to the pathogenesis of PCOS
      and obesity. A dietary trigger such as glucose is capable of inciting OS and an inflammatory
      response from mononuclear cells of women with PCOS, and this phenomenon is independent of
      obesity. The correlation between inflammatory markers and reproductive endocrine disturbance
      and consequent complications should be important.Both OS and EDC had been associated with
      PCOS.

      BPA, one of EDC, is an environmental estrogen used in the synthesis of plastics, is a
      &quot;high-volume production&quot; chemical with widespread human exposure. BPA was been reported in
      several female reproductive disturbance. However, the pathological pathway of BPA impact on
      female reproductive system had not been well-understood. Reactive oxygen species have a role
      in the modulation of gamete quality and gamete interaction. Persistent and elevated
      generation of ROS leads to a disturbance of redox potential that in turn causes OS. The
      first part of our study is aim to evaluate the OS impact on the biochemical parameters in
      women with PCOS; the secondary part of our study is to investigate the BPA on the clinical
      and biochemical of women with PCOS; finally, investigator plans to test the hypothesis that
      BPA might increase OS and then elevated ROS in women with menstrual disturbance,
      furthermore, the role of OS and BPA impact on insulin resistance and metabolic disturbance
      will be also investigated.

      OS, inflammation, and EDCs are all important factors impact on the reproductive competence
      in women. To clarify above problems are critical importance. Investigator then conduct this
      study to demonstrate those problems. Study and control cases will be included. Serum total
      oxidant status, inflammatory biomarkers, total antioxidant status, BPA, and
      clinical/biochemical parameters will be obtained for all cases. OS and BPA will be evaluated
      with all clinical/biochemical parameters for all subjects.
