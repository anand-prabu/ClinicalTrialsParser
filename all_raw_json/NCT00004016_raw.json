Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intratumoral adenovirus vector\n      containing interferon gamma in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic melanoma or\n      other solid tumors. II. Assess the safety and tolerability of this regimen in this patient\n      population. III. Determine the local or distant antitumor effect of this regimen in these\n      patients. IV. Evaluate the biological and immunological effects of this regimen and the\n      extent of local interferon gamma expression in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive adenovirus interferon gamma\n      intratumorally on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients achieving tumoral response may receive\n      additional courses of therapy at the discretion of the investigator. Cohorts of at least 3\n      patients receive escalating doses of adenovirus interferon gamma until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6\n      patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for 3 weeks after\n      treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 12 patients will be accrued for this study."
