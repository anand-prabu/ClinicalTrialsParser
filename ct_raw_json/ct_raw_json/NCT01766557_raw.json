Our working hypothesis is that dietary fish protein improves\n      insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and related plasma endocrine and lipid abnormalities\n      in PCOS women by restoring secretory \u03b2-cell function and insulin signaling to the PI\n      3-kinase activity/Akt pathway. We further hypothesize that fish protein will improve cycle\n      regularity and ovarian function."

            "textblock": "Women with polycystic ovary syndrome are at high risk of developing diabetes. Apart from a\n      primary ovarian defect, up to 10% and 40-50% of those women develop diabetes and insulin\n      resistance (IR) respectively. IR and associated hyperinsulinemia are recognized as important\n      pathogenic factors in determining diabetes in the majority of PCOS women, particularly when\n      obesity is present. Treating IR might reduce the risk of diabetes and improve ovulation and\n      fertility in PCOS women. We recently found that obese, IR men and women consuming a cod\n      protein diet showed a 30% improvement in insulin sensitivity compared with other animal\n      proteins, and also a 24% decrease in high-sensitive C-reactive protein plasma concentration.\n      Therefore, dietary fish protein could represent a natural, safe and practical means to\n      improve insulin sensitivity in PCOS women with IR, and a new non-pharmaceutical approach for\n      the treatment of the multiple endocrine and metabolic abnormalities of PCOS women (see\n      outcome measures for a more extensive description)."
