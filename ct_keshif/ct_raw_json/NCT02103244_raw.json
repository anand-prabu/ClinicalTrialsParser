            "textblock": "Carboplatin is an alkylating anticancer drug that is used for the treatment of various types\n      of cancer, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC),\n      malignant mesothelioma, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer. It is mostly given in combination\n      with other chemotherapeutic drugs, but it can also be given as single agent.\n\n      Since carboplatin is highly eliminated by the kidneys, the dose needs to be adjusted for\n      renal dysfunction. Furthermore, as there is clear correlation between the area under the\n      concentration-time curve (AUC) of carboplatin and haematological toxicity and response rate,\n      carboplatin is dosed per target AUC. For this, the standard pharmacokinetic formula  [dose =\n      clearance carboplatin x target AUC] is used.\n\n      the clearance is typically calculated using the cockcroft and gault (C-G) formula. In\n      patients with high weight, or very low serum creatinine values the C-G-formula may\n      overestimate the renal function, resulting in a potential overdose of carboplatin. the new\n      developed dosing algorithm to be studied adjusts for high BMI and low serum creatinine\n      values, in order to provide a more safe dose of carboplatin"
