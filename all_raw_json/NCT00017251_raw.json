Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oblimersen when combined with standard dose\n      carboplatin and etoposide in patients with previously untreated extensive stage small cell\n      lung cancer.\n\n      II. Determine the toxicity and feasibility of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine\n      potential antitumor activity of this regimen as assessed by objective response in these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of oblimersen (G3139).\n\n      Patients receive G3139 IV continuously on days 1-8, carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 6,\n      and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 6-8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6\n      courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of G3139 until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 6-12 patients will be accrued for this study within 5\n      months."
