The\n      combination of aerobic and resistance training, for both upper limbs (UL) and lower limbs\n      (LL), appears to be the physiologically most complete resource for improving quality of life\n      and increased survival of these patients. Therefore, the aim of the study is to assess the\n      impact of aerobic and resistance training of different intensities on the performance and\n      dyspnoea during activities of daily living and prediction of mortality in patients with\n      COPD. There will be include 30 COPD patients with moderate to severe obstruction, aged\n      between 50-80 years of both gender. All patients will undergo to the following assessments\n      and reassessments: history and anthropometric data, Scale London Chest Activity of Daily\n      Living Scale (LCADL), modified Medical Research Council (mMRC), BODE index, test peripheral\n      muscle strength, mobility and balance tests, 6-minute walk test (6MWT), Circuit ADL Test, 1\n      repetition maximum (1RM) and Incremental Cardiopulmonary Testing (ICPT). Patients will be\n      randomly divided into two groups and undergo to the treatment program will consist of\n      sessions lasting approximately 1 hour, three times a week for 12 consecutive weeks, totaling\n      36 sessions. All patients will undergo general stretching and aerobic training on a cycle\n      ergometer with the intensity between 70-80 % of the maximum load achieved in ICPT. After\n      aerobic training, a group of patients will achieve a protocol of low-intensity resistance\n      training (LI-RT), with emphasis on gaining muscle strength, and the other group will be\n      submitted to a protocol of high intensity (HI-RT), aiming greater gain in muscle strength.\n      The calculation of the intensity of training will be conducted by the 1RM test. After the\n      training protocol, it is expected to find improved performance and dyspnoea during\n      activities of daily living and reduction of BODE index for both groups, however, it is\n      expected that the group of low-intensity resistance training presents greater benefits in\n      ADL."
