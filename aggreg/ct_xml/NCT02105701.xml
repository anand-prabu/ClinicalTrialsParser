    <textblock>
      This is an efficacy and safety study of MK-5172 in combination with MK-8742 with or without
      ribavirin (RBV) in participants with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 1, 4, 5,
      or 6 infections who have failed prior therapy with pegylated interferon and RBV.  The
      primary study hypothesis is that in at least one of the study arms, the percentage of
      participants achieving  sustained viral response 12 weeks after the end of all study
      treatment (SVR12) will be superior to 58%.
