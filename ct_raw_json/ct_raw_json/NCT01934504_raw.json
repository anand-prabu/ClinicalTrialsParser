Three clinical conditions are recognized: microscopic polyangiitis (MPA),\n      granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's, GPA) and eosinophilic granulomatosis with\n      polyangiitis (EPA, formerly Churg Strauss Syndrome). These have different clinical features\n      but can have some overlapping immunological characteristics.\n\n      The precise cause of AAV is not understood, but there are clear genetic associations which,\n      in the context of predisposing environmental factors, such as infections, may lead to\n      development of disease. There are no diagnostic criteria for AAV, but there are validated\n      classification criteria and disease definitions. There is a need to find biological markers\n      that define immunological tolerance so that immunotherapy medicines may be correctly changed\n      and safely withdrawn in some people."
