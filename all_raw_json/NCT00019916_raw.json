It is not yet\n      known whether combining vaccine therapy with interleukin-2 is effective in treating breast\n      and ovarian cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of vaccine therapy\n      and interleukin-2 and to see how well they work in treating women with stage IV, recurrent,\n      or progressive breast or ovarian cancer."

Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment\n      arms.\n\n      All patients undergo apheresis of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which are\n      harvested and selected for monocytes on day -6. The monocyte fraction is cultured with\n      sargramostim (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 for 7 days and then pulsed with p53 peptide vaccine.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive p53 peptide vaccine subcutaneously (SC) on day 1.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive p53 peptide vaccine IV over 5 minutes on day 1. Treatment in\n           both arms repeats every 3 weeks for a total of 4 vaccinations (4 courses). During\n           courses 3 and 4, patients also receive low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) SC daily on days\n           3-7 and days 10-14. Patients with stable or responding disease may continue to receive\n           vaccine and IL-2 treatment for up to 2 years.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 2-4 months for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 34 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
