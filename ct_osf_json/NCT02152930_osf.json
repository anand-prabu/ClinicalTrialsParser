    "description": "\n      Intermittent claudication (IC) is caused by peripheral arterial disease and has a high\n      morbidity and mortality. Etiologic factors are similar to those of cardiovascular disease.\n      Primary treatment consists of cardiovascular risk management and improvement of functional\n      capacity with supervised exercise therapy (SET). A potential additional therapy is the\n      administration of fish oil supplements containing high amounts of omega-3 Poly Unsaturated\n      Fatty Acids (PUFAs). In earlier clinical and experimental trials omega-3 PUFA's improved\n      hemorheological parameters such as erythrocyte deformability and aggregation, and a number\n      of cardiovascular risk factors. Hemorheological parameters determine the blood flow in the\n      microcirculation, which is of main importance in patients with IC since the macrocirculation\n      is compromised. Inflammation is considered an important etiologic factor in the pathogenesis\n      of atherosclerosis and contributes to peripheral arterial disease Since omega-3 PUFAs also\n      have a strong anti-inflammatory effect, they might be effective in patients with IC by\n      lowering the inflammatory response. In addition, visceral fat rather than obesity in general\n      has been recognised as an etiologic and prognostic factor in atherosclerosis.\n\n      We hypothesise that the administration of omega-3 PUFA's in patients with IC has a\n      synergistic effect with SET and improves walking distance after SET, by improving\n      hemorheological parameters resulting in a better microcirculation. Second, we hypothesise\n      that omega-3 PUFA's result in a less proinflammatory of whole blood in response to ex vivo\n      stimulation with endotoxin. Third, we hypothesise that omega-3 PUFA's and SET result in a\n      decrease in visceral fat mass.\n    ",
