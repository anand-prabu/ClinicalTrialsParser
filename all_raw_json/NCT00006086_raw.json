Treatment repeats every 21 days for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-188797 until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 6\n      patients experience dose limiting toxicities.\n\n      Patients are followed for 4 weeks, and then every 3 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 35 patients will be accrued for this study over 12 months."
