Tumor blocks will be reviewed in order to determine the relationship of the\n      activated form of the PR (APR) to preliminary anti-tumor  activity, with the eventual\n      objective of developing a companion diagnostic, which could permit enrichment of the\n      responder population in patients with PR-positive tumors. Patients will be treated until\n      occurrence of an intolerable safety issue, treatment failure, if patient elects to withdraw,\n      or for non-compliance with either protocol specified evaluations or onapristone treatment.\n      An additional cohort of patients will be included at the recommended phase 2 dose to gain\n      additional understanding of the onapristone safety profile and potential anti-tumor\n      activity."
