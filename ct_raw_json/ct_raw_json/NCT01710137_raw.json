Rates of tobacco use\n      among individuals with HIV/AIDS are very high and varenicline may be particularly\n      efficacious for treating nicotine dependence among individuals with HIV/AIDS.

The\n      investigators hypothesize that 1) varenicline and counseling will significantly increase\n      end-of-treatment (week 12) and 24-week biochemically-confirmed abstinence, versus placebo\n      and counseling; 2) quality of life will be rated higher in the varenicline and counseling\n      group versus the placebo and counseling group, and there will be no significant differences\n      between treatment arms in terms of the frequency of severe varenicline-related side effects;\n      and 3) improved affect and reduced cognitive impairment will mediate the effect of\n      varenicline therapy on quit rates."

            "textblock": "Among people diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, the widespread use of highly active antiretroviral\n      therapy (HAART) has greatly improved survival rates and changed the leading causes of death,\n      from AIDS-related diseases (e.g., non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Kaposi sarcoma), to cardiovascular\n      disease and lung cancer. As such, addressing modifiable risk factors for disease mortality\n      among those with HIV/AIDS, including tobacco use, has become a critical priority. To date,\n      only three smoking cessation clinical trials have been conducted with those with HIV/AIDS\n      none of which investigated the efficacy of FDA-approved medications for nicotine dependence.\n      Varenicline is an \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist with greater\n      efficacy for treating nicotine dependence than bupropion or nicotine patch. Varenicline may\n      be particularly efficacious for treating nicotine dependence among individuals with HIV/AIDS\n      given that depression symptoms and cognitive impairment are common in this population,\n      increase during smoking abstinence and predict smoking relapse, and are significantly\n      reduced by varenicline. Therefore, the investigators will conduct a randomized,\n      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of varenicline with smokers with HIV/AIDS.\n      Specifically, 310 smokers with HIV/AIDS will be randomized to varenicline plus 9 weeks of\n      smoking cessation counseling or placebo plus 9 weeks of smoking cessation counseling. The\n      primary outcome variable for this study will be 7-day biochemically confirmed tobacco\n      abstinence at weeks 12 and 24. Secondary outcomes include: prolonged abstinence to week 12,\n      18, and 24 (relapse defined as 7 consecutive days of self-reported smoking, after a 2-week\n      grace period), continuous abstinence at weeks 12 and 24 (e.g., no smoking between quit day\n      and follow-up), time to 7-day relapse (no grace period), and lapse and recovery events. The\n      trial results may support the use of varenicline for the treatment of nicotine dependence\n      among those with HIV/AIDS, thereby reducing tobacco-related morbidity and mortality in this\n      population."
