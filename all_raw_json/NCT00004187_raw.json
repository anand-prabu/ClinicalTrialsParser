            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of capecitabine when combined with\n      oxaliplatin in patients with chemotherapy naive or thymidylate synthase inhibitor pretreated\n      unresectable, advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer. II. Determine the safety profile,\n      toxicity, and efficacy of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the complete and\n      partial remission rates, time to treatment failure, and overall survival of patients treated\n      with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study of capecitabine. Patients are\n      stratified by pretreatment status (any pretreatment vs chemotherapy naive vs thymidylate\n      synthase inhibitor pretreatment). Phase I : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on\n      day 1 and oral capecitabine every 12 hours on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive\n      escalating doses of capecitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The\n      MTD is defined as the highest dose at which 2 or more of 6 patients experience dose limiting\n      toxicity. Phase II: Patients receive capecitabine at the feasible dose. The feasible dose is\n      defined as the dose immediately preceding the MTD from phase I. Patients are followed every\n      3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18 patients will be accrued for phase I of the study and a\n      total of 27-68 patients (14-25 thymidylate synthase inhibitor pretreated patients and 13-43\n      chemotherapy naive patients) will be accrued for phase II of the study."
