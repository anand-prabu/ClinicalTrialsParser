For these\n      patients, laparoscopy represents the last diagnostic step after medical history negative for\n      gastrointestinal, urological, musculoskeletal and psychoneurological disorders related to\n      pelvic pain, physical examination, ultrasonographic assessment and laboratory testing. From\n      all patients, at enrollment, blood samples for serum CA125 determination will be taken\n      during the early follicular phase (2nd-3rd day of the menstrual cycle) and VAS score for\n      menstrual pain will be assessed.  Electrochemiluminescence  immunoassay (Immunoassay Elecsys\n      Systems, Roche Diagnostics, Italy) for serum CA125 assay will be used (kit coefficient of\n      variation between-run 0.0% and within-run 2.0%).\n\n      During the time passed on surgery waiting list, patients will received leuprolide acetate\n      depot (LAD) at a dose of 3.75 mg IM at the 21st day of the menstrual cycle. One month later\n      LAD administration, serum CA125 levels and VAS score will be assessed again, and then the\n      surgical procedure will be performed in all these patients.\n\n      After laparoscopy and definitive histological examination, the population initially enrolled\n      will be sub-grouped according to endometriosis diagnosis in two groups, i.e. group 1\n      (subjects with endometriosis) and group 2 (subjects without endometriosis)."
