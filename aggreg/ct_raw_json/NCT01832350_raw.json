The primary objective will be evaluated using a study\n      endpoint at 1, 13, 26 weeks after initiation of treatment. The secondary objective of this\n      study is to evaluate the benefit of treatment with Nuedexta (20/10) on cognition and\n      functionality as demonstrated in the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Trail making\n      A and B, Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) logical memory and delayed recall, Controlled Oral Word\n      Association (COWA), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI),\n      Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCSADL) and the\n      11-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscore (ADAS-Cog11)."
