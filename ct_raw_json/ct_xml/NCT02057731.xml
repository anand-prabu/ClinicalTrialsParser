  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether carrier status for any type of glycogen
      storage disease (GSD) predisposes the carrier to GSD markers, like high cholesterol, by
      testing blood, urine, and saliva samples.

      Subjects will be asked to contribute about half a tablespoon of blood, 1 oz of urine, and 2
      tablespoons of saliva samples in the morning before they have had anything to eat. The blood
      and urine samples will be tested for the markers of GSD, while the saliva sample will be
      used for genetic testing. Subjects' height and weight will also be measured.

      Subjects will also be asked to fill out a questionnaire about symptoms common to full GSD
      expression that they may have experienced, as well as if they are currently on any
      medication to control their cholesterol.
