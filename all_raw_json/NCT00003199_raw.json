Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy, such as busulfan, melphalan, and thiotepa, work in different ways to stop the\n      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. A\n      peripheral stem cell transplant may be able to replace blood-forming cells that were\n      destroyed by chemotherapy. This may allow more chemotherapy to be given so that more tumor\n      cells are killed.  Aldesleukin may stimulate the white blood cells to kill breast cancer\n      cells. Giving aldesleukin together with  sargramostim may kill more tumor cells"
