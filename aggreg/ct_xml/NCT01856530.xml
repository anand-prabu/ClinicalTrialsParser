  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about how the hormone, oxytocin, impacts social
      behavior in terms of cooperation with others, attention processing, and reward processing,
      among patients with social anxiety disorder. Based on available research, the investigators
      predict that in patients with social anxiety disorder, oxytocin will improve social
      cooperation during an online ball-tossing game called Cyberball, reduce attention toward
      socially threatening cues during a dot-probe task, and lead to greater willingness to work
      for monetary rewards for others rather than themselves during an effort expenditure task.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males &gt; 18 years of age with a primary (or co-principal) psychiatric diagnosis of
             social anxiety disorder (SAD), as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV

             SAD is primary (the disorder that is most distressing to the patient). Inclusion of
             patients with comorbidity will permit accrual of a more clinically relevant patient
             population;

          -  Willingness to participate in and comply with the study procedures as indicated by
             signing the informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a serious medical illness for which hospitalization may be likely
             within the next three months;

          -  Subjects with a current diagnosis of schizophrenia, psychotic disorders, bipolar
             disorder, mental disorder due to a medical condition or substance, substance abuse or
             dependence, as diagnosed by DSM-IV criteria;

          -  Concurrent use of other psychotropic medications is excluded, except for
             antidepressants that have been taken at a stable dose for at least 2 weeks;

          -  Active suicidal or homicidal ideation or suicide attempts within the past six months
             requiring hospitalization;

          -  Subjects with significant nasal pathology (atrophic rhinitis, recurrent nose bleeds,

          -  Smokers who smoke more than 15 cigarettes per day;

          -  Those who smoke cigarettes or have caffeine or alcohol within 24 hours of the study
