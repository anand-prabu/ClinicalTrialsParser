A\n      screening visit will take place maximally 30 days prior to surgery.\n\n      Randomization will occur maximally 7 days prior to the mastectomy procedure. As some women\n      may have to undergo bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction, the randomization scheme will\n      ensure that both breasts will be reconstructed with the same surgical approach.\n\n      The Day of Surgery consists of both a mastectomy and a breast reconstruction. The surgical\n      site and the breasts will be evaluated on the day of hospital discharge and at postoperative\n      days 14 and 30 for all patients after each hospital admission. During these visits, the\n      breasts will be examined and an Acute Inflammatory Assessment (AIR) will be completed. In\n      addition the breast flaps and incisions will be evaluated for signs of infection, seroma,\n      hematoma or skin necrosis."
