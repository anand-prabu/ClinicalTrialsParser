After this, both groups will  performed more 30 minutes of balance\n      training: the control group will performed balance exercises without external cues, visual\n      or auditory feedbacks or cognitive stimulations; the experimental group will performed the\n      balance training with 10 Wii Fit games which stimulate motor and cognitive functions. The\n      main outcome measures will be: (1) the lower limb subscale of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment\n      (FMA-LE); (2) Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (3); Balance Evaluation Systems Test\n      (BESTest) and  (4) 6- minute walk test (6MWT)."
