  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of nilotinib 300mg twice
      daily in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia chronic phase who are intolerant but
      responsive to 1st line treatment with imatinib or dasatinib. Eligible patients have been
      previously treated with imatinib or dasatinib for at least 3 months and are experiencing
      non-hematologic toxicity whilst having documented responses that meet PBS authority for 1st
      line treatment of CML without current MR4.5.

          1. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Grou (ECOG) Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2.

          2. Patient with diagnosis of Ph+ CML-CP associated with BCR-ABL quantifiable by RQ-PCR
             (IS).

          3. Patient has received a minimum of 3 months of imatinib or dasatinib treatment (any
             dose) since initial diagnosis with a documented response.

          4. Patient is eligible for Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) reimbursed 1st line TKI
             treatment.

          5. Patient has experienced non-hematological Adverse Events (AE(s)) of any grade, which
             persisted for at least 1 month despite supportive care or recurred at any grade at
             least once.

          6. No other current or planned anti-leukemia therapies.

          7. Adequate organ function.

          8. Potassium, Magnesium and Total Calcium above Lower limit of normal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior treatment with nilotinib.

          2. Prior Accelerated Phase (AP), Blast Crisis (BC) or allogeneic-transplant (unless the
             patient received an autologous transplant and was in Chrionic Phase (CP) prior to
             transplant and never in AP or BC).

          3. Patient has failed prior 1st line treatment in terms of the PBS reimbursement
             criteria.

          4. Patient has documented Molecular Response (MR) 4.5 at the time of study entry

          5. Patients with atypical BCR-ABL transcript not quantifiable by standard RQ-PCR.

          6. Known impaired cardiac function.

          7. Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly
             alter the absorption of study drug.

          8. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women.

          9. Women of child-bearing potential unwilling or unable to use highly effective
