            "textblock": "Pelvic girdle pain (PGP) occurs in an estimated 70% of pregnant women, of whom 25% have\n      severe pain and 8% significant disability. Current methods of management, such as the use of\n      rigid pelvic belts, are limited in their effectiveness. The Dynamic Elastomeric Fabric\n      Orthoses (DEFO) has recently proven beneficial in managing PGP in athletes. There is a need\n      to explore the potential use of DEFO for managing PGP during pregnancy. The primary aim of\n      the study is to compare the effectiveness of a DEFO to a rigid 'off the shelf' pelvic\n      support belt in terms of its effectiveness in reducing PGP during pregnancy. The secondary\n      aims of the study are to compare the effectiveness of the DEFO to the rigid 'off the shelf'\n      pelvic support belt in (a) optimizing activity levels in pregnant women with PGP,\n      (b)improving quality of life for pregnant women with PGP. The relative cost effectiveness of\n      these two interventions will also be compared."
