            "textblock": "Overweight and excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) is associated with increased risk of\n      high birth weight; furthermore there is increased risk of the child developing overweight,\n      diabetes and other metabolic diseases in childhood or adulthood. The effect of reducing\n      gestational weight gain while supplying optimized amount and sources of nutrients is not\n      well investigated. Increased knowledge to the possibility and efficacy of preventing\n      overweight and related diseases is necessary. Modification of protein source and increase in\n      ratio of protein in relation to amount of carbohydrate and reduction of glycaemic index (GI)\n      has in observational studies individually been linked to improved fetal body composition,\n      metabolism and weight control later in life, and less weight gain and weight retention for\n      the mother. The overall aim of APPROACH is to investigate how an optimal diet during\n      pregnancy influences the programming of the offspring. This study will increase the\n      knowledge of the effect of a specific nutrient composition and weight retention during\n      pregnancy on growth and development during the foetal stage and until nine years off age,\n      risk markers later metabolic diseases, especially diabetes and metabolic syndrome. APPROACH\n      will be a dietary intervention investigating differences in responds to a high-protein,\n      especially marine and dairy protein and low-GI diet versus a diet according to the Nordic\n      Nutritional Recommendations. All visits and assessment will be performed by trained staff at\n      Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev. Subjects will be women with expected delivery at\n      Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics and all examinations of gestational development and\n      foetal growth will take place her; assessment of the children will be performed at the\n      Department of Paediatrics. A total of 390 obese (body mass index (BMI) \u2265 30 kg/m2) pregnant\n      women will be randomized to intervention or control and engage in the program from late\n      first trimester or early second trimester to birth. After birth the children will be\n      included in a prospective cohort according to maternal randomization and examined six times\n      from delivery until the age of nine years. APPROACH will increase the knowledge of the\n      effect of a nutrient composition with high protein for carbohydrate ratio and weight\n      retention during pregnancy on growth and development during the foetal stage and until nine\n      years off age, risk markers later metabolic diseases, especially diabetes and metabolic\n      syndrome. Plasma lipids, markers of metabolic diseases, epigenetics and vitamin D status\n      will be assessed at baseline and several times during pregnancy; and in both intervention\n      and control group these data will increase the knowledge of the effect of supplementing with\n      marine oils and vitamin D in pregnant women. Results from the intervention will be\n      communicated to the general population and published in peer-relieved journals."
