  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will prospectively enroll approximately 660 children, at least 18 months and less
      than 5 years of age, who have been referred to a pediatric developmental evaluation centers.
       Enrolled children will have blood drawn for RNA gene expression analysis and undergo a
      clinical evaluation to determine the presence or absence of a diagnosis of ASD.

      The sequential co-primary objectives of this study are:

        -  To develop an algorithm to classify blood RNA gene expression patterns to maximize
           agreement between the classification and a clinical assessment of presence or absence
           of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).

        -  To prospectively assess the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the blood RNA gene
           expression classification algorithm (the SDX-002 test) in children referred to a
           developmental evaluation clinic for a possible developmental disorder.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Referred to a developmental evaluation centers for evaluation of a possible
             developmental disorder, other than isolated motor problems.

          2. Age &gt;= 18 months and &lt; 5 years.

          3. Parent/legal guardian has been informed about the study and has signed an informed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior reliable diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (i.e. prior evaluation by a
             multi-disciplinary team has already reliably established Autism Spectrum Disorder
             diagnosis).
