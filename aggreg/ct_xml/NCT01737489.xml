  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if aural rehabilitation adds measurable benefit
      and participant satisfaction to a cochlear implant recipient's overall treatment. Also, the
      study is designed to compare the efficacy of a commercially available aural rehabilitation
      program (LACE) and an electronic program which takes advantage of a traditional form of
      auditory training (NOOK) for cochlear implant users.
