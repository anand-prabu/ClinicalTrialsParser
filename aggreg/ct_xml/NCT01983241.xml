  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind clinical study to
      assess the efficacy and safety of two separate dose regimens of Alpha-1 MP versus placebo
      for 156 weeks (i.e., 3 years) using computed tomography (CT) of the lungs as the main
      measure of efficacy. The two Alpha-1 MP doses to be tested are 60 mg/kg and 120 mg/kg
      administered weekly by IV infusion for 156 weeks. The study consists of an up to 21-day
      Screening Phase, a 156-week Treatment Phase, and an End of Study Visit at Week 160.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a documented total alpha1-PI serum level &lt; 11 µM.

          -  Have a diagnosis of congenital AATD with an allelic combination of ZZ, SZ, Z(null),
             (null)(null), S(null), or &quot;at-risk&quot; alleles.

          -  At the Screening (Week -3) Visit, have a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume
             in 1 second (FEV1) ≥ 30% and &lt; 80% of predicted and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC)
             &lt; 70% (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] stage II or
             III).

          -  Have a carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) ≤ 60% of predicted (corrected for
             HgB) within the past 2 years OR evidence of pulmonary emphysema on CT scan within the
             past 2 years per the Investigator's judgment.

          -  Have clinical evidence of pulmonary emphysema per the Investigator's judgment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has received alpha1-PI augmentation therapy for more than 1 month within the six
             months prior to the Screening Visit.

          -  Has received alpha1-PI augmentation therapy within one month of the Screening Visit.

          -  Has had a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation within the 5
             weeks prior to the Screening Visit or during the Screening Phase.

          -  Unable to physically (e.g., unable to fit inside the CT scanner) or mentally (e.g.,
             claustrophobic) undergo a CT scan.

          -  History of lung or liver transplant.

          -  Any lung surgery during the past 2 years (excluding lung biopsy).

          -  On the waiting list for lung surgery, including lung transplant.

          -  Smoking during the past 12 months or a positive urine cotinine test at screening that
             is due to smoking.

          -  History of anaphylaxis or severe systemic response to any plasma-derived alpha1-PI
             preparation or other blood product(s).

          -  Use of systemic steroids above a stable dose equivalent to 5 mg/day prednisone (i.e.,
             10 mg every 2 days) within the 5 weeks prior to the Screening Visit (inhaled steroids
             are not considered systemic steroids) or during the Screening Phase.

          -  Use of systemic or aerosolized antibiotics for a COPD exacerbation within the 5 weeks
             prior to the Screening Visit or during the Screening Phase.

          -  Known selective or severe Immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency.
