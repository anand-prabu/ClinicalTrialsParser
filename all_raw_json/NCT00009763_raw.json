Combining monoclonal antibody\n      therapy with cyclosporine and paclitaxel may be an effective treatment for metastatic breast\n      cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody\n      therapy, cyclosporine, and paclitaxel in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory\n      metastatic breast cancer."

A minimum of 6 million CD34+ cells/kg must be\n      harvested.\n\n      Patients receive oral cyclosporine every 12 hours on days -3 to 25. Patients receive\n      unlabeled monoclonal antibody (MOAB) m170 IV followed by a tracer dose of indium In 111 MOAB\n      m170 IV on day 0. On day 7, patients receive unlabeled MOAB m170 IV followed by Y90 MOAB\n      m170 IV. Patients in cohorts 2-4 also receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 9.\n\n      If needed, patients undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 21\n      and receive G-CSF SC daily until blood counts recover.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Y90 MOAB m170 until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2\n      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6\n      months for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 36\n      months."
