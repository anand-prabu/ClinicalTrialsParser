Therefore,\n      minimally invasive surgery should be an effective treatment method for elderly patients. The\n      investigators conducted a randomized trial that compared laparoscopic surgery and\n      conventional open surgery in elderly patients who were 75 years old or over. The purpose of\n      the present study was to clarify the effect of laparoscopic surgery in elderly patients. In\n      our hypothesis of this trial, laparoscopic surgery is superior to conventional open surgery\n      in short-term results, and same outcome in long -term results. Therefore, laparoscopic\n      surgery would be recommended as standard procedure in an elderly colorectal patient."

That is, intestinal\n           excision with lymph node dissection that separated the feeding blood vessel at its\n           origin was performed in all surgical procedures. Patients who underwent palliative\n           partial excision were not included.\n\n        -  In the laparoscopic surgery, a medial-to-lateral approach was performed in all\n           patients.\n\n        -  In the conventional open surgery, the first procedure was done in lateral approach. The\n           reconstruction techniques were the same as those used in laparoscopic surgery.\n\n      Randomization\n\n        -  To balance the operative backgrounds between the laparoscopic and the conventional open\n           surgery groups, the patients were stratified by the tumor location (right colon, left\n           colon and rectum).\n\n        -  A transverse colon cancer was allocated to the right colon group, and a rectosigmoid\n           cancer was allocated to the rectum group.\n\n      Adjuvant therapy\n\n        -  When the pathological stage was diagnosed as stage 3 by histological examination of the\n           resected specimen, adjuvant chemotherapy was done with oral fluoropyrimidine\n           anti-cancer drug.\n\n        -  Neither radiation therapy nor preoperative chemotherapy was given to any patient.\n           Preoperative chemo-radiotherapy even for rectal cancer is not yet standard treatment in\n           Japan.\n\n      Assessment parameters\n\n        -  The preoperative parameters\n\n        -  Operative assessment parameters\n\n        -  Postoperative assessment parameters An early postoperative complication was defined as\n           a complication that occurred between the finish of the operation and postoperative day\n           30. A late postoperative complication was defined as a complication that occurred after\n           postoperative day 30. The terminologies of complications were classified according to\n           the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, and grading was\n           done by Classification of Surgical Complication.\n\n        -  The pathological results were recorded according to the 7th edition of the Japanese\n           General Rules for Clinical and Pathological Studies on Cancer of the Colon, Rectum and\n           Anus and 7th edition of primary tumor, regional nodes, metastasis (TNM) classification.\n           Circumferential margin involvement was defined as exposure of a cancer cell at the\n           vertical dissection surface on histological examination.\n\n        -  Quality of life (QOL) scores. The QOL score was measured using the 36-item Short Form\n           Health Survey (SF-36) version 2.0. It is a tool that measures health-related QOL\n           (HRQOL) according to an inclusive standard and not a disease-specific standard. The\n           SF-36 is composed of 36 questions. The score is expressed numerically by the provided\n           scoring algorithm. SF-36 questionnaires were sent to the patients at one month, 6\n           months and one year after the surgery by postal mail. A return envelope was enclosed\n           with the SF-36 questionnaire, and the patient sent it back to the research secretariat\n           by postal mail. A questionnaire on the defecation situation and wound pain besides the\n           SF-36 was added all three times. The question of when complete rehabilitation occurred\n           was added in the questionnaire at one year.\n\n      Follow-up schedule\n\n      - The follow-up schedule was as follows according to stage. Patients with stages 0 and 1\n      were followed up with outpatient examinations including tumor marker measurements, and\n      chest, abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) once a year for five years. Patients\n      with stage 2 and 3a were examined by CT and tumor marker measurements every six months for\n      the first two years. These examinations were done once a year from the third year to the\n      fifth year. Patients with stage 3b and 3c were examined by CT and tumor marker measurements\n      every four months for the first two years, and every six months from the third year to the\n      fifth year.\n\n      Statistical analysis\n\n        -  The primary endpoint was early complication rate.\n\n        -  The secondary endpoints were 5-year overall survival, 3-year recurrence-free survival,\n           length of postoperative hospital stay, and HRQOL score.\n\n        -  A sample size of 200 patients was assured to achieve a power of more than 80% to detect\n           a difference between the groups using a two-sided Chi-squared test with type I error\n           rate equal to 0.05, when the true complication rates were 20% and 40% for the\n           laparoscopic and open surgeries, respectively.\n\n        -  For continuous variables, data are presented as means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). For\n           categorical variables, data are presented as frequencies and percentages (%).\n           Comparison of the endpoints was based on intention-to-treat principle, that is, the\n           patients who switched to another group during surgery were treated as members of the\n           allocated group. The Chi-squared test was applied to evaluate the significance of\n           differences in proportions, and t-test was used to evaluate the significance of\n           differences in continuous variables. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered to be\n           statistically significant."
