    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 2-stage, 2-cohort Phase 2 trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of BMN 673 in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with a deleterious
      germline BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutation.  Subjects will be assigned to either Cohort 1 or 2 based
      on prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease:

        -  Cohort 1) Subjects who have previously responded to platinum-containing regimen for
           metastatic disease with disease progression &gt; 8 weeks following the last dose of
           platinum; or

        -  Cohort 2) Subjects who have received &gt; 2 chemotherapy regimens and who have had no
           prior platinum therapy for metastatic disease
