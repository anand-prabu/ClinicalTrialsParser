Recently, Pulpkin Seed Oil shows some improved clinical efficacy on scalp hair growth\n      in men with androgenetic alopecia, but there is no evidence to support this.\n\n      The investigators conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and\n      tolerability trial of Pumpkin seed oil (400mg/day)therapy in male patients with androgenetic\n      alopecia."
