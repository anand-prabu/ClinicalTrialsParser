  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use of drugs is an important factor in secondary prophylaxis after transient ischemic attack
      (TIA), but studies show that adherence to the prescribed drugs is often poor. This
      randomised controlled trial aims to investigate whether a systematic follow up of drug
      treatment using medication reconciliation, medication reviews and patient counselling by
      clinical pharmacists, improves adherence and/or decreases cardiovascular events the first
      three months and the first year after TIA. Patient satisfaction will also be compared
      between the two groups.
