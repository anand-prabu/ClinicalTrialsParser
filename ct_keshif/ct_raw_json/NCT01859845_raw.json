Along with the projected images, the coordinator will provide each control participant with worksheets for the clinical Asymmetry, Border, Color, Diameter (ABCD) and Dermoscopy 3-point check list. A copy of the completed worksheet will be made at the end of the workshop."

            "textblock": "Age-adjusted melanoma incidence among Caucasians has risen from 7.5 to 21.9 cases per\n      100,000 representing an increase of nearly 200% over 30 years. In contrast to other cancers\n      (i.e. colorectal, prostate, cervical), melanoma is detected by intentional visual skin\n      inspection. Intentional screening is the deliberate visual inspection of all cutaneous\n      surfaces. However, fewer than 30% of primary care physicians (PCPs) reported training in\n      skin cancer during their medical education. Early detection of melanoma by PCPs cannot be\n      expected to improve without addressing both the PCPs' lack of training and their low\n      confidence in examination skills pertaining to pigmented lesion exams. A focused\n      intervention is required to improve PCPs' early detection of melanoma and mitigate the\n      near-term consequences of an aging US population.\n\n      Opportunistic surveillance requires skills in both unaided visual inspection of the skin and\n      in dermoscopy of lesions. Dermoscopy\u2014a hand-held magnifying device that assists with\n      diagnosis\u2014reduces the number of unnecessary biopsies and improves the clinical sensitivity\n      of diagnosing melanoma. Studies show that Australian PCPs trained to use a \"three-point\n      checklist of dermoscopy,\" developed biopsy ratios of benign to malignant lesions of 8:1 in\n      the general population, which is comparable to dermatologists using dermoscopy. In 2009, the\n      American Academy of Family Physicians held their first dermoscopy course at their Annual\n      Scientific Meeting, and there is continuing demand for similar courses. By making dermoscopy\n      customary for PCPs, PCPs will be able to detect melanomas opportunistically and render care\n      to the at-risk population of elderly for whom they provide care. Smart-touchscreen\n      technologies can potentially provide a safe environment for medical trainees to learn\n      procedural and screening skills that are rarely available opportunities in the clinic. As\n      such, these technologies may lead to better health outcomes in future populations.\n\n      In this study, eighty 3rd year medical and thirty 1st year physician's assistant students\n      participate in a visual screening and dermoscopy curriculum aimed at improving the retention\n      rate of the learned clinical skills. After a didactic lecture on melanoma screening,\n      participants are randomized to either a control or an experimental study arm for the\n      clinical skills workshop. The control arm represents our previously published clinical\n      skills training workshop (IRB STU 0002705) in which participants interact with a simulated\n      patient model presenting with pigment lesions and review dermoscopy images on a projector\n      screen. In the experimental arm, the projector-based learning approach is replaced with a\n      handheld touchscreen device (smartphone) preloaded with interactive melanoma screening\n      tutorial. The smartphone provides instant feedback and remediation of improper clinical\n      management decisions. Across both groups, all learning content remains similar. Further\n      deliberate practice questions provided to the control arm are standardized while the\n      experimental arm's questions are individualized based on weaknesses determined in the\n      smartphone software."
