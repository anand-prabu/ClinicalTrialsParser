  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical research study designed to determine the safety and efficacy of the
      application of a unique interstitial radio frequency thermal therapy for the treatment of
      large tumours in the kidney or liver.  The novel device offers patients a more effective
      therapy than conventional RFA and for patients with large tumours fewer number of treatments
      and  needle insertion sites. The clinical treatment volumes (or sites of focal tumours) will
      be determined by a combination of biopsy and contrast enhanced CT imaging.

      The study will assess if novel device can produce lesions in the liver or kidney in a
      controlled and predictable manner and with sufficient size to effectively manage disease
      progression in the organ. The extent of lesion size at a delivered power setting and
      treatment time will be measured with post-treatment CT or MRI and biopsy as measures of
      tissue response

    <intervention_name>RFA Loosely wound thermal coil</intervention_name>
    <description>This new device uses radiofrequency energy to destroy kidney or liver tumours. It is called radiofrequency ablation.
This type of energy is simply an alternating current that passes from a coil (electrode) into the tissue causing heating of the tissue in the vicinity of the electrode.</description>
