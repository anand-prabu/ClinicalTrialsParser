Items are rated on a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (very little) to 4 (very much) and a total score is computed by summing all items. The ASI is hierarchical in structure with one higher order factor (AS) and three subfactors (physical, cognitive, and social concerns). The physical concerns subscale includes items related to the fear of consequences or presence of specific physical sensations (e.g. \"When I notice that my heart is beating rapidly, I worry that I might have a heart attack\"). The cognitive concerns subscale includes items related to potential mental health implications of sensations (e.g. \"When I cannot keep my mind on a task, I worry that I might be going crazy\"). The social concerns subscale includes items related to the potential social consequences of physical sensations (e.g. \"It is important to me not to appear nervous\").",
