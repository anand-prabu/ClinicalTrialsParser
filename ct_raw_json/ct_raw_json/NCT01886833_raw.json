            "textblock": "Zambia recently introduced routine infant immunization against rotavirus - the most\n      important cause of severe gastroenteritis and diarrhoea mortality in children. Although\n      vaccines like Rotarix are a cost effective tool against infectious diseases, live oral\n      vaccines can be less immunogenic and efficacious in developing world settings as compared\n      with industrialized countries. Reasons behind this phenomenon are not well understood, but\n      may relate to continued maternal antigen exposure and high level maternal immunity that is\n      passed to the foetus/newborn transplacentally and/or through breast milk.\n\n      Therefore, three arising hypotheses include: (i) high-level rotavirus-specific maternal\n      immunity (in the form of anti-rotavirus breast-milk IgA and transplacental serum IgG) is a\n      major contributor to failed seroconversion following infant vaccination. (ii) Malnutrition\n      negatively impacts infant immunity and increases the risk of post-vaccination rotavirus\n      gastroenteritis. (iii) Introduction of rotavirus vaccine will alter the molecular\n      epidemiology of circulating rotavirus strains detected in vaccinated children presenting\n      with severe diarrhea.\n\n      To address these hypotheses, the proposed study will recruit a prospective cohort of 420\n      mother-infant pairs. These will be enrolled at the time of vaccination and followed for up\n      to four years. Baseline immunological status will be ascertained and seroconversion rates\n      determined a month after full immunization. Incident rotavirus gastroenteritis will be\n      monitored in the vaccinated infants whenever episodes of diarrhoea occur; through this\n      surveillance, the sero-strains of rotaviruses causing disease will be tracked over the four\n      year period. Contributions of HIV infection both in mothers and infants, vitamin A and zinc\n      deficiency, weight for age Z-scores as well as mid upper arm circumference will also be\n      assessed. Knowledge gained from this study will inform future interventional trials on\n      strategies to improve rotavirus vaccine effectiveness in the developing world."

If referral is required, the child will be referred to outpatient clinic, or in\n      serious cases the University Teaching Hospital.\n\n      Laboratory Methods.\n\n        1. Detection of Rotavirus-specific IgA and IgG will occur by ELISA. Detection of\n           rotavirus-specific IgA and IgG will occur by ELISA. Briefly, the procedure is as\n           follows. Microplate wells (e.g., Nunc Immuno I) are incubated with purified viral\n           antigen preparations, then washed with phosphate buffered saline with Tween detergent\n           (PBS-T). Serum and breast-milk samples are diluted serially (in PBS-T containing 1%\n           bovine serum albumin) and incubated in the coated microplates for 2 hours at 37oC then\n           overnight at 4oC. Microplates are then washed and peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgA\n           or IgG goat antibodies (Sigma Immunochemicals) is added. The reaction is then\n           terminated with H2SO4, and optical density is measured by EIA plate reader.  All\n           samples are assayed in duplicate against each viral antigen and against a control\n           antigen. A test well was considered positive by its optical density at 450 nm, e.g., if\n           it is greater than or equal to two times that of its own control. Specificity is\n           controlled by including wells containing control antigen incubated in the absence of\n           the sample, and sensitivity is checked by including wells containing viral antigen\n           incubated in the presence of samples known to contain high titre of a particular\n           rotavirus-specific immunoglobulin class.\n\n        2. Detection of Rotavirus Antigen will occur by Rotaclone ELISA. Stool samples will be\n           tested for rotavirus by ELISA (Rotaclone\u00ae, Meridian Biosciences) according to\n           manufacturer's specifications. Briefly, sample will be brought to room temperature and\n           diluted with buffered saline with 0.02% thimerosol. Diluted sample and enzyme conjugate\n           are then incubated with a monoclonal antibody to the VP6 protein within the Rotaclone\n           microplate. Substrate buffers containing urea peroxide and tetramethylbenzidine are\n           then added, and the reaction is terminated with H2SO4. Spectrophotometric determination\n           of result is then made by measuring absorbance at 450 nm against an air blank.\n           Specimens with absorbance units (A450) greater than 0.150 are considered positive.\n           Those with absorbance equal to or below 0.150 are considered negative.\n\n      3 Determination of Rotavirus VP7 Genotype. Viral RNA is extracted from a 10% suspension of\n      rotavirus antigen-positive faecal material in PBS (pH 7.0) using TRIzolTM Reagent (GIBCO\n      Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Viral RNA is then taken through\n      RT-PCR as described earlier.\n\n      Extracted viral RNA is then taken through nested PCR utilizing primers which are\n      complimentary to the 3' ends of both viral RNA strands within gene segment 9, which encodes\n      viral protein 7 (VP7). These primers are used for first strand synthesis. Primer RVG9 and\n      six serotype-specific primers (aBT1, aCT2, aET3, aDT4, aAT8, and aFT9) which are located in\n      six variable regions on the gene 9 and correspond to G-serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 9, are\n      used in second amplification. Briefly, 5 \u00b5l of RNA with 25 pmol of each primer Beg9 and End9\n      is denatured for 5 min at 97\u00b0C and cooled on ice. Thereafter, 8 \u00b5l of RT reaction mixture\n      containing 1.5 \u00b5l of 10X PCR buffer (500 mM KCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 2 \u00b5l of 25 mM\n      MgCl2, 2 \u00b5l of 2.5 mM of each dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP, 10 U AMV reverse transcriptase\n      (Promega) and 20 U Rnasin ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega), is added to the sample-primer\n      mixture and incubated at 42\u00b0C for 60 min. PCR buffer mixture (35 \u00b5l), containing 3.5 \u00b5l of\n      10X PCR buffer, 2 \u00b5l of 2.5 mM peach dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP, 2.5 U Ampli Taq DNA\n      polymerase (Perkin Elmer) and 27 \u00b5l of water are added to RT reaction. The reaction mixture\n      is denatured at 94\u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles (1 min at 94\u00b0C, 2 min at 42\u00b0C, 3 min\n      at 72\u00b0C) and a final extension of 5 min at 72\u00b0C.\n\n      First-round PCR products (2 \u00b5l) are transferred to 48 \u00b5l of second PCR reaction mixture,\n      containing 5 \u00b5l of 10X PCR buffer, 25 pmol each primers aBT1, aCT2, aET3, aDT4, aAT8, aFT9\n      and RVG9, 0.2 mM each dATP, dGTP, dCTP and dTTP, 2mM MgCl2, 2.5 U of Taq polymerase.\n      Second-round cycling conditions are identical to first round, except that only 25 cycles are\n      run. The PCR products are analyzed by gel electrophoresis to identify expected lengths of\n      amplified VP7, allowing determination of genotype. Other primer sets, PCR conditions and/or\n      sequencing is used to distinguish genotype when/if the initial primers fail.\n\n      4  Determination of VP4 Genotype. The strategy for PCR typing of gene 4 is identical, in\n      principle, to that used for VP7.64 First strand synthesis (reverse transcription) takes\n      advantage of highly conserved areas of VP4 utilizing primers Con2 and Con3 (Box 3), which\n      are complimentary to the 3' ends of both viral RNA strands within gene segment 4. 1 to 5 \u00b5L\n      of viral RNA is added to 0.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes containing 3.5 \u00b5l of dimethylsulfoxide\n      (Sigma) in a final volume of 8.5 \u00b5l, and the samples are mixed and denatured at 97\u00b0C for 5\n      min. The samples are then cooled on ice for 5 min and collected by brief centrifugation.\n      13.5 \u00b5L of H20, 16 \u00b5L of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (1.25 mM each dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and\n      dTTP), 5 \u00b5L 1OX buffer (100 mM Trishydrochloride [pH 8.3], 500 mM KCl) (Perkin-Elmer Cetus),\n      3.5 \u00b5L of 25 mM MgCl2, 2 \u00b5l of primer (containing 25 \u00b5M of each primer, Con 2 and Con 3),\n      and 9 U reverse transcriptase is then added to each denatured dsRNA sample tube (to give a\n      final reaction volume of 49 \u00b51) and incubated at 42oC for 60 minutes.\n\n      Following addition of 1 \u00b5L (1.9U) of Taq polymerase and 100 \u00b5L mineral oil, first-round PCR\n      is carried out for 30 cycles (1 min 94oC, 2 min at 50oC, and 2 min at 72oC. A cooling cycle\n      is used to bring the samples to 17OC at the completion of the experiment. The second-round\n      typing reaction if performed using 0.5 to 5 \u00b5L of the first-round product (5 \u00b5L if no\n      visible product; 0.5 \u00b5L if visible product) is mixed with 45 \u00b5L reaction mixture in a final\n      volume of 50 \u00b5L. If less than 5 \u00b5L of first round product is added, the remaining volume, to\n      complete 50 \u00b5L, is 10mM TrisHCl (pH 8.3)-2.5mM MgCl\u00ac2. The reaction mixture is 19.5 \u00b5L\n      water, 16 \u00b5L dNTPs, 5 \u00b5L 10X Buffer II, 3 \u00b5L 25 mM MgCl2, 1 \u00b5L of the primer cocktail\n      (containing 20 \u00b5M each of Con3, 1T-1, 2T-1, 3T-1, and 4T-1), and 0.5 \u00b5L (2.5U) Taq. The\n      samples are overlaid with mineral oil and taken through 25 rounds of PCR (same cycles as\n      first round). The samples are then analyzed by gel electrophoresis and product size enables\n      determination of VP4 genotype. Other primer sets and/or sequencing is used to distinguish\n      genotype when/if the initial primers fail.\n\n      5  Determination of Vitamin A and Zinc levels: Serum samples will be evaluated for Vitamin A\n      level by ELISA (e.g., Human Vitamin A, EIAAB) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n      Briefly, the microtitre plate provided in this kit has been pre-coated with an antibody\n      specific to Vitamin A. Standards or samples are then added to the appropriate microtitre\n      plate wells with a biotin-conjugated polyclonal antibody preparation specific for VA and\n      Avidin conjugated to Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) is added to each microplate well and\n      incubated. Then a tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution is added to each well. Only those\n      wells that contain Vitamin A, biotin-conjugated antibody and enzyme-conjugated Avidin will\n      exhibit a change in colour. The enzyme-substrate reaction is terminated by the addition of a\n      H2SO4 and the color change is measured spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 450 nm. The\n      concentration of VA in the samples is then determined by comparing the O.D. of the samples\n      to the standard curve.\n\n      Zinc levels will be measured from blood using assays such as Lampugnani's simple\n      colorimetric method which uses a spectrophotometric method with chromogen 4-(2-pyridylazo)\n      resorcinol sodium salt to measure serum zinc concentrations."

Thus, we will identify the number of rotavirus cases following vaccination as well as identify the strain in those with severe disease.\nThis will allow for \"wild type versus vaccine\"strain mismatch evaluation. We anticipate that the circulating strains in the community will change in response to vaccine pressure at the population level.
