Using newer NIRS sensors the correlation between hepatic regional\n      oxygen saturation and hepatic venous oxygen saturation (SvHO2) needs to be determined. If\n      found to correlate then the NIRS can be used to evaluate early liver transplant failure\n      and/or hepatic artery thrombosis, used as an early marker for shock, and necrotizing\n      enterocolitis, and finally used in the outpatient setting to evaluate patients with chronic\n      liver pathologies. If our validation study finds that NIRS monitors are an appropriate\n      marker of hepatic venous saturation then it will lead to further clinical studies."
