  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a common way to assess glycemic control in
      diabetes management. Multiple times of blood glucose measurements by fingerstick in the same
      day are of tough challenge to it. The changes and variations of glucose excursion in senior
      diabetics with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)involve a safety issue besides glycated
      hemoglobin (GHb) value. The goal of this study is to explore modified SMBG protocols for
      precisely monitoring and predicting glycemic excursion, variability in senior type 2
      diabetics with CAD.
