During its 11 years\n      marketing in China, there was hardly any serious adverse drug reactions except for a few\n      cases reported as severe allergic reaction. In this study, clinical pharmacists in selected\n      hospitals will not only record the clinical use and the adverse drug reactions/ adverse drug\n      events of this injection, but also try to figure out why drug-induced severe allergic\n      reaction happens through a nested case-control study.
