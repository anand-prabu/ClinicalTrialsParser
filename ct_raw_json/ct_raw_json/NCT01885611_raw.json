Both groups 1 and 2 will consist\n      of 6 or 7 Paucibacillary (PB) patients and 6 or 7 Multibacillary (MB) patients. All\n      participants will have MDA, SOD, and GSH blood levels taken on initial consult and on the\n      third and sixth months. Treatment response will be measured by a clinical response score,\n      which will be graded by a blinded investigator based on cutaneous manifestations (no change,\n      moderate improvement, definite improvement, worse) and neurologic manifestations (no change,\n      improvement, worse).\n\n      Main Outcome Measures: The mean and inter-quartile range of MDA, SOD, and GSH blood levels;\n      bacterial index (BI) and morphological index (MI) from slit skin-smears; and treatment\n      response based on the clinical response score. Frequency and severity of lepra reactions\n      will also be noted.\n\n      Data Analysis: The following statistical tests will be used: Mann-Whitney test to compare\n      the difference between median values of group 1 and group 2; Kruskal-Wallis Test for\n      multiple comparisons; Wilcoxon signed ranks test for comparing differences in median values\n      within groups; Fisher's exact test to compare the frequency of categorical data of treatment\n      response (cutaneous manifestations); and T test for the quantitative data (neurologic\n      manifestations) will be used. Values of p<0.05 will be considered statistically significant."
