  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of local anesthetics has become an important aspect of pain management in surgical
      settings and is currently recommended in pain management guidelines.

      Elective outpatient hand surgeries, such as carpal tunnel or trigger finger release, cause
      minimum tissue disruption and are short in duration.  As a result, these local anesthetic
      agents are a major component in  post-operative pain control. The most commonly used local
      anesthetic agents are Lidocaine and Bupivacaine. Lidocaine acts faster (within 2-5 minutes
      of injection) and for this reason is often favored in outpatient setting for pre-incisional
      injection. However its effects only last up to 2 hours, without epinephrine, and 3 hours,
      with epinephrine. On the other hand, Bupivacaine, has a slower onset of action (about 5-10
      minutes after injection) but its effects last much longer, for about 4-8 hours. The delay in
      onset of action makes it a less popular option as a primary source of local anesthesia in
      outpatient hand surgery.

      Given the longer duration of anesthesia offered by Bupivacaine, we believe that by giving it
      pre-operatively in elective outpatient hand surgeries, will offer more effective post
      operative pain control compared to using Lidocaine only.  There is limited published data
      confirming the effectiveness of use of pre-operative Bupivicaine in improved postoperative
      pain control and decreased consumption of narcotics. Therefore, our aim in this study is to
      compare the postoperative pain experienced by patients undergoing either elective carpal
      tunnel release or trigger finger release as well as their use of pain medications when the
      incision site is infiltrated preemptively with Lidocaine versus Bupivacaine.

      We believe that adequate post surgical pain control is essential for patients' full
      functional recovery. Poorly controlled post surgical pain increases incidence of surgery
      related complications and thus increased health care costs. It can also reduce patients'
      mobility, delay their return to full function,.  If poorly controlled, post surgical pain
      may progress to chronic pain and rarely complex regional pain syndromes may ensue.
