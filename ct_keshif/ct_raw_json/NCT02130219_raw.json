The method is based on two-depth transcranial Doppler (TCD) technique for simultaneously measuring flow velocities in the intracranial and extracranial segments of the ophthalmic artery (OA). These measurements are made while applying a series of small pressure steps to the tissues surrounding the eye-ball. The intracranial segment of the OA is compressed by ICP and the extracranial segment of the OA is compressed by the externally applied pressure Pe. Blood flow parameters in both of these OA segments can be monitored which will be approximately equal when Pe = ICP. Two-depth TCD device is used as an  indicator of the balance point (Pe = ICP) when the measured parameters of OA segments are identical",
