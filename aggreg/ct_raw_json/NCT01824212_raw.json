With this method cardiac arrest is\n      recognized in 50-83% of cases. When the emergency medical dispatcher identifies cardiac\n      arrest during the emergency call the survival of the patient improves. Accurate emergency\n      medical service response is activated promptly and bystander will receive cardiopulmonary\n      resuscitation (CPR) instructions. It has been estimated that proper implementation of CPR\n      instructions will save thousands of lives each year.\n\n      If the ECG could be recorded by the mobile phone, transmitted during the emergency call to\n      the dispatch centre and analysed there with the software of a semi-automated external\n      defibrillator(AED), the recognition of cardiac arrest could be more accurate.\n\n      The aim of this study is to examine, if AED, with minimal size electrodes within an area of\n      a mobile phone, is able to  recognize reliably ventricular fibrillation (VF), the rhythm\n      with the best prognosis in OHCA."
