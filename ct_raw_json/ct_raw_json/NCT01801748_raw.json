The oral wheat challenge were performed in all study subjects\n      to identify a case of wheat outgrowing. The primary outcome was the development of oral\n      tolerance to wheat. Oral wheat challenge were generally performed at least every 1 years if\n      the child did not have an interval history of symptoms with unintentional exposure."
