  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is one of the most common symptoms associated with cancer. The approach to pain
      management compresses routine pain assessments, utilizes both pharmacologic and
      nonpharmacologic interventions, and requires ongoing reevaluation of the patient. Cancer
      pain can be well controlled in the vast majority of patients if the algorithms of pain
      control are systematically applied, carefully monitored, and tailored to the needs of the
      individual patient.This study is aimed to assess the current pain managements in upper
      gastrointestinal cancer patients in Taiwan. The effects of neuropathic pain and depression
      on the enrolled patients would also be assessed.
