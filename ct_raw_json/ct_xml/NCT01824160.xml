    <textblock>
      The Covered Cheatham-Platinum Stent (CCPS) is being study for repair of tears that occur in
      the pulmonary artery during dilation (enlargement) of a conduit (passageway) connecting the
      right ventricle of the heart to the pulmonary arteries. Patients undergoing replacement of
      their pulmonary valve by transcatheter technique Melody Valve) are at risk of developing
      such tears in the process of preparing the conduit to accept the new valve.  In order to
      implant such a valve, the connection between the right ventricle and the pulmonary arteries
      often needs to be enlarged.  High pressure balloons may be needed and these balloons can
      sometimes cause tears in or even rupture of the connecting conduit.  Such tears can allow
      blood to flow into the chest and rarely this can lead to a life-threatening emergency.
      Experience suggests that such tears can be closed by implanting into the conduit a metallic
      stent with an outer covering, rebuilding the wall and allowing continuation of the valve
      implant.

      Recent clinical reports from multiple pediatric cardiology programs around the world
      indicate that the conduit can be repaired using such a stent. In the United States there are
      no commercially available, FDA approved, covered stents of the size required. The Covered
      Cheatham Platinum Stent (CCPS) manufactured by the NuMED Corporation of Hopkinton, New York
      has been used in Europe since 2003 and more recently in Canada. The CCPS device is not yet
      approved by the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA).  However, it has been used at many
      hospitals in the U.S. to repair Right Ventricle to pulmonary artery conduits under Emergency
      and Compassionate Use circumstances. The NuMED Covered Cheatham-Platinum Stent (CCPS) is
      currently being studied for use in other areas of the body.  The investigators are now
      studying its use in RV-PA conduits.  The use of the Covered Cheatham Platinum Stent in this
      research study is investigational.

      Only patients found to have a conduit tear during a Melody Valve implant procedure will be
      eligible for inclusion into the trial.  Implant technique is left to the catheterization
      physician.  Clinical data obtained during the catheterization, before and after the CCPS
      implant will be studied in order to understand factors leading up to the tear and to
      evaluate how successful the CCPS is in repairing such defects.  Melody valve implant
      patients are routinely seen for clinical and echocardiographic reevaluation 6 months after
      implant.  Patients who have received a CCPS during their Melody valve procedure will
      likewise be seen.  Results from their clinical evaluation will be reviewed to make sure that
      the presence of a CCPS does not diminish the effectiveness of the Melody valve.  Finally,
      the catheterization angiograms and 6 month follow up echocardiograms will be reviewed by an
      independent expert to confirm the clinical readings.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Precatheterization Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient meets institutional criterion for placement of Melody® TPV

          2. Patient size adequate to receive Melody TPV® implantation via venous access using the
             Ensemble® Transcatheter Delivery System

          3. RV-PA conduit original size &gt; 16 mm diameter

          4. Patient age between 10 and 75 years

        Catheterization Inclusion Criteria:

        a. Angiographic evidence for RV-PA conduit disruption including: dissection, aneurysm,
        pseudo-aneurysm, tears or rupture

          -  Recognition and treatment of conduit disruption may occur before, during or after
             implantation of the Melody® TPV

          -  Conduit disruption related to prior intervention, identified angiographically before
             conduit dilation is performed during the Melody® implant procedure, can be eligible
             for CCPS implantation and study inclusion

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Precatheterization Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient size too small for transvenous placement of the Melody® TPV

          2. Bloodstream infection, including endocarditis

          3. Pregnancy

          4. Prisoners and adults lacking the capacity to give consent

        Catheterization Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Conduit size is not suitable (too small or too large) for a Melody® TPV

          2. Risk of coronary compression has been identified

          3. Lack of angiographic evidence for RV-PA conduit disruption - Prophylactic use of
             study CCPS is prohibited
