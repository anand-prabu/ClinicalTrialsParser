However, no study to date has evaluated whether an Appropriate Use Criteria\n      (AUC)-based educational intervention can reduce inappropriate TTEs in this setting. The\n      investigators therefore designed the first randomized control trial of an AUC-based\n      educational and feedback intervention aimed at reducing inappropriate outpatient TTEs\n      ordered by cardiology and internal medicine physicians in training."

A\n      random number generator divided 24 cardiology fellows and 88 internal medicine residents\n      into control and intervention arms.\n\n      During the study, physicians in the intervention arm receive the following multi-faceted\n      educational intervention on TTE appropriateness: 1) a lecture at the beginning of the study\n      period, which describes the AUC for echocardiography and highlights common clinical\n      scenarios for which outpatient TTEs are ordered, 2) an electronic \"pocket card\" via email\n      that provides tips on appropriate ordering of TTEs, and 3) an individualized monthly\n      feedback report that categorizes TTEs ordered over the preceding month. The feedback reports\n      contain the number of TTEs ordered during the month and how many are classified as\n      appropriate, inappropriate, or uncertain based on the 2011 AUC. A description of all\n      inappropriate TTEs and the rationale for the inappropriate classification is provided. The\n      physicians in the control arm have their TTE orders tracked and classified, but do not\n      receive any feedback on their ordering behavior. While study participants are not blinded to\n      which arm of the study they are in, they were blinded to which arm of the study their\n      colleagues are in.\n\n      Prior to the start of the intervention, all study participants receive a knowledge\n      assessment survey. The survey includes five case-based questions designed to assess\n      knowledge of the AUC for TTE and also questions regarding attitudes toward diagnostic\n      testing. Each participant also receives a post-study knowledge assessment survey.\n\n      The primary outcome measures in this study are the rate of inappropriate and appropriate\n      TTEs. Secondary outcome measures include the number of TTEs ordered, common appropriate and\n      inappropriate TTE indications, and pre- and post-study knowledge assessment scores among the\n      study physicians."
