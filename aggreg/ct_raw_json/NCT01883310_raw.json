Informed consent will be\n      obtained. Participants enrolled will included in 2 different treatment groups: Task Oriented\n      Circuit Training (TOCT) + anodal cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation\n      (experimental group) and TOCT + sham transcranial direct current stimulation over the\n      cerebellum (control group). The group with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation\n      will receive continuous stimulation with intensity of 2 mili Ampere during the first 15\n      minutes of functional circuit training. In the sham session, anodal transcranial direct\n      current stimulation was applied for 30 s and then shut off. Each subject will receive 10\n      task-oriented training sessions over 2 weeks (5 sessions/week). 3 subjects with a supervisor\n      physiotherapist will take part at the TOCT. During the stimulation sessions both the subject\n      and the researcher, responsible for carrying out clinical tests, will be unaware of the type\n      of stimulation set.\n\n      Treatment efficacy outcome measures will be clinical test for gait speed (Timed 25-Foot\n      Walk), walking endurance (six minute walking test), balance (Dynamic Gait Index) and\n      mobility (Time Up and Go Test); self-assessment questionnaire for motor fatigue (Fatigue\n      Severity Scale FSS) and quality of life (Short Form (36) Health Survey).\n\n      Outcome measures will be assessed the week prior to treatment initiation (T0), the week\n      after the end of treatment (T1) and at 3 months follow-up (T3) to evaluate treatments\n      retention, by a clinician blinded to the treatment. At the end of each session, the subject\n      will complete a questionnaire where report side effects due to stimulation (headache, neck\n      pain, burning, redness and/or itching in the site of stimulation)."
