Application of ECG electrodes will be\n      performed by medical technicians following standard recommendations, utilizing approved\n      Holter device & stickers.  The Holter ECG  data will be used for the offline heart rate\n      variability (HRV) analysis by the HeartTrends device.\n\n      Immediately following data acquisition, all patients will undergo an exercise MPI according\n      to accepted clinical practice guidelines.\n\n      Following the MPI, there will be no interference with patient management, which will be\n      conducted by the patients' treating physicians according to current guidelines, unaware of\n      HRV results.\n\n      Analysis of recorded ECG data for HRV will be performed blinded to the EST and MPI results,\n      by HeartTrends device.\n\n      The results of the HRV tests will not be available to treating physicians and will not be\n      used to guide patient management. Patients will be followed for 6 months for the occurrence\n      of coronary interventions and MACE, defined as: death, myocardial infarction, unstable\n      angina, or any coronary revascularization."
