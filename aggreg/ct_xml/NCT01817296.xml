  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Klinefelter syndrome occurs in 1 in 600 males and is a common cause of infertility in men.
      It appears scar tissue forms in these boys' testicles, leading to progressive destruction
      over their lifetimes.  Advanced reproductive technology can be used to surgically retrieve
      sperm from these individuals, but these methods have a 50% failure rate in adult Klinefelter
      patients.  Younger men have higher success rates, suggesting that adolescence and young
      adulthood may be the best time to extract sperm, but these techniques have not been studied
      in Klinefelter patients younger than 26 years of age.  Additionally, there is currently no
      way to predict which Klinefelter patients will have success with these methods and which of
      them will not.  This trial will explore sperm extraction in Klinefelter syndrome in an age
      range (12-25 years) that has never been studied, with the ultimate hope of improving the
      potential for fertility in these patients.  The specific goals of this study are to
      determine the ideal age for sperm retrieval in Klinefelter patients and to establish factors
      that can be used to predict which of these patients will have a higher likelihood of success
      with advanced reproductive technology.  The hypothesis is that younger Klinefelter patients
      will have higher sperm retrieval rates.
