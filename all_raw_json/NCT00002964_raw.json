Investigate whether\n      porfimer sodium fluorescence can define areas of field cancerization in the oral mucosa,\n      specifically satellite foci of malignant cells within the margins of an excision. III.\n      Determine whether uptake of fluorescence is indicative of disease stage.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive porfimer sodium IV bolus and are kept in subdued light until\n      examination with a fluorescence photometer 48 hours later. Patients must avoid sunlight and\n      other intense lights for an additional 30 days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 20 patients will be accrued per year."
