To accomplish this aim, Investigators will perform a randomized controlled trial\n      to:\n\n        1. Determine how the shared decision making program influences patients' choice of therapy\n\n        2. Evaluate how the shared decision making program affects persistence with chosen therapy\n\n        3. Determine how the shared decision making program affects decision quality\n\n        4. Determine how the shared decision making program influences cost of care and clinical\n           outcomes\n\n      Expected Outcome and Impact: Investigators expect that this program will influence patients'\n      choice of therapy, persistence with their preferred therapy, and lead to improved clinical\n      outcomes. Investigators believe that this product can be successfully operationalized in the\n      clinic to establish a new paradigm of how providers can communicate personalized treatment\n      options to patients across a broad range of diseases."
