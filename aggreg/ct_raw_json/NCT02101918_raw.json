Estimate the objective response rate (RR) of aflibercept (ziv-aflibercept) among patients\n      with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET)s according to Response Evaluation\n      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.\n\n      II. Test the following hypotheses: that baseline perfusion computed tomography (CT)\n      parameters can predict which patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs)\n      will respond to treatment with aflibercept.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. Estimate progression free survival (PFS) duration among patients treated with\n      aflibercept.\n\n      II. Evaluate the relationship between response rate and baseline blood volume (BV) and\n      between response rate and baseline permeability surface (PS).\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. Determine whether post-treatment changes in BV expressed as relative change from baseline\n      correlate with response to aflibercept.\n\n      II. Determine whether post-treatment tumor blood flow (BF) (absolute measurement) correlates\n      with response to aflibercept.\n\n      III. Determine whether post-treatment changes in BF and, BV, expressed as relative change\n      from baseline, correlate with relative change in sum of tumor diameters (RECIST 1.1\n      measurements).\n\n      IV. Determine the effect of aflibercept therapy on post-treatment BF, BV, mean transit time\n      (MTT), and PS at 4 weeks after treatment.\n\n      V. Evaluate the changes in tumor perfusion parameters at time of progression.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive ziv-aflibercept intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment\n      repeats every 21 days for 35 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients undergo computed tomography perfusion imaging at baseline, day 21 of\n      course 1, and at time of progression.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically."
