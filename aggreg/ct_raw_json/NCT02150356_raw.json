            "textblock": "Very few studies have evaluated the effect of aleurone-enriched grains on cardiovascular\n      risk factors. Price et al.(2010) have shown that 4-week supplementation of aleurone-enriched\n      products (27 g/day of aleurone) increased betaine concentration in plasma whereas reduced\n      homocysteine and LDL-cholesterol levels. Interestingly, aleurone had no effect on total\n      antioxidant status or endothelial function, whereas an improvement of C-reactive protein was\n      observed (Price RK et al, 2012). It is not known whether consumption of  more than 27g/day\n      of aleurone-enriched products  with higher  ferulic acid biodisponibility and longer time of\n      treatment could influence these parameters in individuals with metabolic syndrome.\n      Noteworthy, no studies have investigated  the effect of aleurone-enriched products on\n      fasting and postprandial glycemic homeostasis and lipid metabolism. In addition, mechanisms\n      by which aleurone may act in vivo are still unknown.\n\n      The aim of this study is to investigate whether 8 weeks supplementation with\n      aleurone-enriched products may influence glucose and lipid metabolism, incretin hormones\n      levels, satiety, inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelial function in overweight/obese\n      subjects with high cardiovascular risk."
