If an oral steroid does not give a patient significant temporary\n      relief  of pain from a herniated lumbar disc  then an epidural steroid injection will not\n      either. Therefore the risk and expense associated from the interventional pain management\n      procedure for those patients could be avoided and other treatment modalities pursued."
