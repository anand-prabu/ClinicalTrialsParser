Based on results from a study in mice suffering from retinal\n      degeneration, the investigators hypothesize that rasagiline delays neurodegeneration in the\n      retina and improves visual acuity outcomes after retinal detachment surgery. Rasagiline is a\n      second-generation propargylamine with neuroprotective properties modulating the\n      caspase-dependent pathway of programmed cell death."

            "textblock": "Background\n\n      In previous experimental studies neuroprotection by rasagiline has been shown in rds-mice, a\n      model for slow retinal degeneration. It is known from these experiments that rasagiline\n      specifically delays apoptosis, but also modifies inflammation and autophagy. The\n      bioavailability of the drug in the central nervous system is high, and based on the\n      literature is sufficient in the retina.\n\n      In retinal detachments the outer layers of the neurosensory retina are deprived of nutrients\n      and degeneration of the photoreceptors occurs fast. This is particularly relevant in the\n      macular area of the retina where the density of photoreceptors is high, such that visual\n      acuity recovery can be significantly limited by photoreceptor loss.\n\n      Objective\n\n      To assess the neuroprotective effect of oral rasagiline (1mg daily for 7 days) administered\n      perioperatively in patients undergoing surgical retinal detachment repair for central vision\n      involving retinal detachments.\n\n      Methods\n\n      In this clinical trial, patients suffering from retinal detachments affecting the fovea get\n      randomly assigned to perioperative oral treatment with either rasagiline (1mg) or placebo\n      once daily for 7 days. Pharmacologic treatment is initiated at the time of hospital\n      admission, usually the day before surgery. The main outcome of the study is visual acuity\n      six months after surgical retinal detachment repair. Structural differences of the\n      neurosensory retina between groups will be analysed by optical coherence tomography, a\n      non-invasive imaging method for retinal pathology."
