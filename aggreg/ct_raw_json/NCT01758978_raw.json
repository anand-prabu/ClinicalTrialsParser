Acceptable methods of contraception include abstinence or an intrauterine\n             device (known to have a failure rate of less than 1% per year).\n\n          -  The subject has a negative alcohol test and urine drug screen (UDS).\n\n          -  The subject must be willing and able to comply with study restrictions and to remain\n             at the study center for the required duration of each study drug period during the\n             study.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  The subject has any clinically significant uncontrolled medical conditions (treated\n             or untreated).\n\n          -  The subject has a clinically significant deviation from normal in ECG or physical\n             examination findings, as determined by the investigator or the medical monitor.\n\n          -  The subject has habitually consumed, within the past 2 years, more than 21 units of\n             alcohol per week, or has a history of alcohol, narcotic, or any other substance abuse\n             as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, Fourth\n             Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR, American Psychiatric Association 2000). NOTE: A\n             unit of alcohol is equal to 1 ounce of hard liquor, 5 ounces of wine, or 8 ounces of\n             beer.\n\n          -  The subject is a pregnant or lactating woman. (Any women becoming pregnant during the\n             study will be withdrawn from the study.)\n\n          -  The subject has any disorder that may interfere with drug absorption, distribution,\n             metabolism, or excretion (including gastrointestinal (GI) surgery; a history of\n             appendectomy is allowed).\n\n          -  The subject has received any investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives\n             (whichever is longer) before the 1st dose of study drug, or in the case of a new\n             chemical entity, 3 months or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before the 1st dose\n             of study drug.\n\n          -  The subject has a known sensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to hydrocodone or\n             hydromorphone, their related compounds, or to any metabolites, or naltrexone, or any\n             compound listed as being present in a study formulation.\n\n          -  Other exclusion criteria apply."
