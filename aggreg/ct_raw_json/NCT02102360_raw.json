The use of a microsurgical approach provides magnification and optimal illumination of the surgical site improving visual acuity. Further advantages may be the reduction of flap reflection during surgery, consequently advantages in wound healing process and benefits in patient's perceptions of the procedure. A less invasive surgical procedure may lead to a less cell demand in the healing process, and a potentially reduced morbidity. The minimally invasive surgical procedures were performed using microscope."
