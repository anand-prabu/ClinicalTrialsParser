This project examines patient-reported outcomes (PROs)\n      following LASIK surgery.  This three-phased project is part of FDA's ongoing effort to\n      better monitor and improve the safety and effectiveness of lasers used in LASIK surgery.\n      PROWL-2 is the third phase of the larger LQOLCP project. The primary objective of PROWL-2 is\n      to explore the psychometric properties of a computer-based questionnaire assessing the\n      patient-reported outcomes of satisfaction and ophthalmic-related quality of life before and\n      over a period of 3 months following LASIK. This questionnaire initially developed and\n      examined in PROWL-1 (a military population) will be examined psychometrically in a civilian\n      population.  PROWL-2 is a prospective, multi-center, observational study in which a\n      participant's pre-operative status will serve as the baseline for one-month and three-month\n      post-surgical comparisons. Three hundred (300) participants planning to undergo refractive\n      surgery using LASIK for myopia, hyperopia, or astigmatism will be enrolled in this study\n      from  five (5) clinical sites across the United States. Additionally, routine clinical data\n      will be collected pre- and post-operatively (e.g., best corrected visual acuity, manifest\n      refraction, wavefront aberrometry, conreal topography, and other clinical assessments) and\n      questionnaires will be independently administered pre-operatively and at the one-month and\n      three-month post-operative visits."
