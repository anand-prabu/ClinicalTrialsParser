    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/Phase 2 study of STI571 combined with docetaxel and cisplatin for
      treatment of patients with recurrent and metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

      This research study has 2 parts to it.  The first part (Phase 1) is called a
      dose-escalation.  Not all subjects enrolled into this phase of the study will receive the
      same dose.   The purpose of the dose-escalation is to determine the highest safe dose of
      STI571 that can be used in combination with docetaxel and cisplatin.  That dose will be used
      in Phase 2.

    <description>Treatment will consist of docetaxel plus cisplatin IV every 21days and oral STI571 given on Days -5 to 2 with each chemotherapy cycle.  A maximum of 6 cycles will be given.
Phase 1 dose levels are:
Level 1 Docetaxel/Cisplatin 60 mg/m2, STI571 300mg
Level 2 Docetaxel/Cisplatin 60 mg/m2, STI571 400mg
Level 3 Docetaxel/Cisplatin 70 mg/m2, STI571 400mg
Level 4 Docetaxel/Cisplatin 70 mg/m2, STI571 600mg
Level 5 Docetaxel/Cisplatin 75 mg/m2, STI571 600mg
Level 6 Docetaxel/Cisplatin 75 mg/m2, STI571 800mg
Once the MTD level has been established, the previous dose level will be the dosing schedule for Phase II.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically recurrent, or advanced NSCLC:
             Stage IV disease; or Stage IIIB due to malignant pleural effusion is allowed- only if
             successfully pleurodesed.

          -  Tumor tissue slides must express phosophorylated pdgf-rB by IHC.

          -  At least one measurable target lesion as defined by RECIST criteria that has not been

          -  No prior chemotherapy treatment for this disease will be allowed. Patients with brain
             metastasis will have to be, after appropriate treatment,  neurologically stable for
             at least 1-2 weeks (off steroids) prior to study enrollment.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-1.

          -  Meets initial laboratory parameters.

          -  Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirement or that would prevent informed consent or psychiatric illness/social
