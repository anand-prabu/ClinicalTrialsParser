Although FHH is a standard component of the\n      medical interview its widespread adoption is hindered by three major barriers: (1) a dearth\n      of standard collection methods; (2) the absence of health care provider access to complete\n      FHH information; and (3) the need for clinical guidance for the interpretation and use of\n      FHH. In addition, the time constraints of the busy provider and poor integration of FHH with\n      paper medical records or electronic medical records (EMR) impede its widespread use. The\n      investigators hypothesize that patient-driven and electronic collection of FHH for risk\n      stratification will promote more informed decision-making by patients and providers, and\n      improves adherence to risk-stratified preventive care guidelines. The study team will use an\n      implementation sciences approach to integrate an innovative FHH system that collects FHH\n      from patients. Intermountain Healthcare will provide the information technology expertise\n      with EMR design to develop an innovative solution to a storage model standard for FHH data\n      as well as a centralized standards-compliant open clinical decision support (OpenCDS) rule\n      development architecture to analyze FHH and to generate evidence-based, individualized,\n      disease risk, preventive care recommendations for both patients and providers."

The study will take place in 'real world'\n      clinical, socio-cultural, and demographically diverse (rural, underserved, academic, family\n      medicine) care clinics (n=34) in 5 states (CA, MN, NC, WI, TX) that include genomic medicine\n      'early adopter' and 'na\u00efve' sites, as well as those that are EMR-enabled and others that are\n      not. The study team will recruit a minimum of 7000 English or Spanish speaking adults over a\n      3-year period and will capture process metrics and outcomes that are measured in the course\n      of usual care. The goals are: 1) To optimize the collection of patient entered FHH in\n      diverse clinical environments for coronary heart disease, thrombosis, and selected cancers,\n      2) to export FHH data to an OpenCDS platform and return CDS results to providers and\n      patients (and to EMRs where relevant) and to explore the integration of genetic risk and FHH\n      data at selected sites, 3) to assess the clinical and personal utility of FHH using a\n      pragmatic observational study design to assess reach, adoption, integrity, exposure, and\n      sustainability, and to capture, analyze, and report effectiveness outcomes at each\n      stakeholder level: patient, provider, and clinic/system, and 4) to take a leadership role in\n      the dissemination of guidelines for FHH intervention across in diverse practice settings."
