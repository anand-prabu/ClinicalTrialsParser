      This study will test the safety and tolerability of ISIS-SMNRx administered into the spinal
      fluid as a single injection in patients with Spinal Muscular Atrophy, who previously
      participated in ISIS 396443-CS1

    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of
      ISIS-SMNRx administered as a single intrathecal injection. The single dose will be studied
      in patients who previously participated in ISIS 396443-CS1, and all patients will receive
      active drug.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical signs attributable to Spinal Muscular Atrophy

          -  Satisfactory completion of dosing and all study visits in ISIS 396443-CS1 with an
             acceptable safety profile, per Investigator judgement.

          -  Able to complete all study procedures, measurements and visits and parent/patient has
             adequately supportive psychosocial circumstances, in the opinion of the investigator

          -  Estimated life expectancy &gt; 2 years from Screening

          -  Meets age-appropriate institutional criteria for use of anesthesia/sedation, if use
             is planned for study procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have any  new or worsening of existing condition which in the opinion of the
             Investigator would make the subject unsuitable for enrollment, or could interfere
             with the subject participating in or completing the study.

          -  Dosing in ISIS 396443-CS1 within 270 days (9 months) of screening, or longer ago than
             450 days (15 months)

          -  Dosing in ISIS 396443-CS2

          -  Hospitalization for surgery (i.e. scoliosis surgery) or pulmonary event within 2
             months of screening or planned during the duration of the study

          -  Presence of an untreated or inadequately treated active infection requiring systemic
             antiviral or antimicrobial therapy any time during the screening period

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities in hematology or clinical chemistry parameters

          -  Treatment with investigational drug, biological agent, or device within 1-month of
             Screening or 5 half-lives of study agent, whichever is longer. Treatment with
             valproate or hydroxyurea within 1 months of screening. Any history of gene therapy or
             cell transplantation
