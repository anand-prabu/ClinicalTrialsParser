The study will be conducted in adult patients with advanced breast, NSCLC,\n      ovarian or endometrial cancer for whom there is an indication to the use of paclitaxel and\n      carboplatin.\n\n      Successive cohorts of patients will receive escalating doses of PF-05212384 in combination\n      with paclitaxel and carboplatin, starting at a dose level determined to be the 60% of single\n      agent MTD.\n\n      The study will consist of two parts: the dose finding part (Part 1) and the expansion part\n      (Part 2).\n\n      During Part 1 patients with breast, NSCLC, ovary and endometrial cancer will be enrolled.\n\n      During Part 2, only patients with ovarian cancer will be enrolled. In Part 1, a 3+3 design\n      is employed. Once the MTD of the combination is defined in Part 1, Part 2 is performed for a\n      better definition of the safety profile, of the potential antitumor activity and of the\n      pharmacodynamic effects of the combination; it will be conducted in at least 12 patients\n      with ovarian cancer.\n\n      Approximately 40 patients are expected to be enrolled in the study overall."
