Previous studies have found that POP molecular regulation mechanism of\n      kidney Yang deficiency syndrome may be associated with LTBP1 gene expression.\n\n      This topic using RT-PCR and Western Blot detection POP of kidney Yang deficiency group and\n      healthy group LTBP1 mRNA and proteion's expression level,validate LTBP1 relevance to POP the\n      kidney Yang deficiency syndrome.To provide a scientific basis for clinical treatment."
