Methods: Patients receiving elective surgery under\n      general anesthesia were recruited into this study. The investigators measured their\n      preoperative pressure pain threshold (PPT) and pressure pain tolerance (PTO). The visual\n      analog scale (VAS) was used for pain evaluation at rest and move after the operation. And\n      the PCA press frequency and drug consumption were recorded. Also there were healthy college\n      students volunteer be recruited into this study. The investigators measured their\n      experimental pain sensitivity including pressure pain threshold (PPT) and pressure pain\n      tolerance (PTO). Then genotyping was carried out by direct sequencing."
