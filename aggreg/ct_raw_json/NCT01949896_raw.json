            "textblock": "Recently many publications have indicated a potential temporal association between packed\n      red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion and the development of NEC in neonates.  Although, to\n      date, there is no conclusive evidence indicating a causal role of PRBC transfusion on the\n      development of NEC. Given the growing body of data that support the association of PRBC\n      transfusions and NEC, a common clinical dilemma arises with regard to feeding infants during\n      a blood transfusion. Additionally, it is thought that increased immunomodulation may be\n      exacerbated by any other pro-inflammatory process or insult; thereby leading to a rapidly\n      increasing cascade of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may ultimately lead to gut\n      inflammation and NEC.\n\n      Prior to a non-urgent PRBC transfusion, subjects will be randomized to either the NPO group\n      or fed group of patients. The intervention will be the placement of a subject in the NPO\n      group. Subjects will be made NPO for a total of 24 hours around the time of the PRBC\n      transfusion. During the transfusion, both groups of subjects will have serum cytokine levels\n      obtained at 3 time intervals- 1) 4 hours pre-transfusion, 2) 2-4 hours post-transfusion, and\n      3) 20-24 hours post-transfusion."
