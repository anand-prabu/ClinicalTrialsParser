All patients are stratified according to prognostic\n      factors.\n\n      Patients are randomly allocated to 1 of 2 treatment options. Treatment 1 uses interferon\n      alfa-2b (IFN-A) therapy, and treatment 2 includes adjuvant biochemotherapy.\n\n      Patients who are randomized to IFN-A will be further stratified and randomized to one of two\n      interferon schedules.\n\n        -  Schedule A: IV IFN-A induction 5 times a week for 4 weeks followed by subcutaneous\n           IFN-A maintenance 3 times a week for 48 weeks.\n\n        -  Schedule B: Subcutaneous IFN-A 3 times a week for 52 weeks. Adjuvant biochemotherapy\n           begins immediately after registration on the study. Cisplatin is given IV on days 1-4;\n           vinblastine is given IVPB on days 1-4; dacarbazine (DTIC) is given IVPB on day 1; IFN-A\n           is given subcutaneously on days 1-5; IL-2 is given by continuous infusion for a total\n           of 96 hours on days 1-4. Each course of therapy is repeated every 21 days for 4\n           courses. Patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy will start adjuvant systemic therapy\n           within 8 weeks from lymphadenectomy and a week after completion of and recovery from\n           radiotherapy.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients (100 patients in each arm) will be entered."
