  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment remains a major disability for individuals with multiple sclerosis
      (MS). The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy for treating
      MS-associated cognitive deficits using a unique computer-based plasticity-based and adaptive
      cognitive remediation treatment (PACR) compared to a computer-based control. This novel
      cognitive remediation approach has led to striking improvements in cognitive functioning in
      other disorders (schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury, aging, and dementia) but has never
      been applied to individuals with MS. The investigators will enroll 136 MS participants who
      will be randomized in a 2:1 pattern to complete either the treatment or control condition
      for 60 hours across a 12-week treatment period. Both the treatment and control conditions
      will be accessed remotely by the subjects from a study-provided laptop computer. Study
      outcomes will include program compliance, performance on study tasks and neuropsychological
      measures, quality of life and functional status. Given the success of this program with
      other disorders and strong preliminary data from our feasibility study, the investigators
      believe PACR is an exciting untapped opportunity to improve cognition in individuals with
      MS.
