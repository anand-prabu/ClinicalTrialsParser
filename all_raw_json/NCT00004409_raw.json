Patients who do not respond at the 1 month follow up visit may receive an injection\n      of open label collagenase, if IgE antibody levels are no greater than 15 ng/mL.\n\n      Following treatment, patients use a nighttime extension splint for 4 months and perform\n      finger flexion/extension exercises.  Patients are followed at 1, 7, and 14 days, and at 1,\n      2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, for each joint treated."
