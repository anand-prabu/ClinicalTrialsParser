However, a better understanding of 3D knee kinematics during such activities\n      would allow a better understanding of this often injured joint.\n\n      Hypothesis: A new system using personalized 3D bone imaging and a percutaneous bone fixation\n      device that can be used under local anesthesiaallows for precise and reproducible assessment\n      of 3D knee kinematics during physical and daily life activities.\n\n      Objectives :\n\n        -  To study human knee 3D kinematics during dynamic activities using a novel minimally\n           invasive measuring system\n\n        -  Investigate the correlations between standard clinical knee laxity tests and measured\n           3D knee kinematics during dynamic activities"
