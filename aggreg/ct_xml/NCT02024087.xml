      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of dalantercept plus
      sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to determine the
      recommended dose level of dalantercept in combination with sorafenib.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed, locally advanced or metastatic HCC.

          -  Child-Pugh Score A (5-6)

          -  At least one target lesion that has not been treated with local therapy and is
             measurable by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Able to tolerate oral therapy.

          -  Appropriate clinical laboratory values within 72 hours prior to study day 1:

          -  Females of child bearing potential (defined as sexually mature women who have not
             undergone hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or are not naturally postmenopausal
             ≥ 24 consecutive months) must have negative urine or blood pregnancy test prior to
             enrollment and use adequate birth control methods (abstinence, oral contraceptives,
             barrier method with spermicide, or surgical sterilization) during study
             participation.  Males must agree to use a latex condom during any sexual contact with
             females of child bearing potential while participating in the study and for 12 weeks
             following the last dose of dalantercept, even if he has undergone a successful
             vasectomy.  Patients must be counseled concerning measures to be used to prevent
             pregnancy and potential toxicities prior to the first dose of dalantercept.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Mixed tumor histology

          -  Prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease.

          -  Adjuvant therapy &lt; 6 months prior to study day 1.

          -  Prior treatment with dalantercept or other agent targeting the ALK1 pathway.

          -  Prior treatment with sorafenib or other RAF/VEGF targeted therapies.

          -  Hepatic radiation, chemoembolization, and radiofrequency ablation &lt; 4 weeks prior to
             study day 1.

          -  Palliative radiation therapy to metastatic sites of disease &lt; 2 weeks prior to study
             day 1.

          -  Interferon therapy &lt; 4 weeks prior to study day 1.

          -  Uncontrolled Hepatitis B despite appropriate therapy.

          -  Clinically significant pulmonary, endocrine, neurologic, hematologic,
             gastrointestinal (GI), autoimmune, psychiatric or genitourinary disease unrelated to
             HCC that in the judgment of the investigator should preclude treatment with
             dalantercept or sorafenib.

          -  Known HIV infection.

          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular risk

          -  Clinically significant active pulmonary risk

          -  Known active gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.

          -  Known bleeding diathesis Known history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
             (HHT).

          -  History of another primary cancer, with the exception of:

               1. Curatively resected non melanoma skin cancer.

               2. Curatively treated cervical carcinoma in situ.

               3. Other primary solid tumor with no known active disease in the opinion     of the
                  investigator that will not affect patient outcome in the setting of current HCC
                  diagnosis.

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to study day 1 Active infection Anti-coagulation
             therapy Concomitant treatment with potent CYP3A4 inducers

          -  Peripheral edema ≥ grade 2 within 2 weeks prior to study day 1.

          -  History of recurrent ascites requiring paracentesis within 4 weeks of study day 1.

          -  History of severe (using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for
             Adverse Events, version 4.0 [NCI-CTCAE] v4 current minor version ≥ grade 3) allergic
             or anaphylactic reaction or hypersensitivity to recombinant proteins or excipients
