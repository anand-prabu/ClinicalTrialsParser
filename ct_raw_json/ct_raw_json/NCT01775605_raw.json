This pain can lead to increased anxiety and distress, adversely\n      affecting  patient's overall experience. This study proposes to examine the application of\n      Synera pain patch prior to lidocaine infiltration to reduce this pain and anxiety.\n\n      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of the Synera on maternal\n      experience during epidural placement. The efficacy of Synera pain patch in reducing subject\n      pain during skin infiltration with lidocaine prior to epidural placement in subjects\n      presenting for scheduled cesarean section will be assessed."
