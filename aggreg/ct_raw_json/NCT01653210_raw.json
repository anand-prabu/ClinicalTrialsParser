            "textblock": "The purpose of this particular protocol is to study the underlying glycemic variability\n      across the menstrual cycle in women with T1DM.  A subset of premenopausal women with T1DM\n      experience loss of glucose control during the latter half of the cycle (the luteal phase).\n      Clinical trials are sparse and tools are limited to focus on this aspect of diabetes care\n      which is highly relevant in affected individuals. To obtain data to initialize this\n      mobile-based module, we will enroll premenopausal women for approximately three-month\n      outpatient study designed to characterize at least three complete menstrual cycles. These\n      subjects will wear continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), record self-monitored blood glucoses\n      (SMBGs) and utilize an insulin pump to capture insulin dosing. In-home ovulation kits will\n      be used to determine relevant days for sex-steroid blood measurements to define menstrual\n      cycle phases. Finally, structured at-home meals will be provided during different phases of\n      the menstrual cycle for insulin action parameters assessments.\n\n      The software module will be developed in parallel with the data collection from study\n      subjects. The software module will not be used with the patients in this study as it is not\n      in existence as would be developed in parallel. The goal of the module functionality will be\n      to 1) assist patients and providers in the identification and management of glycemic\n      variability surrounding the menstrual cycle and 2) add value to and become an integral\n      module within the artificial pancreas."
