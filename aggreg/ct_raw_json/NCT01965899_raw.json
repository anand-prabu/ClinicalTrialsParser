All subjects will be requested to wear an external Holter for 48 hours at\n      approximately 4 weeks post-insertion.  Follow-up visits will continue at 6 and 12 months\n      post-implant, with monthly manual interrogations.  Subjects will be exited at their 12 month\n      follow-up visit. The overall study will be conducted in 2 phases which differ primarily on\n      inclusion criteria: Phase I subjects (initial 30 subjects) will have any indication for an\n      ICM, Phase II subjects (all subjects following the initial 30 subjects) will be atrial\n      fibrillation (AF) pre-ablation patients. The study will assess functionality of the Reveal\n      LINQ device by assessing sensing performance and data transmission."
