All subjects enrolled will have two\n      study visits.  At the first visit, a 48-hour pharmacokinetic evaluation will be performed.\n      Immediately following completion of the PK sampling, the tenofovir dose will be changed to\n      150 mg, once daily. Two weeks later, at the second visit, a 24-hour pharmacokinetic\n      evaluation will be performed. Following completion of the second PK sampling the tenofovir\n      dose will be changed back to 300 mg every 48 hours.  At this time the subjects has reach the\n      end of the study."
