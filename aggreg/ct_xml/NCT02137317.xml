  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization pesticide poisoning is a major health problem due
      to the millions of cases annually occurring worldwide. Farmers have a particularly high risk
      of pesticide poisoning because of their work involving pesticide use to protect crops. The
      majority of pesticide poisonings occur in developing countries. On a short term it is not
      realistic to reduce farmers' use of pesticides significantly because it would require that
      secure and cost-effective alternatives are introduced. This is a lengthy process, which
      should undoubtedly be supported. However, it becomes as important to make sure that farmers
      can protect themselves from pesticide exposure meanwhile. Use of personal protective
      equipment can minimize pesticide exposure on farmers' bodies and consequently reduce their
      risk of pesticide poisoning. However, the sparse research identified through a systematic
      literature review shows that we are not in a position to give recommendations on what
      personal protective equipment farmers should protect themselves with against pesticide
      exposure suitable to their specific conditions. The purpose of the present study is to
      examine factors that influence farmers' use of personal protective equipment during their
      work with organophosphates and, based on this examine the ability of locally adapted
      personal protective equipment to reduce their organophosphate exposure. The hypothesis is
      that farmers working in locally adapted personal protective equipment have less acute
      organophosphate poisoning symptoms, a higher plasma cholinesterase level and find it to be a
      more feasible solution than farmers working in their daily practice wearing.  Examining how
      locally adapted personal protective equipment (onwards referred to as the LAPPE solution)
      performs in practice implies testing it in an intervention study. A randomized crossover
      experiment design is chosen partly because fewer farmers have to be recruited since each
      farmer will act as his own control and partly because the between farmer variation is
      strongly reduced. The performance of the LAPPE solution will be tested in one experiment and
      compared to the performance of the same farmers' daily practice wearing (onwards referred to
      as the DP solution) in another experiment. The LAPPE solution is expected to have a superior
      performance. The participation sequence (LAPPE/DP or DP/LAPPE) will be randomized.  The
      study will be conducted among farmers in Chitwan, Nepal.

      LITERATURE SEARCH STRATEGY:

      Based on recommendations from information specialists in the field of health, agriculture
      and technology the following databases were chosen to search for scientific literature about
      the present study's purpose: Pubmed, Embase, SveMed, CAB abstracts (Centre for Agriculture
      and Biosciences International), Agris, DADS (Denmark's Technical University's Digital
      Library), Scopus and Ebsco. The key search terms for the literature search were: personal
      protective equipment, farmers, pesticides, developing countries and tropical climate.
      Synonyms for each of these search terms were identified by means of Gyldendals Dictionary
      and previous international literature. In Pubmed, SveMed, Embase, CAB abstracts and Agris
      the synonyms were applied to find subject headings which the main search was based on.
      However, in DADS, Scopus, Ebsco searches on subject headings was not an option and therefore
      the main search was based on the synonyms.

        -  Pubmed: 3349 hits, subject headings for key terms personal protective equipment and
           pesticides with no limitations.

        -  Embase: 399 hits, subject headings for key terms personal protective equipment and
           pesticides with the limitation human.

        -  SveMed: 24 hits, subject headings for key terms personal protective equipment and
           pesticides.

        -  CAB abstracts: 607 hits, subject headings for key terms personal protective equipment
           and pesticides.

        -  Agris: 681 hits, subject headings for key terms personal protective equipment and
           pesticides.

        -  DADS 8650 hits, subject headings for key terms personal protective equipment and
           pesticides.

        -  Scopus: 1988 hits, synonyms for key terms personal protective equipment and pesticides
           and developing countries and tropical climate with the limitation to human.

        -  EBSCO: 722 hits, synonyms for key terms personal protective equipment and pesticides.

      Firstly, the relevance of titles was evaluated, secondly the relevance of abstracts from
      hits with relevant titles was evaluated and thirdly the relevance of full texts from hits
      with relevant abstracts was evaluated. A search was made based on the function 'related
      studies' for each relevant study in each database. The reference list of each relevant study
      was viewed and searched in Web of Science for citations. Finally each accessible relevant
      study was read carefully (5 hits). Exclusion criteria were studies on closed farming,
      mechanized farming, non-tropical conditions, and farming in industrialized countries or
      laboratory performance testing of personal protective equipment seeing that these criteria
      would not represent typical farming conditions in developing countries. Grey literature was
      searched in databases of the International Labor Organization, World Health Organization and
      Food and Agricultural Organization.

      STUDY AREA:

      Nepal is divided into 75 administrative districts. Pesticide consumption data show that
      excessive use of pesticides is common in different crops such as rice, maize, wheat and
      vegetables production areas. Chitwan District is selected purposively for three reasons:

        -  One of the highest vegetable growing districts of Nepal is Chitwan.

        -  An excessive pesticide use is documented in Chitwan.

        -  An unpublished study being the first of its kind in Nepal known to the research group
           documents the seriousness of the problem in Chitwan. A comparative cross-sectional
           study was conducted among 90 vegetable farmers using hand pressured backpack sprayers
           and 90 blood donors. Fifty %, 15 % and 13 % of the pesticides used by the vegetable
           farmers could be categorized as moderately, highly and slightly hazardous,
           respectively, according to the World Health Organization Hazard Classification.
           Organophosphates were one of the most common pesticides used by the vegetable farmers;
           the moderately hazardous chlorpyrifos and imidacloprid as well as the highly hazardous
           dichlorvos. Poor working practices without adequate safety precautions were common
           among the vegetable farmers. The vegetable farmers reported a higher number of acute
           organophosphate poisoning symptoms and had lower levels of acetyl cholinesterase than
           blood donors. Chitwan has a total population of around 566,661 and was a largely
           uncultivated dense forest before the Nepali government started spraying with the
           insecticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane  for a Malaria Eradication Project in the
           1950s. Immediately, Chitwan became a major farming region and services and
           infrastructure expanded across the area. Out of a total 46,894 hectare of arable land,
           44,291 hectare is used for agricultural purpose (maize, rice, wheat, beans, lentils,
           mustard and vegetables). Agriculture is the primary source of income for 75 % of the
           population. Around 4000-5000 people of the working population is engaged in vegetable
           farming. Chitwan has 40 village district committees  and the District Agricultural
           Office considers 10 of these as pocket areas in terms of vegetable farming based on
           their own observations, experiments, monitoring and personal communication with
           vegetable farmers. The ten pocket areas are Mangalpur, Jagatpur, Shukranagar, Chainpur,
           Bhandara, Gitanagar, Sibanagar, Jutpani, Kumroj and Padampur. Out of these pocket areas
           Gitanagar and Sibanagar are selected for the present study for the following reasons:

        -  There is no involvement in an ongoing pesticide intervention project known to the
           research group.

        -  The placement is logistically practical according to the research establishments.

      Gitanagar has 11.173 people living in 2101 households and Sibanagar has 6937 people living
      in 1314 households. The principal investigator and a local field assistant will visit the
      vegetable farmers' cooperatives in Gitanagar and Sibanagar, District Agricultural Office and
      District of Public Health Office with an oral and written orientation about the study.

      RECRUITMENT STRATEGY:

      Non-probability.

      SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION:

      The sample size calculations are based on a quasi-experimental unpublished study of 25
      vegetable farmers from Chitwan whose acute organophosphate poisoning symptoms and plasma
      cholinesterase levels were measured pre and post an organophosphate spraying session on the
      same day during daily practice conditions.

        -  Mean number of acute organophosphate poisoning symptoms 1.08±1.32 (Pre spraying
           measurement) 2.4±1.87 (Post spraying measurement) 0.0003 (P-value)

        -  Mean U/ml level of plasma cholinesterase 1.41±0.59 (Pre spraying measurement) 1.29±0.54
           (Post spraying measurement) 0.0548 (P-value)

      The pre and post organophosphate spraying measurements are considered to represent the
      &quot;healthiest&quot; and &quot;unhealthiest&quot; condition that the vegetable farmers can be expected to be
      in, respectively. Thus, for the present study the pre and post organophosphate spraying
      measurements are expected to resemble the results among the farmers after having worked with
      organophosphates wearing the LAPPE solution and DP solution, respectively. A sample size
      suitable to the study resources was gained when applying the pre and post results of the
      number of acute organophosphate poisoning symptoms.

        -  Paired means = 1.08, 2.4

        -  Paired standard deviations = 1.320,1.870

        -  Correlation = 0

        -  Sides = 1, 2

        -  Alpha = 0.05

        -  Power = 0.9

      Taking into consideration dropouts, technical problems leading to invalid measurements,
      refusals and co-variables for multivariate analyses 33 % of the sample size (34 pairs) is
      added, the result being rounded up to 50 pairs of farmers needed for the present study.

      DATA ANALYSES:

        -  Descriptive (frequency, proportion, mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, cross
           tables)

        -  Adjusted (t-test, McNemar test, mixed models)

        -  Sensitivity

      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:

      Informal recognition and encouragement in Chitwan will be obtained from the District
      Development Committee, District Agricultural Office and District Public Health Office. An
      advisory opinion from the Danish Ethics Committee will be obtained. Informed consents will
      be retrieved from farmers participating in the pre-testing and experiments.

      The plasma cholinesterase measurement will make it possible to identify farmers with
      abnormal levels. If such cases occur the farmer will be excluded from the study and given
      advice on how to proceed. The small amount of blood required is not considered as damaging
      to the farmers' health. However, the finger stick may have minor risks such as momentary
      pain when the lancet goes into the finger, bruise, visible and sore puncture site for a
      short period, feeling of dizziness or light headedness. Disposable finger stick lancets will
      be used to avoid any infectious transmission.

      The used LAPPE solutions with organophosphate residues will be stored in sealed bags after
      immediate use and on the same day cleaned. The cleaners will be provided personal protective
      equipment during the cleaning. Depending on the results of the study the LAPPE solutions
      will be offered to all participating farmers upon project completion.

      The choice of organophosphates for the experiments will be based on the type of
      organophosphates that the farmers already use. In other words, the farmers will not be
      exposed to less or more dangerous pesticides than what they usually expose themselves to.
      During the data collection the organophosphates will be stored according to their safety
      label recommendations. In case, the remaining organophosphates cannot be used in other
      studies they will be disposed by taking safety precautions as recommended by the World
      Health Organization.

      During all study activities a first aid kit will be accessible and the data collectors will
      wear basic personal protective equipment during the experiments and informed about a safe
      handling of organophosphates.

      During data entry, data is stored on an external hard disk, USB stick 1 and the principal
      investigator's computer under research establishments in the control of the principal
      investigator. Data on the Test Mate Cholinesterase System is automatically deleted when the
      power is switched off. Every week a full backup of the data file will be saved on a USB
      stick placed outside research establishments under the principal investigator's control
      until the data entry is complete. Data editing and analysis will be based on a data file
      without sensitive information (like name, address and phone number). The data file will be
      saved on an external hard disk, USB stick and the principal investigator's computer drop box
      on a daily basis and kept under secure conditions and with only access to the principal
      investigator.

      The following data will be stored in a locked safe under research establishments in the sole
      control of the principal investigator:

        -  Original data (sound file and completed surveys)

        -  File with raw data (USB stick 1)

        -  File with analyzable and anonymized data  (USB stick 1)

        -  File linking farmers' sensitive information with their study identification number (USB
           stick 1)

      The following data will be stored in a locked safe outside research establishments in the
      sole control of the principal investigator and safe owners:

      • File with analyzable data excluding sensitive information (USB stick 2) If necessary,
      during analysis and interpretation of results the research group can get access to the file
      with analyzable and anonymized data through e-mail. However, the e-mail will not contain the
      file linking sensitive information with study identification numbers and is therefore
      considered as being manually encrypted.

      Upon completion of the research study the original data will be cut into pieces, placed in a
      sealable bag which can be tightly tied, fill the bag with water and then transfer the bag to
      a waste container. Blood tests and materials used in this regard will be given to Nepal Red
      Cross Society.

      Data stored outside research establishments will be retrieved. Two independent data files;
      one file with analyzable data excluding sensitive information and another file with farmers'
      sensitive information linking to their study identification number and scanned copies of
      informed consents will be stored in Nepal for up to five years. Potential permission to
      store data in Denmark will be seeked from the Danish Data Protection Agency. Upon approval
      data will be sent to the Danish Data Archive for indefinite storage time with data
      documentation. The condition for data access to the Danish Data Archive is that only the
      principal investigator will have access to the data and full control of giving permission
      for sharing data with others in the future. If sharing of data occurs the new researcher
      will have to seek approval from the Danish Data Protection Agency and then consult the
      Danish Data Archive.

    <description>The World Health Organization has constructed a clinical representation of acute organophosphate poisoning consisting of: headache, dizziness, bradycardia, weakness, anxiety, excessive sweating, fasciculations, abdominal cramps, dyspnea, miosis, paralysis, salivation, tearing, ataxia, pulmonary edema, vomiting, diarrhea, confusion, acetyl cholinesterase inhibition. In the present study, all clinical representations except from acetyl cholinesterase inhibition will be evaluated as self-reported acute organophosphate poisoning symptoms. However, some of the clinical representations may be difficult for the farmers' to report themselves and therefore such clinical representations have been translated into more understandable terms. In a survey information on self-reported acute organophosphate poisoning symptoms will be retrieved with the question: &quot;Do you have any of the following symptoms?&quot; with yes/no response options as has been seen in previous studies.</description>
