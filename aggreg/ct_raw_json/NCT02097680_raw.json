Therefore aromatase\n      inhibition increases testosterone levels, which may affect hepatic and cardiac function.\n\n      In this intervention study two groups of hypogonadal obese men are compared. Group A is\n      treated with Letrozole 2.5 mg (aromatase inhibitor) once every two days during four months;\n      a group with normal testosterone and low oestrogen concentrations. Group B is treated with\n      placebo once every two days during four months; this group will retain low testosterone -\n      and high oestrogenic concentrations.\n\n      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate effects of changed sex steroids in obese\n      men on hepatic and cardiac function."
