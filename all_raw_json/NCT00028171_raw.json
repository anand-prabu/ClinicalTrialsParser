The\n      purpose of this study is to see if tacrolimus can be taken once a day instead  of twice a\n      day in kidney transplant patients.\n\n      Transplant patients are required to take several medications to prevent rejection and to\n      treat complications after their transplantation.  Because of the complicated dosing\n      schedule, it can be difficult for patients to follow their medication schedule.  Taking\n      fewer medications less frequently may help transplant patients to better manage their drug\n      therapy.\n\n      Tacrolimus is better absorbed in the body if it is taken in the morning than if it is taken\n      in the evening.  This suggests that tacrolimus can be taken once every morning instead of\n      twice daily in order to produce appropriate drug exposure to prevent organ rejection without\n      increased side effects."
