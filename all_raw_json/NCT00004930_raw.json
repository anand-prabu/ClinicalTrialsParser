Treatment continues for a maximum of 3\n      courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients may reenter\n      at a higher dose level after a 3-month waiting period.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of doxorubicin until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 6 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-36 patients will be accrued for this study."
