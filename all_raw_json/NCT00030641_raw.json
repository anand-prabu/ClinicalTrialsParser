Oblimersen may increase the effectiveness\n      of docetaxel by making the tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. It is not yet known if\n      docetaxel is more effective with or without oblimersen in treating non-small cell lung\n      cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II/III trial to compare the effectiveness of docetaxel with or\n      without oblimersen in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory non-small cell lung\n      cancer that has been previously treated."

Patients are stratified\n      according to response to prior first-line chemotherapy regimen (progression vs stable\n      disease, partial response, or complete response), ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2), and\n      prior paclitaxel treatment (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oblimersen (G3139) IV continuously on days 1-7 and docetaxel IV\n           over 1 hour on day 5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the\n           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responding or\n           stable disease upon completion of 8 courses may receive 8 or more additional courses at\n           physician's discretion.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21\n           days for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Upon\n           completion of 8 courses, patients may continue to receive docetaxel off study at\n           physician's discretion.\n\n      Patients are followed every 9 weeks for up to 18 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 280 patients (140 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
