Acharya Sushruta an ancient Indian Surgeon has described in his text ' Sushruta\n      Samhita' about an ancient Ayurvedic technique of medicated thread called Ksharsutra\n      treatment for Bhagandara ( Fistula in ano). Treatment of anal Fistula (Bhagandara)and\n      Nadi-Vrana(Sinus) with Ksharsutra was practiced by Sushruta (1000-600B.C.) .\n\n      Hypothesis: Aycharya Sushruta advocated  Kshar Sutra therapy in Fistula in ano and in\n      various types of Fistula."

On local examination Patient had discharging sinus at 3 o' clock position on left\n      side of Perianal region. Before planning the treatment other aetiologies were ruled out.\n\n      Diagnosis was confirmed by Fistulogram, suggestive of high anal fistula with internal\n      opening in the anal canal. Under spinal anaesthesia probing was done. Internal opening of\n      Fistula was confirmed by injecting Methylene Blue dye through external opening. The track\n      was directed upward in the anal canal without any tributaries. Length of the tract was 9cm.\n\n      Then Kshar Sutra was tied covering the entire underlying track for cutting and healing under\n      all aseptic precaution. The patient was discharged on the next day of procedure. The Kshar\n      Sutra was changed weekly. To promote healing and to reduce pain and inflammation oral\n      antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medicine were also prescribed.\n\n      The total period of Kshar Sutra treatment was 5 month. The  Kshar Sutra  was a standard\n      medicated thread smeared with Kshar of Apamarga (Achyranthus aspera), Shnuhi (Eforbia\n      Nerrifolia) which has quality of cutting and Haridra(Curcuma Longa) which is used as a\n      antiseptic. The ph value of the thread thus prepared was determined and its sterilization\n      effected by ultraviolet rediation. The alkalinity of Kshar Sutra was 9.2ph."
