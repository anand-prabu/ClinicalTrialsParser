        The study population will include patients of any age with CD or UC in the US with HSTCL
        who are identified through the sponsor's adverse event reporting systems and who were
        exposed to HUMIRA prior to the diagnosis of HSTCL.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female who has received a single dose of HUMIRA prior to a confirmed
             diagnosis of HSTCL.

          2. Confirmed diagnosis of CD or UC as documented by the AbbVie clinical or registry
             investigator or patient's Health Care Provider (HCP).

          3. Confirmed diagnosis of HSTCL by AbbVie review of the patient's medical history
             including signs, symptoms, hematology and other laboratory data and pathology
             reports.

          4. Patients 18 years old and above must voluntarily sign and date each informed consent,
             approved by an Independent Institutional Review Board (IRB), prior to the initiation
             of any study-specific procedure.

          5. For patients less than 18 years old, a parent or guardian must voluntarily sign and
             date an informed consent approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB).  Pediatric
             patients will be included in all discussions in order to obtain verbal or written
             assent according to applicable to IRB requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female has not received adalimumab prior to a confirmed diagnosis of HSTCL.

          2. Unconfirmed diagnosis of HSTCL, CD or UC, respectively.

          3. The patient or the patient's HCP is unwilling to participate.

          4. Patients, or parents or guardians in the case of patients less than 18 years of age,
             who are unable and/or unwilling to sign informed consent.
