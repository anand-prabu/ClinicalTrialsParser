The clinical and\n      laboratory data will be reviewed and the vascular risk factors will be calculated.\n\n      Spectrum analysis: The sound spectrum will be analysis with the FFT, wavelet, entropy,\n      complexity, and HHT algorithms.\n\n      The correlation between change of spectrums and also the correlated clinical, images, and\n      laboratory change will be further analysis by statistic method."
