  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to investigate the efficacy of sirukumab monotherapy compared with
      adalimumab monotherapy in biologic naïve subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis who are
      intolerant to methotrexate, who are considered inappropriate for continued treatment with
      methotrexate or who are inadequate responders to methotrexate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, global, multicenter study of
      subcutaneous (SC) sirukumab monotherapy compared with adalimumab monotherapy in subjects
      with active rheumatoid arthritis. Approximately 510 subjects will be randomly assigned in a
      1:1:1 ratio to receive treatment with adalimumab 40 mg SC every 2 weeks, sirukumab 100 mg SC
      every 2 weeks, or 50 mg SC every 4 weeks, with approximately 170 subjects per treatment
      group.  At Week 16, subjects in all treatment groups who have &lt; 20% improvement from
      baseline in both swollen and tender joint counts will qualify for early escape. The expected
      duration of the study is 68 weeks.  This includes 52 weeks of treatment with study agent and
      16 weeks of safety follow-up after the last study agent administration.  The study will end
      when the last subject completes the last scheduled visit (Week 68 visit or completes the 16
      week safety follow-up, whichever is later). Subject safety will be monitored through the end
      of the study.
