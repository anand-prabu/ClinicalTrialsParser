            "textblock": "Two-thirds of young women in the United States are overweight or obese.  This excess weight\n      may affect how their body metabolizes drugs such as different birth control methods.  There\n      is a not a lot of research about how excess weight could affect the hormone levels of the\n      contraceptive implant.   Methods like the implant contain only progesterone, which is a\n      hormone that does not increase a woman's risk of blood clot.  These methods would be\n      preferred for overweight and obese women because excess weight also increases a woman's risk\n      of blood clot.\n\n      The investigators propose a study comparing blood hormone levels of women using the implant\n      for at least twelve months and in all weight categories.  The investigators hope to show\n      that all women, regardless of weight, will have hormone levels high enough to prevent\n      pregnancy."

            "textblock": "Two-thirds of reproductive-age women in the United States are either overweight or obese.\n      Body composition may affect contraceptive hormone metabolism and possibly efficacy. Phase\n      III studies to date included few women weighing more than 70 kilograms (134 of 923, 14.5%);\n      there were no reported pregnancies in that group.  Data about pregnancy rates for women in\n      higher body mass index (BMI) categories using the etonogestrel implant exists, but we know\n      little about how weight affects the serum etonogestrel levels.  Progestin-only methods, such\n      as the etonogestrel implant, may be preferred over combined methods including estrogens\n      because obesity increases thrombosis risk.\n\n      The investigators propose a prospective study to compare serum etonogestrel levels in the\n      second and third years of implant use between women across body mass index categories.\n\n      Based on previous studies, the investigators expect a difference in etonogestrel levels\n      based on body weight; however, the investigators hypothesize that etonogestrel levels will\n      remain above the threshold for ovulation suppression through three years of implant use for\n      women across BMI categories.\n\n      The investigators will measure the serum levels of etonogestrel in normal weight (BMI <\n      25kg/m2), overweight (BMI \u2265 25kg/m2 and < 30kg/m2), and obese women (BMI \u2265 30kg/m2) using\n      the single-rod contraceptive implant for at least twelve months.  Their primary objective is\n      to compare the three groups and to evaluate whether etonogestrel levels fall below the\n      critical level for contraceptive efficacy (90 pg/mL) (D\u00edaz 1991) in any group."
