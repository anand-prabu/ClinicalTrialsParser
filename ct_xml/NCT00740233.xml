      The investigators are inviting people with fibromyalgia, IBS, interstitial cystitis, chronic
      pain, and other chronic and recurring conditions to sign up and participate in a year-long
      Internet-based survey to study the effectiveness of alternative medicine and the
      interactions among stress and coping, pain, and treatment outcomes.

      The survey is called PROCAIM, which stands for Patient-Reported Outcomes from Complementary,
      Alternative, and Integrative Medicine. PROCAIM was developed under a grant to UCLA
      researchers from the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine.

      This is a web-based study composed of surveys that will recur at intervals over 1 year!

      PROCAIM, which stands for Patient-Reported Outcomes from Complementary, Alternative, and
      Integrative Medicine, was developed to collect and manage longitudinal patient data and
      implement patient-based outcomes assessment protocols at clinical sites around the country
      that offer various forms of CAM as well as clinics that provide the combination of
      conventional medicine with complementary and alternative therapies.  PROCAIM is currently
      being used for a 12 month longitudinal survey to evaluate interactions among stress,
      symptoms, severity, and general well-being among people with fibromyalgia, IBS, chronic
      fatigue, and other chronic pain conditions, and the frequency and impact of co-morbid
      conditions among users of complementary and alternative medicines.
