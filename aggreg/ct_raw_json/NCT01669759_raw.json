Based on the literature\n      review, fatigue symptom is not only common on post-stroke patient and it also has highly\n      correlation with mortality, prognosis and efficacy of rehabilitation. In Traditional Chinese\n      Medicine recording, Wang Qing-ren suggests that the main etiology of stroke is results from\n      qi stagnation and blood stasis, thereafter, the study about qi deficiency and blood stasis\n      became to the main stream for stroke until now. Therefore, the purpose of the present study\n      was to investigate the correlation between the severity of fatigue, and the severity of qi\n      deficiency and blood stasis."
