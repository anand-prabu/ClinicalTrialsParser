            "textblock": "Rationale for this Study\n\n      This study will specifically evaluate the safety and efficacy of RSDN in the prevention of\n      ICD therapy in patients with ventricular dysfunction who are to receive an ICD for either\n      secondary prevention, or primary prevention if they have inducible VT by programmed\n      ventricular stimulation at the time of ICD implantation.\n\n      Description of Procedures\n\n      Screening:\n\n      To take part in this study, you must meet all study requirements.  The screening visit tests\n      and procedures are done to see if you are eligible to be in the study.  The study doctor\n      will review these with you and let you know if you qualify.  The study doctor will make a\n      final decision about your possible study qualification.\n\n      Pre-randomization Procedures:\n\n      After providing written consent the following data will be collected and examinations and\n      tests performed:\n\n        -  A physical examination\n\n        -  Your blood pressure will be taken\n\n        -  A review of your medical history and what medications you are taking\n\n        -  A blood sample will be drawn for routine laboratory tests.\n\n        -  Women who can have children will take a urine pregnancy test.  The test must be\n           negative for you to be in this study.\n\n        -  A Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE)-a non-invasive test where a probe is placed on the\n           chest wall and images are taken through the chest wall of the heart valves and heart\n           muscle, that will measure the left ventricular size (heart wall thickness) and mitral\n           inflow (flow of blood through the heart valve).\n\n        -  An ICD interrogation (if you already have an ICD implanted) - a non-invasive test where\n           a device is placed over the chest wall near your ICD, and data is transmitted\n           wirelessly from your ICD to a laptop for your physician to review.\n\n        -  An electrocardiogram (EKG) - a non-invasive test where several probes are placed on the\n           chest wall that will measure electrical activity in your heart.\n\n      Randomization:\n\n      Immediately following the catheter ablation, patients will undergo a renal angiogram in\n      order to assess suitability for catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation.  A renal\n      angiogram is an x-ray study of the blood vessels in the kidney to evaluate for blockage, and\n      abnormalities that could be affecting the blood supply to the kidney.  It is performed by\n      injecting contrast dye through a catheter (a tiny tube) into the blood vessels of the\n      kidney.  The study doctor will assess whether the renal arteries are suitable to receive\n      catheter-based renal denervation.  Once you agree to participate in this study, by signing\n      this informed consent, and are it is determined that you are eligible to participate you\n      will be randomized to one of two treatment groups immediately following the renal angiogram.\n\n      Randomization means that you are put into a group by chance.  It is like flipping a coin.\n      You will have an equal chance (50%) of being placed in either group.  This study design is\n      single-blinded; you will not know ahead of time which group you will be in.  Only your\n      physician will know which group you are randomized to.\n\n      If you do not already have an ICD, you will undergo ICD placement as part of routine\n      clinical care.  You may undergo ICD placement up to 1 month (30 days) before randomization.\n      An ICD (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator) is a small battery-powered electrical\n      impulse generator which is implanted in patients who are at risk of sudden cardiac death due\n      to ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. The device is programmed to detect\n      abnormal heart beats (cardiac arrhythmia) and correct it by delivering a jolt of\n      electricity.\n\n      The first group will undergo catheter-based sympathetic renal denervation.  Renal\n      Sympathetic Denervation is a procedure that uses a catheter probe inserted into the renal\n      (kidney) artery that deactivates the nerves that are linked to high blood pressure.\n\n      The second group (control group) will receive no further intervention after ICD\n      implantation."
