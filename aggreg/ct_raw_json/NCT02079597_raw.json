Besides it is described to facilitate leukocyte migration especially\n           in the nervous system.\n\n        -  The investigators hypothesize that Ninj1 expression is increased in SIRS patients,\n           which will fortify its impact during inflammation and the transferability from bench to\n           bedside."
