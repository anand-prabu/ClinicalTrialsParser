The study will include screening phase (28 to 2 days prior\n      to the study medication administration), treatment phase (Study medication will be\n      administered on Day 1), and follow-up phase (up to 99 days). Twelve participants will be\n      randomly assigned to CR8020 50 mg/kg or placebo groups in a 2:1 ratio and receive an\n      assigned treatment on Day 1. Safety will be assessed by evaluating adverse events, clinical\n      laboratory tests, 12-lead Electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination. Total\n      maximum duration of participation of an individual participant will be 127 days."
