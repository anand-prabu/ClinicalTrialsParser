            "textblock": "Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG), is now widely used  as a stand-alone procedure for\n      long-term weight loss. With fewer potential morbidities, comparable weight loss and greater\n      ease of conversion to other procedures,  many patients now opt for  LSG as their bariatric\n      procedure of choice. During surgery gastric decompression and calibration are compulsory for\n      patient safety, gastric anatomic delineation,  ease of surgery and optimal weight loss.  The\n      removed gastric volume at surgery seems to predict the procedure's success rates2. LSG\n      performed without calibration (tube) could result in inconsistent staple lines, with\n      retained high sleeve volume and consequent failure. Traditionally, although different tubes\n      are used for gastric decompression and  calibration, this protocol  interrupts operation\n      room (0R) workflow. Accidental stapling of orogastric tubes and bougies  do occur in the OR\n      but are seldom reported. The need for this multiple tube system can be obviated with the\n      ViSiGi\u2122 Calibration Tube System.  A single, multipurpose tube that integrates all these\n      various steps could prevent breaks in OR; improve workflow; reduce patient injuries, cross\n      contamination and transmission of infections; and  a consistent and reproducible staple\n      line. A similar device has been  in use in Europe, Australia and Asia, but the ViSiGi\u2122\n      Calibration Tube System is the first of its kind to be approved by the FDA. Currently,\n      there are no data on its clinical safety/efficacy in comparison to standard care of separate\n      orogastric tube and bougie in the United States.  Therefore, this exploratory study will\n      investigate the gastric delineation ability, general safety and efficacy of the ViSiGi\u2122\n      Calibration Tube System along with the regular bougie in LSG patients over a six- to\n      twelve-month period. Descriptive outcomes will be reported, with no formal sample size\n      calculation in light of the exploratory study design."
