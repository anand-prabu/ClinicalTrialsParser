The investigators believe\n      low awareness of Sleep Apnea and the risk it imposes to an individual health plays an\n      important role in underdiagnosis and low adherence to treatment among Blacks. Hence,\n      culturally and linguistically tailored health education will decrease the knowledge gap and\n      improve adherence to recommended assessment and treatment of sleep Apnea. the investigators\n      believe the effect of adherence to treatment of Sleep apnea is shown to improve the\n      components of Metabolic syndrome and hence promote well control of Hypertension, Diabetes,\n      weight, triglyceride and cholesterol."
