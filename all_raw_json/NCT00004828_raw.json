Determine the liothyronine supplementation dose that counters the fall in serum\n      liothyronine concentrations and provides the greatest potential myocardial benefit after the\n      modified Fontan procedure.\n\n      III.  Evaluate the potential toxicity of exogenous liothyronine administered in children\n      undergoing a modified Fontan procedure."

If no unacceptable toxicity\n      is observed in this group, a third dose level of liothyronine is added to the randomization.\n       A total of 7 patients are enrolled at each dose level.  All randomized study drugs are\n      administered by continuous infusion over 1 hour after surgery.\n\n      Cardiac function is assessed 5 days after surgery."
