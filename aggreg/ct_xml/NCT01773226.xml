  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective single-center study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single
      dose of &quot;APS(TM)&quot; treated patients with OA of the knee who have failed conservative OA
      therapy. The study will also evaluate efficacy by assessing patient pain and functionality.
