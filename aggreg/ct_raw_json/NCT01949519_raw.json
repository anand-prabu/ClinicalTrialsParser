            "textblock": "Docetaxel is the standard, first-line chemotherapeutic agent for castrate resistant prostate\n      cancer. While it has clinically useful activity, there is a strong need for substantial\n      improvement in its efficacy. Possible ways for improving docetaxel monotherapy would be to\n      combine it with an agent that either minimized toxicity (thus allowing higher doses) or\n      improves efficacy (by targeting synergistic pathways). Lycopene is an attractive agent for\n      combination with docetaxel because of its known accumulation in prostate tissue, its low\n      toxicity, and its ability to inhibit signaling through the IGF-1 axis, and to reduce IL6\n      levels.  Lycopene is highly synergistic with docetaxel at inhibiting the growth of prostate\n      cancer in mice. The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)\n      of lycopene given in combination with docetaxel. This dose can then be used for subsequent\n      phase II or phase III studies."

Prior chemotherapy must have been completed at least 1 year prior to\n             start of treatment under this protocol. Prior biologic therapy, or any\n             investigational drug must have been completed at least 28 days prior to start of\n             therapy, and the patient must have recovered from toxicities of prior therapy to\n             grade 1 or less.\n\n          -  Patients must have been surgically or medically castrated, documented by a\n             testosterone level less than 50ng/mL. If the patient is being treated with medical\n             castration, he must be willing to continue this treatment for the duration of the\n             study.  ADT should not be initiated, terminated, or dose-adjusted during the study.\n\n          -  Prior external beam radiation therapy (to less than 30% of the bone marrow only) is\n             allowed.  At least 28 days must have elapsed since the completion of radiation\n             therapy and the patient must have recovered from side effects.  Prior treatment with\n             samarium-153, radium-223, or strontium-86 is allowed if at least eight weeks have\n             elapsed since dosing, and all toxicities have resolved to grade 1.  Soft tissue\n             disease which has been radiated in the prior 2 months is not assessable as measurable\n             disease.\n\n          -  Patients may have received prior surgery.

Liver function tests should be evaluated prior to each treatment.\n\n          -  Patients must have adequate renal function as defined by a serum creatinine \u22641.5 x\n             the institutional upper limit of normal obtained within 14 days prior to start of\n             therapy.\n\n          -  Men of child bearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective\n             contraception while on treatment and for at least 3 months thereafter.\n\n          -  Age > 18\n\n          -  Patient must have an ECOG performance status 0-2.\n\n          -  Patients must meet the following hematological criteria (minimal values):\n\n          -  Absolute neutrophil count > 1,500/mcL\n\n          -  Hemoglobin of > 8.0gm/dL,\n\n          -  White blood cell count >2,500/mcL,\n\n          -  Platelets > 100,000/mcL Patients with lower values may participate if, in the opinion\n             of the investigator, the cytopenias are the result of bone marrow involvement with\n             active prostate cancer.\n\n          -  Patients must be able to take oral medications.\n\n          -  All patients must be informed and must sign and give written informed consent in\n             accordance with institutional and federal guidelines.
