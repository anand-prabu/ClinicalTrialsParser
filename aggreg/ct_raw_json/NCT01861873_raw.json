In\n      functional treatment planning, additional information on distribution of the function\n      derived from functional imaging of normal tissue is taken into account. by functional\n      treatment planning it becomes possible to prioritize and spare the best functioning part of\n      an organ.\n\n      Aim: To test whether functional treatment planning based on 18-FDGal PET/CT may spare the\n      best functioning liver tissue.\n\n      Endpoints: Reduction in hepatic systemic clearance (K) in the dynamic 18-FDGal PET/CT scan\n      one month after SBRT compared to the baseline status in sub-volumes recieving 15 Gy or\n      higher. Secondly, the investigators will evaluate the toxicity to SBRT by a toxicity scoring\n      system that includes biochemical measures as well as symptomatic scores."
