  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess exercise performance in 20 healthy children 10-19
      years of age with a body mass index greater than 85th percentile and to evaluate the effect
      of dietary and exercise intervention over 12 weeks.

      Our hypothesis is that the vascular health in these children will improve at the end of
      intervention. The results of this study will help us in our long-term objective of improving
      vascular health of children with congenital/acquired heart disease, a group particularly at
      risk for premature atherosclerosis.

    <description>Tests will include: EndoPAT analysis to assess endothelial function, applanation tonometry to assess arterial stiffness, carotid artery imaging to assess the wall thickness of the carotid arteries, exercise testing to assess the physical exercise capacity of these children and blood work to evaluate the lipid profile and inflammation status (CRP). The participant will be asked to come in after an overnight fast. They will receive a snack bag before the exercise test.</description>

The Home Exercise Program will be 3 days a week for 12 weeks and participants will connect with the trainer to perform 45-60 minutes of a combination of strength training and aerobic activity via Skype. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension(DASH) eating pattern will be prescribed to all participants in the treatment group and specific strategies to achieve goals will be discussed weekly by the participant over the phone.</description>
