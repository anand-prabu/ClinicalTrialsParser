            "textblock": "Although anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy is generally effective as\n      treatment for center-involved diabetic macular edema (DME), a substantial proportion of\n      anti-VEGF-treated eyes with DME do not achieve vision of 20/20 or complete resolution of\n      retinal thickening. Indeed, over 50% of ranibizumab-treated eyes did not achieve a 2 or more\n      line improvement in visual acuity from baseline at 2 years in Protocol I, a previous\n      DRCR.net (Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network) study. Furthermore, 27% of\n      ranibizumab-treated eyes still had central subfield (CSF) thickness  on time-domain optical\n      coherence tomography (OCT) \u2265 300 at 1 year, and more than 40% of ranibizumab-treated eyes\n      did not achieve complete resolution of retinal thickening (< 250 microns) by 2 years. Thus,\n      there is a need for alternative or additional treatments that will improve vision by\n      reducing retinal edema in eyes with persistent DME following previous anti-VEGF therapy.\n      Intravitreal steroid is not as efficacious as ranibizumab in eyes with DME overall, but it\n      has been shown to have a positive effect for DME in some eyes and might add benefit in eyes\n      that are already receiving anti-VEGF.\n\n      The main objective of this study is to assess whether the addition of steroid to an\n      anti-VEGF treatment regimen in pseudophakic eyes has beneficial effect short-term in eyes\n      with persistent DME and vision impairment despite previous anti-VEGF therapy, compared with\n      continued anti-VEGF therapy alone. This study will provide important information for the\n      design of a future confirmatory phase III clinical trial on the efficacy of combination\n      steroid and anti-VEGF in eyes with persistent DME and vision impairment following previous\n      anti-VEGF therapy. The primary outcome for efficacy will be the mean change in visual acuity\n      at 24 weeks.\n\n      Each study eye is required to complete a 12-week run-in phase. The run-in phase will\n      identify study eyes that truly have persistent DME despite anti-VEGF therapy by requiring an\n      additional 3 injections while also collecting standardized visual acuity and OCT\n      measurements. At the enrollment, 4-week and 8-week visits of the run-in phase, enrolled eyes\n      will receive an intravitreal injection of ranibizumab 3mg. Then at the 12-week run-in visit,\n      if the eye still has persistent DME, it will be randomized to receive either intravitreal\n      sham+intravitreal ranibizumab 0.3 or intravitreal dexamethasone+intravitreal ranibizumab 0.3\n      injections. The randomized study duration is 24 week, during which a protocol visit takes\n      place every month. The combination injections of sham+ranibizumab or dexamethasone\n      +ranibizumab will be given at the randomization visit (baseline) and at the 12-week visit\n      after randomization. In between, an intravitreal injection of ranibizumab only will be given\n      to study eyes at the 4, 8, 16 and 20 week visits."

An ocular condition is present (other than DME) that, in the opinion of the\n             investigator, might affect macular edema or alter visual acuity during the course of\n             the study (e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease,\n             neovascular glaucoma, etc.).\n\n          4. Substantial posterior capsule opacity that, in the opinion of the investigator, is\n             likely to be decreasing visual acuity by 3 lines or more (i.e., opacity would be\n             reducing acuity to 20/40 or worse if eye was otherwise normal).\n\n          5.
