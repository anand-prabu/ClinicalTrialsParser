Half of the sample are randomized to\n      receive a multi-component technology-based intervention (MCTI) targeting adherence to daily\n      controller medication. The MCTI consists of two components: 1) 2 sessions of\n      computer-delivered motivational interviewing targeting medication adherence, and 2)\n      individualized text messaging focused on medication adherence between the sessions. Text\n      messages are individualized based on Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). The remaining\n      half of participants complete a series of computer-delivered asthma education modules\n      matched for length, location, and method of delivery of the intervention session.  Control\n      participants also receive text messages between intervention sessions. Message content is\n      the same for all control participants and contain general facts about asthma (not tailored)."
