  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney
      disease (ADPKD) have opened up possibilities of new therapies to prevent disease
      progression. High quality clinical investigations in patients with ADPKD, however, pose
      significant challenges to investigators including limited access to patients with
      ADPKD,insufficient guidance by experienced investigators and lack of resources to conduct
      these studies.

      The Polycystic Kidney Disease Research Clinical and Translational Core (P30) aims to
      establish an infrastructure that will assist investigators in designing and conducting
      highest quality clinical and translational research focused on a diverse group of patients
      with ADPKD.

      Objective 1: To establish a Mid-Atlantic cohort of ADPKD patients (N=200) with baseline
      clinical phenotyping performed at the General Clinical Research Unit of the University of
      Maryland School of Medicine.

      Objective 2: To establish a state-of-the-art biobank of specimens from the ADPKD cohort
      including serum, plasma,urine and DNA.

      Objective 3: To develop a collaborative network of physicians and practices in the
      Mid-Atlantic region who will contribute to the ADPKD cohort and will be willing to refer
      patients for future studies and trials.

      Objective 4: To establish a web-based registry of ADPKD patients in the Mid-Atlantic area.
