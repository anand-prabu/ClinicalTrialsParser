Determine the dose limiting\n      toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Assess any antitumor activity of this\n      regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study of irinotecan. Patients receive\n      docetaxel IV over 1 hour followed immediately by irinotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8,\n      15, and 22. Treatment continues every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until\n      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding\n      that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every\n      3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study."
