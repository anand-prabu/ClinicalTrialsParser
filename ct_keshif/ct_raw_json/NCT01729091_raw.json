            "textblock": "The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of immune\n      cells called natural killer (NK) cells that can be given with chemotherapy and a stem cell\n      transplant to patients with myeloma.  Researchers want to learn if adding NK cells will help\n      make the stem cell transplant more effective in treating the disease.  The safety of this\n      treatment will also be studied.\n\n      NK cells may kill myeloma cells that remain in your body after your last chemotherapy\n      treatment.  The NK cells are separated from the umbilical cord blood sample.  These\n      separated NK cells will then be \"grown\" (manipulated) in the lab to increase the number of\n      NK cells that can be given to you by vein.\n\n      Lenalidomide (Revlimid) is designed to block a protein that plays a role in cell function\n      and growth, which may cause cancer cells to die.\n\n      Melphalan is designed to attach to the DNA (genetic material) of cells, which may cause\n      cancer cells to die.  It is commonly used in stem cell transplantation.\n\n      IL-2 is a naturally-occurring protein (cytokine) that can enhance NK cell function."

            "textblock": "NK Cell Dose Levels:\n\n      If you choose to participate in this study, you will be assigned to a dose level of NK cells\n      based on when you joined this study.  Up to 4 dose levels of NK cells will be tested.  Three\n      (3) participants will be enrolled at each dose level until the highest tolerable dose level\n      is found.  Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no\n      intolerable side effects were seen.  This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of\n      NK cells is found.  When the highest tolerable dose is found, more participants may be\n      enrolled at that dose level.\n\n      Chemotherapy, NK and Autologous Cell Infusions:\n\n      In stem cell transplant, the days before you receive your stem cells are called minus days.\n      The day you receive the stem cells is called Day 0.  The days after you receive the stem\n      cells are called plus days.\n\n      On Day -8, you will be admitted to the hospital and will receive hydration fluids by vein.\n\n      On Days -8 through -2, you will take lenalidomide by mouth 1 time a day.  You should swallow\n      lenalidomide capsules whole with water at the same time each day.  Do not break, chew, or\n      open the capsules.\n\n      If you miss a dose of lenalidomide, take it as soon as you remember on the same day.  If you\n      miss taking your dose for the entire day, take your regular dose the next scheduled day.  Do\n      not take double your regular dose to make up for the missed dose.  If you take more than the\n      prescribed dose of lenalidomide you should seek emergency medical care if needed and contact\n      study staff right away.\n\n      On Day -7, you will receive melphalan by vein over about 30 minutes.\n\n      On Day -5 (+/-1 day), you will receive the NK cells by vein over about 1 hour.\n\n      From Day-5 to Day -1, depending on when you enter the study, some participants will receive\n      IL-2 daily as a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection.  Your doctor will tell you if you\n      will be receiving this.\n\n      On Day 0, you will receive the stem cell transplant by vein over 30-60 minutes.\n\n      Starting on Day 0, you will receive filgrastim (G-CSF) through a needle under the skin 1\n      time a day every day until your white blood cell count begins to recover.  Filgrastim is\n      designed to help cells in the bone marrow to multiply, which helps to raise white blood cell\n      counts more quickly, lower fever, and decrease the risk of infection.\n\n      You will receive antibiotics as standard of care to help prevent an infection.\n\n      You may receive lenalidomide, melphalan, IL-2, NK cells, and/or the transplant as an\n      outpatient, if your study doctor approves.\n\n      Pregnancy Tests While Taking Lenalidomide:\n\n      Women who are able to become pregnant must have 3 negative pregnancy tests: within 10-14\n      days before lenalidomide is prescribed, within 24 hours before lenalidomide is prescribed,\n      and about 28 days after the last lenalidomide dose.  You must fill the prescription within 7\n      days.\n\n      One (1) time a week for the first month you start taking lenalidomide, women who are able to\n      become pregnant will have blood (about 1 teaspoon) drawn for a pregnancy test.  Then, in\n      females with regular menstrual cycles, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for pregnancy\n      testing about 28 days after the last dose of lenalidomide.  If menstrual cycles are\n      irregular, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn every 2 weeks, around 14 and 28 days after\n      the last dose of lenalidomide.\n\n      These blood tests will be part of a routine blood draw whenever possible.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      Before you start treatment, the following tests/procedures will be performed if they were\n      not done as part of the routine pre-transplant procedure:\n\n        -  You will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to check the status of the disease.\n           To collect a bone marrow aspiration, an area of the hip or chest bone is numbed with\n           anesthetic, and a small amount of bone and bone marrow is withdrawn through a large\n           needle.\n\n        -  You will have a series of x-rays (a bone survey) to check the status of the disease.\n\n      Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected to check the status of the disease.\n\n      -You will be asked about any symptoms you may be having.\n\n      Up to twice a week from Day -4 to Day +7, blood (about 2 tablespoons each time) will be\n      drawn to check for donor NK cells, if you are one of the first 12 participants enrolled in\n      this study.  If donor NK cells are found, blood (about 2 tablespoons each time) will be\n      drawn 1 time each week until around Day +30 (+/-3 days).  From 30 to about 100 days after\n      stem cell transplant, this blood will be drawn only if you had NK cells in your blood at the\n      last blood draw and you are having a routine follow-up visit.\n\n      At each visit after the NK cell infusion on Day -5, or as often as your study doctor thinks\n      it is needed, you will be checked for possible reactions to the transplant and study drugs,\n      including graft versus host disease (GVHD).  GVHD is a condition in which transplanted\n      tissue attacks the body into which it is transplanted in patients receiving a stem cell\n      transplant.  Graft failure occurs when transplanted stem cells may not be able to grow and\n      multiply in your body.  If this happens, there will be a high risk of infections and/or\n      bleeding.  If the number of white blood cells does not get back to high enough levels within\n      3 weeks after the transplant, more stem cells may need to be given.\n\n      Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn and urine will be collected for routine tests and to\n      check your kidney and liver function as often as your study doctor thinks it is needed.\n\n      Long-Term Follow-Up:\n\n      About 30 days after the stem cell transplant:\n\n        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn to check the status of the disease.\n\n        -  Urine will be collected to check the status of the disease.\n\n        -  If your study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspiration and\n           biopsy to check the status of the disease.\n\n      About 100 days after the stem cell transplant, blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn and\n      urine will be collected to check the status of the disease.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You will remain in this study 100 days after the stem cell transplant.  Your participation\n      on this study will be over when you have completed this long-term follow-up visit.\n\n      You will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse, you have any infections,\n      intolerable side effects occur, you are not able to receive the stem cell transplant, you\n      need medical treatment not allowed in this study, your study doctor decides it is in your\n      best interest, you cannot keep appointments or take study drugs as instructed, or if you\n      decide that you want to leave the study early.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  The way researchers make the NK cells is investigational.\n       At this time, it is being used in research only.  The NK cell preparation will be provided\n      at no cost to you.\n\n      Lenalidomide is FDA approved and commercially available to treat patients with multiple\n      myeloma who have received at least 1 prior therapy.\n\n      IL-2 and melphalan are commercially available and FDA approved for the treatment of myeloma.\n\n      Up to 18 participants will be enrolled in this study.  All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."
