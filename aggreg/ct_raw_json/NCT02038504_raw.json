Mechanisms in\n      the pathogenesis of NTIS are not yet well understood. Our previous study demonstrated that\n      NTIS occurred frequently with a prevalence of 57.5% in gastrointestinal fistulas patients.\n      In recent study, it has been shown that early enteral nutrition decreases the duration of\n      hospitalization and mortality in the burn population, indicating a potential role of enteral\n      nutrition in NTIS.In addition, the management of fistula patients requires bundle therapy\n      including Nutrition therapy, especially enteral nutrition.The purpose of this study is to\n      investigate whether enteral nutrition are effective in the treatment of nonthyroidal illness\n      syndrome among fistula patients."
