    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Eosinophils are white blood cells that help fight infections. High eosinophil levels can
      damage people   s organs, causing hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). Researchers want to
      study if the drug benralizumab can help people with HES.

      Objective:

      - To test if benralizumab can safely decrease eosinophils in people with HES.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults age 18-65 who have been on stable HES therapy for at least 1 month but still have
      symptoms and high eosinophil levels.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and urine and blood
           tests. They will take simple heart and lung tests.

        -  Participants will also have a bone marrow biopsy. A numbing medicine is injected into
           the outer covering of the bone. Then a needle is inserted into the bone. A fast suction
           movement takes bone marrow cells.

        -  Phase 1: Participants will randomly receive either the study drug or placebo as an
           injection.

        -  They will have daily visits for the next 3 days, then 4 weekly visits, and then 4
           biweekly visits. Each time, they will have medical history, physical exam, blood tests,
           and a check of side effects.

        -  They will receive another dose of the study drug or placebo at 1 month and 2 months
           after the first injection.

        -  Phase 2 repeats the Phase 1 schedule. All participants will receive the study drug.

        -  At 1 visit, participants will also receive a vaccine. At 4 visits, they will repeat the
           heart and lung tests. They will also have one other bone marrow biopsy.

        -  After week 24, participants will receive the study drug either 6 times over 6 months or
           twice over 6 months.

    <textblock>
      Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a rare group of heterogeneous disorders characterized by
      marked peripheral eosinophilia (&gt; 1500/(micro)L) and evidence of eosinophil-associated
      tissue damage. Although a high proportion of patients respond initially to corticosteroid
      therapy, high doses are often necessary to control the eosinophilia and clinical symptoms,
      and many patients become relatively refractory to therapy and/or develop serious side
      effects. IL-5 receptor (alpha) (IL-5R (alpha) expression in humans is restricted to
      eosinophils, basophils, mast cells and their precursors and is, therefore, an ideal target
      for the therapy of HES. To date, there have been no safety concerns with benralizumab
      (anti-IL-5R(alpha)) in Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials in humans and ongoing studies in asthma
      are promising. In order to explore the safety and efficacy of benralizumab in the treatment
      of HES, 20 adults (men and non-pregnant women, 18-75 years of age) with HES who are are
      symptomatic with AEC &gt; 1000/(micro)L on stable HES therapy for at least 1 month will be
      recruited for this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase II trial. Benralizumab
      or placebo will be administered subcutaneously for 3 months, after which all subjects will
      receive benralizumab subcutaneously for 3 months. Eosinophil counts will be blinded for a
      subject  and background therapy will not be tapered until that subject has been on study for
      13 weeks. At weeks 12, 16, and 20, all subjects will receive a sc injection of benralizumab.
      Subjects demonstrating a response at the 24 week visit (eosinophil count &lt; 1000/(alpha) L
      and stable or improved clinical symptoms without an increase in background HES therapy) will
      continue to receive additional subcutaneous injections every 4 weeks. Following the initial
      dose of benralizumab or placebo and the first open-label dose of benralizumab, subjects will
      be followed daily for 3 days, weekly for 4 weeks, and every 2 weeks for 8 weeks. Subsequent
      visits will be at 4 weeks intervals for responders and 12 weeks intervals for non-responders
      for the duration of the study. Subjects will receive diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis
      (TdaP) booster immunization at the 22 week visit. Titers will be measured 6 weeks after
      immunization.The primary endpoint of the study is a 50% reduction in peripheral blood
      eosinophilia on stable background therapy at 12 weeks post-inititation of study drug.
      Secondary endpoints will include absolute eosinophil count, the frequency and severity of
      adverse events, reduction in signs and symptoms of HES, tissue eosinophilia, numbers of
      eosinophils, mast cells and their precursors in bone marrow, levels of markers of eosinophil
      and mast cell activation, eosinophil count and background HES therapy at 1 year, and
      pharmacokinetics and anti-drug antibody (ADA) levels. Subjects who complete the study and
      for whom benralizumab provides sustained clinical benefit, may be eligible to receive drug
      on a planned open-label extension protocol until regulatory approval and commercial
      availability of the marketed drug to prescribing physicians (for any indication), or until
      development of benralizumab is discontinued by MedImmune.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        A subject will be eligible for participation in the study only if all of the following
        criteria apply:

          1. Male or female subject greater than or equal to18 and less than or equal to 65 years
             of age at screening.

          2. A female subject is eligible for this study only if she is not pregnant or
             breast-feeding and one of the following:

               1. Of childbearing potential but agrees to practice effective contraception, as
                  determined by the PI, or abstinence throughout the study and for 3 months after
                  administration of the last dose of investigational study drug

               2. Of non-child-bearing potential

        Females of non-child-bearing potential are defined as females with functioning ovaries
        with a documented history of tubal ligation or hysterectomy or females who are
        post-menopausal, as defined by 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with an appropriate
        clinical profile, e.g. age appropriate, &gt; 45 years, in the absence of hormone replacement
        therapy. In questionable cases, a blood sample for follicle stimulating hormone and
        estradiol will be obtained to confirm child-bearing potential.

        Acceptable methods of contraception may include one or more of the following:

        1) male partner who is sterile prior to the female subject   s entry into the study and is
        the sole sexual partner for the female subject; 2) implants of levonorgestrel; 3)
        injectable progestogen, 4) an intrauterine device with a documented failure rate of &lt; 1%;
        and 5) double barrier methods including diaphragm or condom with a spermicide.

        3) A male subject is eligible for this study only if he is one of the following:

          1. Surgically sterile

          2. Agrees to practice effective contraception (see above) or abstinence throughout the
             study and for 3 months after the last administration of the investigational study
             drug

             4) Documented diagnosis of HES (history of persistent eosinophilia &gt; 1500/(micro) L
             without secondary cause and evidence of end organ manifestations attributable to the
             eosinophilia)

             5) Signs or symptoms of HES and AEC &gt; 1000/(micro) L on stable HES therapy for
             greater than or equal to 1 month at the time of enrollment

             6) Participation in protocol 94-I-0079 (Activation and function of eosinophils in
             conditions with blood or tissue eosinophilia)

             7) Agrees to storage of samples for study

             Participation of Women:

             Contraception: The effects of benralizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown.
             For this reason, men and women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to
             study entry and for the duration of study participation. Females of childbearing-age
             must have a negative pregnancy test result prior to receiving benralizumab. During
             the course of the study, if a woman becomes pregnant or suspects she is pregnant, she
             should inform the study staff and her primary care physician immediately. If a
             subject becomes pregnant, the investigational drug will be discontinued immediately,
             and the subject will be counselled as to how to resume approved therapeutic options
             in consultation with an obstetric provider.

             EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

             A subject will be excluded from participation in the study if any of the following
             criteria apply at the time of enrollment:

               1. Subjects with life-threatening or other serious illness or clinical
                  manifestation of HES deemed inappropriate for inclusion in study per the
                  principal investigator, including but not restricted to severe cardiac
                  involvement and prior thromboembolic disease.

               2. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or other known immunodeficiency

               3. Positive hepatitis B surface antigen, or hepatitis C virus antibody serology, or
                  a positive medical history for hepatitis B or C. Patients with a history of
                  hepatitis B vaccination without history of hepatitis B are allowed to enroll

               4. Presence of FIP1L1/PDGFRA or another known imatinib-sensitive mutation

               5. Diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis or serum tryptase level &gt; 40 ng/mL

               6. Known lymphoma, hematological malignancy, advanced and metastatic solid tumors
                  and/or subjects who are under chemotherapy, radiotherapy or interleukin 2
                  treatment

               7. Known history of allergic or anaphylactic reaction to previous antibody therapy,
                  including intravenous immunoglobulin and licensed or experimental monoclonal
                  antibodies.

               8. A helminth parasitic infection diagnosed within 24 weeks prior to the date
                  informed consent is obtained

               9. Acute bacterial or viral infection (subjects may be enrolled once the acute
                  infection has resolved).

              10. Receipt of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) within 30 days prior to the date
                  informed consent is obtained

              11. Receipt of any marketed (eg omalizumab) or investigational biologic within 4
                  months or 5 half-lives prior to the date informed consent is obtained, whichever
                  is longer

              12. Receipt of live attenuated vaccines 30 days prior to the date of randomization

              13. Receipt of inactive/killed vaccinations (e.g. inactive influenza) are allowed

                  consent is obtained

              16. Previous treatment with benralizumab (MEDI-563).

             Co-enrollment Guidelines: Co-enrollment in other trials is restricted, other than
             enrollment on observational studies or those evaluating the use of a licensed
             medication. Study staff should be notified of co-enrollment as it may require the
             approval of the Investigator.

             Justification for Exclusion of Children:

             Because there are insufficient data regarding dosing or adverse events available in
             adults to judge the potential risk in children, children are excluded from this
             study.
