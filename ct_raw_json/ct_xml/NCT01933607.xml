      This Single-Arm Post-Marketing Evaluation will gauge the improvement in function and pain
      for lumbar spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis patients with the TOPS System.    Patients
      who are scheduled to undergo spinal surgery as part of their medical treatment and comply
      with the study inclusion/exclusion criteria will be recruited.  Patients will undergo
      standard surgical decompression prior to device implantation.  For patients with two or
      three levels of disease, the TOPS System will be combined with the Versalink Fixation
      System.  All study devices are CE marked.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Any subject meeting the following criteria will be considered for inclusion in this trial.

          1. Patients with one or both of the following conditions at a single spinal level
             between L3 and L5 are eligible for the TOPS™ System:

               -  Symptomatic monosegmental lumbar spinal stenosis or facet arthrosis

               -  Degenerative Spondylolisthesis up to and including grade 1

          2. At least three (3) months of failed, conservative treatment, including use of
             anti-inflammatory medications at maximum specified dosage; epidural/facet injections,
             unless deemed inadvisable due to progressive motor weakness or other evidence of
             deteriorating condition; rest, heat, electrotherapy/physical therapy;

          3. Moderate to Severe narrowing of the lumbar spinal canal identified on CT /MRI scans

          4. Age 40-85 years old

          5. Lower back pain /sciatica with or without spinal claudication

          6. Psychosocially, mentally and physically able to fully comply with the clinical
             protocol and willing to adhere to the follow-up schedule.

          7. VAS leg pain of at least 40/100 at baseline.

          8. Oswestry Questionnaire score of at least 40/100 at baseline

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients who meet any of the following conditions or criteria are excluded from this
        study:

          1. Primary diagnosis of discogenic back pain at the TOPS System level

          2. Back or non-radicular leg pain of unknown etiology at the TOPS System level

          3. Lytic spondylolisthesis at the TOPS System level

          4. More than one (1) motion segment involved in the degenerative pathology to the extent
             that justifies its inclusion in the surgical procedure, unless a decompression alone
             can be done at that level without compromising stability.

          5. Known allergy to titanium and/or polyurethane

          6. Prior surgery at any lumbar vertebral level.

          7. Supplemental interbody support required (e.g., VBRs, or fusion cages) at the TOPS
             System level

          8. Clinically compromised vertebral bodies at the affected level(s) due to any
             traumatic, neoplastic, metabolic or infectious pathology.

          9. Deformity of the spine that would compromise the implant, e.g. scoliosis of greater
             than ten (10) degrees

         10. Morbid obesity (a body mass index &gt; 40) or a weight more than 100 lbs. over ideal
             body weight.

         11. DEXA bone density T score equal to or lower than - 2.0

         12. Paget's disease, osteomalacia, osteogenesis imperfecta, thyroid and/or parathyroid
             gland disorder and/or any other metabolic bone disease.

         13. Active infection - systemic or local

         14. AIDS, HIV, or active hepatitis

         15. Rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune disease.

         16. Tuberculosis active or in the past 3 years.

         17. Active malignancy: A patient with a history of any invasive malignancy (except
             non-melanoma skin cancer), unless he/she has been treated with curative intent and
             there have been no clinical signs or symptoms of the malignancy for at least 5 years.

         18. Medical conditions requiring treatment with any drugs known to potentially interfere
             with bone/soft tissue healing

         19. Pregnant or interested in becoming pregnant in the next 3 years.

         20. Current chemical/alcohol dependency or psychosocial disturbance.

         21. Cauda equina syndrome or neurogenic bowel/bladder dysfunction

         23. Sustained pathologic fractures of the vertebra or multiple fractures of the vertebra
             or hip

         24. Unremitting pain in any spinal position

         25. Significant peripheral neuropathy

         26. Immunologically suppressed, received steroids &gt; 1 month out of the past year aa.
             Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus bb. Currently taking anticoagulants other than
             aspirin (e.g., Plavix) cc. Life expectancy less than 3 years dd. Waddell signs &gt; 3
