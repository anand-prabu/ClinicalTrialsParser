      The purpose of this study is to determine if MGAH22 is effective in the treatment of certain
      patients with relapsed or refractory advanced breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the pivotal study that established that Herceptin速 was highly effective when added to
      standard chemotherapy in the front-line treatment of women with HER2 positive metastatic
      breast cancer, benefit appeared to accrue to those patients whose tumors expressed the HER2
      oncoprotein at the 3+ level by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or those patients whose tumors
      demonstrated evidence of HER2 gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization
      (FISH) testing. Similarly, when Herceptin速 was used as a single therapy in women with
      metastatic breast cancer that had progressed following cytotoxic chemotherapy, 3+
      overexpression of HER2, but not 2+ expression, was associated with response to treatment.
      These and other studies have led to the recommendation that Herceptin速 should be
      administered to patients with breast cancer whose tumors exhibit 3+ overexpression or gene
      amplification. This study will evaluate whether treatment of patients with tumors that would
      not be expected to respond to Herceptin速 therapy, namely those that lack HER2 gene
      amplification and express the oncoprotein at the 2+ level by IHC, may benefit from the use
      of the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, MGAH22. If 5 or more responses are seen in 41
      evaluable patients, then further clinical development of MGAH22 will be justified.

    <description>Response based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria based on Cycle 2, Day 22 computed tomography (CT) scans. This study will employ a Simon two-stage optimum design in which an initial cohort of 21 patients will be treated with MGAH22. If two or more responses (partial or complete response) are seen at the first tumor re-evaluation on day 22 of Cycle 2, the study will be expanded to include up to 41 patients (20 additional patients in Cohort 2, the second stage of the study) in order to determine whether further development of the drug is warranted (5 or more responses in 41 evaluable patients).</description>
