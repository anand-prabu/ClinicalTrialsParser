The purpose of the study is to determine\n      the effectiveness of the combination of PD 0332991, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (PLD) in\n      treating relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. PD 0332991 (Palbociclib) is an experimental\n      drug and is a pill taken by mouth. It works by blocking specific growth signals within\n      cancer cells. Lenalidomide (also called Revlimid) is approved for use with dexamethasone for\n      people with multiple myeloma who have received prior therapy. Study participants will\n      receive different doses of Palbociclib and lenalidomide depending on when they enroll in the\n      study. The study will help determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of the\n      study drugs. Treatment schedule (treatment cycles are 28 days):\n\n        -  Palbociclib daily for Days 1-14 of each cycle\n\n        -  Lenalidomide daily for Days 8-21 (or Days 1-21, depending on dose level) of each cycle\n\n        -  Dexamethasone on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each cycle. Participants will continue on\n           study treatment as long as they are responding to therapy and not experiencing\n           unacceptable side effects."
