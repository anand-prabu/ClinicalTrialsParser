It is not yet known if\n      breast-conserving treatments are as effective as mastectomy followed by radiation therapy in\n      treating locally advanced breast cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of breast-conserving\n      therapy with mastectomy followed by radiation therapy in treating women who have locally\n      advanced breast cancer that has been previously treated with chemotherapy."

Patients are stratified according to\n      participating center, initial stage (T0, T1, T2, T3, or Tx vs T4), response to prior\n      induction chemotherapy (complete response (CR) vs other), and menopausal status\n      (premenopausal vs postmenopausal). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo mastectomy followed by radiotherapy.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive breast-conserving treatment comprising 1 of 3 of the following\n           therapeutic options:\n\n             -  Regimen A: Patients receive radiotherapy alone.\n\n             -  Regimen B: Patients with a partial response (PR) to prior induction chemotherapy\n                undergo limited surgery followed by radiotherapy. Patients with a CR to prior\n                induction chemotherapy undergo radiotherapy alone.\n\n             -  Regimen C: Patients with a partial response (PR) or CR to prior induction\n                chemotherapy undergo radiotherapy alone.\n\n      Patients with a CR to radiotherapy receive no further treatment. Patients with a PR to\n      radiotherapy undergo limited surgery.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at the end of therapy, every 3 months for 2 years,\n      every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      Patients are followed within 1 month, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3\n      years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,300 patients (650 per treatment arm) will be accrued for\n      this study within 5 years."
