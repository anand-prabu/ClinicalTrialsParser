  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The survival of adult patients with standard-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia(ALL) need to
      improve. We want to compare the efficacy of haplo-identical hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT) with chemotherapy for adult(age:18-39 years old) ALL patients in
      first phase of complete remission (CR1)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the high complete remission rate (80%-90%) can be achieved, the long-term survival
      rate of standard-risk adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia(ALL) is only 25%-55%
      when they receive  chemotherapy alone. The survival rate can be further improved uo to
      50%-75% when they receive HLA-matched HSCT However, the chance of finding a HLA-matched
      donor is low, especially in China. Alternative donor such as halpo-identical related donor
      might be an choice.

      Our retrospective analysis showed about 59% overall survival could be achieved when
      standard-risk adult ALL patients received  halpo-identical HSCT.Therefore, we start this
      randomization controlled trial  to  compare the efficacy of haplo-identical HSCT with
      chemotherapy for adult(age:18-39 years old) ALL patients in CR1.

Graft versus-host disease(GVHD) prevention regimen: CSA/MMF/MTX, cyclosporine A(CSA) 1.25mg/kg/d, i.v administrated in two doses from day -109 until bowel function returned to normal, at which time patients receive oral CSA until 12months after HSCt and then gradually tapered. Every 12h, 0.5g mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)(0.25g for children) was administrated orally from day -10 to +30 and subsequently 0.25g from days +30 to +60. Methotrexate (MTX) was administrated at a dose of 15mg/m2 on day +1 and 10mg/m2 on days +3,+6, and +11.</description>
