  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this trial is to assess the response rate, the feasibility and toxicity of
      the treatment with antigen loaded Dendritic Cell Vaccination in Prostate Cancer patients.
      Furthermore we want to investigate biological responses by measuring markers of in-vivo and
      ex-vivo immunomodulation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  histologically or cytologically proven prostatic carcinoma

          -  proven hormonal resistance: tumor progression after orchiectomy or during treatment
             with hormonal agents. Patients treated with antiandrogens, such as flutamide
             (Flucinom) or bicalutamide (Casodex), should have been discontinued the drug 6 weeks
             prior to the trial entry followed by no tumor response within this 6 weeks

          -  not amenable to curative therapy

          -  patients with measurable and non-measurable disease may be included. Bone lesions
             only are considered to be non-measurable

          -  two consecutive increases of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) should be documented
             over a previous reference value (N째1). The first increase in PSA (N째2) should occur a
             minimum of one week from the reference value and be confirmed (N째3). If this value is
             less than the previous value, the patient is still eligible if the next PSA(N째4) is
             found to be higher than the second PSA. Serum levels of prostate-specific antigen
             must be at least 10 microg/l

          -  Previous radiotherapy is allowed if it has been stopped 4 weeks or more before the
             trial treatment and did not involve lesions used to evaluate activity of the trial
             drugs

          -  one previous chemotherapy (including Estracyt) is allowed, but the chemotherapy
             should have been stopped at least 6 weeks before study entry

          -  age &gt;18 years

          -  performance status 0,1,2 (ECOG, Appendix I)

          -  no concurrent therapy with steroids

          -  no uncontrolled infections

          -  live expectancy more than 3 months

          -  Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-Type has to be HLA*A201

          -  neutrophile count &gt;1500/microl and thrombocytes &gt;100 000/microl

          -  creatinine &lt;1.5 of upper normal level

          -  adequate liver function with bilirubin &lt;2 of upper normal level, alanine
             aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate transamionase (ASAT) &lt; 3 x upper normal level

          -  absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule;
             those conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the
             trial

          -  before patient registration/randomization, informed consent must be given according
             to good clinical practice (GCP), and national/local regulations

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  serious concomitant disease (cardiac, pulmonary and others)

          -  brain metastasis

          -  previous splenectomy or radiotherapy to the spleen

          -  concurrent therapy with immunosuppressive drugs

          -  chronic immunosuppression (includes transplantation or HIV-infection) HIV, hepatitis
             B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) (test required) or any other severe
             uncontrolled infection other neoplastic diseases except: curatively treated basal
             cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or relapse free for more than 5 years
             after curative treatment of a neoplasm

          -  treatment with other investigational drugs during the last month

          -  severe autoimmune disease

          -  chemotherapy, radiotherapy or immunotherapy less than 6 weeks before study entry

          -  Ejection fraction (measured by echocardiography) &lt; 40%
