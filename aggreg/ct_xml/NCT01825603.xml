      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ADH-1 when given together with
      gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin in treating patients with metastatic pancreatic or
      biliary tract cancer that cannot be removed by surgery. ADH-1 may stop the growth of cancer
      cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine
      hydrochloride and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving ADH-1 together with
      gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicities and determine the recommended dose of ADH-1 given twice weekly
      for 3 weeks in combination with cisplatin and fixed-dose rate gemcitabine (gemcitabine
      hydrochloride) given on weeks 1 and 2 of the 3 week schedule for 3 cycles in patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic or biliary tract adenocarcinomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate changes in the levels of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1),
      E-selectin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), soluble vascular endothelial growth
      factor receptor (VEGFR) and basic fibroblast growth factor (B-FGF) during therapy with
      ADH-1, cisplatin and gemcitabine.

      II. Radiographic assessment of disease status after 3 cycles of chemotherapy with ADH-1,
      cisplatin and gemcitabine.

      III. To evaluate progression-free and overall survival of patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic pancreatic or biliary tract adenocarcinomas treated with ADH-1 given with
      cisplatin and fixed dose rate gemcitabine for 3 cycles. Patients with stable or responsive
      disease after 3 cycles will continue on maintenance cisplatin and fixed dose rate
      gemcitabine.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ADH-1 intravenously (IV) over 20-80 minutes on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, and
      18, cisplatin IV and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment
      repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients with stable or responsive disease may receive maintenance therapy with
      cisplatin and gemcitabine hydrochloride.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have adenocarcinoma of the pancreas or biliary tree (intrahepatic or
             extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder or ampulla of Vater) that is locally
             advanced, but non-resectable, metastatic or residual disease after attempted surgical
             resection

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2 or better

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 2000 per mcL or higher

          -  Platelet count of 100,000 per mcL or higher

          -  Patients must have a serum creatinine that is at or below the upper limits of the
             institutional normal range OR a creatinine clearance of 60 mL per min or higher
             corrected for body surface area (BSA)

          -  The total bilirubin must be at or below 2.0 mg/dL in the absence of biliary
             obstruction; if the patient has biliary obstruction, biliary decompression will be
             required; either endoscopic placement of a biliary stent or percutaneous transhepatic
             drainage is acceptable; once biliary drainage has been established, institution of
             protocol therapy may proceed when the total bilirubin falls to 3.0 mg/dL or lower

          -  Patients need not have measurable disease for this study

          -  The patient must be aware of the neoplastic nature of his/her disease and willingly
             provide written, informed consent after being informed of the procedure to be
             followed, the experimental nature of the therapy, alternatives, potential benefits,
             side-effects, risks, and discomforts

          -  Women of reproductive potential must be non-pregnant and non-nursing and must agree
             to employ an effective barrier method of birth control throughout the study and for
             up to 6 months following treatment

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of
             initiating study; (no childbearing potential is defined as age 55 years or older and
             no menses for two years or any age with surgical removal of the uterus and/or both
             ovaries)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients may not have received prior chemotherapy for metastatic adenocarcinoma of
             the pancreas or biliary tract; prior adjuvant chemotherapy is acceptable provided
             that 6 months or longer has elapsed since completion of the prior therapy

          -  History of allergy to platinum compounds or to antiemetics appropriate for
             administration in conjunction with protocol-directed chemotherapy

          -  Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection requiring intravenous antibiotics, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             unstable angina pectoris, or serious, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, that might
             jeopardize the ability of the patient to receive the chemotherapy program outlined in
             this protocol with reasonable safety

          -  Pregnant and nursing women are excluded from this study because the chemotherapy
             agents have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects

          -  Patients with prior malignancy will be excluded except for adequately treated basal
             cell or squamous cell skin cancer, adequately treated noninvasive carcinomas, or
             other cancers from which the patient has been disease-free for at least 5 years
