  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP) are common
      devastating gastrointestinal diseases in premature infants. These infants often need
      surgical intervention to remove the dead bowel and create temporary enterostomies, resulting
      in short bowel syndrome (SBS), a malabsorption state due to insufficient bowel length or
      dysfunction to digest and absorb nutrients adequately.

      These infants are often nourished primarily with parental nutrition (PN) which can lead to
      many complications including PN-associated liver disease. However, with enteral feeding, the
      remaining bowel can adapt somewhat to the shortened state, reducing the need for PN. Enteral
      fats appear to be the most trophic macronutrients with the long chain polyunsaturated fatty
      acids (LCPUFA) being the most beneficial in promoting bowel adaptation.

      Fish oil (FO), a main source of n-3 LCPUFA, has been shown to promote bowel adaptation.
      Microlipid (ML) primarily contains n-6 PUFA and has been found to decrease ostomy output and
      increase weight gain in some SBS infants. WThe investigators will soon have completed a
      randomized clinical trial (EMLFO trial) (WFUHS IRB00011501, NCT01306838) entitled &quot;Early
      Supplementation of Enteral Lipid with Combination of Microlipid and Fish Oil in Infants with
      Enterostomies&quot;. The preliminary data suggest that (a) by supplementing enteral ML/FO, we
      were able to decrease the use of IL; (b) premature infants in the treatment group who
      received ML/FO achieved higher enteral calorie (% of total calorie) intake before
      reanastomosis and better weight gain (g/day) after reanastomosis than those who received
      routine care in control group; and (c) the direct bilirubin level before reanastomosis
      tended to be lower in the treatment group than the control group although the difference was
      not statistically significant. Because the intervention consisted of both an increase in
      enteral fat intake as well as a specific type of fat intake (i.e. FO), it is unclear whether
      improved outcomes in the ML/FO group are attributable to FO's anti-inflammatory effects or
      the increased fat intake. Therefore, the investigators have designed a next randomized
      clinical trial to compare ML alone versus ML plus FO. We hypothesize that as compared to ML
      alone, ML plus FO will result in decreased systemic inflammation, as indicated by blood
      levels of inflammation-related proteins and indicators of oxidative stress.

      In comparison to EMLFO trial, the EMLFO-2 study will modify the eligibility criteria to only
      enroll the infants who have birthweight equal to or less than 1250 g with a jejunostomy or
      ileostomy as the result of surgical treatment for small intestine perforation or NEC in
      order to increase the homogeneity of patient population.
