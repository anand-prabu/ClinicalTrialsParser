Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways\n      to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Heating melphalan to several\n      degrees above body temperature and infusing it only to the area around the tumor may kill\n      more tumor cells.

Compare hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion with melphalan with or without tumor\n      necrosis factor, in terms of response proportion for lesions in the perfusion field, in\n      patients with locally advanced extremity melanoma.\n\n      II. Compare the local recurrence-free survival, improvement in regional symptoms related to\n      tumor, and overall survival in patients treated with these regimens.\n\n      III. Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor\n      burden (high vs low), prior reperfusion (melphalan vs other), regional nodal site (yes vs\n      no), and participating center. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I: Patients undergo hyperthermic isolated perfusions of the lower limb by either the\n      external iliac vessels or the common femoral vessels. Patients undergo perfusions of the\n      upper extremity by the axillary artery and vein using an infraclavicular/axillary incision.\n      Melphalan is introduced into the perfusion by slow injection over 5 minutes and allowed to\n      remain for a total of 60 minutes.\n\n      ARM II: Patients undergo hyperthermic isolated perfusions as in arm I. Tumor necrosis factor\n      is administered by slow injection into the arterial line and allowed to remain for a total\n      of 90 minutes. Melphalan is introduced into the perfusion as in arm I and allowed to remain\n      for a total of 60 minutes.\n\n      Patients are followed within 6 weeks, at 3, 6, and 12 months, every 6 months for 4 years,\n      and then annually thereafter."
