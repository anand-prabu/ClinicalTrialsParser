The\n      micronutrient carnitine, which is present in breast milk and stored in the fetus late in\n      pregnancy, has been shown to protect against brain injury in animal studies. Without\n      supplementation, almost all preterm infants develop carnitine deficiency soon after birth.\n      Thus it is important to determine if carnitine supplementation protects against brain injury\n      and improves developmental outcomes in these vulnerable preterm infants. We hypothesize that\n      preterm infants supplemented early with L-carnitine while receiving parenteral nutrition\n      will not develop carnitine deficiency and will have improved growth in the first two weeks\n      of life and higher scores on developmental tests when compared to control infants who did\n      not receive carnitine."
