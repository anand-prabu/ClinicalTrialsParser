During the first phase, the investigators developed\n      a contraceptive counseling intervention based on the principles of Motivational\n      Interviewing, trained counselors, and conducted a small pilot study to develop skills and\n      refine the intervention.\n\n      The second phase is this feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare outcomes\n      between:\n\n      Group 1 - Women randomized to a 20-40 minute contraceptive counseling session based on the\n      principles of motivational interviewing, vs.\n\n      Group 2 - Women receiving usual clinic care.\n\n      Population:  Women, aged 15-29 years, presenting to the University of Chicago family\n      planning clinic for termination of an unintended pregnancy.\n\n      Hypothesis:  A larger proportion of women who are randomized to receive the MI counseling\n      intervention will be using very effective contraception 3 months after the intervention."
