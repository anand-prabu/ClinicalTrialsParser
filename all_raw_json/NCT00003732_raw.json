Courses repeat every 21 days for a maximum of 6\n      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n        -  Phase I: Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of topotecan until the\n           maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2\n           of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. (phase I closed to accrual 12/21/00)\n\n        -  Phase II: An additional 50 patients receive up to 6 courses of treatment as in phase I\n           at the MTD.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (30 in phase I and 50 in phase II) will be accrued\n      for this study.
