So intermittent suspension of mechanical ventilation under general\n      anesthesia can ensure the surgery to be performed continuously and successfully. But this\n      could result in hypercapnia and hypoxia. So far, there have been few studies focused on the\n       change of the internal environment in blood as result of suspending breath.
