            "textblock": "Tobacco smoke is probably the single most significant source of toxic chemicals that humans\n      are exposed to. Smoking is associated with a variety of pathological conditions such as\n      cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. In addition to the known harmful effects of cigarette\n      smoking, several epidemiological studies identified tobacco use as a risk factor for\n      sarcopenia, the loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength with advancing age. Previous\n      studies examined skeletal muscles of smokers in comparison with muscles of non-smokers and\n      found structural and metabolic damage in muscles of smokers.\n\n      Quitting of smoking is known to be associated with weight gain. A previous study examined\n      the effects of smoking cessation on body composition of post-menopausal women using\n      dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). It was found that women who successfully quit\n      smoking for a period of 16 months have significantly increased their body weight, fat mass,\n      muscle mass and functional muscle mass in comparison with non-quitters women. For the first\n      time, it was shown that smoking cessation is associated with an increase of functional\n      muscle mass. Yet, the effects of quitting of smoking on muscle mass and muscle functional\n      capabilities of younger subjects remain unclear. Therefore, we aim to investigate the\n      effects of smoking cessation on muscle mass, muscle function and strength in heavy smoker's\n      subjects. Our findings may shed light on the beneficial effects of smoking cessation\n      regarding the status and function of skeletal muscle in heavy smokers and as a possible\n      strategy to prevent or delay the progression of sarcopenia.\n\n      Research hypothesis: Smoking cessation among adult heavy smokers will lead to increase in\n      skeletal muscle mass and improvement of muscle function and strength compared with continued\n      smokers."
