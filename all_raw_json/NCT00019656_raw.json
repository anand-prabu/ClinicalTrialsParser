Courses repeat every 28\n      days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating loading and maintenance doses of perifosine until\n      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of each is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose\n      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once\n      the MTD is determined, an additional 10 patients are treated at that dose level.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
