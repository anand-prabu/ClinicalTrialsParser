In the first step the liver parenchyma is transected along the intended line of resection and the future liver remnant cleaned by partial resections from all tumor tissue in the case of bilobar tumors. To this a portal ligation of the larger liver lobe that will have to be removed is added.  After a waiting period of 1-2 weeks the second step is performed in which the deportalized liver is removed to render the patient completely tumor-free. (Ann Surg 2012; 255(3):405-14.)"
