The\n      primary endpoint will be change in forced expiratory volume in one second in response to the\n      diet intervention. Secondary outcomes will include additional spirometry measures, fraction\n      of exhaled nitric oxide, and assessment of symptomatic asthma control. In addition, we will\n      identify potential physiological mechanisms relating diet with lung function, including\n      changes in systemic inflammation, insulin sensitivity, and intestinal microbiome\n      composition."

            "textblock": "Asthma, an inflammatory disease of the airway mucosa, is highly correlated with obesity and\n      nutritional intake in multiple cross-sectional studies. Limited interventional data in\n      adults with asthma, relying on behavioral modification, have reported that asthma control\n      significantly improves with caloric restriction and diets enriched with antioxidants, and\n      may improve with increasing omega-3 fatty acid content.  A comprehensive diet harnessing\n      anti-inflammatory properties of multiple foods may have synergistic effects on bronchial\n      inflammation and pulmonary function, yet this possibility remains largely untested,\n      especially in children.\n\n      We propose a randomized, controlled cross-over trial, with 6-week treatment arms, in\n      pediatric patients with moderate to severe asthma. The experimental diet will focus on\n      reducing glycemic load, and increasing fiber, fruits, vegetables, legumes and food-based\n      omega-3 fatty acid content. The comparison diet will be each participant's habitual diet.\n      Both diets will be isocaloric and weight maintaining, to isolate the effects of the dietary\n      composition from the known beneficial effects of weight loss. In addition, the home delivery\n      of prepared meals will alleviate the variable and incomplete adherence commonly observed in\n      behavioral studies."
