FFRCT is a non-invasive method to evaluate the hemodynamic significance of coronary artery lesions. FFRCT calculates FFR from subject-specific cCTA data using computational fluid dynamics under rest and simulated maximal coronary hyperemic conditions.  FFRCT values range between 0 and 1, and values \u22640.80 are considered hemodynamically (HD)-significant."

Cohort 1 of this\n      study will assess outcomes incorporating standard practice evaluation and Cohort 2 will\n      assess outcomes incorporating FFRCT-guided evaluation. Each Cohort will be further\n      delineated based upon initial presentation, whereas subjects presenting for initial\n      non-invasive testing will be designated as Cohorts 1A and 2A; and subjects already referred\n      for ICA will be designated as Cohorts 1B and 2B.\n\n      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES for sequential cohort comparisons:\n\n        1. To compare the rate of ICA documenting non-obstructive coronary artery disease,\n           clinical outcomes, and QOL following standard practice for diagnostic and treatment\n           planning modalities in Cohort 1 versus incorporating FFRCT as the preferred test to\n           guide further invasive management and medical treatment in Cohort 2;\n\n        2. To compare resource utilization following standard practice for diagnostic and\n           treatment pathways in Cohort 1 versus incorporating FFRCT as the preferred test to\n           guide further invasive management and medical treatment in Cohort 2;\n\n        3. To provide supporting data for generating new guidelines for diagnosis and prognosis of\n           CAD with comparative analysis of the risk stratification with the Updated\n           Diamond-Forrester risk model (UDF);\n\n        4. To provide society including patients, health care providers and other stakeholders\n           with information about which diagnostic technologies are most effective and efficient\n           in managing patients with CAD."
