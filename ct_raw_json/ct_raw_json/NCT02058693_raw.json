The time frame from consent to baseline is 7 days.\n      Patients will receive placebo or MSA  in Phase 1, and in Phase 2, participants will receive\n      MSA.  There will also be a two-week follow up visit after the completion of Phase 2.\n\n      We hypothesize that MSA will be safe and well tolerated, and will improve the patient's\n      response to their antidepressant and provide superior symptom relief to antidepressant\n      alone.  The primary outcome measure is the Massachusetts General Hospital Cognitive-Physical\n      Function Questionnaire (MGH-CPFQ)."
