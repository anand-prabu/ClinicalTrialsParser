Using local\n      anesthesia, Liposuction will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen. The\n      adipose tissue is then transferred to the laboratory for separation of the adipose tissue\n      derived stem cells.  In addition, peripheral blood will be collected for isolation of\n      platelet rich plasma, which are then combined with the ASC's for intra-articular\n      administration of affected joint."
