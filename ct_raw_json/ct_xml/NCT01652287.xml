      The investigators believe a readily available drink containing a high dose of probiotics has
      the potential to improve compliance through many of these mechanisms. This product also has
      the potential to positively impact the health of children and adults around the world, as
      yogurt will likely be more appealing to both children and their parents for long term
      consumption than pharmaceutical-like preparations. In addition to the benefits associated
      with the consumption of probiotics, there is an increased health benefit from consuming
      yogurt, a nutrient dense food.

      More specifically, the rationale for this Phase I study is to determine safety of this
      yogurt drink and comply with FDA recommendations pertaining to an Investigational New Drug
      application. The investigators hypothesize that BB-12 is safe in generally healthy children
      ages 1-5 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in sufficient amounts, may
      improve health. A common use for probiotics is in addressing gastrointestinal issues, such
      as antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). As an alternative to supplements, probiotics are
      also included as ingredients in fermented dairy products to produce functional foods, which
      are foods providing health benefits beyond their nutritional value. Yogurt, for example, is
      a fermented milk product often considered a functional food. One of the most commonly used
      probiotics is Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis (BB-12).

      Our Primary Aim in Years 1-2 is to conduct a pediatric randomized controlled study to
      establish the safety of BB-12 fortified yogurt in children. Our Secondary Aims are to
      examine the fecal microbiota of children prior to, during and following consumption of
      probiotics. This study will evaluate whether a well-defined, probiotic-containing yogurt can
      safely be used as an effective delivery vehicle for probiotics. This study is important to
      help advance probiotic research forward in a systematic, well-accepted manner. Our long-term
      goal is to create yogurt with sufficient probiotic dosages to positively impact many
      different aspects of childhood and adult health.

    <description>The primary outcome is to assess the safety of BB-12 yogurt when consumed by generally healthy children. To achieve this aim, data on adverse events will be collected from diaries; calls to the 24-hour advice line; and research assistant phone calls on days 6, 11, 15 and 180, ±2 days.  All adverse events will be tabulated by type and charted over time.</description>

    <description>The secondary objective is to assess the ability of BB-12 to survive gastric transit. The presence of BB-12 in the stool samples will be examined from the samples collected on days 0, 10, 30, 60 and 90, ±2 days. We will examine the stools by plating on selective agar as well as examining them directly by PCR to detect the presence of BB-12.</description>
