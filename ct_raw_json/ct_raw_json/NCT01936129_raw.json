Cop-1 will be administered in addition to standard therapy as a\n      subcutaneous dose once within 24 hours of presentation, and then one week later (total 2\n      injections). The control group will have placebo in addition to standard regimen. Subjects\n      in the study will have visual field test performed with the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer\n      II, retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness measured with the Stratus optical coherence\n      tomography (OCT) and Optic nerve head evaluated with the Heidelberg retinal tomography\n      (HRT). At least 2 baseline visual field tests will also be performed in the first week.\n      Subsequent visits will be at week 4, 8, 12 and 16. The outcome criteria will be difference\n      in visual field, RNFL thickness, and optic nerve head structural changes."
