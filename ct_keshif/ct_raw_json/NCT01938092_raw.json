Participants will randomly be assigned by a computer-derived random number\n      sequence (after pregnancy is ruled out) to either the treatment group (intravaginal\n      diazepam) or the placebo group Investigators and patients will be blinded to group\n      assignment. The placebo or diazepam tablet will be distributed to the participant in the\n      examining room on the day of allocation. The participant will be instructed to insert the\n      diazepam or placebo tablet into her vagina at home. The treatment group will insert the\n      diazepam 10 mg vaginal tablet 1-2 times daily as needed in addition to the standard\n      conservative therapy. The placebo group will receive the standard conservative therapy, and\n      an intravaginal tablet (visually indistinguishable from diazepam) commercially produced by\n      the university pharmacy.  After 4 weeks, patients from either group will have the option of\n      enrolling into a standard routine program (not research) of comprehensive pelvic floor\n      rehabilitation therapy. The Visual Analog Pain Scale, Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-20\n      Questionnaire, McGill Pain Questionnaire and Global Response Assessment will be completed by\n      the participant at the initial visit, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks. Participants will be\n      given the option of choosing one or more methods for returning questionnaires: electronic\n      mail, self-addressed home envelope, or telephone call."
