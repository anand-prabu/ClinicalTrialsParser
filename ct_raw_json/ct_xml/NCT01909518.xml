      The aim of the present studyï¼š

        1. To investigate the diagnosing value of pCLE for early esophageal squamous neoplasia.

        2. To assess the detection rate of early esophageal squamous neoplasia by virtual
           chromoendoscopy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE; Cellvizio, Mauna Kea Technologies, Paris,
      France) is a newly developed endoscopic device and has shown its value for diagnosing
      Barrett's esophagus, colonal polyps and etc. However, none research has focus on early
      esophageal squamous neoplasia until now. Previous diagnosis of early esophageal neoplasia is
      based on the lugol staining which is time wasting and have many adverse events.Other
      researches have suggested virtual chromoendoscopys are beneficial for screening esophageal
      tumors. Therefore, the aim of the present study is 1.To investigate the diagnosing value of
      pCLE for early esophageal squamous neoplasia according to the surface maturation
      scoring(SMS) diagnostic criteria and 2. To assess the detection rate of early esophageal
      squamous neoplasia by virtual chromoendoscopy(I-SCAN).
