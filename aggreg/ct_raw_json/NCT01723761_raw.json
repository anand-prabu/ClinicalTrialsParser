A total of 500 subjects from 15 cardiology\n      centers of the Veneto region will be included."

The arrhythmic events that will occur in this period, detected\n      by means of remote monitoring or through other clinical evaluations will be recorded. Atrial\n      arrythmias: atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, supraventricular tachycardia.\n\n      Ventricular arrhythmias: ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular\n      extrasystoles.\n\n      Physiological variables: average heart rate (24 hours and at rest), heart rate variability,\n      the percentage of paced beats.\n\n      In addition, any changes in drug therapies and all clinically relevant events, will be\n      recorded.\n\n      During the same period data from monitoring stations of ARPAV (Regional Agency for\n      Environmental Prevention and Protection of Veneto Region) will be collected.\n\n      Climatic variables: temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure. Parameters of air\n      pollution: PM10, PM2.5, O3, CO, SO2, NO2. For each patient, the data from the monitoring\n      station ARPAV of the urban area of \u200b\u200bresidence of the subject will be considered. The mean\n      exposure level used in the analytical studies on the health effects is calculated on the\n      average number of units active in the area. This number is usually of 2-3 units in large\n      centers, while it is generally only 1 in small towns. The residents in centers without\n      monitoring will be excluded from the study. The mean value is the best approximation  ... to\n      be continued page 6."
