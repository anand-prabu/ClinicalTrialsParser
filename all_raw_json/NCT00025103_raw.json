Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplant may\n      allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well chemotherapy followed by surgery and\n      radiation therapy with or without stem cell transplant work in treating patients with\n      relapsed or refractory Wilms' tumor or clear cell sarcoma of the kidney."

Treatment repeats every 42 days\n           for a total of 4 courses. Patients undergo surgical resection and radiotherapy after 2\n           courses of chemotherapy. Patients not achieving complete response after 4 courses of\n           chemotherapy undergo autologous bone marrow transplantation as in regimen C.\n\n        -  Regimen C (all other patients in first relapses OR with progression on first-line\n           therapy OR in second or subsequent relapse previously treated on regimens A and B):\n           Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1, etoposide IV over 2 hours on days\n           1-3 and 22-24, and cyclophosphamide IV twice daily on days 22 and 23. Treatment repeats\n           every 42 days for a total of 3 courses. Patients may undergo surgical resection prior\n           to stem cell rescue. Beginning within 6 weeks after completion of chemotherapy,\n           patients receive melphalan IV on day -1. Autologous peripheral blood stem cells or bone\n           marrow is reinfused on day 0. Patients undergo radiotherapy after transplantation.\n\n      Patients are followed every 8 weeks for 1 year, every 12 weeks for 1 year, and then every 6\n      months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 75 patients (25 for regimens A and B and 50 for regimen C)\n      will be accrued for this study."
