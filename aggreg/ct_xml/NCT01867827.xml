  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to train patients with Parkinson's Disease to increase activity in a
      brain area that is involved in the control of motor functions with the use of a technique
      called real-time fMRI neurofeedback (NF) along with regular physical exercise. This will be
      a randomised and controlled clinical trial to evaluate the benefits of a novel treatment.
      The investigators expect NF training along with physical exercise practise to better improve
      motor functions compared to physical exercise alone.
