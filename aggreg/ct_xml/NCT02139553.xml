  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether rhythmic upper-limb movement training in
      post-stroke patients allows to improve only this particular type of movements or if it also
      improves some parameters of discrete movements.  Based on our results we hope to be able to
      answer a fundamental question: are rhythmic and discrete movements two independent
      primitives?

    <description>Patients undergo a first evaluation, and a second evaluation one month later to determine their natural evolution.  The following month, patients get 12 sessions of rhythmic therapy.  A third evaluation is organized straight after this month and a fourth evaluation, 3 months after to assess the after-effects of the therapy.</description>
