  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One hundred eighty critically ill African adult intensive care patients divided into two
      groups, eighty septic critically ill patients (sepsis group) while, eighty non-septic
      critically ill patients (SIRS) group. Admission serum IL-8 was measured in both sepsis and
      SIRS groups.  IL-8 (-251A/T)  polymorphism was detected in sepsis and SIRS groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of one hundred eighty African patients (97men and 83 women) were included in the
      study. Eighty patients developed septic complication during ICU stay (sepsis group).  Eighty
      patients were critically ill without evidence of infectious organism (SIRS group). Patients
      received anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids before admission, who had
      immunosuppressive illness, who had chronic organ failure; who had received massive blood
      transfusion; those with radiation therapy, previous organ transplantation were excluded from
      the study. At admission, the patient's age, sex, height and weight were recorded. These data
      include the following: clinical status; sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score;
      temperature; heart rate; respiratory rate; blood pressure; central venous pressure;
      laboratory analysis (complete blood count, blood urea nitrogen, blood sugar, serum sodium,
      potassium, calcium, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, prothrombin time,
      albumin and CRP) and arterial blood gas analysis. Routine cultures of blood, urine and
      suspected sites were obtained to determine the presence of infection. We attempted to
      maintain the patient hemoglobin level at 10-12g/dl and central venous pressure at 8-12
      cmH2o. If needed, blood products, intravascular fluid replacement and inotropic and/or
      vasopressor agents were administered. Each day the attending physician in the ICU evaluated
      all the study patients for sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock.

    <description>Serum level of IL-8 was determined by quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay (R&amp;D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The intensity of the colour was measured at 490 nm for IL-8.</description>

    <description>About 4ml blood is withdrawn in EDTA-tubes and the genomic DNA was extracted. Concentration of the extracted DNA was then measured by UV spectrophotometry at 260&amp; 280 nm and run on agaros gel electrophoresis 2% for detection of purity. Molecular detection of the (-251 A/T) polymorphism in the IL-8gene was achieved by restriction fragment length polymorphism typing.</description>
