  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to determine the optimal dose of remifentanil that can prevent the
      complications associated with the removal of LMA without delaying emergence.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups. All patients received a predetermined
      effect-site concentrations (Ce) of remifentanil by target-controlled infusion (TCI)
      according to their group assignments (R0, remifentanil Ce of 0 ng/ml; R0.5, remifentanil Ce
      of 0.5 ng/ml; R1.0, remifentanil Ce of 1.0 ng/ml; R1.5, remifentanil Ce of 1.5 ng/ml) from
      10 minutes before the end of surgery to LMA removal. Airway complications (airway
      obstruction, desaturation, breath holding, and coughing), nausea, and vomiting were assessed
      during the emergence phase.
