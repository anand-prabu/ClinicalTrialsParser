Ovarian volume had been measured by ultrasound at baseline to determine the total thermal dose to apply on the right ovary. The number of punctures (Np) was also calculated for each patient according to the following formula:\nNp = 627 J / 30 W / 4 s Therefore, patients in the ULOD group differed in the number of punctures and energy received by the right ovary, depending on its volume."

PCOS was diagnosed following the Rotterdam consensus\n      criteria. In the ULOD group, we treated the right ovary with thermal dose of 60 J applied\n      per one cubic centimeter of ovarian. In the comparator, BLOD group, all patients received\n      600 J per ovary. The follow-up period encompassed six menstrual cycles for all\n      subjects.Sample size was based on the test of the primary hypothesis that ULOD treatment\n      would result in a higher ovulation rate than BLOD. In our pilot study in 61 patients,\n      ovulation rates were estimated to 44% in the BLOD arm and 69% in the ULOD arm. Assuming 5%\n      significance and 80% power, we calculated that the minimal sample size for a one-sided test\n      had to be 96 patients.\n\n      The aims of our prospective study:\n\n        1. Compare the efficiency of the right ULOD using thermal doses adjusted to ovarian volume\n           (60 J/cm3) with the BLOD method at constant dose and to assess treatment efficiency and\n           predict ovulatory response based on clinical parameters (right or left ovary and its\n           volume) and received thermal doses.\n\n        2. Evidence the effects of ULOD using thermal doses adjusted to ovarian volume on\n           endocrine (changes in androgen and AMH) and reproductive outcomes (ovulation rate) in\n           clomiphene-resistant women with PCOS.\n\n        3. To determine whether unilateral laparoscopic ovarian drilling (ULOD) using thermal\n           doses adjusted to ovarian volume diminishes ovarian reserve less than bilateral LOD\n           (BLOD) using a fixed thermal dose"
