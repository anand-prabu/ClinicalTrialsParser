Eribulin and carboplatin are\n      both chemotherapy drugs. They work by killing cancer cells. A person is made up of cells\n      which control every function in the body. Some cells stop working like they should and\n      become cancer cells. These cancer cells grow and multiply rapidly and can cause destruction\n      to normal body organs. Eribulin and carboplatin have both been approved by United States\n      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the treatment of breast cancer. The\n      combination of these two drugs and the safest dose of eribulin to use is experimental."
