Part of the many hours waited are for various tests the patient has to undergo, where\n      the urine test is one of the main ones.\n\n      Urinary tract infections in children are a common cause of death due to acute and chronic\n      complications alike. Our study aims to test a urine collection method to see whether it\n      reduces parents' and/or nursing staff's involvement  and thereby reducing the urine sample's\n      percentage of contamination."

The innovativeness introduced is that by using an ordinary everyday diaper, which\n      is found in all marketing outlets, and by making a slit in the diaper where the pediatric\n      urine collecting bag can be pulled out and thus allowing parents/care takers to see straight\n      away whether urine has been given and thus cut back on opening and reopening of the diaper."
