  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study designed to validate our methods of recruitment, screening and data
      collection in the community.  The project will help to establish the feasibility of the
      study design to lay the groundwork for a potentially larger study.  The final study will
      allow us to estimate the incidence and prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA),
      carotid artery stenosis, and peripheral artery disease (PAD) in different geographic areas
      in a large urban setting, as well as determine patient access to healthcare and treatment
      for vascular disease as related to geographic and racial differences.
