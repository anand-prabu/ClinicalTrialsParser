      The purpose of this study is to investigate the benefits of incorporating an actuated,
      EMG-controlled glove into occupational therapy of the hand.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke survivors with chronic hemiparesis of the upper extremity undertook 18 one-hour
      training sessions over a 6-week period. Participants received occupational therapy focusing
      on grasp-and-release using a task-oriented protocol developed at the Rehabilitation
      Institute of Chicago by Dr. Mary Ellen Stoykov. Over 90% of  all repetitions performed
      during each session were focused on functional activities, as opposed to active exercise.
      The skills and strategies developed in therapy were then implemented into activities
      identified as goals by the participant, such as donning socks. Difficulty of the task,
      activity, or exercise was progressed for each participant to provide optimal challenge to
      enhance skill.

      Subjects were assigned to one of two groups by casting lots. One group (J-Glove) performed
      all tasks while wearing a custom motor-driven glove, the J-Glove. The other group (No-Glove)
      performed the same types of tasks without use of the J-Glove. The J-Glove is a portable
      active-assistance device, designed to assist digit extension in order to allow repeated
      practice of specified tasks.  The glove contains cables traversing the dorsal side of the
      digits in order to provide extension and resist flexion.  Forces are transmitted through the
      cables from a servomotor located remotely to the digits.  The servomotor controls torque or
      displacement in the cable. Along the digits, the cables traverse through custom plastic
      blocks, which serve both to guide the cable and to prevent joint hyperextension.

      The J-Glove can be controlled with up to 3 channels of electromyography (EMG).  For this
      study, electrodes were placed above flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and extensor
      digitorum communis (EDC).  The group using the J-Glove could receive assistance during hand
      opening, but only if appropriate EMG activity was detected.  The EDC EMG activity had to
      reach a prescribed threshold before extension assistance would be provided.  Similarly, FDS
      EMG activity had to surpass a threshold level during hand closing before the user was
      allowed to flex the digits.  Feedback of muscle activity was available to the user through a
      custom graphical user interface.

    <description>hand kinematics were measured explicitly with a CyberGlove (CyberGlove Systems LLC, San Jose, CA).  From an initially relaxed, resting posture, participants were asked to extend the digits fully (&quot;open&quot;) and then flex fully (&quot;close&quot;) their affected hand into a fist. The CyberGlove measured joint displacement for each digit during task performance.</description>
