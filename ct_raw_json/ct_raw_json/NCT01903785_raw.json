Due to a large variety in the genes that affect how individuals\n      respond to \u03b22-agonists, the investigators will look at variations in the genetic response to\n      these medications by dividing athletes into high-responders and low-responders. The\n      investigators will then compare athletic performance after the inhalation of \u03b22-agonists to\n      placebo. Furthermore, the investigators will analyze the effect of \u03b22-agonists on breathing\n      mechanics. Due to differences in their anatomy females may decrease the energy needed for\n      breathing during high-intensity exercise to a greater extent compared to male athletes after\n      the inhalation of \u03b22-agonists."
