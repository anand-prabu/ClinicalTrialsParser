Artery stiffness has been associated with an increased\n      risk of cardiovascular (heart) disease, and could be useful as an earlier indicator of heart\n      disease. In this study, the stiffness of arteries will be measured at study entry, months 4,\n      8, 12, and annually thereafter, using a tonometer on the participant's forearm."
