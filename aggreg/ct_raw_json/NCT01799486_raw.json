            "textblock": "Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a serious clinical problem because of its\n      worldwide distribution and potential adverse outcome, including cirrhosis, which is a major\n      cause of HBV related death. Studies show the use of nucleot(s)ide analogs treatment can\n      alleviate, even reverse the progress of HBV-related cirrhosis. In cirrhosis stage, some\n      potential factors, including endocrine disorder, renin, aldosterone, vasopressin increasing,\n      hepatitis B virus related nephritis, hepatorenal syndrome, may cause renal damage. With the\n      exposure of NAs, adverse reports of rhabdomyolysis, renal dysfunction, and lactic acidosis\n      are increasing. So when choosing NAs, the potential renal function impairment should be\n      considered.\n\n      Recently, Gane, Xiaoxi Li have separately reported that Telbivudine can improve estimate of\n      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of patients with chronic hepatitis B, while eGFR of\n      patients with Lamivudine, adefovir and entecavir have a trend of decrease, which suggested\n      Telbivudine may have renal protective effects. This effect on patients with HBV-related\n      liver cirrhosis has not been studied, which is not clear now.\n\n      This study is a randomized controlled study to prospectively observe Telbivudine's effect on\n      renal function, which aims to provide evidence in antiviral treatment for the patients with\n      cirrhosis."
