    <textblock>
      In this phase I trial, patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma will receive
      standard high dose melphalan with autologous stem cell rescue. In addition the
      pre-transplant conditioning will include targeted total marrow irradiation (TMI). This
      conventional 3+3 phase I trial will increase the dose of TMI until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is reached. Initial patients enrolled will receive the lowest possible dose of
      3Gy. Maximum dose will be 9Gy.
