Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill\n      them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining\n      monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of fludarabine given with or\n      without monoclonal antibody therapy followed by monoclonal antibody therapy alone in\n      treating patients who have untreated B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia."

Determine the response rate and toxicity profile of concurrent and\n      consolidative chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody IDEC-C2B8 (rituximab) therapy compared\n      to consolidative rituximab therapy in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated\n      with fludarabine. II. Assess the complete response (CR) rate in patients receiving\n      concurrent therapy with rituximab and fludarabine. III. Assess the frequency of conversion\n      of a partial response (PR) to a CR or stable disease to either PR or CR in patients\n      receiving consolidative therapy with rituximab. IV. Follow the effects of rituximab and\n      fludarabine on the immunologic markers CD4, CD8, IgG, IgA, and IgM. V. Assess the\n      progression-free and overall survival of these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to stage (I and II vs\n      III and IV). Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I consists of fludarabine\n      and chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody IDEC-C2B8 (rituximab) induction, and arm II\n      consists of fludarabine induction. Arm I: Rituximab is administered IV over 4 hours on day\n      1, on day 3, and over 1 hour on day 5 of week 1. Subsequent doses are given over 1 hour on\n      day 1 every 4 weeks for a total of 6 courses. Fludarabine IV is administered over 10-30\n      minutes daily for 5 days during weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, and 21 for a total of 6 courses.\n      Following the sixth course of fludarabine, patients undergo clinical staging and are then\n      observed for an additional 2 months, after which they undergo repeat clinical staging,\n      including bone marrow aspiration. Patients achieving a complete or partial response or\n      stable disease then proceed to consolidation therapy consisting of weekly intravenous\n      infusions of rituximab once weekly for 4 weeks. Arm II (Fludarabine Induction): Patients\n      receive fludarabine IV over 10-30 minutes daily for 5 days during weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, and\n      21 for a total of 6 courses. Patients then proceed as in arm I. Patients are followed every\n      3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 12\n      months."
