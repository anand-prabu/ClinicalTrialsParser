Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining more than one drug and combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may\n      kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining oxaliplatin and fluorouracil\n      plus radiation therapy in treating patients who have primary esophageal or stomach cancer."

Patients also undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for\n      6 weeks beginning on day 8.\n\n      Patients without evidence of distant disease or unresectable local regional invasion undergo\n      esophageal resection between days 63-70 (within 3-4 weeks after completion of\n      chemoradiotherapy). Patients then receive oxaliplatin as above on days 105, 119, and 133 and\n      fluorouracil as above on days 105-147.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin and fluorouracil until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at\n      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 4 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 56 patients will be accrued for this study within\n      approximately 3 years."
