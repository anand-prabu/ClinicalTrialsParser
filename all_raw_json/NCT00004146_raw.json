Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of carboxyamidotriazole plus radiation\n      therapy in treating patients who have newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma\n      multiforme."

Determine overall survival rate and duration of disease free progression in\n      patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme treated with\n      carboxyamidotriazole and radiotherapy. II. Evaluate the toxicities of this combination\n      regimen in this patient population. III. Determine the correlations between pharmacokinetic\n      parameters and toxicity and/or drug activity of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive induction therapy consisting of\n      radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week plus oral carboxyamidotriazole once daily for 6 weeks\n      followed by carboxyamidotriazole alone daily for 4 weeks. Patients continue on oral\n      carboxyamidotriazole once daily as maintenance therapy in the absence of disease progression\n      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed monthly for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 54 patients will be accrued for this study over 1.5 years."
