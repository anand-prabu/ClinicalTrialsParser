Pazopanib may stop the growth of cancer by blocking\n      blood flow to the tumor. Pazopanib may also block some of the enzymes needed for cell\n      growth. Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the ability of some tumor cells to\n      grow and spread. Giving pazopanib with cetuximab may provide a more effective treatment for\n      patients with advanced head and neck cancer."

Patient must have a negative\n             serum pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry.\n\n          -  Patient must not be known to be HIV-positive on combination antiretroviral because of\n             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with pazopanib.  In addition, these\n             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with\n             marrow-suppressive therapy.  Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients\n             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated."
