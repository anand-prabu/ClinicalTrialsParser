  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether in Assisted Reproductive Technologies the
      treatment with G-CSF, a growth factor working on stem cells, may improve the pregnancy rate
      and pregnancy outcome in patients experiencing recurrent implantation failure in IVF cycles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We previously showed that G-CSF may be useful in the treatment of recurrent abortion. The
      G-CSF is a cytokine promoting leukocyte growth, but also trophoblast development. In this
      randomized sudy investigators will test this cytokine as a treatment for recurrent
      implantation failure after IVF, at leat three failed previous IVF attempts.

      The study will be conducted in 100 women with recurrent implantation failure  The inclusion
      criteria will be, at least three previous failed IVF attempts where at least 8 good embryos
      were transferred, women less than 40 years old, absence of systemic diseases. These women
      will undergo IVF cycle and they will randomly divided in two groups: one (50 women) will be
      treated with subcutaneous G-CSF 60 micrograms/day from the day of transfer to the day of
      β-hCG test, and if it will be positive the treatment will be continued for other 40 days;
      the group of control will be treated with subcutaneous saline solution infusion in the same
      way of the study group. Primary outcomes will be considered: pregnancy rate and the of β-hCG
      levels at 14/21/28 and 35 days after embryo transfer.
