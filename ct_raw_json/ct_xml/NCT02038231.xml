    <textblock>
      The goal of study is to develop and test a parenting-focused version of mindfulness
      intervention (&quot;Parenting Mindfully&quot;) to reduce parent stress and prevent adolescent
      substance use and HIV risk behaviors (e.g., risky sex). The investigators hypothesize that
      Parenting Mindfully (PM) will decrease prevent adolescent substance use and HIV risk
      behaviors and intentions. Secondarily, PM will improve parenting, and decrease adolescent
      stress responses.
