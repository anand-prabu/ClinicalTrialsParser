Drugs used in chemotherapy\n      use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining\n      monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy plus\n      etoposide in treating patients who have neuroblastoma."

Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for 4\n      courses in the absence of disease progression, human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response, or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      If HAMA fails to develop after completion of 4 courses of MOAB 3F8, patients continue\n      treatment with MOAB 3F8 on days 1-5 every 8 weeks until HAMA reaches greater than 1,000 U/mL\n      or until month 24, whichever occurs first.\n\n      Beginning after completion of 4 courses of etoposide and MOAB 3F8 or if HAMA develops,\n      patients receive oral isotretinoin twice daily for 14 days followed by at least a 14-day\n      rest. Treatment repeats for a total of 6 courses.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients (25 per stratum) will be accrued for this study\n      within 5 years."
