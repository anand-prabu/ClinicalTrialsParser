  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter, phase 1b study will evaluate the safety and pharma cokinetics
      of DNIB0600A in patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. The maximum tolerated dose
      of intravenously infused DNIB0600A in combination with ca rboplatin will be determined in
      escalating dose cohorts. The combination of DNIB 0600A and carboplatin will then be
      evaluated with and without bevacizumab [Avast in] in two dose expansion cohorts.
