  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed project is to enhance the Principal Investigator's research ability
      to conduct behavioral interventions for people with lupus.  This includes intervention
      design, implementation, data collection and data analysis. The Intervention to Improve
      Quality of life for African-AmericaN lupus patients (IQAN) Project is designed to examine
      whether a uniquely tailored intervention program can improve quality of life, decrease
      indicators of depression, and reduce perceived and biological indicators of stress in
      African American lupus patients.  This study builds on three decades of work conducted in
      the field of arthritis self-management but differs in that the intervention mode, the
      disease (lupus), and the study population (African-Americans) are unstudied or understudied.
      The IQAN Project will use the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and
      Maintenance (RE-AIM) model as its theoretical framework.  This program has three specific
      aims.  The first aim seeks to design a three armed randomized, wait list controlled trial
      that employs a patient-centered 'a-la-carte' approach that offers subjects a variety of
      modes of interaction, allowing them to choose as many or few as they wish. The second aim is
      to assess the intervention, using the RE-AIM model framework.  The third aim, to be achieved
      before the first aim, is to use previously collected data to characterize patient-centric
      barriers to care in African-American lupus patients, in order to identify trends in patient
      needs and desires, as well as correlates of non-response and non-compliance that can be used
      in the development and refinement of the intervention.

    <intervention_name>Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP)</intervention_name>
    <description>The Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) is a 2.5 hour workshop given weekly for six weeks.  People with different chronic health problems attend together and support one another in making positive changes in their health.  Workshops are facilitated by two trained leaders, one or both of whom are non-health professionals with a chronic disease themselves. It is the process in which the program is taught that makes it effective.  Classes are highly participative, and mutual support builds the participants' confidence in their ability to manage their health and maintain active and fulfilling lives.</description>

    <description>The Arthritis Self-Management Tool Kit contains 1) a &quot;Self Test&quot; to help participants determine how arthritis affects their lives and self-tailor the use of the Tool Kit, including items related to pain, fatigue, physical limitations, and health worries; participants score this test themselves and are directed to specific parts of the Tool Kit based on their scores; 2) information sheets: Working with Your Doctor and the Health Care System; Exercise; Medications; Healthy Eating; Fatigue and Pain Management; Finding Community Resources; and Dealing with One's Emotions; 3) information sheets on key process components of the ASMP: Action Planning, Problem Solving, Deciding What to Try, and Individualizing an Exercise Program; 4) The Arthritis Helpbook; 5) audio relaxation and exercise compact discs (CDs); and 6) an audio CD of all material printed on the information sheets.</description>

    <description>Interested participants will be referred to the &quot;Lupus: Listening and Learning Group&quot;, a Charleston-based support group affiliated with the Lupus Foundation of America (LFA). One to two LFA-trained facilitators implement the group. The meeting format generally includes a specific discussion topic or an informative presentation such as by a medical or counseling professional, pharmacist, or lupus researcher. This program is followed by time within the group for further interaction and support among the attendees who wish to participate. The Lupus: Listening and Learning Group is open to all lupus patients, family members, friends and supporters, and there is no pre-registration or fee involved.</description>

    <description>A project listserv will be established to link all intervention participants to facilitate exchange of coping strategies, pose questions, and share preferred educational resources or any other information relative to their everyday and disease-specific experiences and/or participation in the project.  Participants will be provided with a URL, from which they will be able to subscribe to the listserv.  Once subscribed, they will be able to post and receive messages, managed by a listserv moderator, who will be responsible for distribution to listserv members as appropriate. Participants will have the option to unsubscribe at any time.</description>
