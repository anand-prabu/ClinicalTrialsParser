            "textblock": "In Denmark, there are approximately 4400 elective benign hysterectomies annually. In about\n      10% of these there will occur a per- or postoperative bleeding complications with increased\n      hospital stay, reoperations and prolonged sick leave as a result. The pharmaceutical product\n      'Tranexamic acid' has proved to be effective in reducing blood loss in other forms of\n      surgery, in trauma patients, and in relation to certain medical conditions. The hypothesis\n      of the proposed study is that Tranexamic acid could also reduce the operative bleeding\n      associated with hysterectomy on benign indications. Based on the literature and previous\n      studies, the objective of the trial is an average bleeding reduction of 25%.\n\n      The clinical trial will be conducted as a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind\n      multicenter trial in gynecological departments several places in Denmark: Nordsj\u00e6llands\n      Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Odense University Hospital and Aarhus University Hospital -\n      Skejby. The subjects will be recruited in outpatient clinics of the gynecological\n      departments. During the study there will be an ongoing monitoring by external partner. The\n      experiment is approved by all relevant bodies. The total period of time in which the trial\n      is planned to last is one year commencing 01.02.3013 and ending 28.02.2014. All together the\n      trial will include 314 participants determined by presumed bleeding reduction, the average\n      bleeding on hysterectomy and type 1 error of 0.05 and type 2 error of 0.20. Randomization\n      will be conducted electronically and both clinician, patient and data collector we will be\n      blinded. Data for the study will partly be collected through registrations to the already\n      well established and well functioning Danish Hysterectomy and Hysteroscopy Database. Data\n      used in relation to the study will be validated by examining the manual records in\n      conjunction with data extraction. The results will be analyzed by univariate and\n      multivariate analyzes and static regression analyzes. All final results from the study will\n      be sought published in recognized international journals.\n\n      Regarding ethical aspects it is noted that the study is carried out with the highest\n      standard of design, and with a proven drug without unexpected side effects or disadvantages.\n      In the literature, there seems no evidence to suspect an increased risk of blood clot\n      formation using the drug. However, it seems clear that the incidence of complications\n      associated with hysterectomy is quite high. It is therefore ethically fully responsible and\n      appropriate to carry out the planned study with the desire to ensure the quality and improve\n      hysterectomy, surgery.\n\n      The project is supported by funds and receives no commercial support."
