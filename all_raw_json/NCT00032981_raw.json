Primary outcome measures\n      will include (1) treatment retention (e.g., number of sessions/weeks completed, the rate of\n      patients completing 3 or more subsequent sessions, and (2) substance use (e.g., urinalyses,\n      days of opioid, cocaine, marijuana, alcohol use, rates of abstinence). Secondary outcomes\n      will include motivation, psychosocial functioning, HIV risk behaviors, treatment\n      utilization, and patient satisfaction. Process assessments will include measures of the\n      working alliance as well as therapist adherence/competence ratings which will evaluate how\n      effectively MET/MI was implemented.  Participating CTPs will implement one of two\n      independent protocols, depending on which is the best suited or feasible for the intake\n      procedures at their clinic. Thus, following an invitation to participate, explanation of the\n      study, and provision of informed consent, patients would complete a brief assessment battery\n      followed by either: 1) Random assignment to 3 individual sessions of standard treatment\n      (treatment as usual) at the program versus 3 individual sessions of MET. or 2) Random\n      assignment to 1 individual standard assessment/evaluation session."
