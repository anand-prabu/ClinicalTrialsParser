    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the influence of hepatic insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics
      (PK) of MK-1439. In Part 1, PK of MK-1439 in participants with moderate hepatic
      insufficiency will be compared with that of healthy control subjects matched with regard to
      mean age and weight. If a clinically meaningful increase in MK-1439 exposure is observed in
      participants with moderate hepatic insufficiency in Part 1, study Part 2 will evaluate PK of
      MK-1439 in participants with mild hepatic insufficiency.
