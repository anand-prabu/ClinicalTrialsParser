The effects of yoga on the fetus have not been\n      demonstrated. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the acute fetal response to yoga\n      exercises by assessing fetal well-being via ultrasound and non-stress testing among healthy\n      women. The investigators hypothesize that yoga during pregnancy does not have any acute\n      negative effects on fetal behavior as assessed by umbilical artery Dopplers and fetal heart\n      rate or maternal vital signs."
