To translate and adapt a stroke symptom questionnaire for identification of stroke\n           symptoms by community workers in a peri-urban Pakistani community\n\n        2. To validate community workers administered stroke symptom questionnaire against\n           assessment by neurologist in a peri-urban Pakistani community\n\n        3. To determine the feasibility of utilizing community workers for identification of\n           stroke patients in the community in terms of subject refusals and difficulty in\n           understanding questions\n\n      The study will be conducted at the community site of AMAN community health project in\n      Ibrahim Hyderi. Community health workers will systematically select households and from them\n      individuals meeting eligibility criteria will be interviewed. Community workers will\n      administer stroke symptom questionnaire to them at their homes. Those unable to answer will\n      have a surrogate answering for them. In the second part of the study, two neurologists will\n      independently assess all individuals. The purpose of this would be to validate the findings\n      of the community workers based on the stroke symptom questionnaire."
