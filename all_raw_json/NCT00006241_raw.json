Treating the peripheral stem cells in\n      the laboratory to remove any existing cancer cells may improve the effectiveness of the\n      transplant.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of treated peripheral stem\n      cells with that of untreated stem cells in patients who have relapsed low- or\n      intermediate-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."

Determine the effectiveness of the B-cell high density microparticles\n      (BCell-HDM) device in purging B-cells from peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) harvested from\n      patients with relapsed low or intermediate grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II.\n      Determine the recovery of T-cells and CD34+ cells in BCell-HDM processed PBSC in these\n      patients. III. Compare hematopoietic engraftment following infusion of autologous PBSC\n      purged using the BCell-HDM device versus unpurged autologous PBSC in these patients\n      receiving high dose chemotherapy. IV. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these\n      patients. V. Determine the occurrence of adverse effects from this regimen in these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by\n      grade of lymphoma (low vs intermediate), type of myeloablative conditioning regimen\n      (chemotherapy only vs chemotherapy/total body irradiation), and center. Patients are\n      randomized to one of two treatment arms. Patients undergo peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC)\n      harvest over no more than 4 consecutive days. A myeloablative conditioning regimen of either\n      chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy/total body irradiation is given within 4 weeks of PBSC\n      harvest. Prior to randomization one patient at each center receives PBSC transplantation\n      using cells purged with the B-cell high density microparticle (BCell-HDM) device. Arm I:\n      Patients receive BCell-HDM treated PBSC transplantation on day 0. Arm II: Patients receive\n      untreated PBSC transplantation on day 0. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously\n      beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients are followed on days\n      30 and 100, and then at 6 and 12 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 115 patients (15 for prerandomization study, 50 for each\n      treatment arm) will be accrued for this study."
