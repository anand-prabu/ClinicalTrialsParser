The investigators sought to investigate the possible role of adding low dose\n      HCG in the follicular phase, on the endometrial growth and development. The investigators\n      constructed this hypothesis based on the fact that LH/HCG (luteinizing hormone/human\n      chorionic gonadotropin) receptor is present in endometrium and therefore a positive\n      interaction could be anticipated when HCG is administered in the proliferative phase of\n      endometrial growth. Furthermore, in a previous study, where human menopausal gonadotropin\n      (hMG) -well known that renders its luteinizing hormone (LH) capacity due to low dose HCG\n      contain- was compared to recombinant-follicular stimulating hormone (rec-FSH) during ovarian\n      stimulation, endometrium was more likely to be iso-echogenic and hypo-echogenic in the hMG\n      group, also anticipating a possible positive role of HCG activity."
