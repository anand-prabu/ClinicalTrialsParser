The entire cohort of 3403 firefighters is now followed\n      for mortality up to 1996.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      The entire cohort of 3,403 firefighers is followed up to 1996 in this longitudinal study.\n      The investigators are using a variety of tracing sources, including the National Death\n      Index, and obtaining death certificates to determine date and cause of death. Cohort data\n      will be analyzed to address the following aims: (1) To provide a longitudinal description of\n      and determine the interrelationships among physical fitness, physical activity, and other\n      measured risk factors; (2) to determine whether levels of physical fitness are related,\n      independently of other known and measured risk factors, CHD and all-cause mortality; (3) To\n      determine whether there is a gradient of decreasing CHD risk with increasing levels of\n      physical fitness, or whether there appears to be some threshold of physical fitness, above\n      which CHD risk stabilizes; (4) To determine whether the relationship between physical\n      fitness and CHD and all-cause mortality varies by such cardiovascular risk factors as age,\n      cholesterol levels, blood pressure, smoking, and obesity."
