Participants: A total of 180 adult outpatients\n      (60 with EoE and 120 without EoE) who are referred for upper endoscopy. Procedures: This is\n      a prospective cohort study.\n\n      Patients will be compared with newly diagnosed EoE to non-EoE controls, obtain baseline\n      measures, reassess EoE patients after treatment, and also reassess untreated controls. Data\n      collection will include questionnaire results, blood collection, and tissue collection\n      (esophageal biopsies performed during upper endoscopy per pre-specified protocol). Blood\n      will be analyzed for the presence of the candidate biomarkers."
