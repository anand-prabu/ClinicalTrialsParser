  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label repeat dose, multicenter, 2-part study to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for GSK525762 given once-daily
      orally. Part 1 of the study is a dose escalation phase to select the recommended Part 2 dose
      (RP2D) based on the safety, PK, and PD profiles observed after oral administration of
      GSK525762. Eligible subjects with relapsed refractory hematological malignancies will be
      enrolled in the dosing cohorts until a MTD is established. Subjects may continue treatment
      in the study until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or
      commercial supply of GSK525762 becomes available to the subject. An expansion cohort (Part
      2) is planned in subjects with acute leukemias to further explore clinical activity at the
      MTD. This is the first study of this agent to be conducted in subjects with these relapsed
      and/or refractory hematological malignancies for which no standard therapies are anticipated
      to result in a durable remission.

          -  Males and females 18 years old or older.

          -  In Part 1, subjects must have relapsed and/or refractory hematologic malignancies
             (leukemias, myeloproliferative neoplasms, lymphomas, and myelomas) for which no
             standard therapies are available or anticipated to result in remission. In Part 2,
             subjects must have a diagnosis of relapsed and/or refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
             (AML). AML subjects &gt;=65 years of age who are not candidates for or have refused
             standard chemotherapy.

          -  Subjects who have previously received an autologous stem cell transplant are allowed
             if a minimum of 3 months has elapsed from the time of transplant (T0) and the subject
             has recovered from transplant-associated toxicities prior to the first dose of
             GSK525762.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of &lt;=1.

          -  Subject must be stable enough to be expected to complete dosing through the DLT
             observation period as assessed by the investigator.

          -  Able to swallow and retain orally administered medication and does not have any
             clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption such
             as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:  Non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy;
             or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable
             cases, a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40
             milli-International units per milliliter and estradiol &lt; 40 picograms per milliliter
             (&lt; 140 picomole per liter) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy
             (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the
             contraception methods defined in protocol if they wish to continue their HRT during
             the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
             post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least two
             to four weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this
             interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their

             contraceptive method;  Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the
             contraception methods for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product
             label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk
             of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until at
             least 4 weeks after the last dose of study medication; Negative serum pregnancy test
             ≤ 7 days prior to first study drug dose; Female subjects who are lactating must
             discontinue nursing prior to the first dose of study treatment and must refrain from
             nursing throughout the treatment period and for 5 half-lives of GSK525762 or at least
             28 days (whichever is longer) following the last dose of study treatment.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the methods of contraception specified. This
             method must be used from the time of the first dose of study medication until least
             16 weeks after the last dose of study medication.
