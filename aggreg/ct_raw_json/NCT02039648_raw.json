Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g.) is\n      one of the major pathogens associated with the onset and progression of periodontitis.\n      Previous in vitro studies have shown that a proanthocyanidin-enriched extract from Rumex\n      acetosa L. inhibits the adhesion of P.g. and acts in a cytoprotective manner. Since the the\n      bacterial adhesion to oral mucosa cells is a pivotal step for the P.g. mediated tissue\n      destruction, its inhibition may be helpful in preventing the colonization with P.g. or its\n      eradication in P.g. infected patients. Therefore, the aim of this controlled, randomized and\n      double blinded study was to analyze the effects of a Proanthocyanidin-enriched extract from\n      Rumex acetosa L. on the intraoral colonization with Porphyromonas gingivalis in individuals\n      harboring P.g. intramurally."

Plaque samples were taken at different visits\n      (screening, baseline, 2, 4, 7 and 14 days after baseline) and P.g. was identified and\n      quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-PCR). Also the relative quantity of\n      eight other oral pathogenic microorganisms (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Treponema\n      denticola, Tannerella forsythia, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Eikenella\n      corrodens, Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans) and four commensal bacteria\n      (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mitis, Veillonella parvula and Actinomyces viscosus)\n      was determined over the whole study period by qrt-PCR. Additionally clinical parameters,\n      i.e. the Approximal Plaque Index (API) and the modified Sulcular Bleeding Index (SBI) were\n      recorded at baseline, 7 and 14 days. For identifying any dysplastic changes and mutations as\n      a potential reaction to the tested mouthwash solutions brushing biopsies of the oral mucosa\n      were taken at baseline and day 7 and were histologically examined."
