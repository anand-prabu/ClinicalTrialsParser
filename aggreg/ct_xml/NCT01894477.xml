    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well treosulfan and fludarabine phosphate with or
      without total body irradiation before donor stem cell transplant works in treating patients
      with myelodysplastic syndrome. Giving chemotherapy, such as treosulfan and fludarabine
      phosphate, and total-body irradiation before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the
      growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the
      donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help
      destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted
      cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving
      tacrolimus before and mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from
      happening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the better of two treosulfan-based conditioning regimens in patients with
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), by comparing 6-month progression-free survival.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effects of two conditioning regimens on changes in gene expression
      profiles, and evaluate the association of gene expression profiles and disease relapse.

      II. Determine the incidence of progression-free survival at 1 year and 2 years after
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).

      III. Evaluate overall survival (OS) at 6 months, at 1 year and at 2 years after HCT.

      IV. Determine the incidence of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

      V. Determine the incidence of chronic GVHD.

      VI. Determine donor chimerism around days +28 and +84.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN:

      ARM A: Patients receive treosulfan intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days -6 to -4 and
      fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -6 to -2.

      ARM B: Patients receive treosulfan and fludarabine phosphate as in Arm A and undergo
      low-dose total-body irradiation (TBI) on day 0.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients in both arms undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC)
      transplant or bone marrow transplant on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients with a related donor receive tacrolimus orally (PO) every 8 or 12
      hours on days -3 to 56 with taper to day 180. Beginning 4-6 hours after PBSC infusion,
      patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil PO every 12 hours to day 28. Patients with an
      unrelated donor receive tacrolimus PO every 8 or 12 hours on days -3 to 100 with taper to
      day 180. Beginning 4-6 hours after PBSC infusion, patients also receive mycophenolate
      mofetil PO every 8 hours to day 40 with taper to day 96.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

    <description>Differences between arms in the changes in gene expression will be compared. 80% power to detect mean differences between arms in the change in gene expression equal in magnitude to 1.08 standard deviation (SD) units will be done using a two-sample t-test, at the 2-sided 0.05 Bonferroni-corrected level of significance (assuming correction for 100 genes).</description>

    <description>Among genes identified whose expression is modified by conditioning, the degree of change in expression in these genes will be evaluated to determine whether it is correlated with relapse risk and offers improved prediction of relapse risk over that obtained with standard clinical parameters (cytogenetics, blast count, International Prognostic Scoring System [IPSS] score). To account for censoring and the competing risk of NRM, the analysis will be a time-to-event analysis of relapse using Cox regression, with change in expression as a continuous covariate (on a log scale).</description>
