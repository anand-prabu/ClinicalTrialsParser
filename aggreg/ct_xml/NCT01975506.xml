  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the role of occupational therapy within Head Start
      programs.  Representatives within Head Start will be asked to participate in a nationwide
      internet based survey identifying the amount and type of services provided within this area.
       The Model of Human Occupation (MOHO) will also be included in the study by identifying
      current use of the model and how it can be utilized in the future. In order to complete this
      study to the fullest extent, we must begin by defining the Model of Human Occupation as well
      as understanding the mission of the National Head Start Association.  The vision of MOHO is
      to support practice that is focused on occupation, client centered, holistic,
      evidence-based, and complementary to other occupational therapy models.  The mission of the
      National Head Start Association is to coalesce, inspire and support the Head Start field as
      a leader in early childhood development and education. This has lead researchers to perform
      the following study:  An examination of occupational therapy in the context of Head Start.

      Participants will be informed of the intent of the study in the initial e-mail introduction
      and invitation of participation. Participants will be given the opportunity to ask questions
      about the study by asking the research assistants, whose names and email addresses will be
      given. Within the initial email introduction/invitation of participation, participants will
      be given the name and contact information of the research assistants and will be instructed
      to direct all questions regarding the survey to them. All data received from the survey
      participants will be returned de-identified. None of the data collected will be traceable to
      the survey participants. Participants will be provided the research assistants' email
      addresses and can contact them should they be interested in receiving any results from the
      study. The benefits of the study are to advance the overall role of Occupational Therapy
      services within head start facilities.  This study could further understandings of how and /
      or why certain concepts should / shouldn't be used, could assist administrators in
      developing quality programming, and contribute to the body of knowledge in Occupational
      Therapy in Head Start programs. The research assistants' e-mail addresses will be provided
      in the consent forms with a statement saying that they will be able to contact her via
      e-mail should they be interested in receiving any results from the study.Informed consent
      will be obtained through the initial email introduction and formal request for
      participation.  Participants will be provided study information on the first page of the
      survey and will indicate their consent by clicking &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; before beginning the
      survey.
