Dietary\n      supplementation with polyphenols in high-risk patients could diminish the harmful\n      consequences of oxidative stress.\n\n      The aim of this study is to show that the daily consumption of grape juice rich in\n      polyphenols \" R@isol \", has a positive impact on the oxidation/antioxidation balance in\n      healthy volunteers."
