Determine the antitumor activity of DX-8951f in women with metastatic\n      adenocarcinoma of the breast who have failed prior therapy with an anthracycline and a\n      taxane. II. Evaluate the quantitative and qualitative toxicities of this drug in these\n      patients. III. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive DX-8951f IV over 30 minutes daily for 5 days. Courses repeat every\n      21 days. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n      Patients are followed every 3 months until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study."
