  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group study. Participants
      will be randomly assigned to receive treatment with beclomethasone dipropionate at a dosage
      of 80 or 160 mcg/day delivered via a Breath-Actuated Inhaler (BAI); or a matching BAI
      placebo, in a 1:1:1 ratio after a 14- to 21-day run-in period. Participants and
      investigators will remain blinded to randomized treatment assignment during the study.

      The study consists of 3 periods:

        -  run-in period: Screening visit (SV) to randomization visit (RV), 14-21 days (2-3 weeks)
           prior to study start

        -  double-blind treatment period: RV through the final treatment visit, 85±3 days or 12
           weeks after study start.

        -  follow-up period: a follow-up visit/telephone call, 7±3 days after the treatment period
           ends.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Severity of Disease: The patient has persistent asthma, with an forced expiratory
             volume in 1 second (FEV1) 40%-85% of the value predicted for age, height, sex, and
             race as per the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III)
             reference values at screening visit (SV) (Hankinson et al 1999).

          -  Current asthma therapy: The patient is currently being treated with 1 of the
             following:

             1) inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) at a stable daily dose of less than or equal to 220
             mcg/day fluticasone propionate via metered dose inhaler (MDI) or equivalent for a
             minimum of 4 weeks (28 days) before screening visit, or 2) a stable daily dosage of
             non-corticosteroid therapy, including leukotriene modifiers, theophylline, chromones,
             or short-acting  beta-2 agonists (SABAs) alone or in combination for a minimum of 4
             weeks (28 days) before screening visit (SV).

          -  Reversibility of disease: The patient has demonstrated at least 15% and at least 200
             mL increase from baseline FEV1 (patients age 18 and older) within 30 minutes after
             2-4 inhalations of albuterol/salbutamol hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) MDI (90 mcg
             ex-actuator) or equivalent at SV or on retesting.  - Other criteria apply, please
             contact the investigator for more information

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has a history of life-threatening asthma, defined for this protocol as an
             asthma episode that required intubation and/or was associated with hypercapnea,
             respiratory arrest, or hypoxic seizures.

          -  The patient is a pregnant or lactating female or plans to become pregnant.

          -  The patient has a known hypersensitivity to any corticosteroid or any of the
             excipients in the study drug or rescue medication formulation.

          -  The patient currently smokes or has a smoking history of 10 pack-years or more (a
             pack-year is defined as smoking 1 pack of cigarettes/day for 1 year). The patient may
             not have used tobacco products within the past year.

          -  The patient has had an asthma exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids within 1
             month before SV, or has had any hospitalization for asthma within 2 months before SV.

          -  The patient has historical or current evidence of a clinically significant disease.
             Significant disease is defined as any disease that in the medical judgment of the
             investigator would put the safety of the patient at risk through participation or
             that could affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the disease/condition worsened
             during the study.

          -  Other criteria apply, please contact the investigator for more information
