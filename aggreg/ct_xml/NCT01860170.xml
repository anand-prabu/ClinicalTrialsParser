  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Bortezomib, known commercially as Velcade is
      safe and tolerated at different dose levels (amounts) with high dose Cyclophosphamide to be
      used as graft versus host disease prevention after reduced-intensity allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that the administration of an early and short course cyclophosphamide and
      bortezomib after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantationin in the setting of
      matched related or unrelated donor transplantation using a standard reduced-intensity
      conditioning regimen is feasible.

      The study is a phase I study. The primary objective of the study is to determine the
      feasibility and safety of increasing doses of bortezomib administered post-transplant in
      conjunction with fixed high dose cyclophosphamide, also administered post-transplant in the
      setting of reduced-intensity allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, as GVHD
      prophylaxis strategy. Eligible patients will receive a conditioning regimen based on a
      combination of fludarabine and  busulfan with or without rATG.

    <description>Neutrophil engraftment is defined as achieving an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 0.5 109/L for 3 consecutive measurements on different days. The first of the 3 days will be considered the day of neutrophil engraftment.
Platelet engraftment is defined as platelet count &gt; 20 109/L for 3 consecutive measurements over at least 3 days. The first of the 3 days will be considered the day of platelet engraftment.
In this study, graft failure is defined as lack of achieving neutrophil engraftment by day 22 and donor chimerism &gt; 50% by day 45.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>GVHD</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed routinely by clinical and pathological evaluation.  Acute GVHD will be assessed  up to day 150 post-transplant. Chronic GVHD will be assess up to 2 years post-transplant.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>aGVHD onset at a certain grade will be used to calculate the cumulative incidence for that grade (e.g., onset of grade 70 post-transplant , time to grade III is 70 days).  This end point will be evaluated through day 150 post-transplant. The diagnosis of aGVHD is based on clinical and pathological evaluation by the treating physician.
The first day of cGVHD will be used to calculate the cumulative incidence of cGVHD. The diagnosis of cGVHD is based on clinical and pathological evaluation by the treating physician.</description>
