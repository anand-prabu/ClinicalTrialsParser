Patients\n      receiving interferon-gamma had fewer hospital stays, shorter in length, than the placebo\n      group.  Children less than 10 years of age benefitted most from treatment and had fewer side\n      effects.\n\n      Based on these data, the FDA licensed interferon-gamma for prophylaxis in CGD patients.  We\n      wish to monitor our patients who participated in the original study for possible long-term\n      side effects.  Any new patients referred to us who are either on interferon-gamma or\n      considered to be candidates for interferon-gamma will be considered for this protocol.  In\n      addition, our patients who were originally accepted under Genentech's compassionate plea\n      protocol will also be monitored under this new protocol.  The patients will be evaluated\n      every six months, with blood work and interim medical histories taken."
