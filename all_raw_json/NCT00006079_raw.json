Establish the\n      biochemical tissue markers of DNA content, PCNA, the ras oncogene, EGFR, and keratin and\n      involucrin as intermediate biomarker end points for squamous carcinogenesis in these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to\n      one of three treatment arms. Arm I-II: Patients receive one of two different doses of oral\n      eflornithine daily. Arm III: Patients receive oral placebo daily. Treatment continues for 28\n      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed\n      at 28 days, and then at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients (60 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
