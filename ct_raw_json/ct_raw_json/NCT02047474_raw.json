Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as\n      leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride, and oxaliplatin, work in\n      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping\n      them from dividing. Giving combination chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor\n      smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving these\n      treatments after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery."

To determine the progression-free survival in patients with resectable non-metastatic\n      pancreatic cancer treated with peri-operative modified leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil,\n      irinotecan hydrochloride, oxaliplatin (mFOLFIRINOX).\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. Determine overall survival. II. Determine objective response rate after neoadjuvant\n      mFOLFIRINOX.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. Compare R0 resection rate and pathologic stage with institutional historical controls who\n      did not receive neoadjuvant therapy.\n\n      II. Correlate early metabolic response, determined by changes in glucose metabolism using\n      positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, with pathologic response, R0 resection, and\n      pathologic stage.\n\n      III. Correlate early metabolic response, determined by changes in glucose metabolism using\n      PET scanning, with progression-free and overall survival.\n\n      IV. Correlate pre-operative response of CA19-9 with progression-free and overall survival.\n\n      V. Collect and bank serial serum and plasma specimens from subjects for future correlative\n      biomarker studies.\n\n      VI. Collect and bank tumor tissue from subjects prior to treatment (from the diagnostic\n      endoscopic ultrasonography [EUS]-guided biopsy) and after treatment with six cycles of\n      FOLFIRINOX (from the surgical specimen) for future correlative biomarker studies.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      NEOADJUVANT THERAPY: Patients receive mFOLFIRINOX comprising oxaliplatin intravenously (IV)\n      over 2 hours, levoleucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90\n      minutes, and fluorouracil IV continuously for 46 hours on day 1.
