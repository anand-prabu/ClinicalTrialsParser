  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:  Patients hospitalized with complex chronic conditions frequently experience
      preventable short-term readmissions due to inadequate transition support.  Although
      structured discharge planning with telephone follow-up improves transition outcomes, these
      services often are unavailable, and proactive outreach is often inadequate once the patient
      returns home.  Informal caregivers are invaluable for ensuring successful transitions, but
      many patients live alone, have an in-home caregiver who is struggling with competing
      demands, or live at a distance from adult children or other potential sources of support.
      New models are needed for transition support that include low-cost technologies and more
      structured assistance for patients' informal caregiving network, while providing patients'
      clinical teams with the information they need to avert health crises.

      Objectives: Consistent with Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality goals to improve
      transitions using accessible health IT, we will evaluate a novel intervention designed to
      improve the effectiveness of transition support for common chronic conditions via three
      mechanisms of action: (a) direct tailored communication to patients via automated calls post
      discharge, (b) support for informal caregivers via structured feedback about the patient's
      status and advice about how they can help, and (c) support for proactive care management
      including a web-based disease management tool, automated alerts about potential problems,
      and the capacity for asynchronous communication with patients and their caregivers.
      Specifically, the trial will determine: 1) whether the CarePartner intervention improves
      patients' readmission risk and functional status; 2) the impact of the intervention on
      patients' self-care behaviors and the quality of the transition process; and 3) whether the
      intervention improves caregiver burden and stress levels.

      Methods: 422 adults with complex chronic conditions will be identified upon admission to a
      university-based acute care general medical service.  Patients will be asked to identify a
      CarePartner (CP) living outside their household; CPs will be spouses, adult children, and
      others in their social network willing to play an active role in their transition support.
      Patients will be randomized to the intervention or usual care. Intervention patients will
      receive automated assessment and behavior change calls, and their CPs will receive
      structured feedback and advice following each assessment.  Patients' clinical team will have
      access to patients' assessment results via the web, will receive automated reports about
      urgent health problems, and will be able to communicate asynchronously with patients and CPs
      using a secure web page and a specially designed voicemail service.  Patients will complete
      surveys at baseline, 30- and 90- days post discharge; utilization data will be obtained from
      hospital records.  CPs and clinicians will be interviewed to evaluate intervention effects
      on processes of self-care support, caregiver stress and communication, and the
      intervention's potential for broader implementation.  The primary outcome will be 30 day
      readmission rates; 2ndary outcomes include functional status, self-care behaviors, and
      mortality risk.

    <description>Patients in the intervention group receive automated telephone calls that ask about their health and self-care along with tailored health-related feedback.  The patient's CarePartner receives health update reports about the patient and how they can help via e-mail.  Urgent health problems are reported to the patient's health care team via fax or e-mail.</description>
