This has been tested in randomised clinical trials (ARCTIC, GRAVITAS\n      and TRIGGER-PCI), but despite reducing platelet reactivity, a strategy of therapy adjustment\n      based on platelet function monitoring did not reduce the incidence of cardiac ischaemic\n      events1, which indicates that most pharmacodynamical tests monitored anti-platelet treatment\n      failed so far.\n\n      We accordingly performed this registration study to investigate whether the pharmacogenetic\n      and pharmacokinetic factors are associated with clopidogrel low response as well as clinical\n      outcome, and aimed to provide new targets for the individualized anti-platelet treatment.\n\n      Inclusion criteria:\n\n        1. Successively recruit all patients who receive stent implantation;\n\n        2. Patient aged >18 years and \u226680 years old;\n\n        3. Signed inform consent.\n\n      Exclusion criteria:\n\n      1.None\n\n      Clinical data collection:\n\n        1. Patients basic characteristics.\n\n        2. Diagnosis and complicated diseases.\n\n        3. Medical treatment and interventional treatment.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      Blood samples are collected on the 5th days after the patients' taking clopidogrel to\n      perform the genetic testing and determine the light transmittancy aggregation (LTA) and the\n      serum levels of the parent clopidogrel, intermediate and active metabolites of clopidogrel.\n      LTA is to re-determined 1 month after clopidogrel consumption. Clopidogrel low response is\n      defined as the inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) in response to 5\u03bcM ADP is no more\n      than 60%. Clinical follow-up will be performed 1month, 6month, and 1year after the patients'\n      included. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) is set as death, non-fatal myocardial\n      infarction (MI), ischemic stroke. Associations of the pharmacogenetic and pharmacokinetic\n      factors with clopidogrel low response and clinical outcome will be analyzed.\n\n      Tests:\n\n        1. ADP-induced platelet aggregation: LTA in response to 5\u03bcM ADP.\n\n        2. Arachidonic acid (AA)-induced platelet aggregation: LTA in response to 1mM AA.\n\n        3. Simultaneous detection of clopidogrel, 2-oxo-clopidogrel and its thiol metabolite in\n           human plasma by the high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry\n           (HPLC-MS/MS) method.\n\n        4. GWAS scan or genotyping of ABCB1,CYP2C19, paraoxonase 1 (PON1).\n\n      Sample size: We plan to recruit 1500 patients.\n\n      Clinical follow-up: 1 month, 6 month, and 1 year after the patients' included.\n\n      Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE): Death, non-fatal MI, ischemic stroke.\n\n      Minor adverse cardiovascular events: Hospitalization, revascularization, stent thrombosis\n      (ARC definition) and minor, moderate, and major bleeding (TIMI definition)."
