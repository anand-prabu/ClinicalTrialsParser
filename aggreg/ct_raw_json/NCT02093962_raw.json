Pemetrexed has poor tissue penetration and targets the regions\n      of tumors that are located in proximity to the tumor vessels. The presence of hypoxia in\n      solid tumors is associated with a more malignant phenotype and resistance to chemotherapy.\n      The hypoxia-activated prodrug, TH-302, is designed to selectively target the hypoxic\n      microenvironment. There is evidence supporting the presence of hypoxia in NSCLC lesions\n      based on a hypoxia PET study. Combining pemetrexed with TH-302 may enable the targeting of\n      both the normoxic and hypoxic regions of NSCLC lesions."
