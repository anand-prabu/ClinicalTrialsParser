This is a study\n      designed to evaluate the feasibility of using prototype imaging technology to enhance the\n      detection of precancerous changes in various tissues. The results of this laboratory study\n      will be used to further develop the technology for clinical application.\n\n      The primary aim of this project will be to investigate what digital image analysis criteria\n      can be used to best detect dysplasia in various types of resected tissue."
