            "textblock": "Background: End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients have an extremely high mortality and the\n      leading cause of death is cardiovascular disease which accounts for 50% of all deaths. It is\n      estimated that about one third is due to arrhythmias. Previous studies reveal a higher risk\n      of various arrhythmias in dialysis patients but the prevalence is uncertain.  Atrial\n      fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia among patients with ESRD. The arrhythmia is often\n      asymptomatic, but the risk of stroke increases dramatically and the annual mortality\n      doubles. Autonomic cardiac dysfunction is often seen in patients with ESRD, and this is\n      expressed by attenuated Heart Rate Variability (HRV) which is a measure of the variation in\n      the time interval between heart beats. Attenuated 24 hours HRV is associated with an\n      increased risk of sudden cardiac death in the general population and among patients with\n      ESRD. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in fish or fish oil supplements have been\n      shown to increase HRV and reduce the risk of various ventricular and supraventricular\n      arrhythmias in some but not all studies, but this effect has only been sparsely investigated\n      in the high risk patients with ESRD, who has a very low intake of n-3 PUFAs.\n\n      Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of n-3 PUFA\n      supplementation on HRV and arrhythmias in dialysis patients.\n\n      Hypothesis: n-3 PUFA supplementation increases 24 hours HRV in dialysis patients. n-3 PUFA\n      supplementation reduces the level of Supraventricular tachycardia, premature atrial\n      complexes (PACs) and premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) in chronic dialysis patients.\n\n      Design: Randomized double-blind, placebo controlled trial\n\n      Study participants: 140 dialysis patients at Aalborg University Hospital and Vendsyssel\n      Hospital, Hj\u00f8rring in Denmark.\n\n      Inclusion time: Summer 2014 to Spring 2015\n\n      Methods: The patients are allocated to 3 months treatment with supplements of 2 g n-3 PUFAs\n      or placebo (olive oil).  The following data are registered at baseline and after 3 months\n      treatment: Demographics and medical history, Standard ECG-12, blood pressure, blood samples,\n      48 hours ambulatory ECG Holter recordings, Intake of n-3 PUFAs (assessed by questionnaires\n      and blood measurements).\n\n      Perspective: A positive result of this study might make it possible to achieve a reduction\n      in arrhythmias and mortality in these high risk patients by a cheap and well tolerated\n      nutritional supplement."
