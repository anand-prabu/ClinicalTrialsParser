The purpose of the study is to establish the safety and potential\n      efficacy of subconjunctival injections of aflibercept (EYLEA\u00ae , marketed by Regeneron)\n      injection in inducing regression of blood vessels growing into the cornea and promoting\n      graft survival.\n\n      This study is being conducted by Dr. Balamurali Ambati at the Moran Eye Center."

Current standard of care to prevent graft rejection\n      includes use of topical steroids and immunosuppressants. These do not address corneal\n      neovascularization. The cornea is kept in its avascular state by a complex interaction of\n      signal proteins and host receptors, with a vital role played by the soluble VEGF-receptor 1.\n      In any condition of chronic corneal inflammation or hypoxia, the balance may tip in favour\n      of pro-angiogenic factors, and neovascularization will ensue. Early and limited studies have\n      examined the effect of subconjunctival or intracorneal administration of monoclonal\n      antibodies to VEGF (bevacizumab, ranibizumab) in combating corneal neovascularization. Most\n      report subtotal or temporary regression. The development of aflibercept (also known as VEGF\n      Trap-Eye) offers new hope of more effectively combating the problem.  In this study,\n      research will be conducted to investigate and assess safety of subconjunctival aflibercept\n      injection in patients with corneal neovascularization undergoing corneal transplantation.\n\n      This is a phase 1, prospective, randomized, open label clinical trial that will enroll 10\n      corneal transplant patients with corneal neovascularization in one or more quadrants\n      crossing more than 0.5 mm over the limbus at the time of corneal transplantation."
