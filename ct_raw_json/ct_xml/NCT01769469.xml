  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational cohort sub-study of subjects enrolled in the ATN 110 or
      ATN 113 study.  All subjects will be followed for at least 48 weeks.  Subjects who meet
      specific bone or renal criteria at Week 48 of the ATN 110 or ATN 113 study will be followed
      for an additional 48 weeks in the Extension Phase of ATN 110 or ATN 113 and ATN 117.  The
      maximum duration of participation will be 96 weeks.

      There is no therapeutic intervention specific to this sub-study, and there are no extra
      study visits required for participation in this sub-study.  Questionnaires will be
      administered and blood and urine samples for laboratory evaluation of potential
      emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir (TDF) (Truvada®) toxicities will be obtained for this
      sub-study at visits that are required by the ATN 110 or ATN 113 study. Measurement of bone
      mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
      (DXA) scan are planned as a part of the ATN 110 and ATN 113 studies, and results will be
      utilized for the analysis in this study. This study does not require extra BMD or BMC
      measurements.
