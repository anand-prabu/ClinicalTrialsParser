  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Essential tremor is the most common adult-onset movement disorder, and essential voice
      tremor is the vocal manifestation of essential tremor. While nearly all essential tremor
      patients experience hand tremor, many also manifest head tremor and voice tremor. Essential
      voice tremor can lead to increased vocal effort, decreased intelligibility, and misconstrued
      emotional state. Only one medication, propranolol, is FDA-approved to treat essential
      tremor. Propranolol is not felt to be nearly as effective for axial tremors (head, trunk,
      neck) as it is for extremity tremors. However, this has not been studied with any objective
      assessment in a prospective way for EVT. For patients with essential voice tremor, the
      limited published data suggests that botulinum toxin has been shown to lead to functional
      voice improvement. Botulinum toxin, though also not well-studied with objective voice
      outcomes, is a commonly used clinical therapy for treatment of essential voice tremor. While
      it is used more often for essential voice tremor than propranolol therapy, botulinum toxin
      also has not been prospectively studied with validated, objective voice outcome measures.
      The investigators would like to determine if propranolol has any significant effect on vocal
      tremor. The investigators would also like to determine, in an objective way, the effect of
      botulinum toxin on vocal tremor. If effective, propranolol would provide an affordable and
      non-invasive alternative or addition to botulinum toxin injections for patients with
      essential voice tremor.

      Specific Aims

      • Determine the effect of propranolol on vocal tremor in the treatment-seeking population.

      To date, the nonselective beta-blocker propranolol remains the only agent approved for the
      treatment of essential tremor (ET). For ET, immediate and sustained release formations of
      propranolol are equally effective, while other beta-blockers like nadolol and timolol are
      not as effective. While propranolol improves tremor in greater than half of patients with
      essential tremor, its effects on tremor are not evenly distributed. Improvement in tremor
      symptoms is greater for limb tremor than axial tremor, and therefore propranolol is not
      commonly used for the treatment of essential voice tremor (EVT). However, its effect on
      essential voice tremor has never been objectively, prospectively studied. Our aim is to
      objectively determine the effect of propranolol on essential voice tremor in the
      treatment-seeking population by evaluating patients with EVT before and after propranolol
      therapy.

      • Determine the effect of botulinum toxin injections on vocal tremor in the
      treatment-seeking population.

      More recently, botulinum toxin A has been used for the treatment of EVT. Chemical
      denervation with botulinum toxin is only modestly effective in reducing limb tremor in ET
      and complicated by side effects of weakness. However, botulinum toxin seems to be more
      effective in treating EVT than other manifestations of ET. While prior studies have not
      enlisted validated assessments of voice quality to measure the effect of botulinum toxin
      injections on EVT, they have shown subjective improvement in acoustic measures of tremor and
      ratings of videotaped speech after therapy with botulinum toxin. Our aim is to objectively
      determine the effect of botulinum toxin on vocal tremor in the treatment-seeking population
      by evaluating patients with EVT before and after botulinum therapy.

      Voice Evaluations and Medications

      For the first evaluation, a research coordinator will collect demographics and patient
      reported data. This data will result from providing patient questionnaires and recording the
      patient's voice. VRQOL data will be collected by having the patient answer ten statements on
      a 1-5 scale, such as &quot;I have trouble speaking loudly or being heard in noisy situations&quot; or
      &quot;I run out of air and need to take frequent breaths.&quot; QUEST data will be also recorded to a
      30-item essential tremor-specific questionnaire. Patient will also complete a global voice
      rating of a 0-7 scoring of &quot;How would you rate your voice today?&quot; After these subjective
      questionnaires, patient will participate in a vocal recording using prompts and passages
      from the validated CAPE-V voice assessment tool.

      After a discussion of the risks and benefits of propranolol therapy, the patient will then
      be given a prescription by the principal investigator for propranolol.

      The second evaluation will occur at an office visit two weeks after initiating propranolol
      therapy. Again, this will consist of patient-reported V-RQOL, QUEST, and global voice rating
      data. Patient will participate in a second vocal recording using prompts and passages from
      the validated CAPE-V voice assessment tool.

      At this second evaluation, patient will receive botulinum toxin injections. The risks and
      benefits of botulinum toxin therapy will be explained to the patient, and bilateral
      injections will take place.

      Four weeks after botulinum toxin injection, the patient will undergo the third voice
      assessment. Again, this will consist of patient-reported V-RQOL, QUEST, and global voice
      rating data. Patient will participate in a third vocal recording using prompts and passages
      from the validated CAPE-V voice assessment tool.
