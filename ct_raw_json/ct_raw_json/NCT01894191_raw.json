Missed adenomas which are more likely to be in the proximal colon may\n      be contributing factors. An independent predictor of the risk of interval cancers is adenoma\n      detection rate. In pilot observations, the investigators showed that water exchange enhanced\n      adenoma detection in the right colon (cecum to hepatic flexure). This prospective,\n      randomized controlled trial will compare water exchange  with water immersion and\n      traditional air insufflation in patients undergoing colonoscopy. The investigators test the\n      hypothesis that compared with air insufflation and water immersion, water exchange produces\n      a significantly higher adenoma detection rate in the right colon."
