Evaluate the safety profile\n      of the MTD in this patient population. III. Determine the objective response rate, time to\n      response, duration of response, time to progression, and survival rate in this patient\n      population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, open label, multicenter study. Patients receive\n      pegylated-interferon alfa-2a (PEG-IFN) subcutaneously once a week for 24 weeks. Dose\n      escalation of PEG-IFN continues until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The\n      MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting\n      toxicity. After the MTD of PEG-IFN is determined, additional patients are treated at this\n      dose level. These patients may continue treatment after the first 24 weeks for up to 1 year,\n      in the absence of disease progression. Patients are followed for 4 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 46-58 patients will be accrued for this study within 9 months."
