    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects must have completed 6 doses of treatment of radium-223 dichloride and
      experienced no radium-223 dichloride-related SAEs (serious adverse events) or CTCAE (Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Grade 3 or 4 adverse event during or after the
      initial course of radium-223 dichloride that led to the discontinuation of treatment. 40
      Subjects will be enrolled and will receive up to 6 doses of radium-223 dichloride 50 kBq/kg
      IV every 4 weeks.

      The subject will be evaluated for AEs (adverse events) and laboratory tests at each visit
      every 4 weeks, prior to receiving radium-223 dichloride.

      After the end of treatment visit the subjects will enter the active follow up period.
      Related AEs and SAEs and Lab tests will be evaluated at each visit every 4 weeks for the
      first 12 weeks, then every 12 weeks for up to 2 years after the last dose of radium-223
      dichloride.

      After the 2 years of active follow-up, subjects will enter the long-term follow-up period
      and will be followed via telephone follow-up at 6-month intervals for late toxicities and
      survival up to 7 years after the last dose of radium-223 dichloride or until death.

      Joint safety reviews will regularly take place to oversee safety of the subjects conducted
      at regular intervals.

      An interim analysis of the safety data will be conducted during the study.
