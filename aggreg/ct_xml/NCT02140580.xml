      Trial question: Does administration of exogenous surfactant using a minimally-invasive
      technique improve outcome in preterm infants 25-28 weeks gestation treated with continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP)? Trial hypothesis: That early surfactant administration via
      a minimally-invasive technique to preterm infants on CPAP will result in a lesser duration
      of mechanical respiratory support, and a higher incidence of survival without
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Trial design: Multicentre, randomised, masked, controlled trial
      in inborn preterm infants 25-28 weeks gestation, aged less than 6 hours, requiring CPAP
      because of respiratory distress, with an FiO2 of &gt;=0.3 and CPAP pressure 5-8. Infants
      randomised to surfactant treatment receive 200 mg/kg of poractant alfa (Curosurf)
      administered under direct laryngoscopy using a surfactant instillation catheter, followed by
      reinstitution of CPAP. Controls continue on CPAP. The intervention is masked from the
      clinical team. Care thereafter is as per usual in both groups, other than the requirement to
      adhere to intubation criteria. The primary outcome is incidence of death or BPD. Secondary
      outcomes include incidence of death, major neonatal morbidities (BPD, intraventricular
      haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotising
      enterocolitis), pneumothorax and patent ductus arteriosus; need for intubation and
      surfactant therapy; durations of mechanical respiratory support, intubation, CPAP,
      intubation and CPAP, high flow nasal cannula (HFNC), oxygen therapy, intensive care stay and
      hospitalisation; hospitalisation cost; applicability and safety of the MIST procedure; and
      outcome at 2 years. The sample size is 303/group, allowing detection of a 33% difference in
      the primary outcome with 90% power. The trial commenced at Royal Hobart Hospital December
      2011 and Royal Women's Hospital during 2012, and will ultimately be conducted over 5 years
      in multiple centres internationally.

    <description>Composite outcome of death by 36 weeks or physiological bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Physiological BPD is assessed at 36 weeks post-menstrual age, and is defined as either need for respiratory support (intubation / CPAP / high flow nasal cannula &gt; 2 L/min) or need for FiO2 &gt;=0.3 or failure of a room air trial conducted at 36 weeks post-menstrual age. This will be assessed by the research nurse at each centre.</description>

    <description>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) will be assessed both clinically (need for mechanical respiratory support and/or an oxygen requirement at 36 weeks corrected gestation), and by a physiological definition. Physiological BPD is assessed at 36 weeks post-menstrual age, and is defined as either need for respiratory support (intubation / CPAP / high flow nasal cannula &gt; 2 L/min) or need for FiO2 &gt;=0.3 or failure of a room air trial conducted at 36 weeks post-menstrual age. This will be assessed by the research nurse at each centre.</description>

    <description>Minimally invasive surfactant therapy - delivery of exogenous surfactant to the lung via brief catheterisation of the trachea with an instillation catheter in a preterm infant who is being supported with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) via nasal prongs or mask. Poractant alfa (Curosurf) at a dosage of 200 mg/kg will be administered over 15 - 30 seconds. Total duration of the procedure will be less than 5 minutes, followed by reinstitution of CPAP.</description>

    <description>Standard control treatment. After randomisation, infants will receive a sham treatment from a treatment team not engaged in clinical care. This will not involve removal of prongs or discontinuation of CPAP but will require setting up intubation equipment, screening the baby, testing suction unit, repositioning of the baby and changing the baby's monitoring. CPAP will thereafter continue.</description>
