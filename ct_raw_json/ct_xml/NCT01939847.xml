  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the feasibility of identifying patients who could benefit from tumor
      molecular profiling, of analyzing the patients' tumors in a timely (28 day) fashion, and of
      the identification of possible actionable mutations that are not just biologically
      interesting but are clinically relevant. The investigators will also examine the outcome
      data from patients who followed the Molecular Profiling Tumor Board suggestion compared with
      those who did not.

      The goal of this research study is to determine if it is possible to obtain personalized
      genetic information from a subject's tumor to see if physicians can use that information to
      make a treatment suggestion. The investigators hope to identify genes important to cancer
      cells that could potentially identify a more educated way to recommend therapy. It is not
      known if our suggestion for treatment based on genetic information will be the correct
      treatment choice.

      Subjects and their treating doctor will have a choice about what treatment they will receive
      and do not have to decide to be treated with the suggestion from this study.  In some cases
      it will not be possible to make a suggestion. For example, a suggestion for treatment will
      not be possible if there are technical issues, if the gene sequencing process takes longer
      than planned, or if no genes are identified that could help identify a treatment suggestion.

      The investigators also plan to collect information about the treatment subjects receive and
      how their cancer responds to the treatment.  This may help us to understand if our
      personalized suggestion improves the amount of time before their disease progresses.

      In addition, blood samples will be collected for research studies.  These samples are being
      collected to learn more about breast cancer by studying cells, genes, and gene products
      including their patterns and changes in the blood and tissue to help to learn how cancer
      develops and responds to therapy.

      Any man or woman being seen at Johns Hopkins for treatment of metastatic triple negative (or
      behaving as triple negative) breast cancer may be eligible.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or Female

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Metastatic breast cancer and treatment with prior chemotherapy (either in adjuvant,
             neoadjuvant or metastatic setting)

          -  Triple negative clinical phenotype (ER-, PR-, HER2-). For HER2 assessment, a negative
             result is an immunohistochemical (IHC staining of 0 or 1+, a FISH result of less than
             4.0 HER2 gene copies per nucleus, or a FISH ratio of less than 1.8. ER/PR will be
             assessed by IHC and will be defined as positive/negative using the American Society
             of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) Guidelines. Estrogen
             receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) assays will be considered positive if
             there are at least 1% positive tumor nuclei in the sample on testing in the presence
             of expected reactivity of internal (normal epithelial elements) and external
             controls. NOTE:  A triple negative clinical phenotype based upon the patient's
             clinical course may also be eligible as determined at the discretion of the Study
             Chair (ie, if a patient is behaving clinically as ER/PR negative but does not meet
             the strict criteria outlined.)

          -  Patients must have a tumor suitable for biopsy and be deemed medically appropriate to
             undergo a biopsy

          -  Able to voluntarily provide informed consent
