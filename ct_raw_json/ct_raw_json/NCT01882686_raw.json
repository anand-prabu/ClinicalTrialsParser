            "textblock": "Low back pain (LBP) is a common, recalcitrant and costly health problem, which limits\n      patients' daily activities. In 85% of the cases, LBP is classified as 'non-specific', which\n      means there is no clear underlying patho-anatomical/radiological abnormality. This subgroup\n      often gives rise to a chronic fluctuating problem. Although most cases of LBP resolve within\n      8 to 12 weeks, it may become chronic in up to 15% of patients. LBP constitutes an enormous\n      and growing medical and socio-economical problem for the modern society. Nursing has been\n      identified amongst the top professions at risk for occupational LBP, with lifetime\n      prevalence between 66%-82%. The impact of LBP for nurses includes time off work, increased\n      risk of chronicity, associated personal and economic costs and reduced nursing workforce\n      efficiency.\n\n      Non Specific Chronic Low Back Pain (NSCLBP) is widely viewed as a multifactorial\n      biopsychosocial pain syndrome. It has been proposed by several authors that NSCLBP\n      represents a vicious cycle associated with different combinations of maladaptive; cognitive\n      (negative beliefs, fear avoidance behaviours, catastrophising, depression, stress, lack of\n      pacing and coping), physical (pain provocative postures, movement patterns and pain\n      behaviours) and lifestyle (inactivity, rest) behaviours that act to promote pain and\n      disability. However a recent systematic review suggests that this change in paradigm and the\n      investigators new understanding of NSCLBP has not resulted in clinical trials utilizing\n      multidimensional classification systems or targeted interventions based on the underlying\n      mechanisms. In line with this paradigm shift a novel multidimensional classification system\n      has been developed incorporating the biopsychosocial model, which subgroups patients based\n      on their underlying pain mechanism. Enabling a classification based interventions targetting\n      the maladaptive cognitive, physical and lifestyle behaviours associated with the disorder."
