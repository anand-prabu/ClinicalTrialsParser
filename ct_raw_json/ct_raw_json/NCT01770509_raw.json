            "textblock": "Ulcers of the lower extremities, particularly in patients older than 65 years, are common\n      among the population. Studies estimate the prevalence of current chronic leg ulcers at\n      approximately 1%. The most common cause (approximately 80%) is thought to be chronic venous\n      insufficiency disease. Recurrent cellulitis is an additional common cause. The ulcers cause\n      a significant morbidity and negative impact on the patients' quality of life. The care of\n      chronic vascular ulcers places a significant burden on the patient and the health care\n      system. Additionally, these nonhealing ulcers place the patient at much higher risk for\n      lower extremity amputation.\n\n      Natural Matrix Bio polymer Membrane (NMBM)  is a novel topical cosmetic cream containing a\n      mix of natural waxes, sugars and lipids. The aim of this study is to test whether of Natural\n      Matrix Bio polymer Membrane (NMBM) is effective as an adjunctive therapy to the treatment of\n      venous stasis and post-erysipelas leg ulcers."
