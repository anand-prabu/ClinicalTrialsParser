The purpose\n      of this study is to compare patient-physician communication between patients who receive a\n      DVD that models patient communication strategies vs. those who do not receive a DVD. All\n      patients will also receive a written decision aid that describes treatment options for early\n      stage prostate cancer. The Investigators hypothesize that the DVD will:\n\n        -  increase patients' perceptions of the importance of their preferences to their decision\n           making\n\n        -  increase patients' perceptions of their intention to discuss their values and\n           preferences with their urologists and radiation oncologists\n\n        -  increase patients' actual engagement with their physician during the clinical encounter\n\n        -  increase the concordance between patient decision making preferences and actual\n           decision making outcomes\n\n        -  increase long term satisfaction with decision on type of treatment selected\n\n        -  increase patient satisfaction with their decision and the decision making process\n\n        -  influence patient perception of his physician (e.g., trust) and of the diagnosis visit"
