A randomized trial is justified for the\n      following reasons:  1) The high rate of death and disability associated with ischemic stroke\n      despite treatment with intravenous rt-PA mandates critical analysis of alternate therapies\n      with therapeutic potential,  2) endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke is\n      expanding in North America without compelling evidence of safety and efficacy from\n      well-designed clinical trials, 3) critical cost-effectiveness analysis cannot be done\n      without acquiring pertinent outcomes data from controlled studies."
