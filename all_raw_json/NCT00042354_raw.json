Where an alternative therapy has been shown to\n             prolong survival in an analogous population, this should be offered to the patient\n             prior to discussing this study.\n\n          -  Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (M3) must have been treated with at least\n             2 regimens-a retinoic acid-containing regimen and an arsenic trioxide-containing\n             regimen before being considered for this study.\n\n          -  Have a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of greater than or equal to 70.\n\n          -  Provide signed, written informed consent from parent or guardian and assent from\n             patients greater than or equal to 7 years old according to local IRB and\n             institutional requirements.\n\n          -  Have adequate organ function as indicated by the following laboratory values,\n             obtained within 2 weeks prior to registration: Serum bilirubin less than or equal to\n             1.5 x ULN; AST and ALT less than or equal to 5 x ULN; Serum Creatinine less than 2 x\n             ULN for age. ULN= Institutional Upper Limit of Normal\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Received previous treatment with Clofarabine.\n\n          -  Have an active, uncontrolled systemic infection considered opportunistic, life\n             threatening, or clinically significant at the time of treatment.\n\n          -  Are pregnant or lactating.  Male and female patients who are fertile must agree to\n             use an effective means of birth control (i.e., latex condom, diaphragm, cervical cap,\n             etc) to avoid pregnancy.\n\n          -  Have psychiatric disorders that would interfere with consent, study participation, or\n             follow up.\n\n          -  Are receiving any other chemotherapy.  Patients must have been off previous therapy\n             for at least 2 weeks (with the exception of intrathecal therapy, which is allowed up\n             to 24hrs prior to 1st dose of study drug) and must have recovered from acute toxicity\n             of all previous therapy prior to enrollment.  Treatment may start earlier, following\n             consultation with the ILEX Medical Monitor, if there is evidence of disease relapse\n             prior to that time.\n\n          -  Have any other severe concurrent disease, which, in the judgment of the investigator,\n             would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.\n\n          -  Have symptomatic CNS involvement.\n\n          -  Febrile neutropenia at time of study entry.\n\n          -  Known or suspected fungal infection (ie. patients on parenteral antifungal therapy)."
