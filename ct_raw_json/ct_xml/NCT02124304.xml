    <textblock>
      Neck pain is a condition that affects 14.6% of all adults annually. Of this annual
      prevalence, 37.3% experience persistent neck pain with periodic recurring episodes. The
      purpose of this study is to compare muscle activation patterns of the cervical musculature
      during exercises with elastic versus manual resistance in a neck pain and asymptomatic
      populations. Methods: A convenience sample of 15 healthy, physically active participants and
      15 current patients diagnosed with non-radicular cervical pain will be recruited.
      Exclusionary criteria will include: current cervical or upper extremity injury (healthy
      group), history of neck surgery, corticosteroid treatment within the last two weeks, and
      radicular signs or symptoms. Surface electromyography will be used to quantify the activity
      level of the bilateral SCM, AS, Cervical Paraspinal (CP), and the Upper Trapezius (UT)
      muscles while performing a series of 6 exercises with elastic resistance using Thera-Band®
      Resistance Bands and manual resistance. The area will be prepped and surface electrodes
      placed on the corresponding muscles. The movement will be standardized by using the peak
      activation (PA) of each muscle during full flexion-extension movement to create a percentage
      of peak activation (%PA). The testing battery will consist of 6 exercises with elastic
      resistance and manual resistance, totaling 12 different trials. Each trial will involve 5
      repetitions, each held for 5 seconds. The exercises will include cervical: extension,
      flexion, left rotation, right rotation, left side bending, and right side bending. The men
      will use the green and women will use the red Thera-Band® Resistance Band. The order of
      exercises will be randomized in to two parts to minimize the effect of fatigue. First,
      cervical flexion and extension with manual and elastic resistance will be randomized.
      Secondly, the remaining 8 exercises will be randomized. Following each exercise, the patient
      will rate their perceived level of exertion on the Thera-band® Resistance Intensity Scale
      for Exercise (RISE).
