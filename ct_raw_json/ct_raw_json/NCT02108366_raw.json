Many of these patients are 'late presenters'\n      who are admitted to hospital a few days after symptoms onset and have developed\n      complications secondary to immunodysregulation. Antiviral treatment with the neuraminidase\n      inhibitor is of limited usage for patients who presented to the hospital 48 hours after\n      symptom onset. Apart from ventilatory and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support,\n      treatment options for these patients are limited. Recent animal study has demonstrated that\n      combinations of an antiviral agent with a COX-II inhibitor  can reduce mortality in mice\n      infected with influenza virus. The investigators therefore propose to enrol patients with\n      severe influenza A infection requiring hospitalization and oxygen support on a randomized\n      controlled trial with celecoxib."

The hypothesis of this study is that treatment of severe influenza A\n      infection with celecoxib will reduce mortality. The primary outcome to be assessed will be\n      the 28-days mortality rate from hospitalization. The secondary outcomes to be assessed will\n      be safety of the treatment, duration of intensive care, duration of ventilatory and oxygen\n      support, the viral load and cytokine change."
