    <textblock>
      This study intends to use in patients with renal tissue and blood samples, screening and
      identification of renal tissue hURAT1 regulating the expression of micro-RNA, for further
      study of uric acid stone formation mechanism and the occurrence of clinical preventive uric
      acid stones provide new clues and new intervention targets.
