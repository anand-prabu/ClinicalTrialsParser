This subgrouping first assesses a patient fear avoidance beliefs, flexibility, body mechanics, and then strength and functional ability. The reason for sequential treatment is that there is evidence that without adequate flexibility a patient will be unable to perform exercises with proper body mechanics, and without proper mechanics strengthening and functional activity can cause increased stress on the patellofemoral joint. Progression through each specific subgroup is based on objective goals. Once the patient has met these goals they are progressed to the next treatment subgroup until discharge."

The control group will receive\n      treatment that would be considered standard physical therapy care.  To apply standard\n      physical therapy care in a standardized manner the investigators are using a multimodal\n      treatment approach that has been previously shown by Lowry to be beneficial in the treatment\n      of PFS.  Both groups of subjects will be seen 2 times per week for a maximum of 12 visits.\n      Patients can be discharged early if they no longer report pain or impaired function on the\n      Anterior Knee Pain scale.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to see if patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome treated\n      with the experimental Patellofemoral treatment algorithm experience significant improvements\n      in function, pain and the number of treatment sessions compared with a previously researched\n      multimodal approach to the treatment of patellofemoral pain.\n\n      The secondary objective of this study is to examine results to determine if a full\n      randomized controlled clinical trial of the PFS algorithm is justified.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that utilization of the Patellofemoral syndrome treatment\n      algorithm with evaluation and treatment of patients diagnosed with PFS will lead to\n      significant improvements in function, pain and the number of treatment sessions when\n      compared to previously researched treatment of PFS."

Treatment is at\n      the therapist discretion with the objective to meet the requirements for each subgroup.\n      Evidence from literature guides treatment to best meet these goals.\n\n      The first group within the classification system is Fear Avoidance, as research has shown\n      that a change in fear-avoidance beliefs about physical activity is one of the best\n      predictors for improved functional outcome.\n\n      The second group is Flexibility.  This is the second group in the system because research\n      shows that patients with decreased flexibility are unable to properly perform functional\n      malalignment test.  Also quadriceps length and gastrocnemius/soleus lengths are strongly\n      associated with PFS.\n\n      The third group is Functional Malalignment.  This group assesses the patient's form with\n      functional tasks.  If the patient demonstrates impaired mechanics, time is spent with\n      strengthening and motor control so that the patient will be able to strengthen and return to\n      full function with proper technique.\n\n      The final group is Strengthening/Return to Function.  This group will work strengthening of\n      the lower quarter muscles with particular attention to the quadriceps, hip abductor and\n      external rotators.  This is also the time to progress the patient back to sport or\n      functional activity.\n\n      -Fear Avoidance Belief Questionaire (A score of 15 or greater on this questionaire results\n      in being give a PFS fear avoidance booklet and treatment using a Cognitive Behavioral\n      emphasis)\n\n      Primary Muscle Flexibility Requirements (Not meeting 1 of these flexibility measures results\n      being placed into the flexibility subgroup)\n\n        -  Quadriceps \u2265 130 degrees\n\n        -  Gastrocnemius \u2265 12 degrees\n\n        -  Soleus \u2265 20 degrees\n\n        -  WB DF \u2265 50 degrees\n\n      Secondary Muscle Flexibility (Having tightness in at least 3 of the following tests results\n      in being placed into the flexibility subgroup)\n\n        -  Thomas test\n\n        -  Ober's Test\n\n        -  Hamstring SLR \u2265 80 degrees\n\n        -  Adductor Flexibility\n\n      Functional Malalignment (Score of great than 1 results in being placed into functional\n      malalignment subgroup)\n\n        -  Lateral Step Down test\n\n        -  Single Leg Squat test\n\n      Strengthening/Functional Progression (A limb symmetry index score of >=90% for each of these\n      test is used to determine adequate LE strength and function)\n\n        -  Single Hop Test\n\n        -  Triple Hop Test\n\n        -  Crossover Hop for Distance test\n\n        -  Timed Step Down test"
