After a pre-participation screening participants will be distributed\n      randomly but stratified by sex and age to one of the 3 intervention groups (cognitive\n      training, strength training, strength training + supplement).\n\n      Study participants are eligible if they are male or female with an age over 65 years and if\n      their cognitive status as well as their physical fitness level allows to participate at the\n      strength training sessions. Exclusion criteria comprise chronic diseases which\n      contraindicate the medical training therapy, serious cardiovascular disease, diabetic\n      retinopathy and manifest osteoporosis, medication with anticoagulants or cortisone drugs and\n      also regular strength training during the last six months.\n\n      Primary outcome measure is the change in isokinetic torque of knee extensors. Secondary\n      outcome measures comprise anthropometric data, functional performance tests, immunological\n      and oxidative stress parameters. The change in muscle signaling pathways will be assessed\n      from muscle biopsies."
