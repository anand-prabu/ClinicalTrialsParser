The DPP has ended\n      early demonstrating that lifestyle reduced diabetes onset by 58% and metformin reduced\n      diabetes onset by 31%.\n\n      The DPPOS is designed to take advantage of the scientifically and clinically valuable DPP\n      participants.  This group of participants is nearly 50% minority and represents the largest\n      IGT population ever studied. Clinically important research questions remain that focus on\n      1)durability of the prior DPP intervention, 2) determination of the clinical course of\n      precisely known new onset diabetes, in particular regarding CVD, CVD risk factors and\n      atherosclerosis and microvascular disease, 3)close examination of these topics in men vs\n      women and in minority populations."
