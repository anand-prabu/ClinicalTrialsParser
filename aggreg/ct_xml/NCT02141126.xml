  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this research is to evaluate changes in lower limb strength and physical
      function following six weeks of resistance training and routine physiotherapy versus a
      control group of routine physiotherapy only in an older inpatient population.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single blinded, randomised controlled trial recruiting consecutive
      appropriate patients in this post-acute rehabilitation unit.

      There are two groups (i) exercise intervention and (ii) control. It will not be possible to
      blind the treating physiotherapist or the patient to the exercise intervention; hence the
      single (assessor) blinded design.

      The study will be based in St James's Hospital, Dublin.  Assessments and the delivery of the
      exercise intervention will be conducted in the Physiotherapy department.

      Patients will be recruited in the inpatient setting. Appropriate patients will be
      approached, and the intervention explained to them. The patient will be given an information
      leaflet and 24-hours to consider involvement in the study

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Lower limb dynamometry</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Lower limb dynamometry will be measured using the Power Track II Commander by J-Tech Medical. A previous study in this rehabilitation unit has determined that this is a reliable measure of lower limb strength in this population. The primary outcome measurement will be quadriceps muscle strength.</description>

    <measure>Functional mobility using the Timed Up and Go (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Functional mobility using the Timed Up and Go (TUG) - this is a test of basic functional mobility for frail elderly people. The patient is asked to stand up from a chair, walk three metres, turn around and return to the chair, while being timed by the assessor.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) - this is a performance-based test. The distance walked in six minutes is measured and reported in metres or feet and is an indication of exercise tolerance.</description>

    <measure>EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) - measures health related quality of life, it contains a visual analogue scale (0 to 100, representing dead to excellent health state) and five items: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.</description>

    <measure>Canadian Study of Health and Ageing  Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Canadian Study of Health and Ageing  Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) - this is a measure of frailty based on clinical judgement. It is an ordinal scale which ranges from 1 to 7. Reliability and validity have been proven in an older population (Rockwood et al, 2005).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Height and Weight and BMI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Height will be measured from ulna length (BAPEN, 2004), weight will be measured using body composition scales, and body mass index (BMI) calculated using these measures.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Skeletal muscle mass</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Skeletal muscle mass will be calculated using a validated equation based on measured bioimpedance from the body composition scales (Janssen J Appl Phil 2000).</description>
