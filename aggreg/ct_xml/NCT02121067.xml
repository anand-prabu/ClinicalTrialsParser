  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of postpartum women interested in having the Mirena® LNG-IUS placed for
      contraception. The Mirena® is an FDA approved intrauterine contraceptive device that
      provides contraception for 5 years with excellent effectiveness. Women enrolled in this
      study will only have the Mirena® placed. This is a randomized trial. The control group will
      receive the standard of care and have the Mirena placed at 6-7 weeks postpartum in the
      standard fashion. Six to seven weeks is the current standard of care at our institution. The
      treatment group will have the Mirena placed at 2-3 weeks postpartum in the standard fashion.
      For the new treatment group, we will be using the Mirena in an off-label manner.  However,
      the main risk of placement in this off-label time period is increased expulsion, which is
      when the device does not remain in the uterus
