As a\n      result, even though the signs and symptoms of MPS II typically appear early in childhood,\n      the diagnosis may lag behind by several years.\n\n      The primary objective of this international multi-center study is to evaluate the positive\n      screening rate of MPS II subjects by screening a high-risk male pediatric population who\n      have had or are scheduled for 1 or more specific ENT surgical procedures (adenoidectomy\n      and/or tonsillectomy and/or tympanostomy) and who have a previously repaired or present\n      evidence of an inguinal and/or umbilical hernia."
