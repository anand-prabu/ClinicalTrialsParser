            "textblock": "The goal of this MEEI Auditory Brainstem Implant (ABI) research study is to find new ways to\n      improve hearing in patients who are deaf and cannot receive a cochlear implant.  The ABI is\n      a surgically placed bionic implant that converts sounds into electrical signals that are\n      directly transmitted to the cochlear nucleus, the first auditory center of the brain.  For\n      many years, ABIs have improved the hearing of patients who are deaf due to brain tumors\n      associated with a genetic syndrome called Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2).  However, a number\n      of recent studies suggest that deaf patients who do not have NF2 and are not eligible for a\n      cochlear implant may also benefit from placement of an ABI.  These preliminary studies\n      suggest that these non-NF2 or \"nontumor\" patients may actually have better outcomes after\n      ABI surgery than patients suffering from NF2.  Patients who do not have NF2 and are deaf due\n      to damage to the hearing nerves or inner ears from infection, disease or injury are not\n      cochlear implant candidates and there are no other options to improve hearing in these cases\n      except for the ABI. Thus, the purpose of our study is to carefully analyze whether ABI\n      surgery improves the hearing and quality of life of non-NF2 patients based on subjective and\n      objective measures of their hearing before and after ABI surgery.  In particular, we plan to\n      study ABI outcomes in non-NF2 patients, characterize the parameters used on their devices,\n      and determine the safety profile of ABIs in these patients."
