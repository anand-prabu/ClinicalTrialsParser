  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, non-randomized, multi-center clinical study of the Venus P-valve for the
      treatment of RVOT stenosis with pulmonary regurgitation after surgery of congenital heart
      defect.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this protocol is to assess the efficacy, safety and performance of Venus P-valve.

      Patients between 18-60 years with RVOT stenosis and moderate to severe pulmonary
      regurgitation (≥3+) who have undergone trans-annular patch repair of their RVOT, cardiac
      magnetic resonance (CMR) screening right ventricular end-diastolic volume index (RVEDVI)
      between 130-160mL/m2.

      Post-procedure follow-ups will be scheduled at 24 hours, 30 days, 6 months and 12 months.
