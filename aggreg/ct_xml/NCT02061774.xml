      The purpose of this project is to study the effects of preoperative followed by scheduled
      intravenous acetaminophen on pain control for 24 hours postoperatively after minimally
      invasive 1 or 2 level transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion.

    <description>Sedation will be measured on a scale of 1 to 5 at 4-hour intervals as follows: 1-completely awake; 2-awake but drowsy; 3 asleep, but responds to verbal commands; 4-asleep but responds to tactile stimuli; and 5-asleep and not responding to any stimuli.</description>

    <description>Routine postoperative vital signs will be collected at 4-hour intervals (+/- 30 minutes) postoperatively respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate. Any reports of headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, pruritis, agitation, constipation, insomnia, bradycardia (Heart rate below 60 beats per minute), hypotension (MAP less than 30% of baseline), or urinary retention will be recorded throughout the study and will be treated appropriately as they occur, and the treatment medication will be stopped if determined to be a causative factor.</description>
