After VATS procedure,\n      intravenous patient controlled analgesia (IV PCA) is being used for pain control.  However,\n      the side effects of IV PCA are nausea, vomiting, sleepiness, and urination difficulty which\n      interrupt the early recovery. It is established that pre-emptive local bupivacaine injection\n      is more economical, has almost no side effects, and finally, it is effective for the\n      postoperative 24 hours. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether pre-emptive local\n      bupivacaine injection is a better alternative pain control modality than the conventional\n      intravenous patient controlled analgesia."
