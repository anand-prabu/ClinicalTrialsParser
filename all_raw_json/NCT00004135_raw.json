Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace\n      immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy used to kill tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy plus peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation in treating patients who have metastatic kidney cancer or melanoma."

Immediately following each daily donor\n      leukapheresis, patients receive allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) IV over 15\n      minutes beginning on day 0 and continuing until the target cells are collected. Patients\n      receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood\n      counts recover.\n\n      If no graft versus host disease has developed within 4 weeks of allogeneic PBSC\n      transplantation, patients with disease progression or recurrence who have residual donor\n      hematopoiesis on chimerism analysis may receive donor T lymphocytes IV over 30 minutes.\n      Patients may receive an additional course of donor T lymphocytes at the investigator's\n      discretion.\n\n      Patients are followed at days 30 and 100, and then every 3 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-38 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5\n      years."
