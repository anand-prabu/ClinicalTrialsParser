  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CLARITY I is a pilot study to identify the clinically appropriate endpoint(s) of a larger,
      statistically powered pivotal trial for treatment of patients with Critical Limb Ischemia
      (CLI).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      50 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to Orbital Atherectomy (OA) performed with Cardiovascular
      Systems, Inc.'s Orbital Atherectomy System (OAS) followed by adjunctive balloon angioplasty
      (BA) vs. BA alone for treatment of tibial vessel disease, defined as ≥ 50 % stenosis of the
      tibial arteries (AT, PT, TPT, and PR) by angiography.  All subjects will have a
      corresponding wound being fed by the target vessel which will be assessed during the study.
      Subjects enrolled in this study may be rolled into the larger pivotal trial, as appropriate.

    <description>MAE's are defined for the study as death, major unplanned amputation (above the ankle) of the index limb, and clinically-driven target vessel revascularization (TLR).  MAE's will be collected through 6 months and 12 months post-treatment with the study devices.</description>

    <description>Maximum balloon inflation pressure (atm) and time at maximum pressure (sec), rate of stenting, and rate of procedural angiographic complications (dissection, perforation, and distal embolization) will be compared between the two study arms.  Angiography will be assessed by an independent Angio Core Lab.</description>

    <description>Technical success is defined for each arm as a final post-procedure result of &lt; 50% residual stenosis by angiography (before stenting, if performed).  Angiography will be assessed by an independent Angio Core Lab.</description>

          -  Subject is currently participating in an investigational drug or other device study
             that can clinically interfere with the endpoints of this trial.

          -  Subject has a known sensitivity to contrast media and the sensitivity cannot be
             adequately pre-medicated.

          -  Uncontrolled allergy to nitinol, stainless steel, or other stent materials.

          -  Subject has known allergy to atherectomy lubricant components such as soybean oil,
