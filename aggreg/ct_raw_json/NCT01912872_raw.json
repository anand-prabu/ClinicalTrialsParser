If a patient complies with all inclusion and exclusion criteria and has been\n      receiving the according-to-age run-in proposed doses during the last month, the patient may\n      continue to the stable-steroid phase.\n\n      During the 16-week stable-steroid phase, adult and pediatric eligible patients will be\n      randomized to one of the two treatment groups.\n\n      During the 8-week steroid-reduction phase, adult and pediatric patients will reduce 25% of\n      the budesonide baseline dose every 2 weeks, depending of the asthma control, until reaching\n      a 100% reduction of the baseline dose.
