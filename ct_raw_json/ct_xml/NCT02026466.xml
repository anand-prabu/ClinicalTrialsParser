  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational registry, sponsored by Saint Luke's Hospital.  This study is to be
      conducted according to DHHS Guidelines, applicable state regulations, and local IRB policies
      and procedures.  The overall objective is to address current gaps in knowledge regarding
      CTO-PCI, as a prospective, multi-center, single-arm study of 1,000 participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  1,000 participants will be enrolled into the OPEN CTO study.

        -  Study coordinators will screen both men and women over the age of 18 who are admitted
           for an elective CTO-PCI procedure.

        -  Study coordinators will be trained by the Coordinating Center at Saint Luke's Hospital
           of Kansas City.

        -  Participants will be screened for Eligibility, and Informed Consent will be obtained.

        -  Participants will also be asked to sign a Medical Records Release form, and a Billing
           Records Release form.

        -  Detailed procedural data will be obtained by the Study Coordinator and local Principal
           Investigator.

        -  Participants will undergo a Baseline interview.

        -  These data will be entered into the electronic data capture system, Velos, which has
           stringent protections and quality controls.

        -  Participants will have telephone follow-up interviews conducted by the centralized
           Follow-up Center at Saint Luke's Hospital.
