  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides detailed insights into heart
      function and injury. The nature and significance of heart injury after a heart attack is
      incompletely understood. We propose a 'natural history' study of heart attack injury using
      contemporary MRI methods. In a large hospital in the West of Scotland, heart attack patients
      will be invited to have at least two MRI scans and also continue with life-long follow-up.
      The results from the MRI scans will be assessed with all of the other clinical information
      obtained at the time of the heart attack and during follow-up. The results of our study
      should provide new insights into heart attack injury and these results should help improve
      how heart attack patients should be treated.

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides detailed insights into soft tissue characteristics
      and this technique has particular value for imaging patients with acute myocardial
      infarction (MI).  Recent advances in MRI have the potential to reveal new insights into the
      evolution and functional significance of myocardial injury and repair.

      Here, we will study at least 300 consecutive patients with acute ST elevation MI (STEMI) and
      focus on oedema, scar and bleeding in the heart using MRI in patients managed by emergency
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Cardiac MRI scans will be performed at 1.5 Tesla
      (MAGNETOM, Siemens Healthcare). MRI will be used to assess initial heart function and
      injury. Novel MRI methods will also be used to quantify the extent of myocardial jeopardy
      representing the initial area-at-risk (AAR), and the nature of this injury (strain,
      haemorrhage). The MRI methods will include T1 and T2 relaxometry (mapping). Secondly, we
      will assess coronary artery disease severity by angiography and coronary artery function at
      the time of the heart attack treatment using a pressure-sensitive coronary guidewire (St
      Jude Medical). This wire can be used instead of the usual coronary wire and can provide
      information on heart injury, which can be linked in turn to the MRI findings. All of this
      information will be linked with health outcomes in the longer term.

      We hypothesise that myocardial salvage, oedema, haemorrhage, and strain as revealed by MRI,
      have functional and prognostic significance. In all patients MRI will be performed at
      baseline (~day 2) and again at 6 months. In a subgroup of 30 patients, MRI will be performed
      on days &lt;12 hours, and days 2, 7-10 days and 6 months post-MI. A blood and urine sample and
      quality of life will be obtained at baseline and at 6 months post-MI. Clinical outcomes
      (e.g. rehospitalisation, death) will be assessed at 1 year and again up to 20 years by
      electronic linkage through central National Health Service (NHS) and government health
      records in order to determine the long-term prognostic significance of our initial
      observations with angiography, MRI and the pressure wire.

The initial area-at-risk will be assessed retrospectively with MRI ~2 days after initial hospitalisation for STEMI. Area-at-risk will be assessed with T2 and T1 mapping.

    <description>The myocardial T1 relaxation time (ms) pre- and post-contrast will be estimated using a Modified Look-Locker Inversion recovery method (MOLLI, Siemens Healthcare).

    <description>The index of microvascular resistance (IMR) is a guidewire-derived measurement of coronary microvascular function. IMR = mean distal coronary pressure x mean transit time, measured during systemic hyperaemia induced by intravenous adenosine (140 ug/kg/min).

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Patient-reported quality of life and health status will be assessed at baseline and during follow-up at 6 months. The Euroquol EQ-5D questionnaire will be used. Health-related quality of life will be related to other clinical information, including the MRI findings, and for estimation of quality-adjusted life years which is relevant for health economic assessments.</description>

    <measure>Recurrent myocardial infarction</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The clinical characteristics that might predict recurrent cardiac events in survivors of STEMI are uncertain. The risk of recurrent MI is clinically relevant since this risk is potentially modifiable by additional PCI, as observed in the Preventative Angioplasty in Acute Myocardial Infarction (PRAMI) trial (N Engl J Med 2013 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1305520).
The clinical predictors of recurrent MI, as revealed by contrast MRI at 6 months and recurrent adverse cardiac events during the longer term will be assessed. Recurrent MI may be fatal or non-fatal. The characteristics to be assessed at baseline will include clinical characteristics (e.g. age, diabetes), coronary artery disease characteristics (as revealed by quantitative coronary analysis and plaque characterisation), guidewire-derived parameters of coronary artery function, and MI characteristics as revealed by contrast-enhanced MRI.</description>

    <description>The response to intravenous adenosine as reflected by patient-reported symptoms and changes in heart rate and blood pressure will be prospectively assessed. Adverse events, such as abnormalities in heart rate and rhythm and bronchospasm, that might be associated with the adenosine infusion will also be recorded.</description>
