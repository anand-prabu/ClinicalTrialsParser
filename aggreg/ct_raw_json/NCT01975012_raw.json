Study participants will be\n      assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts based on age. Cohort 1 will include children at least 6 years of\n      age to less than 12 years of age. Cohort 2 will include children at least 2 years of age to\n      less than 6 years of age. Each cohort will consist of two stages: Stage 1 and Stage 2. Stage\n      1 will be the initial dose finding stage. Participants will begin treatment with daily RPV\n      and 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). The 2 NRTIs will be selected by\n      the site investigator but will not be provided through the study. This stage of the study\n      will involve intense pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and\n      antiviral activity of RPV, which will allow for the selection of an RPV dose to use in Stage\n      2 of the study. Participants in both cohorts will remain on RPV-based therapy for up to 48\n      weeks.\n\n      Study enrollment will begin with Cohort 1. Once data from Cohort 1 has been reviewed and an\n      RPV dose has been approved, enrollment for Cohort 2 will begin.\n\n      Study participation will include at least 12 study visits over 48 weeks. Participants who\n      complete 48 weeks of RPV treatment and are benefiting from the drug will continue on the\n      study and receive RPV as part of a long-term safety follow-up for a minimum of 4 additional\n      years. Study visits in this stage of the study will occur every 24 weeks.\n\n      At most visits, participants will give a medical history and undergo a physical exam, blood\n      collection, and urine collection. At some visits, participants will also undergo an\n      electrocardiogram (ECG), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test (consisting of\n      blood collection and an injection of ACTH), and determination of the participant's stage of\n      sexual development."
