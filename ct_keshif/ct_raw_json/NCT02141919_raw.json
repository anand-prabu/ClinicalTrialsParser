The current study will also implement fractionated stereotactic\n      radiosurgery to treat a unilateral kidney tumor. Fractionated radiotherapy is advocated to\n      further reduce the potential toxicity arising from a large single fraction regimen. In fact,\n      fractionated radiotherapy has been the standard treatment for many tumors in variety of\n      locations to reduce the toxicity associated with radiotherapy. A fractionated stereotactic\n      regimen has the potential to reduce the normal tissue toxicity that often accompanies\n      radiotherapy.\n\n      Successful implementation of stereotactic radiosurgery of renal tumors may become an\n      effective and the least invasive treatment modality. This study will refine the current\n      understanding of the image guided conformal therapy to the kidney using stereotactic body\n      radiotherapy."

            "textblock": "Based on the published retrospective and the two prospective phase I trials, the dose\n      fractionations evaluated in this trial is 8Gy x5, 10Gy x 4 and 12 Gy x 3.  In a\n      retrospective study published paper by Wers\u00e4ll, et al, from the Karolinska Hospital, 50\n      patients with kidney cancer, both primary and metastatic, were retrospectively analyzed\n      [50].  High rates of local control were achieved with doses ranging from 25 Gy to 45 Gy.\n      The most common doses used were 40 Gy in 5 fractions and 45 Gy in 3 fractions.  Another\n      retrospective study used the dose dose of 40Gy in 5 fractions and both studies reported\n      excellent control rate [45]. Therefore 8Gy x 5 is evaluated in this study. The 4 and 3\n      fraction equivalent doses to this dose levels are 10Gy and 12 Gy respectively, which are the\n      two other dose levels included in this trial. Justification of the three fraction dose\n      equivalent of 12Gy x 3 comes from the phase I study that did not see any failures at this\n      level.\n\n      The study population for this trial is patients with biopsy proven primary RCC that are\n      candidates for active surveillance (AS). Keeping patient safety in perspective, it is\n      reasonable to offer an experimental treatment such as this to a patient population that\n      would have otherwise been put in AS. At any sign of progression, the patients that have\n      undergone SABR in this trial will be offered the standard of care (SOC) of radical\n      nephrectomy, partial nephrectomy or ablation as deemed appropriate by the treating\n      urologist\u2014which is same as what would have been offered to them had they been in AS. The AUA\n      defines AS patients to be those with small renal mass (SRM) with <3cm tumors. The NCCN\n      recommends AS for patients with T1a tumors or tumors <4 cm. A number of retrospective and\n      one prospective study reported on the natural history of SRMs. A meta-analysis reviewed\n      multiple retrospective studies and reported an average growth rate of 0.28 cm/year for these\n      tumors [51]. They further reported a growth of 0.4 cm/year in the subset of patients that\n      had biopsy confirmed RCC. Keeping clinical application in perspective, it is logical to use\n      SABR only to tumors that are growing, since one third of the SRMs do not grow. Therefore,\n      patients showing growth >4mm in two scans will be enrolled and treated with SABR in this\n      trial. The primary endpoint in this trial is local control and the hypothesis tested is that\n      SABR to the SRMs will lead to an elimination of tumor growth. The local control will be\n      defined using MRI or contrast CT and <4mm increase in single scan or <2.0mm increase in two\n      different scans in the setting of an absence of radiographic  indication of tumor viability\n      will constitute local control [56]. Kidney function will be monitored closely to evaluate\n      radiation induced kidney toxicity."
