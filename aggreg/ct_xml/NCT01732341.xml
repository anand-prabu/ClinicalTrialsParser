      This study will test compare the Stentys Stent with the Multi-Link Vision™ stent system
      (Abbott Vascular Inc.)in patients with a heart attack. It is expected that the Stentys stent
      is not worse than the Vision stent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease continues to be the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in
      the occidental world. Treatment of coronary atherosclerotic disease has been significantly
      advanced by interventional cardiology, and in particular the advent of coronary arterial
      stents.  In comparison to angioplasty alone, stents have reduced the incidence of
      angiographic as well as clinical restenosis, the recurrence of angina, the need for coronary
      arterial bypass graft (CABG) surgery, the need for repeat revascularization and the
      occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE).However,problems remain due to failure to
      achieve optimal stent apposition and normal myocardial reperfusion. Early stent
      malapposition may be due to incomplete expansion or undersizing of balloon-expandable
      stents. Several studies have emphasized the importance of early malapposition in the setting
      of ST elevation MI, in which substantial thrombotic burden and the presence of diffuse
      vasoconstriction may be contributory. The Stentys Coronary Stent System includes a
      self-expanding bare metal (nitinol) stent on a rapid exchange (RX) delivery system.  In view
      of the theoretical implications of malapposition, the self-expanding property may offer a
      potential benefit.

      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Stentys Coronary
      Stent System in the treatment of de novo stenotic lesions in coronary arteries in patients
      undergoing primary revascularization due to AMI as compared to the Multi-Link Vision™
      coronary stent system (Abbott Vascular Inc. The study is powered for non-inferiority of the
      Stentys Coronary Stent System compared to the Vision Stent System.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        General Inclusion Criteria

          1. Subject ≥ 18 years old.

          2. Subject experiencing clinical symptoms consistent with AMI of &gt;30 min. in duration.

          3. ST elevation ≥1 mm in ≥2 contiguous leads or new left bundle branch block, or true
             posterior MI with ST depression of ≥1 mm in ≥2 contiguous anterior leads.

          4. Symptom duration is &lt;12 hours prior to signing informed consent.

          5. Subject should be in catheterization laboratory and procedure started within 2 hours
             of consent.

          6. Patient provides written informed consent.

          7. Patient agrees to all required follow-up procedures and visits.

        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria

          1. Based on coronary anatomy, PCI is indicated for the culprit lesion with anticipated
             use of stenting.

          2. The vessel diameter is either known or expected to be 2.5-4.0mm, without excessive
             tortuosity or diffuse distal disease.

          3. Lesion length ≥12mm and ≤ 23mm
