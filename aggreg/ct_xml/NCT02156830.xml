  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project consists of qualitative interviews with all the members of the obesity team
      (endocrinologist, bariatric surgeon, dietician, psychologist,..) in different Flemish
      hospitals. These interviews have the aim to gain insight into the current practice about
      counseling patients with bariatric surgery, with a focus on medication counseling. This will
      make it possible to assess the strengths and weaknesses in the current practice of obese
      patients who will undergo and have undergone bariatric surgery.

      do a benchmarking and also qualitative analyses of the interviews using Nvivo 10.
