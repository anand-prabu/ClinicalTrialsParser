The level of HBV DNA varies according to HBe status and\n      geographical origin, and is strongly predictive of the risk of HBV mother-to-child\n      transmission (MTCT). The rate of vertical transmission (Yuan J et al. J Viral Hepatitis\n      2006) was 0% in newborns to mothers with HBV DNA less than 100,000 copies/mL and up to more\n      than 40% in newborns to mothers with HBV DNA above 8 Log10 copies/mL, despite\n      serovaccination at birth, thus justifying the use of tenofovir DF during the last trimester\n      of pregnancy in highly viraemic pregnant women, as mentionned in EASL 2012 Guidelines. Data\n      are needed concerning the results of this strategy in western countries, justifying this\n      prospective study."
