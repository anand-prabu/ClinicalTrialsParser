      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the general anesthesia immunosuppressive
      could effect hepatitis B Virus replication

    <textblock>
      The change of immune state can influence HBV replication or elimination, it has been
      reported that a certain degree of immunosuppression occured after general anesthesia. In
      this study we detect the cytotoxic T lymphocyte(CTL) count and activity, interferon-γ(IFN-γ)
      and HBV-DNA content form the HBV patient who will accept general anesthesia. Our purpose is
      to evaluate the influence of general anesthesia immunosuppressive on HBV replication. If the
      results show that HBV-DNA quantity increases, so the patients might be given anti-HBV drugs
      or immune enhancer; otherwise it is indicated the general anesthesia immunosuppressive don't
      influence HBV replication.
