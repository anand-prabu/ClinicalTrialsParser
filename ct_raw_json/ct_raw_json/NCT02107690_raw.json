Each participant will receive three injections subcutaneously on the abdomen\n      with different temperatures. After each injection, participants will be asked to evaluate\n      the pain on a Visual analog scale (0-100 mm). It is anticipated that the pain decreases with\n      increasing temperature. The aim of the study is to find a simple method for pain reduction\n      that can be used in clinical practice."
