  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare meniscal healing with or without platelet rich plasma.  The
      assessments will include validated, disease specific, patient oriented outcome measures, MRI
      arthrogram (MRA).  Results of this study will help ascertain whether PRP improves meniscal
      healing rates.

      Null Hypothesis:  There is no difference in meniscal healing with or without the use of PRP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The integrity of the meniscus is pivotal to the distribution of joint reaction forces and
      shock absorption across the knee and meniscal damage can lead to secondary degenerative
      joint disease.  This has lead to treatments directed towards repairing and preserving the
      meniscus to alter the progression of joint degeneration.  Although success rates of meniscal
      repair are greater when performed in association with anterior cruciate reconstruction,
      healing rates remain in the 70-80% range for isolated repairs.

      Therefore, techniques such as the use of fibrin clots, trephining and rasping of the
      tissues, have been incorporated to improve healing results of meniscal repair.  There has
      been a surge of enthusiasm for the use of Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) to improve healing
      rates of soft tissue injuries. Therefore, it may be reasonable to surmise that applying
      blood products, such as thrombin and platelet rich plasma, to the meniscal repair bed may
      induce more complete and possibly faster healing.

    <description>The WOMET is a disease-specific validated tool designed to evaluate HRQOL (Health Related Quality of Life) in patients with meniscal pathology (meniscal tears or in patients who have undergone meniscal repair or resection). In this subset of patients with meniscal pathology, the WOMET has been found to be reliable, valid and responsive.
The WOMET has 16 items including the domains of physical symptoms, sports/recreation/work/lifestyle, and emotions.  It demonstrated adequate content and construct validity when compared with other measures.  Test-retest reliability was assessed and was found to be high, with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.833.</description>

    <description>If a second look arthroscopy is performed, the status of the meniscus (healed or not healed) will be compared to the MRA findings.  Second look arthroscopy will be performed on subjects with clinical indication of a failed meniscal repair.  Clinical indications of failed meniscus repair include persistent pain and symptoms or MRA positive for a meniscus repair.</description>
