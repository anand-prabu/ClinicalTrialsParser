          -  Subject has ongoing androgen deprivation therapy with a Gonadotropin-releasing
             hormone (GnRH) analogue (agonist or antagonist) or bilateral orchiectomy (i.e.,

          -  Subject has disease progression by at least one of the following:

               1. Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) progression defined by a minimum of 2 rising PSA
                  levels with an interval of at least 1 week between each draw;

                  guidelines (at least 2 new lesions) on bone scan; or

          -  For subjects who have not had an orchiectomy, there must be a plan to maintain
             effective GnRH-analogue therapy for the duration of the study.

          -  Subject must have failed at least one course of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT),

          -  Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2.

          -  Subject has been evaluated by a local neurologist prior to study entry who has
             determined the subject has at least one risk factor for seizure including:

               1. past history of seizure due to any cause except a single febrile seizure in
                  childhood. Patients with a history of seizures should not have had a seizure
                  within 12 months of Screening and must have had no anticonvulsants for 12 months
                  prior to Screening,

               2. history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack (TIA),

               3. history of traumatic brain or head injury with loss of consciousness

               4. unexplained loss of consciousness within the last 12 months,

               5. presence of a space occupying lesion in the brain including previously treated
                  brain metastasis(es) or primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor,

               6. history of arteriovenous malformations of the brain,

               7. history of brain infection (i.e., abscess, meningitis, or encephalitis),

               8. current use of medication that may lower seizure threshold

               9. presence of Alzheimer's disease, meningioma, leptomeningeal disease from
                  prostate cancer.

          -  Subject is able to swallow the study drug and comply with study requirements.

          -  Subject agrees not to participate in another interventional study while on treatment.

          -  Male subject and his female partner who is of childbearing potential must use two
             acceptable methods of birth control (one of which must include a condom as a barrier
             method of contraception) starting at Screening and continuing throughout the study
             period and for 3 months after final study drug administration.

             1. Two acceptable forms of birth control include:

               1. Condom (barrier method of contraception), AND

               2. One of the following acceptable forms of contraception is required:

                    1. Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of
                       contraception.

                    2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).

                    3. Barrier methods of contraception: Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository).

                    4. Vasectomy or surgical castration at least 6 months prior to Screening.

          -  Male subject must use a condom, if having sex with a pregnant woman.

             period and for at least 3 months after final drug administration.

             100,000/µL) or hemoglobin is &lt; 5.6 millimoles(mmol)/liter (L) (9 grams (g)/deciliter

          -  Subject's total bilirubin is ≥ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (except for subjects
             with documented Gilbert's disease) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST) is ≥ 2.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) at Screening.

          -  Subject's estimated creatinine clearance (Cer)  is less than 30 milliliter
             (mL)/minute (min) by the Cockcroft and Gault formula (Creatinine Clearance  (mL/min)
             = (140 - age)(weight (wt) kilogram (kg) / 72 x serum creatinine (milligram (mg)/100
             mL) [Cockroft, 1976] at Screening.

          -  Subject has uncontrolled hypertension as indicated by a resting systolic blood
             pressure &gt; 160 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100
             millimeter of mercury (mmHg) at Screening.

          -  Subject has received an investigational agent within 4 weeks or 5 half lives
             whichever is longer prior to Day 1.

          -  Subject has shown a hypersensitivity reaction to the active pharmaceutical ingredient
