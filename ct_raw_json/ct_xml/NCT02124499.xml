  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective association study to analyse perioperative patients' outcome. Outcome comprises
      intraoperative and postoperative complications e.g. cardio-vascular events, allergic
      reactions, postoperative side-effects like nausea and vomiting, impaired wound healing,
      increased or decreased drug effects, severe pain, long-lasting pain as well as long-term
      outcome.

      Possible variables which might have on influence: patient- and surgery-related data,
      patients' genetic background etc.

      Background

      Anesthesia and surgery are related to unwanted adverse events, side effects and
      postoperative discomfort. Whereas severe complications like cardiovascular events are rare,
      postoperative side effects like nausea and vomiting, pain, long-lasting pain and
      pain-related interference of daily activities are frequent. The question arises which
      patient is at specific risk for these sequelae. Pre-existing predisposing factors (e.g.
      patients' genetic background), surgery- and anesthesia-related variables (drugs, techniques
      administered for anesthesia and analgesia) as well as psychological and social factors might
      influence the outcome.

      In this prospective association study these variables will be investigated in a
      well-described patient cohort presenting for scheduled surgery.

      Objective

      The aim of this study is to associate perioperative and postoperative complications and side
      effects as well as long-term outcome after surgery to patient- and surgery-related
      variables, including genetic variants.
