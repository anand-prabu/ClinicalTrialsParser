             of

             Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation:

             eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 175 x (Scr, std)-1.154 x (Age)-0.203 x (0.742 if female) x
             (1.212 if African American).

          4. Has a body mass index (BMI) of 25.0 to 40.0 kg/m2 (inclusive) at Screening.

                  Visit 1 (Screening) (not applicable to hysterectomized females)

               -  Surgically sterile, postmenopausal, or if of childbearing potential, must
                  practice and be willing to continue to practice appropriate birth control
                  (defined as a method which results in a low failure rate of less than 1% per
                  year when used consistently and correctly such as implants, injectables, oral
                  contraceptives, intrauterine contraceptive devices [IUDs], sexual abstinence,
                  tubal ligation, condom with spermicide, or a vasectomized partner) during the
                  entire duration of the study

             the investigator.

          7. Ability to understand and willingness to adhere to protocol requirements.

          8. If on chronic thyroid pharmacologic therapy, the dose must be stable for at least 3
             months prior to Visit 1 (Screening), and must have thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
             test result in normal range at Visit 1 (Screening).
