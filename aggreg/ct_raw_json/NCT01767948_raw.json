The study\n      mainly consists of 3 phases: screening phase (within 21 days prior to the first dose of\n      study medication), treatment phase, and a follow up phase (10 to 12 days after the last dose\n      of study medication). In the treatment phase, participants will receive single oral dose of\n      PCI-32765 on Day 1. Liver impairment will be classified according to the Child-Pugh\n      Classification of Severity of Liver Disease, as: normal, mild, moderate, and severe. Total\n      30 participants (24 with hepatic impairment [6 mild, 9 moderate and 9 severe] at baseline\n      and 6 in the control group according to Child-Pugh criteria) will be enrolled. Participants\n      in the control group will be enrolled after the participants with mild or moderate hepatic\n      impairment have completed the study. Safety evaluations for adverse events, clinical\n      laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination will be monitored\n      throughout the study. The total duration of study for each participant will be approximately\n      for 29 to 33 days."
