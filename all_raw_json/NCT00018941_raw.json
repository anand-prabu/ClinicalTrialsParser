Determine the response rate and overall survival of patients with metastatic\n      renal cell carcinoma treated with either low-dose or high-dose intravenous interleukin-2\n      (IL-2) or subcutaneous IL-2. II. Compare the toxic effects of these 3 regimens in this\n      patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to presence of renal\n      tumor (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms. Arm I: Patients\n      receive low dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV every 8 hours for up to 15 doses. Treatment repeats\n      in 7-10 days for one complete course. Arm II: Patients receive high dose IL-2 IV every 8\n      hours for up to 15 doses. Treatment repeats in 7-10 days for one complete course. Arm III:\n      Patients receive IL-2 subcutaneously daily 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Treatment continues in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or\n      responding disease receive an additional complete course of therapy.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients will be accrued for this study."
