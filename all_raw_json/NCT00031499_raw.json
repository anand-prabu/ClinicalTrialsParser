Approximately 600 healthy adults, who are HIV-negative, ages 18 to 55\n      years of age, with primary, secondary or early latent syphilis, will participate in this\n      research study. Volunteers will be enrolled in 5 U.S. cities and in Madagascar. Participants\n      will be chosen randomly (by chance) to receive 1 of 2 study drugs: benzathine penicillin\n      given (2 shots in the buttocks) or 4 tablets of azithromycin. Subjects who report a history\n      of a penicillin allergy will be given either 2.0 g of oral azithromycin or 100 mg\n      doxycycline taken orally, twice a day for 14 days. Over 2 years, 10 visits will be required.\n      Procedures will include blood samples, physical exams, and swabs of sores."

            "textblock": "Syphilis is a disease with a worldwide distribution. It causes genital ulceration, thereby\n      amplifying risk for HIV acquisition and transmission and it may cause congenital infection,\n      spontaneous abortion, and stillbirth if untreated in pregnant women. About one third of all\n      cases, if untreated, result in late sequelae which include neurosyphilis, gumma formation\n      and cardiovascular involvement. This study will be a multi-center, randomized, open-label\n      trial to evaluate the efficacy of azithromycin in treating primary, secondary and early\n      latent syphilis in HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) uninfected volunteers. Up through\n      version 6.0 of this protocol volunteers were only followed for 12 months. The protocol was\n      amended starting with version 7.0 to include follow-up visits at month 18 and 24 in order to\n      capture possible \"late failures.\" Each subject will be randomized into a treatment group. If\n      the subject does not have a self-reported history of penicillin allergy, the subject will be\n      randomized to receive either a single 2.0 gram dose of azithromycin administered orally, or\n      2.4 million units of benzathine penicillin G administered intramuscularly once. Eligible\n      patients who report a history of penicillin allergy will be randomized (using a separate\n      randomization schedule) to receive either a single dose of azithromycin or doxycycline, 100\n      milligrams, taken orally, twice a day for 14 days. Block randomization will be used within\n      each clinical center with subjects allocated in equal numbers to either standard therapy or\n      azithromycin. Participants found to be ineligible for study participation after they have\n      been randomized and treated, will be treated again with benzathine penicillin G (or\n      doxycycline if they are allergic to penicillin) and will continue follow-up for safety\n      evaluation. The treatment assignments will not be blinded. No attempt will be made to\n      recruit a sufficient sample size among penicillin allergic subjects to attain the desired\n      power for the primary outcome. Therefore these results will be seen as preliminary to a\n      possible future trial and as confirmatory to the primary comparison. Although the study\n      endpoint will be determined at 6 months, all participants, will have follow-up visits for 2\n      full years. At the end of the 6 month evaluation period, all participants will have been\n      classified in one of the following groups: cure; clinical response/serological nonresponse;\n      or failure."
