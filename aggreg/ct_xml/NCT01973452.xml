  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the drug, Dexmedetomidine (also known as Precedex),
      can reduce pain for patients having Thoracic Surgery and therefore reduce the amount of
      opioid drug needed after surgery. It is a drug that is already approved by the FDA (Food &amp;
      Drug Administration) for use as a sedative in hospitals and is currently used in the
      investigators Intensive Care Unit for this purpose. The investigators want to investigate if
      it also has pain relieving properties.
