We will build on existing cohorts and enrich enrollment\n      for individuals over the age of 50 while adjusting for important co-variates such as ART,\n      smoking history, co-infections, and illicit drug use. Evaluations will be scheduled at\n      baseline, 18 months, and 36 months.  Study visits will consist of blood draw,\n      questionnaires, and pulmonary function testing."
