  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of a Phase1b lead-in portion to determine the MTD of OMP-59R5 in
      combination with EP for 6 cycles followed a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized,
      placebo-controlled portion comparing the efficacy and safety of OMP-59R5 in combination with
      EP for 6 cycles followed by single agent OMP-59R5 relative to EP alone for 6 cycles in
      subjects receiving first-line therapy for extensive stage small cell lung cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for the study:

          1. Histologically or cytologically documented extensive stage small cell lung cancer.

          2. Adults of 18 years of age or older.

          3. Performance Status (ECOG) of 0 or 1.

          4. FFPE tumor tissue.

          5. Adequate organ function:

               1. Adequate hematologic function (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] ≥ 1,500 cells/μL;
                  hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL, platelets ≥ 100,000/μL).

               2. Adequate renal function (serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL or calculated creatinine
                  clearance ≥ 60 mL/min using Cockcroft-Gault formula).

               3. Adequate hepatic function (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] ≤ 3 x upper limit of
                  normal [ULN], ALT may be ≤ 5 x ULN if due to liver metastases but cannot be

                  the Sponsor's Medical Monitor).

                  activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤1.5 × ULN.

          6. Written consent on an IRB/IEC-approved Informed Consent Form prior to any
             study-specific evaluation.

             use of physician-approved method of birth control from 30 days prior to the first
             study drug administration to 30 days following the last study drug administration or
             the last EP in the study, whichever is discontinued last.

          8. Male subjects must be surgically sterile or must agree to use physician-approved
             contraception during the study and for 30 days following the last study drug

             extensive stage small cell lung cancer.

             ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure unstable angina
             pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled arterial thrombosis,
             symptomatic pulmonary embolism, and psychiatric illness that would limit compliance
             with study requirement.

             angina), coronary angioplasty and/or stenting within 6 months prior to the first
             administration of study drug.

          5. A history of malignancy with the exception of:

               1. Adequately treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or
                  in situ cervical cancer

               2. Adequately treated stage I cancer from which the subject is currently in
                  remission, or

               3. Any other cancer from which the subject has been disease-free for ≥ 3 years

          6. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

          7. Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
