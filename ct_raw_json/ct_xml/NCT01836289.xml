      This research is being done to see if people with Crohn's disease who receive high-dose
      cyclophosphamide have an improvement of their disease, how long the benefit may last, and
      how safe cyclophosphamide is.  This study is for patient with medically refractory disease
      that is not easily amenable to surgery.

      Cyclophosphamide is an FDA-approved chemotherapy medication that is also frequently used to
      treat autoimmune illness; use of cyclophosphamide for autoimmune disease is not approved by
      the FDA.  An autoimmune illness is when the immune system mistakenly attacks self, targeting
      the cells, tissues, and organs of a person's own body.  There are many different autoimmune
      diseases and they can each affect the body is different ways.  Crohn's disease is an
      autoimmune disease that primarily affects the small and large intestines.  High
      dose-cyclophosphamide has been successfully used to treat Crohn's, primarily as part of a
      conditioning regimen for autologous stem cell transplantation.  However, this therapy is
      limited in Crohn's because of it's serious infectious risks.  This current study involves
      using high-dose cyclophosphamide without need for stem cell transplantation.  This appears
      to be a safer approach in other autoimmune illnesses that have been studied.
