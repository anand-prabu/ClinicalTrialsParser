Breast radiation is usually done with women lying on their back\n      (\"supine\").  Some women develop temporary breakdown of the skin (moist desquamation).  This\n      skin reaction can be painful and has been linked to long term side effects such as chronic\n      pain and decreased quality of life.\n\n      This study is being done because women with large breasts have higher rates of skin\n      breakdown (called 'moist desquamation') and breast pain during and shortly after radiation\n      therapy is complete.  It is unclear if such skin reactions and pain would be improved by\n      alternating treatment position - namely lying on your belly (\"prone\") during their radiation\n      treatment."
