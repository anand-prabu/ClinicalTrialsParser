The exercise training will follow the public health\n      recommendations for exercise (150 minutes/week of moderate exercise). The group increasing\n      physical activity along with exercise training will be asked to increase physical activity\n      in their daily life (up to 3,000 step/day above their current levels through the use of step\n      counters), and meetings focused on behavior modification. The investigators hypothesize that\n      combining aerobic training and additional physical activity after training will have the\n      most profound reduction on waist circumference and body composition."

The investigators will\n      randomize sedentary (<6,500 steps per day) obese adults with at least one additional\n      cardiovascular risk factor (N= 45) to a: (1) structured aerobic exercise program with no\n      intervention on Non-Ex PA (AERO group, N=15); (2) structured aerobic exercise program with\n      the additional goal of increasing Non-EX PA (AERO-PA group, N=15), or (3) a non-exercise\n      control group (CON, N=15) for 6 months. Exercise groups will participate in the same aerobic\n      training program (50 to 75% VO2 max), designed to be consistent with public health\n      recommendations of 150 minutes per week of moderate physical activity. Non-Ex PA in the AERO\n      group will be tracked throughout the entire 6 month intervention with pedometers capable of\n      counting steps, but not displaying them to the participant (blind mode capable). The AERO-PA\n      group will progressively increase Non-Ex PA throughout intervention using pedometers (a\n      progressive increase of 1,000 to 3,000 steps per day above baseline levels). The AERO-PA\n      group will also participate in lifestyle counseling grounded in the principles of the\n      behavioral change theories to determine/reinforce strategies to increase Non-Ex PA. The\n      primary outcome measure will be change in waist circumference following the intervention.\n      The results of this pilot study will be used to determine the efficacy/feasibility of the\n      intervention, and power a larger trial as an R01 application."
