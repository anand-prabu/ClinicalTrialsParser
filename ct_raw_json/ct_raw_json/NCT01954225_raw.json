The track was directed upward in the anal canal without any tributary. Length of\n      the tract was 3cm, suggestive of low anal fistula.\n\n      Then Udumbara Sutra was tied covering the entire underlying track for cutting and healing\n      under all aseptic precaution. The patient was discharged on the next day of procedure. The\n      Udumbara Sutra was changed skilfully by weekly. To promote healing and to reduce pain and\n      inflammation oral antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medicine were also prescribed.\n\n      The total period of Udumbara Sutra treatment was 1,1/2 month.
