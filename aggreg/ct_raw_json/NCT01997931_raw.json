Patients with BIS have fewer ventilation days than those receiving standard sedation\n           management.\n\n        2. Level of sedation administered will differ according to the critical care experience\n           and qualification of the nurse."

            "textblock": "Patients in intensive care units (ICUs) frequently require sedatives and analgesics as part\n      of therapy.  Assessing the appropriate dose of sedative and analgesic drugs can be difficult\n      due to the severity of the patient's illness, inability of the patient to communicate,\n      multiple procedures and transports for investigations and the subjectivity of clinical\n      sedation assessment tools.  Poorly assessed and managed levels of sedation can result in\n      over sedation, extended ventilation time and a potentially extended ICU stay.\n\n      The BIS monitor is derived from the electroencephalogram and provides a numeric value that\n      represents a measure of cerebral activity.  Such an objective measure of the patient's level\n      of sedation may provide a useful tool that will enable nurses to titrate sedation more\n      accurately in an attempt to provide the optimal level of sedation for all ICU patients.\n\n      The study will be conducted in the Intensive Care Unit at the Alfred Hospital.  This study\n      is designed as a prospective randomised control trial with parallel design.  This means that\n      participants' will be randomly allocated into either one of two groups - an intervention or\n      control group.  Participant's randomised to the intervention group will receive BIS\n      monitoring.  The control group will receive standard ICU sedation assessment and management.\n\n      To determine if BIS monitoring is useful in ICU, information will be collected by auditing\n      patient charts and determining the average amounts of sedation medication for each nursing\n      shift.   In addition, the years of critical care experience and critical care qualification\n      will be recorded for each nurse managing patients recruited to the study."
