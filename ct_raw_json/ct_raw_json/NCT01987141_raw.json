This\n      alert will remind providers to counsel patients on the recommendations for gestational\n      weight gain. The control group will receive standard prenatal care, without electronic\n      alerts generated regarding BMI and gestational weight gain.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that a higher percentage of patients who receive the\n      intervention will meet the IOM guidelines for weight gain."
