  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate whether the medication, febuxostat, can improve the
      degree of insulin resistance and other features of the metabolic syndrome (high blood
      pressure, elevated insulin levels, excess body fat around the waist, and/or high
      cholesterol) by lowering uric acid levels in the blood.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The metabolic syndrome (MS) is characterized by a constellation of metabolic features
      including dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, obesity, and insulin resistance. This
      cluster of features is strongly associated with type 2 diabetes, atherosclerotic
      cardiovascular disease, and increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Hyperuricemia
      (elevated serum uric acid) is associated with insulin resistance and features of the MS in
      cross-sectional epidemiological studies. However, it remains unclear whether this
      association is causal or simply coincidental. If hyperuricemia CAUSES insulin resistance,
      then lowering serum uric acid by pharmacological means may result in improved insulin
      sensitivity and reversal of features of the metabolic syndrome.  In some recent small
      studies, lowering serum uric acid with allopurinol was associated with improvement in some
      of the features and/or complications of the MS: Allopurinol use resulted in reduction in
      blood pressure in adolescents and improvement in exercise capacity in patients with chronic
      stable angina. A low urine pH is strongly associated with insulin resistance, and individual
      features of the metabolic syndrome. Similarly, a low fractional excretion of uric acid is
      also associated with metabolic syndrome feature. We therefore would like to examine the
      effect on febuxostat on these two parameters which have been linked with the metabolic
      syndrome.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate whether pharmacological lowering of serum uric acid
      with the medication febuxostat is associated with improvement in the degree of insulin
      resistance and various features of the metabolic syndrome.
