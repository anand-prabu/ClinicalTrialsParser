Patients will be recruited at\n      participating study centers that offer BT as a treatment option to patients with asthma who\n      remain symptomatic despite taking standard of care maintenance medications.\n\n      In addition, patients may be included in the Registry retrospectively provided they sign the\n      informed consent form for the Registry, have undergone BT procedures after January 01, 2013,\n      and have adequate medical records to support completion of key data fields in the Registry\n      including completed Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaires (AQLQ) at Baseline and at\n      post-treatment follow-up visits.\n\n      The Registry will be conducted at up to 40  sites globally and will enroll up to 225\n      patients for 200 evaluable patients. The treatment period is from the date of the first BT\n      procedure until 6 weeks after the third (last) procedure (approximately 12 weeks). The\n      post-treatment period starts at the date of the 6-week follow up visit after completion of\n      the third (last) BT procedure for 2-years of follow-up.\n\n      This Registry will collect real-world outcome data on the experience of BT patients and\n      allow for confirmation of the impact of BT on:\n\n        -  Safety : procedure related respiratory adverse events (rates of serious respiratory\n           adverse events, and percentage of patients with serious respiratory adverse events)\n\n        -  Healthcare Utilization: emergency department (ED) visits for asthma symptoms (rates of\n           ED visits and percentage of patients with ED visits for asthma symptoms);\n           hospitalizations for asthma symptoms (rates and the percentage of patients with\n           hospitalizations for asthma symptoms); unscheduled office visits including urgent care\n           visits for asthma symptoms\n\n        -  Pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV1\n\n        -  Effectiveness: percentage of patients experiencing severe asthma exacerbations; rates\n           of severe asthma exacerbations (exacerbations / patient / year).\n\n        -  Quality of Life: Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) Score - Baseline, 6-Week\n           post BT 3, 1 Year, 2 Year Follow-up office visits\n\n      The primary endpoint will be the incidence of severe asthma exacerbations following BT with\n      the Alair System."
