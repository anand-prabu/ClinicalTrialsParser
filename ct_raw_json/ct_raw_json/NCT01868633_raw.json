The subjects will then be prescribed a\n      standard post-operative analgesia regimen. The subjects will then be interviewed at 12,24\n      and 48 hours post cesarean delivery. During the interview the subjects will be asked to rate\n      their pain, nausea and vomiting and pruritus. They will also be asked to rate their quality\n      of recovery from the surgery using Quality of Recovery-40 questionnaire.
