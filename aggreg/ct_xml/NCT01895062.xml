  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of delivering
      continuous negative external pressure (cNEP) to the upper airway as a means of preventing
      episodes of respiratory impairment (RI) such as hypoxemia, apnea and hypoventilation
      associated with the use of intravenous sedation in elective colonoscopy in adult patients.
