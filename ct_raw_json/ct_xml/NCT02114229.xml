    <textblock>
      This study incorporates alisertib, the small-molecule inhibitor of Aurora A activity, in the
      treatment of patients younger than 22 years of age.  Patients with recurrent or refractory
      atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (ATRT) or malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT) will receive
      alisertib as a single agent.  Patients with newly diagnosed ATRT or concurrent extra-CNS MRT
      will receive alisertib as part of age- and risk-adapted chemotherapy.

      Alisertib will be administered as a single agent on days 1-7 of each 21-day cycle in all
      recurrent patients enrolled on Stratum A.  For the patients on the newly diagnosed strata
      (B, C or D), alisertib will be administered in sequence with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

      This study has 3 primary strata:  (A) children with recurrent/progressive ATRT or extra-CNS
      malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT), (B) children &lt; 36 months-old with newly diagnosed ATRT, (C)
      children &gt; 36 months old with newly diagnosed ATRT.  Children with concurrent MRT will be
      treated according to age and risk stratification schemes outlined for strata B and C and
      will have additional treatment for local control.  Children with synchronous ATRT will be
      treated with age and CNS risk-appropriate therapy, and also receive surgery and/or radiation
      for local control of the non-CNS tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES

        -  To estimate the sustained objective response rate of recurrent or refractory pediatric
           patients with ATRT (atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor in the CNS) (Stratum A1) treated
           with alisertib and determine if the response is sufficient to merit continued
           investigation of alisertib in this population.

        -  To estimate the sustained objective response rate of pediatric patients with recurrent
           or refractory MRT (malignant rhabdoid tumor outside the CNS) (Stratum A2) treated with
           alisertib and determine if the response is sufficient to merit continued investigation
           of alisertib in this population.

        -  To estimate the PFS rate of newly diagnosed patients with ATRT who are younger than 36
           months of age at diagnosis with no metastatic disease (Stratum B1) treated with
           alisertib in sequence with induction and consolidation chemotherapy and radiation
           (depending on age) and to determine if the rates are sufficient to merit continued
           investigation of alisertib in this population.

        -  To estimate the PFS rate of newly diagnosed patients with ATRT who are younger than 36
           months of age at diagnosis, with metastatic disease (Stratum B2) treated with alisertib
           in sequence with induction and consolidation chemotherapy and to determine if the rates
           are sufficient to merit continued investigation of alisertib in this population.

        -  To estimate the PFS rate of newly diagnosed patients with ATRT who are 3 years of age
           or greater at diagnosis with no metastatic disease  and gross total resection or near
           total resection (Stratum C1) treated with alisertib in sequence with radiation and
           consolidation chemotherapy and to determine if the rates are sufficient to merit
           continued investigation of alisertib in this population.

        -  To estimate the PFS rate of newly diagnosed patients with ATRT who are 3 years of age
           or greater at diagnosis with metastatic or residual disease (Stratum C2) treated with
           alisertib in sequence with radiation and consolidation chemotherapy and to determine if
           the rates are sufficient to merit continued investigation of alisertib in this
           population.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of alisertib in pediatric
           patients and to relate drug disposition to toxicity.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

        -  To estimate the duration of objective response and PFS in patients with
           recurrent/progressive ATRT and MRT (Strata A1 and A2).

        -  To estimate PFS and OS distributions in patients with newly diagnosed ATRT (Strata B1,
           B2, B3, C1 and C2).

        -  To describe toxicities experienced by patients treated on this trial, specifically any
           toxicities of alisertib when administered as a single agent or in combination with
           other therapy over multiple courses and toxicities related to proton or photon
           radiotherapy.

        -  To describe the patterns of local and distant failure in newly diagnosed patients
           (Strata B1, B2, B3, C1 and C2).  Local control relative to primary-site radiotherapy,
           with criteria for infield, marginal, or distant failure will also be reported
           descriptively.

      We propose a study with 3 primary treatment strata according to participant's previous
      treatment, age and presence of extra-CNS disease, with substrata for presence of focal or
      metastatic disease:

        -  STRATUM A - RECURRENT OR PROGRESSIVE DISEASE:  Patients &lt; 22 years of age at diagnosis
           with recurrent or progressive MRT (either CNS and/or extra-CNS) and measurable disease
           as defined in the protocol.

             -  Stratum A1: patients with ATRT (CNS MRT).

             -  Stratum A2: patients with extra-CNS MRT (patients with concurrent progression of
                ATRT and MRT are eligible for therapy, but their data will be analyzed
                separately).

             -  Stratum A3:  patients with synchronous ATRT and extra-CNS MRT

        -  STRATUM B - NEWLY DIAGNOSED DISEASE IN YOUNG CHILDREN &lt; 36 MONTHS:  Patients &lt; 36
           months of age at diagnosis of CNS-ATRT, no prior therapy:

             -  Stratum B1:  Patients with no metastatic disease (M0).

             -  Stratum B2:  Patients with metastatic disease (M+) regardless of degree of
                resection.

             -  Stratum B3: Patients for whom CSF by lumbar puncture was not obtained for clinical
                reasons and have no other evidence of metastatic disease (MX).

        -  STRATUM C - NEWLY DIAGNOSED DISEASE IN CHILDREN &gt; 3 YEARS:  Patients &gt; 3 years (36
           months) of age at diagnosis of ATRT, no prior therapy:

             -  Stratum C1:  Patients with gross total (GTR) or near total resection (NTR) defined
                as &lt;1.5 cm2 of residual tumor, and no metastatic disease.

             -  Stratum C2:  Patients with metastatic disease (M+) and/or bulky residual tumor
                &gt;1.5 cm^2.

      STRATUM D - SYNCHRONOUS EXTRANEURAL ATRT:  Treatment will be based on the extent of both CNS
      and extraneural disease.  CNS-directed therapy will be given according to Strata B1 or
      B2/B3, according to M status.  In addition, patients may receive irradiation according to
      best clinical management for local control of extra-CNS disease.

        -  Stratum D1:  Patients &lt; 36 months at time of diagnosis with synchronous extra-neural
           ATRT and no disease in the CSF (M0).

        -  Stratum D2:  Patients &lt; 36 months at time of diagnosis with synchronous extra-neural
           ATRT and having disease in the CSF (MX, or M+).

        -  Stratum D3:  Patients ≥ 3 years at time of diagnosis with synchronous extra-neural ATRT
           with or without disease in the CSF regardless of degree of resection.

      Biological parents of participants with ATRT/MRT may consent to and provide a genomic blood
      specimen for DNA extraction and analysis.

      OVERVIEW OF TREATMENT PLAN:  Patients with recurrent disease (Stratum A) will receive
      alisertib as a single agent days 1-7 out of 21 days.  Newly diagnosed patients (Strata B, C
      and D) will receive alisertib in sequence with chemo and radiotherapy.  Patients on Stratum
      B1 and D1 will receive focal RT once they are &gt;12 months of age.  Patients on Stratum
      B2/B3/D2, with disseminated disease will receive optional central nervous system (CNS)
      radiation therapy (RT). Patients on Strata C1/C2/D3 will receive risk-stratified
      craniospinal irradiation (CSI) and boost to primary tumor site followed by adjuvant
      chemotherapy.  Those patients with concurrent CNS and extra-CNS MRT may undergo irradiation
      of the extra-CNS MRT according to best clinical management in addition to CNS directed
      therapy.  Alisertib will be administered only to eligible patients under the supervision of
      the investigator or identified sub-investigator(s).

    <description>For patients with localized ATRT, gross total resection results in a significant survival benefit. Maximal resection that can be achieved without undue risk to the patient should be attempted prior to trial enrollment.  Decisions about initial resectability will be at the discretion of the local neurosurgeon. In rare instances, the feasibility of completely resecting residual tumor may change as a result of induction chemotherapy; in these cases a &quot;second-look&quot; operation is encouraged if and may be performed prior to consolidation therapy.</description>

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Patients must be &lt; 22 years of age at time of diagnosis (e.g., eligible until 22nd
             birthday).

          -  Histologic diagnosis of  ATRT or MRT as documented by institutional pathologist with
             loss of INI1 confirmed by immunohistochemistry demonstrating loss of SMARCB1/BAF47
             immunoreactivity in tumor cells, or by molecular confirmation of tumor-specific
             bi-allelic INI1 loss/mutation if INI1 immunohistochemistry is not available. Patients
             with synchronous extraneural ATRT are eligible.

          -  Patients must have adequate organ function (bone marrow, renal, liver), as defined in
             the protocol.

          -  Performance status defined by Karnofsky or Lansky  ≥ 30 (except for posterior fossa
             syndrome).  Use Karnofsky for patients ≥ 16 years and Lansky for patients &lt; 16 years.
              Note: Patients who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but who are up in a
             wheelchair, will be considered to be ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the
             performance score.

          -  Female patients who are at least 10-years-old or are post-menarchal must have a
             negative serum or urine pregnancy test prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients of childbearing or child fathering potential must be willing to use a
             medically acceptable form of birth control, which includes abstinence during study
             treatment and 12 months after the last dose of alisertib.  See Appendix X for further
             guidance for pregnancy prevention for patients receiving alisertib.

        Stratum A Participants:

          -  Patients with recurrent or progressive ATRT/MRT (either CNS and/or extra-CNS) with
             radiographically measurable disease as defined by at least 1  lesion that can be
             measured in 2 dimensions or with tumor cells present in the CSF taken within 2 weeks
             prior to enrollment.

          -  Patient has fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of chemotherapy,
             immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study:

               -  Myelosuppressive chemotherapy:  Patient has not received myelosuppressive
                  chemotherapy within 3 weeks of enrollment onto this study (6 weeks if prior
                  nitrosourea).

               -  Hematopoietic growth factors: At least 7 days must have elapsed since the
                  completion of therapy with a growth factor. At least 14 days must have elapsed
                  after receiving pegfilgrastim.

               -  Biologic (anti-neoplastic agent): At least 7 days must have elapsed since
                  completion of therapy with a biologic agent. For agents that have known adverse
                  events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period prior to
                  enrollment must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are
                  known to occur.

               -  Monoclonal antibodies: At least 3 half-lives must have elapsed since prior
                  therapy that included a monoclonal antibody (see Appendix I).

               -  Radiotherapy: at least 2 weeks must have elapsed since any irradiation; at least
                  6 weeks must have elapsed since craniospinal RT or substantial bone marrow
                  irradiation.

        Strata B or C Participants:

          -  Patients with newly diagnosed ATRT.

          -  No previous radiotherapy or chemotherapy other than corticosteroid therapy.

          -  Patients must begin treatment as outlined in the protocol within 36 days of
             definitive surgery (day of surgery is day 0; definitive surgery includes last surgery
             to resect residual tumor).

        Stratum D Participants:

          -  Patients with newly diagnosed ATRT and synchronous extra-CNS MRT.

          -  No previous radiotherapy or chemotherapy other than corticosteroid therapy.

          -  Patients must begin treatment as outlined in Appendix XI within 36 days of definitive
             surgery (day of surgery is day 0; definitive surgery includes repeat surgeries to
             resect residual tumor).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Clinically significant medical disorders that could compromise the ability to
             tolerate protocol therapy or that would interfere with the study procedures or
             results history.

          -  Presence of an active, uncontrolled infection.

          -  Known history of uncontrolled sleep apnea syndrome or other conditions that could
             result in excessive daytime sleepiness, such as severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
             disease or a requirement for supplemental oxygen.

          -  Requirement for constant administration of proton-pump inhibitor, H2 antagonist, or
             pancreatic enzymes.  Intermittent uses of antacids or H2 antagonists are allowed
             while patients are on dexamethasone as described in Appendix VII.

          -  Inability  to comply with the safety monitoring requirements of the study, as judged
             by the investigator.

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding.

          -  Receiving other investigational drugs 14 or fewer days before enrollment.

          -  Treatment with clinically significant enzyme inducers, such as the enzyme-inducing
             antiepileptic drugs phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital, or with rifampin,
             rifabutin, rifapentine, or St. John's wort within 14 days prior to dose of alisertib.

          -  Known GI disease or GI procedures that could interfere with the oral absorption or
             tolerance of alisertib. Examples include, but are not limited to partial gastrectomy,
             history of small intestine surgery, and celiac disease.

          -  Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment or New York Heart
             Association Class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled
             ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or active
             conduction system abnormalities. Prior to study entry, any ECG abnormality at
             screening has to be documented by the investigator as being not medically relevant.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, including
             uncontrolled diabetes, malabsorption, resection of the pancreas or upper small-bowel,
             or requirement for pancreatic enzymes, any condition that would modify small bowel
             absorption of oral medications, or any laboratory abnormality that may increase the
             risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or
             that may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of
             the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for enrollment in this study.
