  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with atrophic glossitis (AG) or burning mouth syndrome (BMS) are frequently
      encountered in the oral mucosal disease clinic. Our previous studies found a significantly
      higher frequency (26.7%) of serum gastric parietal cell antibody (GPCA) and a significantly
      higher frequency (31%) of serum thyroglobulin antibody (TGA) or thyroid microsomal antibody
      (TMA) in AG patients than in healthy control subjects. Moreover, there is also a
      significantly higher frequency (13.3%) of serum GPCA or a significantly higher frequency
      (23.5%) of serum TGA or TMA in BMS patients than in healthy control subjects. Because
      patients with one organ-specific autoantibody are prone to have another organ-specific
      autoantibody in sera, we also evaluated whether AG or BMS patients with GPCA are prone to
      have TGA or TMA in sera and vice versa. We further found that 25.3% of TGA- or TMA-positive
      AG or BMS patients also have GPCA, 32.3% GPCA-positive AG or BMS patients also have TGA, and
      30.6% GPCA-positive AG or BMS patients also have TMA in their sera. Without proper diagnosis
      and treatment, patients with GPCA are more likely to develop autoimmune atrophic gastritis
      and subsequently progress to gastric carcinoma, and patients with TGA or TMA may develop
      autoimmune thyroid disease and finally result in thyroid dysfunction. In addition, previous
      studies have shown a close association of the HLA-DR or HLA-DQ loci with the presence of
      autoantibodies (such as GPCA, TGA or TMA) in patients with different types of autoimmune
      disease. Therefore, in the following 3-year research project, we plan to collect 300 AG and
      450 BMS patients from the oral mucosal disease clinic of Department of Dentistry, National
      Taiwan University Hospital. For each year, 100 AG and 150 BMS patients are collected. A
      10-cc blood sample will be drawn from each patient, with 5 cc being used for the
      determination of the serum levels of GPCA, TGA and TMA and another 5 cc being used for the
      HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1-genotyping using the polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific
      primer (PCR-SSP) typing technique. At the end of this 3-year study, we will realize the
      frequencies of presence of GPCA, TGA and TMA in sera of our 300 AG or 450 BMS patients.
      After statistical analyses, we will also know which specific HLA-DRB1 or HLA-DQB1 allele and
      which specific DRB1-DQB1 haplotype are responsible for the possession of GPCA, TGA or TMA in
      sera of our AG or BMS patients. In addition, we will understand which specific HLA-DRB1 or
      HLA-DQB1 allele and which specific DRB1-DQB1 haplotype are responsible for the possession of
      GPCA in TGA- or TMA-positive AG or BMS patients as well as for the possession of TGA or TMA
      in GPCA-positive AG or BMS patients. With this important information in mind, we can predict
      the development of the specific autoimmune diseases such as autoimmune atrophic gastritis
      and autoimmune thyroid diseases and then adopt proper early diagnosis and treatment to
      prevent the future occurrence of these diseases and their potential complications (such as
      gastric carcinoma or thyroid dysfunction).
