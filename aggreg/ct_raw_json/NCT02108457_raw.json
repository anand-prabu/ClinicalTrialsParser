Participants will be 18 years of age or old with a\n      history of gynecologic cancer. Subjects will undergo 3 FLT-PET scans (one before treatment,\n      one during the course of RT, and one 2-5 weeks after initiation of RT). Scans will take\n      place in the Department of Radiation Oncology."
