Subjects must be at least 18 years of age.\n\n          3. Subjects must present with a clinical diagnosis of stable (at least 3 months)\n             plaque-type psoriasis.\n\n          4. Subjects with psoriasis involving 2 to 20% BSA, not including the face, scalp and\n             intertriginous areas.\n\n          5. Subjects must have an IGA Grade of 3 at the Baseline Visit.\n\n          6. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test\n             result at Baseline (Visit 2) (test will have a sensitivity of at least 25mIU/ml for\n             human chorionic gonadotropin) and practice a reliable method of contraception or\n             remain sexually inactive throughout the study.\n\n             All women of childbearing potential must be willing to undergo a urine pregnancy test\n             at Visit 2 (Day 0), at Visit 4 (Day 14), and at Visit 5 (Day 28).\n\n          7. Subjects must be in good general health as determined by the investigator and\n             supported by the medical history and normal or not clinically significant abnormal\n             vital signs (blood pressure and pulse).\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Current diagnosis of unstable forms of psoriasis including guttate, erythrodermic,\n             exfoliative or pustular psoriasis.\n\n          2.

Presence of pigmentation, extensive scarring, pigmented lesions or sunburn which\n             could interfere with the rating of efficacy parameters.\n\n          4. History of psoriasis unresponsive to topical treatments.\n\n          5. History of organ transplant requiring immunosuppression, HIV, or other\n             immunocompromised state.\n\n          6. Use within 180 days prior to Baseline Visit of biologic treatment for psoriasis\n             (e.g., infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept, ustekinumab, or alefacept).\n\n          7. Have received treatment for any type of cancer within 5 years of the Baseline Visit\n             except for non-melanoma skin cancer and cervical cancer (in situ) are allowed within\n             1 year of the Baseline Visit.\n\n          8. Use within 60 days prior to the Baseline Visit of: 1) immunosuppressive drugs (e.g.,\n             tacrolimus, pimecrolimus), 2) systemic antipsoriatic treatment (e.g., methotrexate,\n             cyclosporine, hydroxyurea) or 3) oral retinoids (e.g., acitretin, isotretinoin).\n\n          9. Use within 30 days prior to the Baseline Visit of: 1) systemic steroids, 2) PUVA\n             therapy, 3) systemic anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., mycophenolate mofetil,\n             sulfasalazine, 6-thioguanine), or 4) UVB therapy.  Note: Inhaled, intraocular and\n             intranasal steroids are allowed.\n\n         10. Use within 14 days prior to the Baseline Visit of: 1) topical antipsoriatic drugs\n             (e.g., salicylic acid, anthralin, coal tar, calcipotriene), 2) topical retinoids\n             (e.g., tazarotene, tretinoin) or 3) topical corticosteroids.\n\n         11. Subjects with known hypersensitivity to clocortolone pivalate or any component of\n             Cloderm Cream.\n\n         12.
