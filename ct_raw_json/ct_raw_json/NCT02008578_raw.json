Onset of illness no more than 6 days before randomization, defined as when the\n                  patient first experienced at least one respiratory symptom, constitutional\n                  symptom or fever\n\n               5. For women of child-bearing potential, a negative pregnancy test within one day\n                  prior to randomization and a willingness to abstain from sexual intercourse or\n                  use at least 1 form of hormonal or barrier contraception through Day 28 of the\n                  study\n\n               6.

Strong clinical evidence (in the judgment of the site investigator) that the etiology\n             of illness is primarily bacterial in origin.\n\n          4. Prior treatment with any investigational drug therapy within 30 days prior to\n             screening\n\n          5. History of allergic reaction to blood or plasma products (as judged by the\n             investigator)\n\n          6. Known IgA deficiency\n\n          7. A pre-existing condition or use of medication that, in the opinion of the\n             investigator, may place the individual at a substantially increased risk of\n             thrombosis (e.g., cryoglobulinemia, severe refractory hypertriglyceridemia, or\n             clinically significant monoclonal gammopathy)\n\n          8.
