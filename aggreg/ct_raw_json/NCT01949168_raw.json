Recent in vitro studies suggest similar efficacy against genotype 6 chronic\n      hepatitis C infection.\n\n      The investigators therefore hypothesise that:\n\n      i) Boceprevir is a potent inhibitor of genotype 6 hepatitis C replication in vivo.\n\n      ii) Boceprevir in combination with pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin for 24 weeks\n      will cure a high proportion of patients chronically infected with genotype 6 chronic\n      hepatitis C infection."

            "textblock": "Genotype 6 HCV (HCV-6) is common in parts of South-East Asia, in particular Vietnam. There\n      is a small but growing population of immigrant patients with chronic HCV-6 in Australia. The\n      current standard-of-care treatment (SOC) for chronic HCV-6 infection is peg-interferon-\u03b1\n      (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) therapy for 48 weeks. The available data evaluating treatment\n      outcome suggests that SVR rates are intermediate between those of HCV-1 and HCV-2/3. There\n      is a medical need for novel therapies that might increase SVR rates and/or allow shortened\n      treatment duration.\n\n      Boceprevir is a novel HCV NS3 protease inhibitor, and boceprevir-based triple therapy has\n      recently been approved for the treatment of HCV-1. Boceprevir also appears to have some\n      antiviral effect against HCV-2 and HCV-3 in vivo. Boceprevir has not been used to treat\n      patients with chronic HCV-6 infection. Recent in vitro data have demonstrated that\n      boceprevir has an antiviral effect against HCV-6.\n\n      The investigators are therefore undertaking an investigator-initiated proof-of-concept pilot\n      study of boceprevir-based therapy for the treatment of patients chronically infected with\n      HCV-6.\n\n      The study population will consist of a representative group of 30 adult patients who are\n      chronically infected with genotype 6 HCV. All patients will be of Asian background, will be\n      non-cirrhotic, and will carry a \"good response\" IL28B genotype (C/C for rs12979860).  The\n      patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinics of 4 Hepatology units in Melbourne,\n      Australia, represented by the principal and associate investigators."
