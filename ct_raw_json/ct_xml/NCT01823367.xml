  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized intervention that will test three different approaches reflecting
      diverse levels of both intensity and cost, to achieving risk reduction of T2D. This will
      help address a critical question in the translation of primary prevention research into the
      public health: how much intensity (and thus cost) is required to achieve an effective
      outcome? In addition, the proposed study will address a critical need in diabetes prevention
      that has not received sufficient scholarly attention: the prevention of T2D in children. No
      studies of diabetes prevention similar in scope to the DPP have been performed in
      school-aged children; however, reducing childhood obesity is widely accepted as the primary
      pathway to decreasing the growing prevalence of T2D in the pediatric population.

      The proposed interventions will target mothers with a history of GDM or who gave birth to
      babies 9 pounds or greater, who are thus at very high risk for developing diabetes, and by
      virtue of their GDM, their children are also at high risk. Because of the genetic components
      involved, all children born by a woman afflicted with gestational diabetes mellitus have
      elevated risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes.  This first intervention builds upon the
      evidence-based curriculum used in the DPP and incorporates into the curriculum detailed
      education regarding ways to help their children adopt healthier lifestyle behaviors. It will
      be delivered in groups of mothers only at community sites using trained laypeople. The
      second intervention will use the same parent curriculum, but adds a group program for
      children that teach them (directly) strategies for eating better and increasing physical
      activity. This program will be delivered to both mothers and children in separate groups.
      The group sessions will take place at the same time and in the same location by a trained
      facilitator. The third intervention is an existing weight management program that is
      delivered to families as a unit by a trained health care team. This program, called Stop
      Taking On Pounds (STOP) was carefully designed using evidence-based criteria for weight loss
      in adolescents and children. It has been evaluated by IU Health Care, found to be effective
      and subsequently incorporated in the clinics of Wishard Health Services. STOP is designed to
      help increase families' understanding of how to manage weight in their children by using
      three key elements: nutrition, exercise, and behavior modification. It strives to provide a
      positive environment that encourages children to make changes that can benefit the entire
      family and improve the child's self esteem and problem solving skills.
