It\n      is also to the benefit of deeper intubation depth so that higher total enteroscopy rate and\n      diagnostic rate will be achieved.\n\n      Initial reports indicated that CO2 was effective during the colonoscopy ,ERCP and DBE\n      examination, but it is still uncertain to the SBE procedure"
