  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the study is to test whether the use of small electrical currents
      to stimulate proprioceptors of the upper limb can result into enhancing the benefits of
      robotic-assisted therapy. The stimulation technique used is &quot;Stochastic Resonance&quot; (SR). In
      previous studies, it has been shown that SR has the effect of increasing afferent traffic
      from Golgi tendon organs and muscle spindles. This effect is referred to as &quot;sensory
      enhancement&quot;. Also, SR has been shown to improve the results of physical therapy in an
      animal model. The study is intended to explore the use of SR in stroke survivors.

      Aim 1: To establish a procedure to optimize the delivery of the SR stimulation to the target
      organs. The investigators hypothesize that there is an optimal level of stimulation for an
      individual that will lead to the highest level of sensory enhancement. The investigators
      will determine such level of stimulation by measuring the impact of different stimulation
      levels on the quality of the movements performed by subjects while being stimulated.

      Aim 2: To gather preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of SR stimulation in stroke
      rehabilitation. The investigators plan to combine the optimal SR stimulation, determined in
      Aim 1, with robotic-assisted rehabilitation to perform a preliminary assessment of the size
      of the improvement associated with the delivery of SR stimulation. The investigators
      hypothesize that robotic-assisted rehabilitation in combination with SR stimulation of
      proprioceptors leads to larger motor gains than robotic-assisted rehabilitation alone.
