            "textblock": "Preoperative chemoradiation (CRT) with fluoropyrimidine (5-fluorouracil or capecitabine) is\n      now regarded as a standard treatment option in patients with locally advanced resectable\n      rectal cancer, and pathologic response rates and tumor regression grades after preoperative\n      CRT have been proved to be important prognostic factors for survival outcomes. Several\n      studies of preoperative CRT with fluoropyrimidines plus other agents, such as oxaliplatin,\n      irinotecan, cetuximab, and bevacizumab, have been performed to improve pathologic response\n      rates; however, they have failed to show improved results compared to those with\n      fluoropyrimidine alone. Thus, fluoropyrimidine alone is a standard chemotherapeutic strategy\n      in patients with locally advanced resectable rectal cancer who will be treated with\n      preoperative CRT at present; further studies are needed to find effective combination for\n      improving pathologic responses other than fluoropyrimidines alone in these patient\n      population.\n\n      Temozolomide is an oral alkylating agent, and has been proved to be effective in patients\n      with glioblastoma or high grade anaplastic glioma when administered with concurrent\n      radiotherapy either as adjuvant or recurrent settings, and also seemed to be effective in\n      patients with malignant melanoma either as monotherapy or combination chemotherapy.\n      Temozolomide has been known to deplete O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), which\n      is one of the DNA repair enzymes, and recent studies have shown that lower expression (by\n      immunohistochemistry) or hypermethylation (by methylation-specific PCR) of MGMT could be a\n      predictive marker of better responses to treatment with temozolomide in patient with\n      glioblastoma, high grade anaplastic glioma or malignant melanoma.\n\n      Silencing of MGMT by promoter hypermethylation has been known to involve colorectal\n      carcinogenesis pathway by the association with KRAS mutation and low-CIMP (CpG island\n      methylation phenotype), and hypermethylation of MGMT promoter could be detected in 29% to\n      46% of tumor tissues from sporadic colorectal cancer patients. Nagasaka et al. showed\n      notable results that MGMT promoter methylation status was associated with microsatellite\n      instability and hypermethylation of MGMT promoter could be a predictive factor of low\n      recurrence in colorectal cancer patients with adjuvant oral fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy\n      after curative surgery.  In addition, Shacham-Shmueli et al. showed that temozolomide could\n      be an additional treatment option in a small group of patients with chemotherapy-refractory\n      metastatic colorectal cancer which had lower MGMT expressions."
