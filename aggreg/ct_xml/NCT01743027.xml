  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate an ophthalmic solution for the treatment of ocular
      itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis using the Conjunctival Allergen Challenge
      (CAC) model.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled participants will be tested for the presence of common allergies using the
      Conjunctival Allergen Challenge (CAC) model. Drops of increasing concentration of a
      solubilized allergen will be instilled in both eyes until a positive reaction occurs. The
      test will be repeated to confirm the allergic reaction.  Participants with confirmed
      reactions will be administered the test article (Day 0) and undergo a CAC 24 hours
      post-instillation (Day 1). On Day 14, participants will be administered the test article and
      undergo an additional CAC.
