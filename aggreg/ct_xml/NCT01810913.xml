  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II/III trial studies how well radiation therapy works when given
      together with cisplatin compared to docetaxel or cetuximab and docetaxel after surgery in
      treating patients with stage III-IV squamous cell head and neck cancer. Specialized
      radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more
      tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      cisplatin and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells
      to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or transmit tumor killing
      molecules to them. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy is more effective when
      given with cisplatin, docetaxel, or cetuximab and docetaxel.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To select the better experimental arm to improve disease-free survival (DFS) over the
      control arm of radiation and cisplatin. (Phase II) II. To determine whether the selected
      experimental arm will improve overall survival (OS) over the control arm of radiation and
      cisplatin. (Phase III)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To improve local-regional disease control. II. To compare distant metastasis. III. To
      compare patterns of cancer failure (local, regional, distant) and correlate with radiation
      dose and technique.

      IV. To compare acute toxicity profiles during radiation therapy (RT) and at completion of
      treatment.

      V. To compare late toxicity profiles at 1, 3, and 5 years after treatment. VI. To compare
      overall quality of life. VII. To compare patient-reported outcome. VIII. To compare
      swallowing function at 1 and 2 years. IX. To investigate associations between acute mucosal
      toxicity, swallowing function, and quality of life (QOL).

      X. To compare quality adjusted life years (QALY). XI. To investigate associations between
      late toxicity (dysphagia) and QALY. XII. To determine whether specific molecular profiles
      are associated with clinical outcomes.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups.

      ARM 1: Patients undergo intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) once daily (QD) five
      days a week and receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours once weekly for 6 weeks.

      ARM 2: Patients undergo IMRT as in Arm I and receive docetaxel IV once weekly for 6 weeks.

      ARM 3: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 120 minutes on week 1 and over 60 minutes once
      weekly on weeks 2-7. Patients undergo IMRT as in Arm I and receive docetaxel once weekly for
      6 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 3 months, every 3
      months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
