The risk is doubled if patient has familial disposition as well. In retrospective studies, non-genetic risk-prediction models were compared to risk-prediction models containing both non-genetic factors and SNPs analyses. The genetic models had a significantly higher specificity than the non-genetic models. It has been argued that genetic PCa risk assessment could reduce the inexpedient use of PSA tests, saving it for patients at high risk of PCa."

Yet, an increasing number of men get the PSA test as part of\n      unsystematic screening. Genetic risk assessment may be a better way to identify men with low\n      risk of PCa. The main study hypothesis is that genetic information about low risk of PCa can\n      reduce the number of patients who get a PSA test as part of unsystematic screening."
