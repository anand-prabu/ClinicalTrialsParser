  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hetlioz™ (tasimelteon) is used in the treatment of Non-24-Hour-Sleep-Wake Disorder (Non-24).
       Non-24 is very common in people who are totally blind because light can not reset their
      body clock. This causes the internal sleep-wake cycle to be out of sync with the 24-hour
      day-night.  Non-24 is a serious, chronic circadian rhythm disorder in the blind that causes
      nighttime sleep problems and a wide range of daytime difficulties, including an overwhelming
      urge to nap.

      Tasimelteon will be given  in two ways; orally (by mouth) as a 20 mg capsule and
      intravenously (I.V.) by infusion through a catheter (not an injection) into a vein.  The
      oral administration is approved by the FDA.  The I.V. administration is considered
      investigational as it has not been approved by the FDA. This will be the first time
      tasimelteon will be given to humans by intravenous (I.V.) injection.

      The purposes of this research study are to:

        -  assess how quickly a single 20 mg oral dose of tasimelteon is absorbed into the body;

        -  evaluate the single-dose pharmacokinetics of tasimelteon after a single 20 mg oral dose
           and after a single 2 mg I.V. dose;

        -  evaluate the single-dose pharmacokinetics of tasimelteon metabolites after a single 20
           mg oral dose and after a single 2 mg I.V. dose;

        -  evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single 20 mg oral dose of tasimelteon; and

        -  evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single 2 mg I.V. dose of tasimelteon.

      Pharmacokinetics (PK) is the study of how a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and
      eventually eliminated by the body.  Pharmacokinetics is what the body does to the drug.
      Blood samples will be taken throughout the study for PK analysis.

    <description>The absolute bioavailability (F) of tasimelteon will be estimated from the dose-corrected AUC(inf) after oral and I.V. administration using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with treatment, period, sequence, and subject within sequence as the classification variables, using natural log-transformed data. The geometric mean ratio (GMR), oral-to-I.V., and its associated 90% confidence interval (CI) will be used as the estimate of F and its variability.</description>
