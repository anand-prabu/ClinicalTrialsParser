A number of\n      eye diseases are irreversible at on early stage. Both glaucoma and diabetic\n      retinopathy(DR)are frequently asymptomatic until significant, often-irreversible, damage to\n      the vision has already occurred. It has been estimated that only 10% of persons in India\n      with glaucoma are diagnosed, and the Handan Eye Survey reports that only 10% of persons with\n      diabetes in rural areas of China have received diabetic eye care. In order to deliver\n      effective care for DR and glaucoma in areas with limited resources, education of patients\n      and interventions to promote compliance among patients will both be needed."
