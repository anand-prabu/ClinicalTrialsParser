      INTRODUCTION: Stress urinary incontinence is a common condition in women and can be defined
      as the involuntary loss of urine on exertion, exercise, sneezing or coughing. This pathology
      causes physical discomfort and impacts the quality of life in a negative manner.
      Physiotherapeutic exercises is a treatment with low cost and high patient attendance. It can
      be applied with focus on strengthening the pelvic floor muscles or on muscular synergism.
      OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of Kegel exercises performed alone or performed in
      association with the strengthening of the muscles of the hip in the treatment of stress
      urinary incontinence. METHODOLOGY: The study is a randomized, blinded clinical trial. It
      aims at assessing objectively the strength of the pelvic floor, the improvement in the
      number of episodes of loss and impact on quality of life. The study will accept up to 40
      women, who will be divided into two groups of physical therapy: group 1 (that will
      strengthen the pelvic floor muscles with Kegel exercises) and group 2 (that will perform
      strengthening the pelvic floor  muscles with Kegel exercises associated with the
      strengthening of muscles of the hip). The two groups will be evaluated at the beginning and
      at the end of treatment.
