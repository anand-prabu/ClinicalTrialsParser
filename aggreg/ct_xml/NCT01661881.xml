      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the
      effectiveness of an investigational combination of drugs to learn whether the combination of
      drugs works in treating a specific cancer. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the combination of
      drugs is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about
      it-such as the safest dose to use, the side effects it may cause, and if the combination of
      drus is effective for treating different types of cancer. It also means the FDA has not yet
      approved this combination of drugs for your type of cancer.

      Patients enrolling in this study will receive a maximum of six cycles of the study drugs.
      Each cycle is 28 days in length. They will receive Rituximab-Bendamustine (RB) for the first
      3 cycles. This treatment will consist of Rituximab given by infusion into a vein
      (intravenous) on day 1 of each cycle and Bendamustine given by infusion into a vein (over
      approximately 30-60 minutes) daily on days 1 and 2 of each cycle.

      They will then receive Rituximab-Cytarabine (RC) for the last 3 cycles (with the first cycle
      administered 28 days after the last RB cycle). This treatment will consist of Rituximab
      given by infusion into a vein (intravenous) on day 1 of each cycle and cytarabine by
      infusion into a vein (intravenous) every 12 hours on days 1 and 2 of each cycle. It is
      expected that those 3 cycles will be delivered in the hospital, over 2-3 days each time.

      It is expected that patients will proceed to autologous stem cell transplantation at the
      conclusion of this study. However, the stem cell transplantation will not be performed as
      part of this study.
