The daily exercise\n      will be performed on a rowing machine that will be adapted to the patient's own physical\n      ability.\n\n      Daily physical activity will be measured with the help of an actimeter.\n\n      Once a month, MG evolution and tolerance to exercise will be assessed and MG treatment dose\n      will be collected.\n\n      Exercise will be interrupted in case of MG exacerbation.\n\n      Quality of life and psychological status will be assessed at 3, 6 and 9 months.\n\n      Plasma levels of pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines will be measured at 3, 6 and 9 months\n      in order to assess the effects of exercise on immune response.\n\n      Patients enrolled in the control arm will benefit from the same follow-up but will not have\n      daily exercise."
