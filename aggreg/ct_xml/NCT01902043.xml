    <textblock>
      Chronic disease care requires good collaboration between healthcare providers, teamwork,
      self-management education and use of evidence-based medicine. However, such care process is
      complex and often suboptimal. Diabetes, a prevalent chronic disease (~ 9% worldwide) which
      represents a major public health burden in terms of morbidity, disability and mortality, is
      not an exception. Individuals with diabetes, require more health care resources than people
      without diabetes. Improving quality of diabetes care is especially needed to reduce the
      health and societal burden of this disease.

      In the canton of Vaud, Switzerland, a state with more than 700,000 inhabitants, a recent
      population-based study has shown that the prevalence of diabetes was around 7%. Data on the
      quality of diabetes care is scarce and quality of care data are still infrequently and
      unsystematically collected in Switzerland. In addition, when they are available, they rather
      focus on intermediate outcomes as well as clinical and biological cardiovascular risk
      factors. Also, they are not population-based and do not consider patient-reported outcomes.

      In 2010, the Public Health Department of the canton of Vaud initiated the development of a
      regional diabetes program entitled &quot;Programme cantonal Diabète&quot; (PcD). It aimed both at
      decreasing the incidence of diabetes and at improving care for patients with diabetes.

      To better tailor the program to the healthcare needs of patients and healthcare
      professionals involved in diabetes care, an exploratory study using qualitative methods was
      conducted in 2010. This was followed by a population-based survey conducted in fall 2011 and
      summer 2012. The objectives of this survey were to characterize patients with diabetes and
      assess the quality of the care they received. In addition, to help targeting unmet needs and
      possible areas of improvements, the results of this survey also constituted the baseline
      patients' measurement of the evaluation of the PcD.

      The CoDiab-VD cohort emerged from that initial project. Its specific objectives are 1) to
      follow over time quality of diabetes care, 2) to assess the impact of the PcD on care of
      patients with diabetes, and 3) to evaluate the coverage of the PcD within the canton of
      Vaud.

      patients with diabetes, and 3) to evaluate the coverage of the PcD within the canton of
      Vaud.

      Patients with diabetes were recruited by community-based pharmacies in the fall of 2011 and
      the summer of 2012. Participating community-based pharmacies, randomly contacted among those
      registered in the canton of Vaud, were asked to recruit non-institutionalized adult patients
      with diabetes (disease duration of at least 12 months), who were visiting the pharmacy with
      a prescription for oral antidiabetic drugs, insulin, glycemic strips or glucose meter.

      At baseline, patients filled in a self-reported paper questionnaire that targeted the
      following areas:

        -  diabetes (type, disease duration, treatment, complications)

        -  current diabetes care: recommended process of care indicators, such as annual eye
           examination by ophthalmologist, foot examination, microalbuminuria, …, and specific
           outcomes of cares such as HbA1C levels, quality of life (SF-12 and ADDQoL)

        -  patient assessment of care (PACIC)

        -  healthcare utilization

        -  health behaviors (smoking and drinking habits, physical activity) and health status
           (comorbidities)

        -  self-management support (for example glycemic self-monitoring, self-efficacy,
           information level about diabetes)

        -  sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, nationality, place of residence,
           education, employment, marital status, family size, family income, insurance status).

      Participants were also asked to give the contact details of their family doctor and/or
      diabetologist. With the consent of the patients, treating physicians were contacted. Those
      accepting to participate filled in a brief paper questionnaire asking for few clinical and
      laboratory data.

      A follow-up, using paper questionnaires, will be organized. While patients will be contacted
      every year, physicians will be contacted every two years.

      Patients' follow-up paper questionnaires will be constituted of a core set of questions
      identical to the baseline questionnaire. New questions will be added and developed according
      to the development and needs of PcD.
