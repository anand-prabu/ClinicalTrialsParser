  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Thrombolytic drugs may dissolve blood vessel clots in acute ischemic stroke. The
      overall benefit of intravenous thrombolysis is substantial, but up to 2/3 of patients with
      large clots may not achieve re-opening of the vessel and up to 40% of the patients may
      remain severely disabled or die. Ultrasound accelerates clot break-up (lysis) when combined
      with thrombolysis (sonothrombolysis) and increases the likelihood of functional independence
      at 3 months. Adding intravenous ultrasound contrast (gaseous microspheres) further enhances
      the thrombolytic effect (contrast enhanced sonothrombolysis = CEST). Contrast enhanced
      ultrasound may also accelerate clot break-up in the absence of thrombolytic drugs (contrast
      enhanced sonolysis = CES).

      HYPOTHESIS: Contrast enhanced ultrasound treatment administered within 4 1/2 hours after
      symptom onset may be given safely to patients with acute ischemic stroke, both to those
      receiving intravenous thrombolysis and those not receiving intravenous thrombolysis, and
      will improve clinical outcome.

      AIMS: To compare efficacy and safety of contrast enhanced ultrasound treatment vs. no
      ultrasound treatment in patients with acute ischemic stroke receiving or not receiving
      intravenous thrombolysis.

      STUDY ENDPOINTS: The primary endpoint is excellent clinical outcome at 3 months (effect).
      Secondary endpoints are early clinical improvement (effect) and bleeding complications
      (safety).

      NOR-SASS aims at testing contrast enhanced sonothrombolysis in all patients with acute
      ischemic stroke. Patients eligible for thrombolysis are therefore included in NOR-SASS-I
      sub-study, patients not eligible for thrombolysis are included in NOR-SASS-II sub-study.

      DESIGN: NOR-SASS is a PROBE (prospective randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint) trial,
      designed to establish the superiority of contrast-enhanced ultrasound treatment given within
      4½ hours after stroke onset in consecutively admitted patients with acute ischaemic stroke,
      as compared with 1) standard iv thrombolysis with tenecteplase (TNK) or alteplase (tPA) in
      patients eligible for thrombolytic treatment, and 2) no specific treatment in patients not
      eligible for thrombolytic treatment.

      HYPOTHESIS: 1.) In patients eligible for intravenous thrombolysis contrast enhanced
      sonothrombolysis (CEST) has superior effect as compared with standard intravenous
      thrombolysis and may be given safely. 2.) In patients not eligible for thrombolysis,
      contrast enhanced sonolysis (CES) has superior effect as compared with no specific treatment
      and may be given safely.

      RANDOMISATION: In NOR-SASS-I (two step randomisation), 1st randomisation is 1:1 to either
      tenecteplase (TNK) or alteplase (tPA); 2nd randomisation is 1:1 to either CEST or no CEST.
      In NOR-SASS-II, randomisation is 1:1 to either CES or no CES.
