By\n      combining W10 imaging with half-time acquisition, the time of the technetium-99m myocardial\n      perfusion imaging procedure could be shortened by at least 50%, lasting only 40 minutes for\n      W10 (10-minute waiting) imaging compared with 90 minutes for W30 imaging (30-minute\n      waiting).\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that (1) W10 MPI is clinically feasible and tolerable by the\n      patients, that (2) W10 MPI provides high image quality and that (3) W10 MPI provides\n      diagnostic accuracy comparable to W30 MPI."
