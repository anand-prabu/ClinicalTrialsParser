The investigators therefore randomly assigned 99 individuals with type 2\n      diabetes to either a low-fat, vegan diet or a diet based on current American Diabetes\n      Association guidelines for 22 weeks with a one-year follow-up period. The principal\n      dependent measure is hemoglobin A1c. Cardiovascular risk factors are also being tracked, as\n      is dietary acceptance."
