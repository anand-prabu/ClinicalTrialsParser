    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the validity, reliability and reproducibility of
      digital models obtained from iTero® and Lava Digital® in comparison with traditional plaster
      models.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the validity, reliability and
      reproducibility of the dental measurements obtained on the digital models with iTero® in
      comparison with those obtained on the plaster models (gold standard) and on the digital
      models with Lava Digital®.

      The secondary objective is to compare two different impression materials (i.e. alginate and
      polyvinylsiloxane (PVS)) and determine whether the impression material used affects the
      accuracy of the measurements.

      Statistical analysis:

        -  Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) will be used to evaluate the intra- and
           inter-operator reliability of the measurements for each method, i.e. the plaster models
           and the digital models.

        -  A paired t-test will be used to determine the validity of the digital measurements with
           iTero®, and to compare the impression materials (alginate and PVS).

        -  A Bland-Altman plot will also be used to compare the two digital methods (Lava Digital®
           et iTero®) with the plaster models.

        -  Dahlberg coefficient will be used to evaluate the technical error associated with the
           measurements that will be made.

    <description>Description of all measurements that will be done on all dental models:
Mesio-distal width of all upper and lower permanent teeth, i.e. from the first molar to the other first molar: to perform the Bolton 6 and Bolton 12 analysis.
Arch length/Space available
Intercanine width: distance between cusp tips
Intermolar width: distance between the central fossae of the first molars
Overbite: measured as the greatest amount of vertical overlap at the central incisors
Overjet: measured as the greatest horizontal distance from the labial surface of the lower central incisor to the most inferior point at the mesiodistal center of the upper central incisor</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged between 12 and 30 years old (male or female)

          -  complete permanent dentition from first molar to the other first molar

          -  no interproximal modifications (e.g. decay, large restorations, abnormal tooth
             morphology) which could affect the mesio-distal width of the teeth

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Dentition with severe crowding (that could therefore affect the mesio-distal width of
             the teeth)
