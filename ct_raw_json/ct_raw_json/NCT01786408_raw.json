The study will also involve collecting blood by fingerstick which is a common\n      way of collecting blood.  The SAFE-T-FILL Capillary Blood Collection system and the Terumo\n      Capiject 1.5 mm Blade Safety Lancet will be used for this.  The study will compare the\n      concentrations of glucose, hemoglobin, and HbA1C in blood samples collected with the two\n      different blood collection methods. Additional information will be collected about how the\n      TAP20-C device performs."
