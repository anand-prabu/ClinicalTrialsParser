To examine\n      brain mechanisms of relapse/recovery, participants will complete fMRI sessions before,\n      during, and after treatment. Brain responses to specific probes of reward and inhibition\n      will be used as biomarkers predicting drug use during and after the treatment."

Physically healthy cocaine-dependent (based on DSM-IV- TR criteria) male or female\n             aged 18-60 yrs, voluntarily seeking treatment for cocaine dependence.\n\n          2. Females must be non-pregnant, non- lactating and either be of non-childbearing\n             potential (i.e. sterilized via hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation or at least 1\n             year post-menopausal) or of child bearing potential, but practicing a medically\n             acceptable method of birth control. Examples of medically acceptable methods for this\n             protocol include barrier (diaphragm or condom) with spermicide, an intrauterine\n             device (IUD), oral contraceptives, a levonorgestrel implant, intrauterine\n             progesterone contraceptive system, medroxyprogesterone acetate contraceptive\n             injection, and abstinence.\n\n          3. Reading level at or above eighth grade.\n\n          4. Participants provide voluntary informed consent.\n\n          5. Smoking is primary route of cocaine administration.\n\n          6. Available for an inpatient stay.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Participation in clinical trial and receipt of investigational drug(s) during\n             previous 60 days, except as explicitly approved by the Principal Investigator.\n\n          2. Clinically significant cardiovascular, hematologic, hepatic, renal, neurological or\n             endocrinological abnormalities.\n\n          3. History of serious head trauma or injury causing loss of consciousness that lasted\n             more than 3 minutes or associated with skull fracture or inter-cranial bleeding or\n             abnormal MRI.\n\n          4. Presence of magnetically active prosthetics, plates, pins, broken needles, permanent\n             retainer, bullets, etc. in patient's body (unless a radiologist confirms that its\n             presence is unproblematic). An x-ray may be obtained to determine eligibility.\n\n          5. Claustrophobia or other medical condition that disables the participant from lying in\n             the MRI for approximately 60 minutes.\n\n          6. Current or prior gambling problems (assessed by participants self-report)\n\n          7. Non-removable skin patches\n\n          8. Have received medication that could interact adversely with baclofen, including\n             muscle relaxants (including tricyclic antidepressants), antiseizure medication, CNS\n             depressants (tranquilizers, sleeping pills), MAO inhibitors), within the time of\n             administration of study agent based on the study physician's guidance (e.g. 5 half\n             lives)\n\n          9. Have known or suspected hypersensitivity to baclofen.\n\n         10. Be taking baclofen for any reason currently or during the past year."
