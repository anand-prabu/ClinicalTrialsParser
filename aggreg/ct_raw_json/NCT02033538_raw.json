In Eastern countries, preoperative\n      chemotherapy followed by radical surgery became one of the treatment strategies for\n      resectable, clinical stage II or III esophageal cancer. In an effort to improve the efficacy\n      of systemic chemotherapy, we conducted a prospective study to evaluate the regimen of\n      nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel plus 5-fluorouracil as perioperative therapy for\n      patients with resectable esophageal carcinoma."
