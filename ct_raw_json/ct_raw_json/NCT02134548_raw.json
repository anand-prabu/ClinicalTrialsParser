This test is intended to be used on human whole blood or\n      serum samples. Chagas Detect\u2122 Plus results (positive or negative) must be confirmed by\n      testing with a reference standard test.\n\n      Subjects will be patients at clinical sites located in Chagas-endemic areas. After informed\n      consent is obtained and the subject is screened for eligibility, 2 diagnostic samples will\n      be collected. One is blood from finger prick, and the other is blood from venous puncture\n      (drawn from vein in arm).\n\n      Rapid tests and reference tests will be performed by different operators who are laboratory\n      staff members. These staff members, blinded to each other's results, will evaluate the\n      samples from each method independently."
