Ixazomib may stop the\n      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

The primary purpose of the Phase I portion of the study is to\n      establish the maximum tolerated dose for combination therapy\n      pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib. Patients receive pomalidomide orally (PO) once daily\n      (QD) on days 1-21, dexamethasone PO QD on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, and ixazomib PO QD on days\n      1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression,\n      unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. About 24 patients will take part in this\n      portion of the study.\n\n      The primary purpose of the Phase II portion of the study is to assess whether the\n      combination of pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib improves progression free survival\n      relative to pomalidomide/dexamethasone. Please see the \"Arms\" section below for a detailed\n      description of the treatment arms for Phase II of the study. The dose for pomalidomide and\n      ixazomib will be determined in phase I of the study. About 108 patients will take part in\n      this portion of the study. The secondary objectives are listed below.\n\n      Secondary Phase I Objectives:\n\n        1. To determine dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)\n\n        2. To analyze type and grade of all serious adverse events (SAEs)\n\n        3. To analyze type and grade of all adverse events (AEs)\n\n        4. To analyze the reason for and incidence of dose modifications/omissions/delays\n\n        5. To assess preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy\n\n      Secondary Phase II Objectives:\n\n        1. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR), partial response (PR), very good partial\n           response (VGPR), complete response (CR) and stringent CR (sCR) rate for\n           pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib compared to pomalidomide/dexamethasone\n\n        2. To assess the clinical benefit rate (CBR: minimal response (MR) + ORR) for\n           pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib compared to pomalidomide/dexamethasone\n\n        3. To assess the disease control rate (DCR: stable disease (SD) + CBR) for\n           pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib compared to pomalidomide/dexamethasone\n\n        4. For those patients achieving a PR or better, we will assess whether the combination of\n           pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib increases the duration of response (DOR) compared\n           to pomalidomide/dexamethasone.\n\n        5. To assess whether the combination of pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib improves\n           overall survival (OS) compared to those taking pomalidomide/dexamethasone alone.\n\n        6. To assess time to next treatment (TNT) for patients taking\n           pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib compared to those on pomalidomide/dexamethasone.\n\n        7. To evaluate the safety of pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib compared with\n           pomalidomide/dexamethasone.\n\n        8. For patients on the pomalidomide/dexamethasone arm who opt to cross-over to the\n           pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib arm, assessment of response rate (ORR, CBR, DCR)\n           DOR, TNT, PFS, and OS will be evaluated from date of cross-over.\n\n        9. To determine if baseline level of perceived fatigue and overall quality of life (QOL)\n           is associated with OS.\n\n      Patients are followed up every 4 weeks until disease progression, death or the withdrawal of\n      informed consent."
