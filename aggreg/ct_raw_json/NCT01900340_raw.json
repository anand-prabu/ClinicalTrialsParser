            "textblock": "Understanding the exact mechanisms by which GLP-1 inhibits eating can be crucial in order to\n      convert its anorectic action into useful, safe and effective drugs. So far, it is however\n      not clear to what extent GLP-1 is a hormonal regulator of eating or whether the observed\n      effects are rather a pharmacological phenomenon. By applying classical algorithms from\n      endocrinology several criteria must be fulfilled before a hormone can be considered an\n      endogenous physiological satiety signal. One is that exogenous administration of a selective\n      antagonist should prevent the eating-inhibitory effect of GLP-1. At present, cholecystokinin\n      (CCK) is the only peptide in humans identified to fit these criteria. For intestinal GLP-1,\n      it has not been investigated whether a specific GLP-1 receptor antagonist can block the\n      eating-inhibitory effect in humans. The availability of a specific GLP-1 receptor\n      antagonist, exendin (9-39), now makes it possible to further investigate this pathway.\n      Exendin (9-39), is a powerful tool available for human use to characterize of endogenous\n      GLP-1 as a physiological regulator of different biological functions. The molecule has been\n      used to document that endogenous GLP-1 is an important incretin hormone and a regulator of\n      antro-pyloro-duodenal motility. The role of endogenous GLP-1 in regulating food intake and\n      appetite has, however, not been investigated before."
