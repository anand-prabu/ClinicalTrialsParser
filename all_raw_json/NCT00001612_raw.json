Visual function will be assessed with manifest refraction and\n      standardized visual acuity measurement.  The progression of retinopathy will be evaluated by\n      ocular exam and fundus photography.  A brief medical history will be obtained.  The goal of\n      this study is to evaluate the long-term results of patients whose diabetic retinopathy was\n      treated with different strategies of scatter and/or focal laser photocoagulation."
