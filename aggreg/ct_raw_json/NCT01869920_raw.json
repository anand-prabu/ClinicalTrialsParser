Design: cluster\n      randomized trial. Setting: Multicentre. Primary Care Health Centres (PCHC). Madrid.\n      Subjects: mother-infant pairs using exclusive breastfeeding attending any query in the\n      health centre, as long as the infant is not older than four weeks and who consent to\n      participate in the study.\n\n      Sample size: N= 432 (216 in each arm). Randomisation: Unit of randomization: primary\n      healthcare centres.\n\n      Analysis unit: mother-infant pairs, recruitment to consecutive sampling. Intervention:\n      Educational group intervention in the treatment group and the usual intervention in the\n      control group. Variables: Main response variable: mother-infant pairs using EBF at six\n      months. Secondary variables: types of breastfeeding at 6 months, duration of EBF, reasons\n      for abandoning breastfeeding, satisfaction with the intervention (SERVQUAL). Prognostic\n      variables: infant, mother and professional. Data Analysis: Analysis of main effectiveness by\n      intention to treat, comparing the proportion of mother-infant pairs using EBF at six months\n      in both groups. The estimation adjusted using an explanatory logistics regression model. To\n      assess the effect of the educational group intervention on the duration of the various types\n      of breastfeeding, a survival analysis will be used comparing the two groups using the\n      log-rank test. The control of potential confounding variables will be performed by the\n      construction of various Cox regression models."
