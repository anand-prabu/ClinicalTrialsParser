  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer patients are considered platinum refractory if their disease worsens during
      primary platinum treatment or if they have no effect of the treatment. This constitutes a
      major therapeutic problem and new treatment approaches are highly needed.

      Cabazitaxel (Jevtana®) is a new taxane with effect in breast and prostatic cancer. In both
      tumors it has effect in patients refractory to taxotere. Consequently, it could be
      anticipated that cabazitaxel may have an effect in platinum refractory ovarian cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed epithelial, primary fallopian or primary peritoneal cancer.
             Stages I-IV.

          -  Patients with refractory disease defined as progression or no change during primary
             treatment, as evaluated after 3 and/or 6 cycles of platinum/paclitaxel. Prior to
             inclusion, patients must have received platinum and paclitaxel as combination
             treatment.

          -  Measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 or
             evaluable by Gynecologic Cancer Interest Group (GCIG) cancer antigen 125 (CA-125)
             criteria.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Performance stage 0-2.

          -  Adequate bone marrow function, liver function, renal function, and coagulation
             parameters (within 7 days prior to inclusion):

               1. Neutrophils (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/l

               2. Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/l

               3. Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

               4. Serum transaminase ≤ 2.5 x ULN

               5. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 ULN. If creatinine 1.0 - 1.5 x ULN, creatinine clearance
                  will be calculated according to the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology
                  Collaboration formula (CKD-EPI)and patients with creatinine clearance &lt;60 mL/min
                  should be excluded

          -  Written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reaction (≥grade 3) to taxol.

          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reaction (≥grade 3) to polysorbate 80 containing
             drugs.

          -  Concurrent or planned treatment with strong inhibitors or strong inducers of
             cytochrome P4503A4/5 (a one week wash-out period is necessary for patients who are
             already on these treatments).

          -  Neuropathy grade ≥ 2.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding patients. For fertile women a negative pregnancy test at
             screening is mandatory.

          -  Fertile patients not willing to use effective methods of contraception during
             treatment and for 6 months after the end of treatment.

          -  Other malignant diseases within 5 years prior to inclusion in the study, except basal
             cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and cervical carcinoma-in-situ.

          -  Other experimental therapy or participation in another clinical trial within 28 days
             prior to treatment initiation.

          -  History of any chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality
             that is not medically controlled or in the opinion of the investigator may increase
             the risks associated with study drug administration. (e.g. diabetes, cardiac
             diseases, hypertension, renal, thyroid or liver disease).

          -  Vaccination with yellow fever vaccine or any live attenuated vaccine during the
             treatment.

          -  Treatment with disulfiram (antabuse)
