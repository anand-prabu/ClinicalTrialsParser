            "textblock": "Compared to end-stage heart failure, a patient's situation is usually greatly improved after\n      a heart transplant (HTx), but the exercise capacity remains sub-normal, also long-term,\n      ranging from 50 to 70% in most studies. While effective rehabilitation, including regular\n      exercise, is considered an effective tool of improving health related quality of life\n      (HRQoL) and prognosis of cardiac patients in general, the knowledge about and the effect of\n      different rehabilitation programs among HTx recipients is limited. Exercise training is\n      considered one of the most central parts in rehabilitation, but the mode of exercise used in\n      different studies varies considerably. It is documented that high intensity interval\n      training (HIT) has superior effects compared to training with moderate intensity in cardiac\n      and heart failure patients. In contrast, HTx recipients have a denervated heart, and HIT had\n      been considered unphysiological. However, the investigators have recently demonstrated\n      highly beneficial effects on exercise capacity, muscle strength, body composition, reduced\n      progression of cardiac allograft vasculopathy and HRQoL among long-term HTx recipients. In\n      the present study the investigators want to test the hypothesis that systematic aerobic\n      exercise with high intensity improve exercise capacity also in newly transplanted\n      recipients, and secondarily that it gives favourable effects on the heart, peripheral\n      circulation and a better HRQoL."
