Our hypothesis is that the\n      chance that a galactosemic woman with POI becomes pregnant is higher than the 5-10% that has\n      been reported for women with POI due to other causes. Chance of spontaneous pregnancy will\n      be evaluated through semi standardized interview in women with classic galactosemia aged 18\n      years or older. During the interview, questions will be asked regarding fertility and\n      pregnancy."
