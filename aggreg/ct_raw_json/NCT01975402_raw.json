An important component of our overall strategy for continued\n      development and refinement of the remote monitoring system is the incorporation of iterative\n      behavioral evaluations to facilitate assessment and refinement in order to optimize\n      adherence, utilization, and usability for patients as well as efficiency and functionality\n      for providers."
