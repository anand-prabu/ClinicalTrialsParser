Cohort A is a single\n      sequence drug interaction study in which 28 subjects (14 female and 14 male subjects) will\n      be enrolled. Each subject will receive single doses of Simvastatin and Rosuvastatin on two\n      occasions, once alone and once following administration of repeated doses of GSK2586184.\n      Cohort B is a 3-way crossover PK study in which 9 male subjects will be randomized (3\n      subjects to each treatment sequence).
