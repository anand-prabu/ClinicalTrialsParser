This will give the general practitioner the oppurtunity to\n      choose a different type of preparation or prescribe ulcer-preventive medicine at the same\n      time.\n\n      The decision-support tool will be tested in a randomized trial among general practitioners.\n      The aim is to reduce the occurence of peptic ulcer bleeding. The expected outcome is a\n      reduction in half of the total numbers of peptic ulcers."

On average 1-2% of patients using NSAID and Aspirin will develope gastric ulcer\n      bleeding. But for patients with one or more risk-factors, the risk increases to 9% per 6\n      months. The mortality in this case is 10-15%. Approximately 3200 patients are admitted to\n      the hospital with bleeding ulcer annually in Denmark.\n\n      Danish investigations have shown that 80% of all peptic ulcer bleedings admitted to hospital\n      are related to the use of NSAID or Aspirin.\n\n      The consumption of NSAID and Aspirin is large. A third of people over 60 are treated within\n      a year with these preparations. The risk of developing gastric ulcer related to NSAID and\n      Aspirin can be reduced by concomitant therapy with antacids. Several studies have shown that\n      only 20-30% of patients with risk-factors receive ulcer preventive medicine."
