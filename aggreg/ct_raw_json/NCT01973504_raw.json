            "textblock": "Acute trauma, including both blunt and penetrating injury, is often associated with\n      uncontrolled bleeding that leads to hemorrhagic shock. During shock, inadequate blood flow\n      results in local ischemia and tissue hypoxia (insufficient oxygenation) of critical organs\n      with resulting lactic acidosis. More than 10% of trauma victims who reach hospital alive\n      will die, and many will suffer from organ failure. The primary goal when treating traumatic\n      hemorrhage is to control blood loss, support ventilation and oxygenation, and maintain\n      cardiovascular function to maintain organ perfusion.\n\n      Despite optimal care, organ dysfunction is present in many patients as evidenced by\n      persistent lactic acidosis.  Blood transfusions are intended to improve circulation of\n      oxygen-carrying red blood cells, but are frequently insufficient, even when the hemoglobin\n      level is optimized.  The severity of lactic acidosis in trauma victims has also been shown\n      to correlate with worse outcome.\n\n      Support for the proposed application for MP4OX as a therapeutic adjunct to standard\n      treatment of severe hemorrhage shock, is based on multiple preclinical studies in different\n      animal models of hemorrhagic shock resuscitation. These preclinical studies demonstrated\n      that survival was greater and restoration of acid-base status and hemodynamics were improved\n      with MP4OX. The benefits of MP4OX in animals were observed with or without co-administration\n      of autologous blood, demonstrating that red cell transfusion alone was insufficient, and\n      that the effects of MP4OX were additive.\n\n      The hypothesis for the current study is that MP4OX will enhance perfusion and oxygenation of\n      ischemic organs and thereby prevent and reduce the duration of organ failure and improve\n      morbidity and mortality outcome measures."
