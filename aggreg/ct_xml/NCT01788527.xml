  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine if RT CGM (Real Time-Continuous Glucose
      Monitoring) can improve glycemic control in women with T1D who are pregnant or planning
      pregnancy without substantially increasing the rate of hypoglycemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In women with diabetes, hyperglycemia is associated with increased rates of numerous
      maternal and fetal adverse outcomes.  Mothers are at increased risk of preeclampsia,
      polyhydramnios, and caesarean sections.  Infants of mothers with diabetes have increased
      rates of congenital anomalies, premature delivery, macrosomia, stillbirth and NICU
      admissions. Macrosomia itself is associated with numerous adverse fetal outcomes including
      shoulder dystocia, birth injury, neonatal hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, respiratory
      distress syndrome and NICU admissions, asphyxia and death.  Postprandial blood sugars in
      particular have been associated with increased macrosomia rates.

      Numerous studies have shown that pregnancy outcomes can be reduced with improved glycemic
      control. In particular, pre-pregnancy care has been shown to assist women improve glucose
      control during the crucial period of organogenesis, and is associated with reduced rates of
      adverse pregnancy outcome including major congenital malformation, stillbirth and neonatal
      death.

      Technological advances aimed at reducing glycemic excursions and improving glucose control
      in patients with diabetes include the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. We
      hypothesize that real-time CGM will assist women with type 1 diabetes to improve their
      glycemic control before and during pregnancy.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and using daily insulin therapy for at least
             one year

          -  Age 18-40 years

          -  Insulin regimen involves either the use of an insulin pump or multiple daily
             injections of insulin (at least 3 shots per day).  Subjects using premixed fixed
             doses of insulin at the time of enrolment will not be eligible. Insulin regimen must
             be stable for at least 4 weeks (i.e. on multiple insulin injections or on insulin
             pump) prior to randomization.

          -  No expectation that subject will be moving out of the area of the clinical center
             during the next year, unless the move will be to an area served by another study
             center

          -  Informed Consent Form signed by the subject

        In addition, specific eligibility criteria apply to the respective groups:

        Pre-pregnancy Group:

          -  Patients who are planning pregnancy and wish to optimise glycemic control before
             conception

        Pregnancy Group:

          -  Pregnancy gestation ≤13 weeks, 6 days at time of randomization

          -  Live singleton fetus

          -  Dating ultrasound (US) done to confirm gestational age, viability and rule out
             multiples. Gestational age will be based on the last menstrual period (LMP) provided
             there is a ≤5 day discrepancy with US dates in the first trimester and ≤10 day
             discrepancy with US dates in the second trimester.  If the dates from LMP are outside
             these limits, the US dates will be used as the best estimate of gestational age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Type 2 diabetes

          -  Gestational diabetes

          -  Regular home user of RT-CGM in the previous 3 months

          -  Previous participation in the study

          -  Estimated GFR &lt;60 ml/min/1.73

          -  The presence of a significant medical disorder or use of a medication such as oral
             glucocorticoids that in the judgment of the investigator will affect the wearing of
             the sensors or the completion of any aspect of the protocol.

        If the investigator is uncertain whether the patient would be eligible; i.e. if the
        medical disorder would constitute an exclusion, the Steering Committee will be asked to
        make the decision.

          -  Inpatient psychiatric treatment in the past 6 months

          -  Subjects using premixed fixed doses of insulin at the time of enrolment

        In addition, specific exclusion criteria apply to the respective groups:

        Pre-pregnancy Group:

          -  HbA1c &lt;7.0% or &gt;10.0%

        Pregnancy Group:

          -  HbA1c &lt;6.5% or &gt;10.0%

          -  Known current higher order pregnancies (twins, triplets, etc.) These women will be
             excluded as they have a higher rate of adverse outcomes and could lead to
             inequalities if they are unequally distributed between the groups.

          -  Known potentially major fetal anomaly (as per EUROCAT criteria).
