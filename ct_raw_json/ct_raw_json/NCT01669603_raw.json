Current treatments for the common cold that have proven\n      efficacy are limited to pharmacologic agents that are directed at specific symptoms.  These\n      treatments- antihistamines, nasal decongestants and analgesics- have limited effectiveness,\n      generally relieving the target symptom by 15-25% at the peak of activity, and are associated\n      with bothersome side effects.  There are no currently effective treatments for prevention of\n      rhinovirus infections.\n\n      Probiotics have been defined by FAO/WHO as \"Live microorganisms which when administered in\n      adequate amount confer a health benefit on a host.\" The most common probiotics belong to\n      Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium genera. Bifidobacteria are natural human gut inhabitants\n      that were discovered over a hundred years ago from the feces of breast-fed infants. The\n      study product Bifidobacterium animalis subspecies (subsp.) lactis Bl-04 (Bl-04) has been\n      genetically characterized as B. animalis subsp. lactis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and full\n      genome sequence comparison. Bl-04 has been deposited in the American Type Culture\n      Collections safe deposit as SD5219.\n\n      This study will test the hypothesis that ingestion of a probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis\n      subsp. lactis Bl-04 will alter the innate and adaptive host response to rhinovirus\n      infection."
