Determine the maximum tolerated dose of gadolinium texaphyrin in patients\n      with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic or periampullary adenocarcinoma undergoing\n      local regional radiotherapy. II. Determine the toxic effects of gadolinium texaphyrin with\n      concurrent radiotherapy in these patients. III. Correlate estimates of tumor and normal\n      organ gadolinium texaphyrin uptake and retention over time by MRI with plasma/serum levels\n      in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive gadolinium texaphyrin IV over\n      5-10 minutes 4 times weekly at least 2 hours prior to external beam radiotherapy over 2.5\n      weeks (total of 10 fractions). Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated at escalating doses of\n      gadolinium texaphyrin. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the highest dose level in\n      which dose limiting toxicity occurs in no more than 2 of 6 patients. Patients are followed\n      once monthly for 2 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 evaluable patients will be accrued for this study within\n      18-24 months."
