  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) results from the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing
      ß cells. Although exogenous insulin is widely available, it is not possible for affected
      individuals to consistently achieve euglycemia with current technology, and thus they are at
      risk for devastating long-term complications. This phase II study is designed to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of imatinib mesylate as a novel therapy for new-onset T1DM. Imatinib
      is a first-in-class tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

      This study will explore the potential role of short-term therapy with imatinib to induce
      tolerance and possibly lead to a durable long-term remission of T1DM.

      Eligible participants will be randomized to receive either imatinib mesylate or placebo
      daily.

      All participants randomized into this study will be seen at a study site for a follow-up
      evaluation, 2 weeks and 4 weeks after randomization, and every month month thereafter for
      the first year. Participants will come in for a visit ever 6 months for the second year.

      At the study visits, participants will undergo assessments of their insulin production,
      immunologic status, and overall health. Subjects will be followed until the conclusion of
      the study. The trial is expected to last approximately 2-4 years or until the required
      amount of information is gathered.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females age 12-45 years of age who meet the ADA standard T1DM criteria1.
             Positive for at least one islet cell autoantibody. Initial enrollment will be for
             subjects ages 18-45, with the goal to lower the age down to 12 upon acceptable safety
             review and prospect of benefit for this initial older cohort.

          -  Diagnosis of T1DM within 100 days of Visit 0.

          -  Peak stimulated C-peptide level &gt;0.2 pmol/mL following an MMTT.

          -  Participants of childbearing age who are sexually active must agree to use an
             effective form of birth control (e.g., barrier method, oral contraception, or
             surgery). For females, these contraceptive measures must be maintained throughout the
             study; for males these measures must be followed for a minimum of 3 months after
             discontinuation of imatinib therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior history of any significant cardiac disease such as congestive heart failure,
             myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, or structural defects or suspicion thereof.

          -  Leukopenia (&lt;3,000 leukocytes/μL), neutropenia (&lt;1,500 neutrophils/μL), or
             thrombocytopenia (&lt;125,000 platelets/μL).

          -  Low Hemoglobin (baseline hemoglobin below lower limit of normal)

          -  Prior history of anaphylaxis, angioedema or serious cutaneous drug reactions

          -  Any sign of significant chronic active infection (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis, EBV,
             CMV, or toxoplasmosis), or screening laboratory evidence consistent with a
             significant chronic active infection (such as positive for HIV, PPD, or HBSAg).
             Significant acute infections must be resolved before treatment may commence, e.g.,
             acute respiratory tract, urinary tract, or gastrointestinal tract infections.

          -  Anticipated ongoing use of diabetes medications other than insulin that affect
             glucose homeostasis, such as metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones,
             glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) mimetics, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV)
             inhibitors, or amylin.

          -  Prior or current treatment that is known to cause a significant, ongoing change in
             the course of T1DM or immunologic status, including high-dose inhaled, extensive
             topical or systemic glucocorticoids.

          -  Evidence of liver dysfunction, with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST) &gt;2.0 times the upper limit of normal persistent for 1 week or
             greater.

          -  Evidence of renal insufficiency as indicated by serum creatinine &gt; 1.2 times the
             upper limit of normal and confirmed in a repeat test at least one week apart.
             Evidence of clinically significant metabolic bone disease (except adequately treated
             rickets).

          -  Females who are pregnant at the time of screening or unwilling to defer pregnancy
             during the 24-month study period.

          -  Prior treatment with imatinib or related tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

          -  Unable to avoid medications that affect CYP3A4: either inducers that may decrease
             imatinib levels, or inhibitors that may increase drug concentrations. (Refer to
             section 1.5.1.12 for a complete list of inducers and inhibitors.)

          -  Height standard deviation score ≥2 standard deviations below mean

          -  Any sign of QT prolongation on Visit -1 noted on ECG (&gt; 450 ms in males and &gt; 470 ms
             in females)

          -  Known coagulation disorders or use of anticoagulants

          -  Current and anticipated on-going treatment with drugs that may increase or decrease
             imatinib plasma concentrations (CYP3A4 family inhibitors or inducers) or drugs that
             may have their plasma concentration altered by imatinib (drugs metabolized by
             CYP3A4/5 and CYP2D6).

          -  Any condition that, in the investigator's opinion, may compromise study participation
             or may confound the interpretation of the study results.
