  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to create a registry to help us learn more about germ cell tumors
      (GCT) and other testicular tumors. The registry will include people with these tumors and
      also relatives and unrelated people without these tumors. This study will help us learn more
      about the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of these tumors. Studying relatives
      of patients and people unrelated to patients with GCT and other testicular tumors will help
      us understand why some people get these tumors and why some people don't.

        At MSKCC, the following outpatient clinics will be used to recruit GCT and testicular
        tumor cases and controls: Urology (Department of Surgery), Gynecologic Oncology
        (Department of Surgery) Clinical Genetics, Genitourinary Oncology (Department of
        Medicine), and Gynecologic Medical Oncology (Department of Medicine).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Case Cohort

          -  Must be ≥ 18 years of age AND

          -  Must be an English-speaker AND

          -  Must have a diagnosis or suspicion of germ cell tumor and/or a testicular mass

        Family Member Cohort

          -  Must be ≥ 18 years of age AND

          -  Must be an English-speaker AND

          -  Must be a blood relative of the proband. Family members of probands are eligible.
             These individuals need not have a diagnosis of GCT-TT, as they will be used for
             segregation analysis of suspected variants found in the proband.

        Control Cohort

          -  Must be ≥ 18 years of age AND

          -  Must be an English-speaker AND

               -  Must not have a personal history of cancer, with the exception of nonmelanoma
                  skin cancer, AND

          -  Must not be a blood relative of any cases or controls enrolled in this study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who, in the opinion of the primary MSKCC clinician or the investigator, have
             a condition that precludes their ability to provide an informed consent
