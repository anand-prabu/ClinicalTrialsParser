  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Field tests are convenient, simple tests that serve as estimates of components of athletic
      performance like power speed, and agility. It is thought clinically, that those who do best
      at these tests will perform the best in their sport and/or be the least likely to get
      injured. The converse is also thought to be true. The objective of this study is to
      administer field tests to athletes at the beginning of each season and then follow athletes
      over several years, tracking their injuries and their performance statistics. In this way,
      the investigators can determine if the clinical supposition is true and that the results of
      field tests are associated with injury or performance
