The presurgical mapping of eloquent areas with\n      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is helpful to plan the surgery. BOLD fMRI is\n      now the gold standard to map language areas. However, BOLD signal is diminished near the\n      brain tumor. It is now possible to detect cortical activation with arterial spin labeling\n      (ASL) techniques, detecting variations of perfusion during an activation paradigm (fASL),\n      fASL could be interesting to detect eloquent areas near a brain tumor."
