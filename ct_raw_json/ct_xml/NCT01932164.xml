  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to perform the bone tissue engineering to reconstruct the alveolar
      bone defect in cleft lip and palate patients using mesenchymal stem cells from deciduous
      dental pulp associated with a collagen and hydroxyapatite biomaterial (Geistlich Bio-Oss®)
      through prospective qualitative and quantitative analysis of bone neoformation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The reconstruction of the craniofacial skeleton in development between 2 and 10 years old,
      remains a major challenge for reconstructive plastic surgery. Local autogenous bone is
      practically unavailable, the distant bone graft has significant morbidity and use of
      alloplastic materials is incompatible with the growing facial skeleton. With the advent of
      bioengineered tissue, however, osteogenesis induced by the use of mesenchymal stem cells
      associated with biomaterials has become a potential solution to the shortage bone-related
      morbidity and donor bone in the region in pediatric patients.

      The association of mesenchymal stem  cells to biomaterials has provided new bone formation
      and a significant reduction of morbidity, for rehabilitation of the alveolar bone in
      patients with cleft lip palate.

      To perform the rehabilitation of alveolar bone cleft, other donor regions of bone (iliac
      crest, ribs, skull) suffer morbidity for obtaining bone to be used in alveolar bone
      grafting. In order to eliminate the morbidity at the  bone  donor region for these patients
      and reduce costs of patient permanence in the operating room  the aim of this study is  to
      perform the bone tissue engineering to reconstruct the alveolar bone defect in cleft lip and
      palate patients using mesenchymal stem cells from deciduous dental pulp associated with a
      collagen  and hydroxyapatite biomaterial (Geistlich Bio-Oss®) through prospective
      qualitative and quantitative analysis of bone neoformation.
