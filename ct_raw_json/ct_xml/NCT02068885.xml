      This study will evaluate the effects of dietary composition on energy expenditure and
      chronic disease risk factors, while also exploring physiological mechanisms underlying these
      effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many overweight and obese people can lose weight for a few months, but most have difficulty
      maintaining weight loss over the long term. One explanation for the poor long-term outcome
      of weight-loss diets relates to behavior, in that motivation to adhere to restrictive
      regimens typically diminishes with time. An alternative explanation is that weight loss
      elicits biological adaptations - specifically a decline in energy expenditure and an
      increase in hunger - that promote weight regain. The purpose of this study is to evaluate
      the effects of dietary composition on energy expenditure and risk for chronic diseases,
      while also exploring physiological mechanisms underlying these effects. The study will be
      performed in collaboration with Framingham State University, providing a novel and feasible
      method for feeding subjects in dining halls and monitoring compliance.

      Following 12±2% weight loss on a standard run-in diet, 150 adults (aged 18 to 55 years) will
      be randomly assigned to one of three weight-loss maintenance diets controlled for protein
      content (20% of energy) and varying widely in dietary carbohydrate-to-fat ratio:
      Low-carbohydrate (15% of energy from carbohydrate, 65% fat), Moderate- carbohydrate (40%
      carbohydrate, 40% fat), High-carbohydrate (60% carbohydrate, 20% fat). During the
      weight-loss maintenance phase, energy intake will be adjusted to prevent changes in body
      weight. The primary outcome will be change in total energy expenditure (indirect calorimetry
      using stable isotopes) at 20 weeks. Secondary outcomes during weight maintenance will
      include energy intake, resting energy expenditure (indirect calorimetry using respiratory
      gas exchange), physical activity (accelerometry), measures of insulin resistance and
      skeletal muscle work efficiency, components of the metabolic syndrome, and hormonal and
      metabolic measures that might inform an understanding of physiological mechanisms. We also
      will assess voluntary food intake and weight change during a 2-week ad libitum feeding
      phase, as an objective measure of dietary effects on hunger. The analytic framework for
      addressing study hypothesis will be repeated-measures analysis of variance, with adjustment
      for covariates (sex, race, ethnicity, age, anthropometrics). We also will test each
      covariate for effect modification (covariate × diet interaction).
