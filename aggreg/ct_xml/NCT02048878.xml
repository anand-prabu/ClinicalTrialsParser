  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether individuals with insomnia have a higher
      degree of physiologic arousal (resulting in their trouble sleeping) than good sleepers.
      Physiologic arousal will be measured by analyzing the brain waves during wake and during
      sleep, the heart rate during wake and during sleep and activity in a nerve of the leg.

    <description>The EEG will be measured continuously during sleep and at frequent intervals during wake.  The signal will be submitted to power spectral analysis to examine spectral power in frequency bands that are typical of arousal and in frequency bands that are typical of deep sleep.</description>

    <description>Assessment of physiologic hyper-arousal across the two following domains:
Neurophysiologic arousal:  recording of multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), recording of wake electroencephalography (EEG), and quantitative sleep EEG recording and analysis.
Sympathetic neural activity:  recording at the level of the muscle by microneurography and at the level of the heart by spectral analysis of heart rate variability from the ECG signal obtained during sleep and wakefulness.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:• Men and women with primary insomnia of at least 3 months in duration

          -  ages 21-65 years old

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) &lt;30 kg/m2 to enable microneurography

          -  Moderate to severe insomnia based on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)
             questionnaire34

          -  Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index35 (PSQI) &gt; 5

          -  Sleep efficiency on overnight screening of brain waves (PSG) during sleep recording
             with total recording time (TRT) of 8 hours &lt;80%

          -  Self-reported habitual sleep duration &lt; 6.5 hours

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Sleep disorders other than insomnia as assessed by screening PSG (apnea-hypopnea
             index or apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 5, periodic leg movement (PLM) arousal index ≥
             5)

             mania or alcohol or substance abuse

          -  A Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) questionnaire score of 16
             or greater, indicating clinically significant depression36

          -  Unstable or serious medical conditions

          -  Current, or use within the past month, of psychoactive, hypnotic, stimulant or
             analgesic medications (except occasional non-narcotic analgesics), beta blockers or
             alpha blockers

          -  Shift work or other types of self imposed irregular sleep schedules

          -  A history of habitual smoking (6 or more cigarettes per week) or caffeine consumption
             of greater than 300 mg per day

          -  More than 2 alcoholic drinks per day

          -  Pregnancy
