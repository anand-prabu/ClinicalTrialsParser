            "textblock": "Psychological therapies for depression have demonstrated efficacy, but outcomes are still\n      unsatisfactory, especially in cases with high comorbidity. Depression and anxiety co-occur\n      in up to 69-75% of teens and intensify functional impairment and service use. This study\n      will develop treatment materials for a transdiagnostic Group Behavioral Activation Therapy\n      (GBAT) and conduct a pilot waitlist-controlled school-based study with 35 7th and 8th grade\n      boys and girls with co-occurring depression and anxiety. Multi-reporter, multi-domain\n      assessments will be conducted at initial screening, pre- and post-treatment, and 4-month\n      follow-up. BA is a straightforward, but flexible and robust, therapy that has demonstrated\n      strong results in adults. Current formulations of BA highlight the specific role of\n      avoidance in depressotypic behavior. It presumes that anhedonia, isolation, and negative\n      behaviors associated with depression function to avoid imminent distress even as it blocks\n      access to otherwise available positive reinforcement. This study will therefore employ novel\n      electronic diary technology to obtain Ecological Momentary Assessment and evaluate: (a) the\n      function of avoidance in distinguishing youth with depression (n=35) from a non-clinical\n      comparison group (n=18), and (b) the role of avoidance in mediating treatment gains in\n      participants in the GBAT intervention."

            "textblock": "Specific Aims and Hypotheses:\n\n      This study will develop treatment materials for a transdiagnostic Group Behavioral\n      Activation Therapy (GBAT). It will then conduct a double-gated screening of middle-school\n      students (N=895) to identify youth with subclinical or clinical DSM-IV-TR anxiety or mood\n      disorders. Eligible youth (N=35) will then participate in a randomized clinical trial of\n      GBAT where 21 will be randomly assigned to GBAT and 14 to a 15-week waitlist period. This\n      addresses critical needs to develop first-line early interventions that are evidence-based\n      and can efficiently address commonly co-occurring problems in settings where treatment is\n      needed most.\n\n      Aim 1. To develop treatment materials and test GBAT's feasibility (e.g., recruitment and\n      retention rates, therapist adherence) and acceptability to youth participants (client\n      satisfaction, group cohesion, homework completion).\n\n      Aim 2. To estimate initial efficacy of GBAT compared to a waitlist (WL) control in a\n      randomized pilot study with 35 youth (21 assigned to two GBAT groups; 14 assigned to WL). It\n      is hypothesized that GBAT will show greater pre- to post-treatment outcomes on primary\n      (clinical diagnosis, symptom severity) and secondary measures (achievement of target goals,\n      reduced avoidance, social and academic adjustment). Youth who receive GBAT will also show\n      linear improvement on outcome measures from pretreatment through four-month follow-up.\n\n      A second major goal of the project is to understand the functional role of avoidance in\n      depression. Participating youth will carry Electronic Diaries (EDs; i.e., ipod touch)\n      throughout the active treatment and follow-up phases and complete twice-daily reports of\n      negative events, emotional and behavioral responses, and perceived function of one's\n      responses. A non-clinical comparison group (n=18) will also carry EDs during a two-week\n      period. Such Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data has been used effectively with youth\n      populations to determine the impact of positive and negative coping responses on depressive\n      symptoms.\n\n      Aim 3. The research suggests that depressed youth seek out depressogenic activities and\n      respond less to positive events. Based on EMA data, the study hypothesizes that, compared to\n      non-clinical comparisons: (a) depressed youth will identify more events as negative during\n      the day, (b) depressed youth will respond with greater negativity than non-depressed youth,\n      (c) the coping strategies used will be more avoidant or aimed at disengagement, and (d) the\n      function of these strategies will be to minimize distress and conflict. Furthermore, youth\n      who receive GBAT, compared to WL participants, will demonstrate increased ratio of\n      engagement-based to avoidance-based coping strategies from pre- to post-treatment and 4-mo\n      FU."
