      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of combining metformin and
      atorvastatin treatment in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer during the interval
      between breast biopsy and surgery. Metformin is a medication used to treat patients with
      diabetes. It has been shown to have anti-tumor properties in breast cancer. Atorvastatin is
      widely used for the treatment of elevated cholesterol and has also shown to have anti-tumor
      properties in breast cancer. Both have safely been used in patients without diabetes or
      elevated cholesterol. This study will assess the impact of combined metformin and
      atorvastatin on breast tumor tissue markers as well as blood levels, including cholesterol
      and insulin. Both medications will be given for two weeks prior to your scheduled breast
      surgery.

    <textblock>
      Utilizing a pre-surgical model, we plan to conduct a pilot study of 40 women with newly
      diagnosed invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) who will receive oral
      metformin and atorvastatin daily for at least two weeks, in the interval between diagnostic
      breast biopsy and definitive breast surgery. In this pre-surgical trial, patients will
      receive metformin and atorvastatin at bedtime. Women with histologically-confirmed invasive
      breast cancer or DCIS will be recruited by the medical oncologist and will start the dual
      therapy at least two weeks prior to their scheduled surgery.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate changes in tissue levels of the
      proliferation marker Ki-67. These will be compared to a) historical control group of
      metformin treated patients and b) historical control matched by age, body mass index, and
      tumor stage who did not receive metformin or statin.  Secondary endpoints include assessment
      of changes in protein expression of AMPK/mTOR signaling; modulation of apoptosis markers
      such as bax, bid, and various caspase levels; and changes in fasting serum markers of the
      insulin growth factor pathway such as insulin, glucose, and lipids.  The goal is to
      determine if dual combination treatment with metformin plus atorvastatin significantly
      impacts tumor-based markers, such as proliferation, and blood-based biomarkers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female subjects with histologically-confirmed operable invasive breast cancer or

          -  Treatment with other investigational drugs within 6 months of study entry

          -  Strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, and
