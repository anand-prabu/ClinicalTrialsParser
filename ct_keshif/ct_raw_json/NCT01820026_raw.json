            "textblock": "Bacterial infections are a frequent complication in liver cirrhosis with a bad prognosis.\n      However, the clinical outcome of cirrhotic patients with serious infections is significantly\n      improved over the last 30 years due to early diagnosis and to the use of a more appropriate\n      antibiotic therapy.\n\n      As in the general population, empirical treatment should be initiated soon after diagnosis,\n      after making the necessary sampling and should be based on the use of an antibiotic with low\n      toxicity and broad spectrum antibacterial efficacy, taking into account the local\n      epidemiology and prevalence of antibiotic resistance.\n\n      The third generation cephalosporins are considered the gold standard in the treatment of\n      most infections in cirrhotics due to their effectiveness against enterobacteriaceae and\n      against non-enterococcal streptococci and due to their low toxicity.\n\n      However, the recommendations for the antibiotic therapy are currently based on results of\n      trials of '80s and '90s, when the proportion of resistant pathogens was lower. Similarly to\n      nosocomial infections, the increasing rate of infections due to multidrug resistant (MDR)\n      bacteria represents the rational for a different choice of empirical antibiotic therapy with\n      a higher  resistance barrier. This change in the epidemiology of community acquired\n      infections is mainly due to the increased contacts with healthcare system of these patients\n      and for the larger use of antibiotic prophylaxis. With this regard, it was recently proposed\n      to introduce a third epidemiological class of infection \"Health care-associated\": Infections\n      occurring in community in patients who have been in contact with the health system shortly\n      before the infection.\n\n      This epidemiological class of infection should be distinguished from \"community-acquired\"\n      because they are more similar to\"nosocomial\" in terms of their sensitivity to antibiotics.\n      Therefore for this class should be taken into consideration the use of a different empirical\n      antibiotic therapy.\n\n      The investigators aim was to evaluate prospectively the effectiveness of a broad spectrum\n      antibiotic treatment in a cohort of cirrhotic patients with\n      \"healthcare-Associated\"infections\n\n      Cirrhotic patients with \"Healthcare Associated\" admitted to the gastroenterology department\n      of the Policlinico Umberto I and in the Department of Hepatology of the Hospital of Marino\n      will be consecutively enrolled.\n\n      Randomized controlled trial with randomisation stratified by epidemiological class of\n      infection."
