            "textblock": "Introduction:\n\n      The coronary and peripheral vasodilatory properties of levosimendan has recently been\n      investigated in patients with heart failure. It is considered as a promising alternative to\n      conventional  inotropic   agents  for  patients  with  low  LVEF. However, the  effects  of\n      levosimendan on renal functions in patients undergoing open heart surgeries with CPB are not\n      well studied in randomized clinical trials.\n\n      The primary goal of our study was to investigate the effects of levosimendan on 1- renal\n      function by evaluation of serum creatinine (mg/dL) values and calculated estimated\n      glomerular filtration(eGFR)(ml/min/1.73 m2) rates.\n\n      Our secondary goal was to determine clinical outcomes including;\n\n      1-need for renal replacement therapy (RRT)  in  patients with low ejection fraction\n      undergoing  mitral valve repair or replacement surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).\n\n      Inclusion and exclusion criterions include as listed below. Patients included into the study\n      had a diagnosis of mitral valve insufficiency with or without coronary artery disease and a\n      left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of \u2264 45 %.\n\n      Exclusion criteria were unstable angina, diabetes mellitus treated with insulin, clinical\n      findings of acute or chronic renal failure  (serum creatinine (sCr)> 1.5  mg/dL),  severe\n      hepatic  disease  (alanine  aminotransferase  or  aspartate aminotransferase > 100 U\n      litre/L), severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (forced expired volume in 1 s < 50 %\n      of predicted or < 2.0 litre), a history of prior coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery\n      or myocardial infarction (MI) within the previous month, emergent operations, patients on\n      inotropic support before operation, aortic valvular disease, and infective endocarditis.\n\n      The study protocol:\n\n      The patients will be randomized into two groups. Randomization into two groups was performed\n      using sealed envelopes and the sequentially numbered assignments of the participant which\n      will be concealed in an envelope and will be opened  after anesthesia induction by a health\n      care personnel. The observers will be blinded  to the inotropic protocol. Caregivers will\n      not be blinded, but they will not participate in data collection or data interpretation.\n\n      In the levosimendan group, a loading it of levosimendan (6 \u03bcg/kg) will be  administered\n      after removal of the aortic cross-clamp, followed by an infusion of levosimendan at a dose\n      of  0.1 \u03bcg/kg/min in addition to standard inotropic therapy (one or more agent including;\n      dobutamine, epinephrine or norepinephrine)for 24 hours. In the control group, only standard\n      inotropic therapy will be administered.\n\n      The need for renal replacement therapy (RRT)will be provided to all patients under the\n      following criterions: 1- when urine output was less than 100 mL within the last 8 hours, 2-\n      with no response to 50 mg intravenous dose of furosemide, 3- urine sodium concentration\n      should be > 40 milliequivalent/liter (mEq/L) before administration of furosemide, 4- blood\n      urea nitrogen (BUN) level > 50 mg/dl 5-additional presence of one or more of the following\n      factors such as; a- increase in serum creatinine level > 50% from preoperative value, b-\n      presence of metabolic acidosis, c- presence of hypervolemia, d- presence of hyperkalemia\n      (potassium ion level > 5 Meq/L).\n\n      The study parameters:\n\n      The demographic data includes; age, weight, height, body mass index and gender.   The\n      cardiovascular   risk   factors   including;   diabetes   mellitus,   hypertension,\n      hypercholesterolemia, obesity, history of smoking  as well as  history of chronic\n      obstructive  pulmonary disease and peripheral vascular disease were sought.\n\n      Echocardiographic data were  performed to evaluate the ejection fraction and valvular\n      functions by the same cardiologist using a Vivid 3 echocardiography device (Healthcare\n      General Electronics,Hamburg,Germany) before operation  and on  first hour, 12 and 24 hour\n      after operation.\n\n      Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is defined by a mean pulmonary  artery pressure (MPAP) >25 mmHg\n      at rest. The diagnosis of PH depends on direct measurement of the mean PAP by right heart\n      catheterization. However, we used Doppler echocardiographic study to provide an estimate of\n      the pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP)and mean PAP is calculated with the formula:\n      mean PAP = 0.65 PASP + 0.55 mmHg.\n\n      The risk of operation  will be evaluated using the European System for the Cardiac Operation\n      Risk Evaluation scale (EuroSCORE).\n\n      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined as increase in serum creatinine from baseline by > 50 %\n       within 48 hours postoperatively.\n\n      SCr  levels will be collected on preoperative and postoperative days 1, 3 and 10 and and\n      eGFR will be calculated according to the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease\n      (MDRD) equation."
