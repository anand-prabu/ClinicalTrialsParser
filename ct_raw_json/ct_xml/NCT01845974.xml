  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is examining data elements of hemodynamic, electrophysiologic and electrolyte
      trends comparing 2 different types of catheters used during a procedure to treat medication
      resistant atrial fibrillation- an irregular heart beat- called radiofrequency catheter
      ablation. A high flow catheter delivers a higher volume of saline during the procedure.  The
      low flow catheter delivers a lower volume of saline during the procedure.  The patient will
      be consented and randomized to one of the 2 groups using a computer generated randomization
      chart.  Those that are put in the low flow catheter group will be considered the
      experimental group.  All data will be collected before and after the procedure and each
      patient will act as their own control within each group. The hypothesis is that using a
      lower flow catheter will cause less hemodynamic, electrolyte, and electrophysiologic
      derangements resulting in better patient outcomes and fewer complications

    <description>This is a pilot study designed to discern if trends in hemodynamic changes related to relatively high as compared to relatively low cardiac volume loading can be demonstrated. If relevant trends are observed, we would anticipate performing a larger trial sufficiently powered to analyze these differences in a rigorous statistical manner.</description>
