CS is difficult to diagnose with\n      currently available methods, therefore this project will allow access to 18F FDG PET/CT\n      scanning, which may more accurately diagnose the presence of CS. This study will also\n      provide additional data to further examine the effectiveness and safety profile of 18F FDG\n      for this condition. Accurate and early detection is important to allow for better management\n      of CS and improve patient care.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to provide access to 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging in patients with\n      clinical suspicion of cardiac sarcoidosis, and to collect additional data about the safety\n      and effectiveness of 18F-FDG PET/CT in this patient population"

            "textblock": "1. Purpose:The purpose of this study is to provide access to 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging in\n           patients with clinical suspicion of cardiac sarcoidosis, and to collect additional data\n           about the safety and effectiveness of 18F-FDG PET/CT in this patient population.\n\n        2. Hypothesis:18F-FDG PET/CT has greater sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy compared\n           to the current clinical gold standard of diagnosis for CS, the Japanese Ministry of\n           Health, Labour, and Welfare (MHLW) guidelines\n\n        3. Justification:Currently a clinical diagnosis CS is diagnosed using a combination of\n           diagnostic techniques including imaging and biopsy. Biopsies are challenging as it can\n           be difficult to locate the disease or access the desired biopsy location. MRI has been\n           proven effective but it is limited as patients with pacemakers and\n           cardioverter-defibrillators or patients with renal impairments are unable to have an\n           MRI. Finally radionuclide scintigraphy with Gallium-67 or Thallium-201 (201Tl) has been\n           useful, but can be non-specific for sarcoidosis. 18F-FDG PET/CT has significant\n           advantages over other radionuclide imaging modalities due to superior resolution of PET\n           coupled with the affinity of inflammatory cardiac tissue to metabolize FDG. 18F-FDG\n           PET/CT has been found to have higher sensitivity and specificity over other\n           conventionally used imaging modalities.\n\n        4. Research Method:This will be an expanded access study in which adult subjects with a\n           clinical suspicion of CS will be invited to participate, in order to identify potential\n           sites for biopsy or provide confirmation of the presence of CS. Based on population\n           extrapolation from all diagnosed or suspected cases of CS in British Columbia (BC), as\n           well as expert clinical opinion, it is estimated that 10 to 15 patients per year will\n           be enrolled in the study. Over a three year period, the expected sample size will be 30\n           - 45 patients. All subjects will receive an 18F-FDG PET/CT at the BC Cancer Agency\n           (BCCA) - Vancouver Centre.\n\n        5. Statistical Analysis:The planned sample size is 30-45 patients. The primary endpoint is\n           to provide PET/CT imaging to patients diagnosed with or suspected of CS. The secondary\n           end-point will be to assess the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 18F-FDG PET in\n           BC population. Confidence intervals of 95% will be used to assess this using exact\n           binomial distribution. All analyses will be performed in direct consultation with a\n           qualified statistician.\n\n      Sensitivity (ratio of true positive lesions to total positive lesions), specificity (ratio\n      of true negative lesions to total negative lesions) and accuracy (ratio of total correct\n      studies to the total number of biopsied lesions) of 18F-FDG PET studies performed by the\n      BCCA will be obtained by comparing results of the PET scan with a composite of the outcome\n      of clinical examinations, histopathological diagnosis, if those results are available, and\n      results of all other available imaging (cardiac MRI, 201Tl, 67Ga). Confidence intervals (95%\n      CI) for sensitivity, specificity and accuracy will be calculated using exact binomial\n      distribution."
