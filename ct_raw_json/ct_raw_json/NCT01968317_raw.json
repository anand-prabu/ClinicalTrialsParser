Age, waist\n      circumstances, blood pressure, basic history of infertility, blood pressure, serum lipid\n      level and side effects will be collected. Blood tests, including triglycerides, high density\n      lipoprotein-cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, liver and kidney function will be performed\n      before treatment to evacuate their metabolic conditions.\n\n      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups. Patients will receive metformin 500 mg\n      by mouth third daily and megestrol acetate 150 mg by mouth daily for 3 months on Arm I.\n      Patients will receive megestrol acetate 150 mg PO daily for 3 months on Arm II. Then an\n      hysteroscope will be used to evaluate the endometrial condition, and the findings will be\n      recorded. For patients with EAH, complete response (CR) is defined as the reversion of\n      endometrial atypical hyperplasia to proliferative or secretory endometrium; partial response\n      (PR) is defined as regression to simple or complex hyperplasia without atypia; no response\n      (NR) is defined as the persistence of the disease; and progressive disease (PD) is defined\n      as the appearance of endometrial cancer in patients. EAH after treatment will be defined as\n      PR in patients with EC. Continuous therapies will be needed in PR, NR or PD.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, 3 months of maintenance treatment will be recommended\n      for patients with CR, and they will be followed up for 2 years.\n\n      In addition, we've already had a pilot study in 19 patients primarily diagnosed of\n      endometrial atypical hyperplasia from August  2012 to April 2013. 10 patients were in Arm I\n      and 9 patients were in Arm II. Metabolic syndrome were evaluated among all subjects. After\n      treatment, megestrol acetate plus metformin worked better than megestrol acetate alone. But\n      two arms showed no difference in NR patients, which may suggest metformin just worked as an\n      antitumor drug more than an insulin sensitizer. More supportive researches are needed to\n      verify it."
