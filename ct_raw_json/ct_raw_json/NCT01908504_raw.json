The information from the PET-CT may allow the investigators to change the\n      radiation plan or the delivery of the radiation to the tumor/tumor site such as the total\n      dose of radiation or the size of the area to receive further radiation. Presently the use of\n      PET scans to adjust radiation therapy during radiation treatment is not standard of care and\n      is being investigated in this study."

The CT scan \u2014 also called computerized tomography or just CT \u2014 combines a series of X-ray views taken from many different angles to produce cross-sectional images of the bones and soft tissues inside the body. A PET is a highly specialized imaging technique that uses short-lived radioactive substances (such as FDG a simple sugar labeled with a radioactive atom) to produce three-dimensional colored images of those substances functioning within the body. These images are called PET scans and the technique is termed PET scanning. PET scanning provides information about the body's chemistry not available through other procedures. Unlike CT or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), techniques that look at anatomy or body form, PET studies metabolic activity or body function.",
