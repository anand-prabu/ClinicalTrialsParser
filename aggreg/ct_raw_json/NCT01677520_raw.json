Fat\n      injections are used in aesthetic surgery but tend to disassemble over time.  If the\n      investigators can enhance growth and volume of fat in culture, the investigators could use\n      fat grafts in reconstruction of cancer and traumatic injury defects with the patients own\n      cultured fat cells and grafts."
