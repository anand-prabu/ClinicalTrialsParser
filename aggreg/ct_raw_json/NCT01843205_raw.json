Intensive research\n      efforts have yielded behavioral interventions that reduce methamphetamine use, however,\n      these interventions are not universally effective and treatment effects diminish over time.\n      Development of a pharmacotherapy that enhances the efficacy of these interventions is a\n      priority for the National Institute on Drug Abuse. This study proposes to determine the\n      impact of buspirone maintenance on self-administration of methamphetamine. These preliminary\n      data will be used to support further research developing buspirone as a pharmacotherapy for\n      methamphetamine use disorders. The investigators hypothesize that buspirone will attenuate\n      the reinforcing effects of methamphetamine."
