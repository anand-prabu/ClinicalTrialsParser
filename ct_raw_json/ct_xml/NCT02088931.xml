  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of the experimental therapy of a single
      infusion of Regulatory T cells (Tregs).  The investigators want to find out what effects,
      good or bad, Tregs will have on the kidney transplant patients.

      There are different types of T cells.  This study uses Regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are
      found in the blood and are part of the immune system that stops other immune cells from
      working. Tregs help to turn off the immune system after other immune cells have finished
      tackling outside infections, and Tregs keep the immune system in check so that the body does
      not attack itself. The researchers are hoping that, by giving an infusion of Tregs that the
      attack on the kidney can be stopped and kidney function will be stabilized.  It is not known
      if the Treg experimental therapy can stop the inflammation in the kidney.

      In this study, the researchers will take some of Tregs from the patient, multiply them in
      the laboratory, and then infuse them back into the patient.  The procedure used to multiply
      Tregs is an experimental process performed in the laboratory.  Similar procedures done with
      mice have been shown to reverse inflammation but it is not known whether the results will be
      the same in humans. This therapy has not yet been done in humans outside of a research
      study.

      This is an open-label single dose pilot study in which 3 subjects with inflammation on their
      6-month surveillance biopsy following renal transplantation will receive a single infusion
      of a target of 320 million cells ex vivo selected and expanded autologous polyclonal Tregs.

      At the time of Treg infusion (day 0), the maintenance immunosuppression will remain
      unchanged and consists of tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid and steroids. On the follow-up
      biopsy 2 weeks after the Treg infusion, the inflammatory load will be assessed by computer
      assisted image analysis looking at the number of infiltrating cells per square mm as well as
      the percentage of renal cortex infiltrated with lymphocytes. If the inflammatory load has
      decreased by ≥50% and infused Tregs are observed in the allograft, everolimus will be
      started at 1.5 mg bid and the dose of tacrolimus will be decreased by 50%. After 2 weeks,
      tacrolimus will be discontinued. These patients will remain on everolimus, mycophenolic acid
      and prednisone through the end of the study and the follow-up period. If on the 2-week
      follow-up biopsy, there is no decrease in the inflammatory load or there is a decrease &lt;50%,
      no change will be made to the maintenance immunosuppressive regimen consisting of
      tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid and prednisone. All prescribing physicians are enrolled in and
      will participate in the FDA Mycophenolate Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy.

      Subjects will be enrolled at 4 intervals. The first subject will receive an infusion and
      will be observed weekly until they get the biopsy 2 weeks after the infusion. The next
      patient will not be enrolled until at least 2 weeks after the biopsy. The study team (IND
      sponsor, protocol chair, and medical monitor) and the members of the DSMB will review the
      safety data and results of the 2 week biopsy of each subject prior to proceeding.

      If no grade 3 or higher related adverse event is observed related to study participation,
      subsequent subjects may be treated. Otherwise treatment will be suspended pending review.
