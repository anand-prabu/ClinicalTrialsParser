Its use is indicated after failure to harvest with\n      GCSF alone. Nevertheless, in the pediatric population its appliance is less well established\n      and the indications are less well confirmed .Several disease states and diagnoses may prompt\n      the anticipation of difficulties in harvesting stem cells using GCSF only. Such patients may\n      benefit utilizing plerixafor in first-line rather than exhausting the stem cell niche with\n      GCSF alone and only than go for plerixafor as second-line rescue procedure.\n\n      In this study we propose to examine the applicability and feasibility of harvesting\n      autologous stem cells by means of GCSF + plerixafor in first-line measure for pediatric\n      patients with specific indications."
