  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-range goal of this protocol is to more completely understand the risks and the
      pathophysiology of asthma exacerbations, in order to develop prevention strategies and/or
      expedite a return to complete control of baseline asthma symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Theinvestigators and others have shown that airway epithelial cell infection with human
      rhinovirus (HRV) is a major risk factor for subsequent exacerbation.  Additionally, the
      investigators have shown that the nucleotide receptor, P2X7, is an important host factor in
      the prevention of exacerbations, and have data to suggest that this may occur at the level
      of the alveolar macrophage.  Alveolar macrophages facilitate the resolution of inflammation
      in part by generating eicosanoid metabolites of arachidonic acid including prostaglandin E2
      (PGE2) and lipoxin A4 (LXA4). Patients with severe asthma have a reduced capacity to
      generate PGE2 and LXA4 when compared to those with non-severe asthma, despite alveolar
      macrophage expression of two of the key enzymes involved in their production.  These and
      other data suggest that pro-resolving eicosanoid metabolism is most efficient when airway
      epithelial cells are in communication with alveolar macrophages, and that these pathways may
      be defective in patients with severe asthma. Moreover, inoculation experiments with human
      rhinovirus (HRV) demonstrate that alveolar macrophages express cox-2 during resolution.
      These and other data have led to the central hypothesis that transcellular generation of
      PGE2 and lipoxins is regulated by P2X7-induced cox-2 expression in alveolar macrophages, and
      that this process facilitates resolution of an HRV-triggered exacerbation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18-55 years

          -  Diagnosis of mild asthma

          -  Pre-albuterol forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) of &gt;70% predicted.

          -  Confirmation of asthma diagnosis by either an improvement in FEV1 after four puffs of
             albuterol by ≥ 12%, or a decline in FEV1 by ≥ 20% after a graded challenge with
             inhaled methacholine with a provocative concentration causing a 20% fall ≤ 8 mg/mL

          -  Documented negative Tuberculin skin test (PPD) within the last 12 months or a medical
             history that is consistent with a low probability of exposure to tuberculosis (i.e.
             the subject is not a health worker, has not traveled to endemic areas, and has no
             pre-existing medical or social risk factors for tuberculosis).

          -  Safety laboratory assessments within normal ranges (labs to include complete blood
             count with differential and platelet count, PT/INR, creatinine, ALT)

          -  Women of child-bearing potential (WCBP) must have a negative urine pregnancy test
             (urine HCG) within 48 hours of the methacholine challenge at Visit 2, within 48 hours
             of the bronchoscopy at Visit 3 and within 48 hrs of Visit 4.  WCBP must agree to use
             a reliable method of birth control for the duration of the study (reliable methods of
             birth control can include abstinence, barrier methods, oral contraceptives, injection
             contraceptives or skin absorption contraceptives).

             diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension or lung diseases other than asthma. The listed
             health problems are definitive exclusion but decisions regarding major health
             problems not listed will be based upon the judgment of the investigator.

          -  No pre-existing chronic infectious disease.

          -  Any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, transient oxyhemoglobin
             desaturation is inadvisable.

          -  Current smokers (defined as smoked within the last year) or a former smoker with a
             history of &gt;10 pack years.

          -  Morbid obesity as defined by a Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 40.

          -  Use of an investigational drug within 30 days of entering the study

          -  History of noncompliance with medical regiments or subjects who are considered
             unreliable including those with a psychiatric history that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may interfere with the conduct of study procedures.
