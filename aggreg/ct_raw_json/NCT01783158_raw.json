The most frequent primary tumors were oropharyngeal (49/132), tumors of the oral cavity (36/132) and larynx (35/132). The majority of subjects (107/132 patients, 81.1%) had advanced HNSCC carcinomas (stages III and IV). Multiple LVLs were discovered in 24 subjects (18.2%), and no LVLs in 108 (81.8%) subjects. Fifty-five LVL biopsy specimens were obtained and assessed. Squamous cell carcinomas were detected in two patients, peptic esophagitis in 11 patients, gastric heterotopic mucosa in two patients, hyperplasia in two patients, and low- and high-grade dysplasia in three patients."

Staining of the esophagus with Lugol's solution is an\n      easy and inexpensive option and can be done in most of gastroenterology offices."
