Lillipops Iced Soothies are naturally flavoured\n      freezies developed in the United Kingdom for women with morning sickness. They are available\n      in 5 different flavours: grapefruit and tangerine, lemon and mint, chamomile and orange,\n      lime and vanilla, and ginger. The flavours are derived from steam distillation of the peels\n      (grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, orange, lime), mint leaves, and chamomile flowers to release\n      and collect their essential oils. Vanilla pods and ginger are macerated and their resin is\n      used. These flavours are chosen because they may provide relief of symptoms as they are\n      either traditional remedies for NVP, such as ginger, or soothing and refreshing flavours,\n      such as chamomile, vanilla and citrus.\n\n      This study hypothesizes that using Lillipops Iced Soothies will reduce the severity of NVP\n      symptoms according to the PUQE-24 (pregnancy-unique quantification of emesis and nausea)\n      scoring system for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. In addition, we hypothesize concurrent\n      symptoms that may intensify NVP7, such as metallic taste or gastrointestinal disorders (e.g.\n      heartburn, acid reflux, indigestion and gas), will be alleviated. We hypothesize that\n      improvements to NVP and concurrent symptoms will be greater with Lillipop freezies compared\n      to another commercially available freezie."
