            "textblock": "Gastrointestinal discomfort regularly affects >25% of the population worldwide. One of the\n      major contributors to Gastrointestinal discomfort is constipation, which has a prevalence of\n      ~15%, and symptoms of which have a significant negative impact on the sufferer's quality of\n      life. One of the hallmarks of chronic constipation is slow progression of contents through\n      the gut (i.e. slow gut / colonic transit time), which may be associated with hard stools\n      that are difficult to expel. Previous studies have shown that probiotics improve colonic\n      transit times in constipated patients. In addition, several other studies, employing a range\n      of different probiotic strains, have shown a significant increase in defaecation frequency\n      and improvement in stool consistency. However, the clinical relevance of these results is\n      uncertain, due to small sample sizes and limitations in study methodology. The current study\n      is designed to compare changes in gut transit time and gastrointestinal symptoms following 4\n      weeks consumption of a probiotic strain in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled\n      manner, in adults with constipation."
