            "textblock": "Although the negative impact of sleep apnea on the clinical course of acute ischemic stroke\n      (AIS) is well known, data regarding non-invasive ventilation in acute patients are scarce.\n      Several studies showed its tolerability, safety and signals-of-efficacy, yet no controlled\n      randomized sequential phase studies currently exist that aim to establish the efficacy of\n      early non-invasive ventilation in AIS patients. The main hypothesis for this study is that\n      early non-invasive ventilation with automated bilevel positive airway pressure (auto-BPAP)\n      positively affects short-term clinical outcomes in AIS patients. This is a multicenter,\n      prospective, randomized, controlled, third rater-blinded, parallel-group trial. Patients\n      with AIS with proximal arterial obstruction and clinically suspected sleep apnea will be\n      randomized to standard or standard stroke care plus auto-BPAP. Auto-BPAP will be initiated\n      within 24 hours from stroke onset and performed for a maximum of 48 hours during diurnal and\n      nocturnal sleep. Patients will undergo cardiorespiratory polygraphy between day 3 and 5 to\n      assess sleep apnea. The primary endpoint is any early neurological improvement on the NIHSS\n      at 72 hours from randomization. Safety, tolerability, short-term and 3 months functional\n      outcomes are assessed as secondary endpoints by un-blinded and blinded observers\n      respectively. This study will provide data to power a subsequent phase III study."
