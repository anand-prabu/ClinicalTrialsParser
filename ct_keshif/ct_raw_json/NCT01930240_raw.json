The secondary objectives of the study are to characterize the safety and\n      tolerability of TRIA-662 and to assess any potential gender-related differences in the\n      plasma profile of MNA. Changes in serum lipid parameters with particular reference to\n      triglycerides, lipoprotein lipase, and blood pressure effects will also be noted."
