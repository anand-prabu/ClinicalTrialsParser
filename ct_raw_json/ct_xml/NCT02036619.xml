      The General hypothesis is that the IADPSG screening strategy for gestational diabetes (GDM)
      will lead to an important increase in the work load and the prevalence of GDM in Belgium but
      that this might not be cost effective concerning the prevention of adverse pregnancy
      outcomes. The risk to develop type 2 diabetes postpartum will probably be lower than for
      women diagnosed with the two-step screening strategy.

      In this prospective multicentric cohort study, women will be universally screened for
      pregestational diabetes and GDM at the first prenatal visit during the first trimester by
      measuring the fasting plasma glucose. In the second trimester, women without diagnosis of
      diabetes or GDM in the first trimester, will be universally screened for GDM using the 50g
      glucose challenge test (GCT) and the 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with the IADPSG
      criteria for GDM. Diagnosis of GDM will be based on the 75g OGTT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accurate data on the prevalence of gestational diabetes (GDM) are lacking in Belgium and the
      current practice for screening for GDM varies across different centers. The discrepancy in
      recommendations is due to the lack of data based on research in our population concerning
      the best screening strategy for pregestational diabetes in early pregnancy and the lack of
      data on the best screening strategy for GDM. A substantial number of centers in Belgium
      already use the IADPSG screening strategy although not always a an universal screening
      strategy or not always as an one-step screening strategy.

      The General hypothesis is that the IADPSG screening strategy will lead to an important
      increase in the work load and the prevalence of GDM in Belgium but that this might not be
      cost effective concerning the prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes. The risk to develop
      type 2 diabetes postpartum will probably be lower than for women diagnosed with the two-step
      screening strategy.

      In this prospective cohort study, women will be universally screened for pregestational
      diabetes and GDM at the first prenatal visit during the first trimester by measuring the
      fasting plasma glucose. GDM will be defined as a fasting plasma glucose  â‰¥100-125mg/dl. This
      will allow to identify the most important risk factors for the development of GDM.

      In the second trimester, women will be universally screened for GDM using the 50g glucose
      challenge test (GCT) and the 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)with the IADPSG criteria
      for GDM. Compared to the IADPSG screening strategy used in normal routine, the 50g GCT will
      be an extra test specific for the study. Diagnosis of GDM will be based on the 75g OGTT.
      Participants and researchers will therefore be blinded for the result of the GCT. The
      results of the GCT test will be used at the end of the study for research purposes only. The
      use of a GCT as an universal screening tool in a two-step approach with the use of the 75g
      2-hour OGTT with the IADPSG criteria only if the GCT is abnormal, is not yet validated and
      will be evaluated in the study, since this could be a practical solution.  Differences in
      GDM prevalence and pregnancy outcomes will be analyzed using different diagnostic criteria
      based on the 75g OGTT: the Carpenter &amp; Coustan criteria, the IADPSG criteria, and threshold
      values if diagnostic criteria would be based on an odds ratio of 2.0. The evaluation of
      different screening strategies and different diagnostic criteria will allow to explore the
      most cost effective methods for identifying women at risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes and
      at high risk for the development of type 2 diabetes  after pregnancy. By using a
      multivariable risk estimation model based on the most relevant clinical risk factors and
      biochemical measures for GDM in our own population, the aim is to develop a simple and cost
      effective screening algorithm.

      This study will also allow to evaluate the best short-term follow up strategy postpartum for
      women with a previous history of GDM. Different screening tests will be used three months
      postpartum: a fasting plasma glucose, Hba1c and 75g OGTT.
