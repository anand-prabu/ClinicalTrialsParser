      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a single application of AL-60371/AL-817 Otic
      Suspension relative to ototopical CIPRODEX for microbiological success at Day 8 and time to
      cessation of otorrhea.

    <description>A sustained clinical cure at Day 3 will be attained if otorrhea is absent at the Day 3 visit and continues to be absent through the last study visit (Day 8 or Early Exit).</description>

    <time_frame>Day 8</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Microbiological success will be attained if all pre-therapy bacteria are absent in the Day 8 specimen. If no otorrhea at Day 8, eradication of pre-therapy bacteria will be presumed and the subject will be considered a microbiological success.</description>

    <measure>Time (in days) to cessation of otorrhea</measure>
    <time_frame>Time to event, up to Day 8</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The time (in days) to the cessation of otorrhea (ie, otorrhea is absent) will be calculated as the number of days from the Day 1 (Visit 1) to the absence of otorrhea in the study ear as recorded by the parent/guardian via the twice-daily diary. Cessation of otorrhea will be defined as ending on the first day that otorrhea is absent from the study ear and remains absent for any/all subsequent diary entries.</description>
