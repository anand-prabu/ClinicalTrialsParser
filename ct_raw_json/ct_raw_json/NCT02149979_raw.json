The Applied\n      Physics group at the Tel Aviv University has developed a Temperature Controlled CO2 Laser\n      Soldering system for soft tissue bonding.\n\n      This system includes features that make laser soldering suitable for clinical use. The\n      Temperature Controlled Laser Soldering System is composed of CO2 fiberoptic laser device,\n      Infrared fiber-optic radiometer, a computerized temperature control program,   propriety\n      grip device (Clamps) and concentrated Human Albumin as a soldering agent."
