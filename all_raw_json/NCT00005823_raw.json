It is not yet known if stronger doses of chemotherapy given\n      over a longer period of time are as well tolerated or as effective as less intensive\n      chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying intensive regimens of chemotherapy to\n      see how well they work compared to nonintensive regimens of chemotherapy in treating older\n      patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome."

Patients are randomized or electively\n      assigned to either intensive or nonintensive chemotherapy*.\n\n      Intensive chemotherapy\n\n        -  Induction therapy: Patients are randomized to 1 of 6 treatment arms. Patients receive 2\n           courses of chemotherapy comprising 1 of 2 daunorubicin doses, 1 of 2 cytarabine doses,\n           thioguanine, and with or without PSC 833.\n\n      Patients receive daunorubicin IV once daily on days 1-3 with cytarabine IV twice daily and\n      oral thioguanine once daily on days 1-10 during course 1. Treatment repeats in approximately\n      31 days as in course 1 except cytarabine and thioguanine are given only on days 1-8.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive higher dose of daunorubicin, lower dose of cytarabine, and\n           thioguanine.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive higher dose of daunorubicin, higher dose of cytarabine, and\n           thioguanine.\n\n        -  Arm III: Patients receive lower dose of daunorubicin, lower dose of cytarabine, and\n           thioguanine.\n\n        -  Arm IV: Patients receive lower dose of daunorubicin, higher dose of cytarabine, and\n           thioguanine.\n\n        -  Arm V: Patients receive treatment as in arm III in combination with continuous infusion\n           of PSC 833 beginning day 1.\n\n        -  Arm VI: Patients receive treatment as in arm IV in combination with continuous infusion\n           of PSC 833 beginning on day 1.\n\n      Patients with refractory disease after the first course of induction chemotherapy may\n      continue with the intensive protocol arm or enter the nonintensive arm*. Patients who do not\n      achieve complete remission after completion of induction chemotherapy are removed from\n      study. Patients in complete remission after induction therapy receive consolidation therapy.\n\n        -  Consolidation therapy: Patients in complete remission after induction are randomized to\n           either short or long consolidation.\n\n             -  Short consolidation: Patients receive mitoxantrone IV on days 1-3 and cytarabine\n                IV over 2 hours twice daily on days 1-3.\n\n             -  Long consolidation: Patients complete short consolidation and then receive\n                idarubicin IV over 5 minutes once daily on days 1 and 3, cytarabine IV over 2\n                hours twice daily and etoposide IV over 1 hour once daily on days 1-3.\n\n      Non-intensive chemotherapy*\n\n        -  Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.\n\n             -  Arm I: Patients receive oral hydroxyurea as necessary to control WBC count until\n                treatment failure.\n\n             -  Arm II: Patients receive hydroxyurea as in arm I and oral tretinoin daily for up\n                to 16 weeks.\n\n             -  Arm III: Patients receive low dose cytarabine subcutaneously twice daily on days\n                1-10 every 28 days for a minimum of 4 courses.\n\n             -  Arm IV: Patients receive cytarabine as in arm III plus oral tretinoin daily for up\n                to 16 weeks.\n\n      NOTE: *Patients with liver function test > 2 times upper limit of normal are not eligible\n      for nonintensive randomization\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at study entry, and then at 1, 3, and 6 months.\n\n      Patients are followed at one year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 2,000 patients (1,200 to intensive arm and 800 to\n      nonintensive arm) will be accrued for this study over 5 years."
