Hormone therapy using\n      arzoxifene hydrochloride may fight ovarian or peritoneal cancer by blocking the use of\n      estrogen by the tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well arzoxifene hydrochloride works in treating\n      women with metastatic refractory ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal cancer."

Determine\n      the time to progressive disease, time to treatment failure, response duration, and survival\n      of these patients. III. Assess the safety of this treatment in these patients. IV. Measure\n      changes in serum estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and sex\n      hormone binding globulin during this treatment in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral arzoxifene hydrochloride daily at a fixed dose. Treatment\n      continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified\n\n      National Cancer Institute (NCI) registered this trial with Eli Lilly as sponsor.  NCI did\n      not update the record when the trial completed. In June 2012, NCI transferred the trial to\n      Lilly's clinicaltrials.gov account and Lilly updated the record with the trial completion\n      date.  This trial is not an applicable trial under Food and Drug Administration Amendments\n      Act of 2007 (FDAAA)."
