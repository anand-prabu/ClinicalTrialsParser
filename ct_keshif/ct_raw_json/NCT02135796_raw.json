            "textblock": "The investigators hypothesize that not all patients with severe sepsis or septic shock with\n      a Central Venous Oxygen Saturation (ScvO2) less than 70% have cardiac dysfunction that would\n      benefit from inotropic therapy (a key strategy in early goal directed therapy in patients\n      with sepsis). Echocardiography might show that despite an adequate Central Venous Pressure\n      (CVP), intravascular volume status is low and further volume expansion is warranted.\n      Alternatively, echocardiography may indicate that left atrial pressure is elevated, and\n      further intravascular volume resuscitation should be limited. Such observations may lead to\n      a role for echocardiography within the parameters of the early goal-directed therapy\n      protocol that may improve treatment of cardiac dysfunction and hypovolemia.\n\n      The study objective is to correlate echocardiographic findings with objective parameters,\n      namely central venous pressure (CVP) and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2), measured\n      during the early resuscitation of critically ill patients with severe sepsis and septic\n      shock.\n\n      Aim #1: Correlate echocardiographic findings of right ventricular (RV) systolic function and\n      dilation, left ventricular (LV) systolic function and dilation, and left ventricular\n      diastolic function with CVP and ScvO2 in the early hours of resuscitation in patients with\n      severe sepsis and septic shock.\n\n      Aim #2: Evaluate the change in RV and LV dysfunction over time in patients with severe\n      sepsis and septic shock and correlate with mortality.\n\n      Aim #3: Evaluate the efficacy of bedside echocardiography performed by the intensivist in\n      the ICU in the evaluation of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock."
