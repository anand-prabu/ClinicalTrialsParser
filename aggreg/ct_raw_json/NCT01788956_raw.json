            "textblock": "The conventional bedside pulse oximeter has been a standard in clinical care for\n      non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring and measures arterial blood oxygenation.  To date, a\n      non-invasive bedside monitor for measuring mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) has not\n      been developed. The clinical applications of venous oximetry are numerous and include\n      management of severe sepsis and septic shock, trauma and hemorrhagic shock, heart failure\n      and cardiac arrest.\n\n      The existing method for venous blood oxygenation monitored is either through an invasive\n      fiber optic catheter, or intermittently by blood sampling through a central venous catheter\n      Oximetry. However, SvO2 measurements using fiber optic catheters are very expensive, and all\n      central line insertions include inherent risks. Also, insertion of a central line is in some\n      circumstances not feasible (e.g. discomfort/limited experience in central line insertion,\n      unavailability of specific monitoring systems etc.) resulting in inappropriate therapy\n      usually guided by SvO2.  Therefore, a non-invasive monitor to measure SvO2 at the bedside\n      negating the requirement for a central line insertion would be of clinical benefit and allow\n      appropriate therapy of many patients listed above at a time when therapy has the most\n      benefit.\n\n      The Mespere VA Oximeter is a novel non-invasive medical device for simultaneous monitoring\n      of venous blood oxygenation through the internal or external jugular vein.  The Mespere VA\n      Oximeter is based upon near infrared spectroscopy. The System consists of a portable monitor\n      and probe is placed on the skin overlying the internal or external jugular vein (right or\n      left). The monitor displays the oxygenation and plethysmographic waveforms of venous blood\n      measured at the level of the neck vein.\n\n      Continuous measurement of SvO2 will be beneficial because it will help the physician better\n      understand local ischemia as well as provide better guidance for the physician to be able to\n      best treat the patient and decrease their burden of illness."
