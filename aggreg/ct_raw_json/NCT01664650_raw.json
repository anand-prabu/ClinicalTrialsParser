It is\n      associated with a 2-4 fold increase in cardiovascular morbility and mortality and with a 5-\n      9 fold increase in developing type II diabetes. MS prevalence increases after the onset of\n      menopause, because of estrogen deficiency. It is still not clear if menopause itself\n      increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases in al women or only in those that develop MS.\n      Many MS patients that show slight modification in cardiovascular and metabolic parameters\n      are not generally pharmacologically treated since diabetes or alteration in the lipid\n      profile are not evidenced. In this respect it is of importance to develop new therapeutic\n      strategies to prevent and treat MS. Genistein (4,5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone), shown a\n      potentially preventive role on the cardiovascular apparatus in post-menopausal women, may be\n      termed as selective ER modulator (SERM), since it reveals both ER-alpha full agonist and\n      ER-beta partial agonist activity."
