Needing, moreover, a simple and not\n      harmful device that could assess effective energy expenditure and the adherence by pregnant\n      women to prenatal exercise, the investigators use SenseWear system armband (SWA)."

            "textblock": "Pregnant women, recruited from antenatal clinics, with pre-pregnancy BMI \u2265 25 kg/m2, age >18\n      years and single pregnancy are enrolled within 12th week at the Obstetric Unit of\n      Policlinico Hospital of Modena.\n\n      Exclusion criteria are as follows: twin pregnancies, chronic diseases (i.e., diabetes\n      mellitus, chronic hypertension, untreated thyroid diseases), gestational diabetes mellitus\n      (GDM) in previous pregnancies, smoking during pregnancy, dietary supplements or herbal\n      products known to affect body weight, other medical conditions that might affect body\n      weight, and plans to deliver outside of the Birth Center.\n\n      At the first visit, an accurate obstetric history, family history, and personal history is\n      collected for the assessment of exclusion criteria. The blood pressure, height and weight\n      are measured, and the BMI is calculated.\n\n      Eligible women are randomly assigned to no intervention (Control group) or the Therapeutic\n      Lifestyle Changes Program (TLC group). Randomization is performed using sealed\n      envelopes(using a computer-generated random allocation). Study randomization is numbered and\n      sealed in white envelops. Randomization occurs in consecutive order at time of the first\n      visit. Due to study design, both gynecologist and dietitian know the allocation of the\n      patient.\n\n      Every subject receives care in another institution (Antenatal Clinics of Modena Health\n      program). Hence, women in both groups receive the same antenatal evaluation including two\n      ultrasound examinations and at least 4 obstetric evaluations until term. However, referral\n      gynecologists possibly know the allocated arm of their women.\n\n      Randomized subjects receive a 75-g 2-h Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) at 16-18 and/or\n      24-28 weeks. The diagnosis of GDM is made for any glucose value exceeding the normal\n      cut-off, as reported by the HAPO study. If OGTT is pathological, women are referred to other\n      health care specialists.\n\n      Women randomized to both group are scheduled to have a specific follow-up for adherence to\n      the program at 16, 20, 28, 36 weeks  and 3 months after delivery also evaluating the fat\n      mass, fat-free mass and total body water through the use of the bioimpedance analyzer.\n      Moreover, at baseline, 20 and 36 weeks the investigator evaluate the detailed patient's\n      metabolism through the Armband or metabolic holter. At baseline and 36 weeks each subject\n      have to complete a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) to identify any change in eating\n      habits. The FFQ includes questions about specific food items, such as the frequency of sauce\n      consumption, the fat content of several food items, and seasonal consumption of fruit and\n      vegetables. While the Control group receives only a simple nutritional booklet about a\n      lifestyle (in accordance with Italian Guidelines for a healthy diet during pregnancy), the\n      TLC Program includes a specific caloric restriction associated to a mild physical activity\n      program.\n\n      The TLC diet comprises 1500 kcal/day and consists of 3 main meals and 3 snacks (breakfast,\n      snack, lunch, snack, dinner, and evening snack) that corresponds to the baseline  metabolism\n      of a pregnant woman. The dietitian adds an amount of  200 kcal/day for obese or 300 kcal/day\n      for overweight pregnant women submitted to physical activity program.The TLC diet has a\n      target macronutrient composition of 55% carbohydrate, 20% protein, and 25% fat with\n      moderately low saturated fat levels. The exercise intervention is focused on increasing\n      walking and developing a more active lifestyle (i.e., walking rather than driving for short\n      distances). The recommended exercise prescription for pregnant women is generally consistent\n      with recommendations for the general adult population. However, it is important to monitor\n      and adjust exercise prescriptions according to the woman's symptoms, discomforts, and\n      abilities during pregnancy and be aware of contraindications for exercising during\n      pregnancy. All participants are advised to participate in 30 min of moderate intensity\n      activity at least 3 days a week. Subjects wear a pedometer (Omron Walking Style III\n      HJ-203-EK) on a belt at the back of their waist during walking session for the assessment of\n      the adherence to the physical activity program."
