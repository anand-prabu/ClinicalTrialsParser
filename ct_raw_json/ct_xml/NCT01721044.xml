      The purpose of this study is to determine whether baricitinib 4 milligram (mg) once daily is
      superior to placebo in the treatment of participants with moderately to severely active
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) who have had an inadequate response to a tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF) inhibitor, despite ongoing treatment with conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic
      drugs (cDMARDs).

               -  experienced intolerance of such treatment

          -  Have had regular use of at least 1 conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs
