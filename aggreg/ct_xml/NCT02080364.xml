      This is a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TTP488 in patients with mild
      Alzheimer's disease.   Patients will receive either TTP488 or placebo with a patient's
      participation lasting approximately 18 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of probable Alzheimer Disease (AD) with documented evidence of progression
             of disease

          -  Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 21-26, inclusive

          -  Rosen-Modified Hachinski Ischemia Score less than or equal to 4

          -  Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) consistent with the diagnosis of probable AD

          -  Concurrent use of cholinesterase inhibitor or memantine with stable dose for at least
             3 months prior to randomization

          -  Caregiver willing to participate and be able to attend clinic visits with patient

          -  Ability to ingest oral medications

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant neurological or psychiatric disease other than Alzheimer's disease

          -  Participants with evidence or history of severe drug allergies (resulting in dyspnea
             or severe rash).

          -  Any contraindications to MRI  (e.g., clinically significant claustrophobia,
             non-removable ferromagnetic implants).

          -  Any contraindications to the FDG-PET study (e.g. allergy to any component of the FDG
             dose) in the mild AD dementia subject cohort undergoing a PET scan.

          -  Previous exposure to investigational or non-investigational therapies for Alzheimer's
             disease that are being investigated for possible disease modification activity

          -  History of cancer within the last 5 years. Cutaneous basal cell, squamous cell
             cancer, resolved by excision, or non-progressive prostate cancer not requiring
             treatment are allowed.

          -  Women of childbearing potential
