In previous studies that used 131I-MIBG as a potential anti-cancer\n      therapy, a decrease in the size of tumors was seen in some of the children and adults. This\n      research study will continue to evaluate the side effects of 131I-MIBG when treating\n      children and adults with neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, or paraganglioma. The 131I-MIBG\n      compound is intended to work by selectively delivering the radioactive iodine to the tumor\n      cells, which is then intended to result in their destruction.\n\n      The purpose of this research study is to:\n\n        -  Make 131I-MIBG therapy available to patients with advanced neuroblastoma,\n           pheochromocytoma, or paraganglioma\n\n        -  Further assess the side effects of 131I-MIBG therapy"

            "textblock": "Neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and paraganglioma remain fatal diseases for a large\n      percentage of patients, especially those with high-risk disease features who become\n      resistant to conventional therapy. 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) is a\n      norepinephrine analog that concentrates in adrenergic tissue and has been shown to be\n      sensitive and specific for detecting localized and metastatic neuroblastoma,\n      pheochromocytoma, and paraganglioma. More importantly, experience of many institutions has\n      proven that this agent used as a targeted radiotherapeutic has significant anti-tumor\n      activity against refractory neuroblastoma 1-7 as well as pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma.\n      Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, UCSF, and the University of Michigan have just\n      completed a large Phase 2 study of 131I-MIBG given in doses of 10-18 mCi/kg with stem cell\n      rescue, if necessary, and have shown that this agent is safe and effective palliative\n      therapy for refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma patients. In addition, there is growing\n      evidence that low-dose (5-10 mCi/kg) submyeloablative MIBG therapy is both safe and\n      effective for disease palliation. This protocol therefore provides a mechanism to deliver\n      this therapy when clinically indicated.\n\n      Primary Objectives:\n\n        -  Provide palliative therapy with 131I-MIBG for patients with advanced neuroblastoma,\n           pheochromocytoma, or paraganglioma.\n\n        -  Gain more information about acute and late toxicity of 131I-MIBG therapy for patients\n           with refractory neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, or paraganglioma."
