      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate safety and efficacy of intravenous delivery of
      self-complementary scAAV9.CB.SMN  as a treatment of Spinal Muscular Atrophy type 1 (SMN1).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate safety and efficacy of gene transfer in Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type
      1 (SMA1) patients.  SMA is caused by low levels of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein,
      and affects all muscles in the body.  There is no other effective treatment for SMA and
      current drug therapy has been unsuccessful in stabilizing or reversing this disease.  Only
      supportive care is currently possible.

      The gene transfer trial will deliver SMN gene intravenously (i.v.) using the
      adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9). Two cohorts will undergo gene transfer in a
      standard three-six dose escalation scheme to establish maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using
      toxicity. The first cohort will consist of three participants, and the second cohort will
      consist of six participants to receive a 5-fold increase in dose.

      The primary objective of this study is the assessment of the safety of scAAV9.CB.SMN
      delivered intravenously to SMA type 1 patients.  Following gene transfer i.v. infusion,
      participants will be carefully monitored for any side effects at the outpatient follow-up
      visits weekly for 3 weeks followed by monthly visits over two years of active study period.
      Safety endpoints will be assessed by changes in hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis,
      immunologic response to rAAV9 and SMN, and reported history and observations of symptoms.
      The time from birth to study pre-defined use of respiratory assistance devices or death will
      be used as a secondary outcome measure of efficacy.  Exploratory outcome measures include
      nerve conduction and muscle assessment studies.  The active phase of this study will last
      for two-years post-infusion, following which, participants will be asked to transfer into a
      monitoring program where medical progress will continue to be collected from annual standard
      care medical exams for the next 15 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Nine months of age and younger at day of vector infusion with Type 1 SMA as defined
             by the following features:

               1. Bi-allelic SMN1 gene mutations (deletion or point mutation) with two copies of
                  SMN2 (no more and no fewer).

               2. Onset of disease at birth to 6 months of age.

               3. Hypotonia by clinical evaluation with delay in motor skills, poor head control,
                  round shoulder posture and hypermobility of joints.

          -  Active viral infection (includes HIV or serology positive for hepatitis B or C)

          -  Use of invasive ventilatory support (tracheotomy with positive pressure)* or pulse
             oximetry &lt;95% saturation.
