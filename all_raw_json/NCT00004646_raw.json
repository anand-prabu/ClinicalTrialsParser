Determine whether prednisone changes levels of insulin-like growth factor 1, growth\n      hormone, and insulin.\n\n      III.  Characterize the effect of prednisone on muscle morphometry and muscle localization of\n      utrophin.\n\n      IV.  Compare the prednisone response in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy to that\n      seen in normal individuals and in patients with facioscapulohumeral dystrophy."
