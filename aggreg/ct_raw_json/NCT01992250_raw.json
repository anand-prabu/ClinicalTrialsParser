Core Biopsy (Pre-Registration)\n\n        2. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Pre-Registration)\n\n        3. Tumor Cryoablation\n\n        4. Core Biopsy (Post-Cryoablation)\n\n        5. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Post-Cryoablation)\n\n        6. Post-operative Follow-up\n\n        7. Evaluation of outcomes\n\n      ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\n\n        1. Age 70 or older\n\n        2. No History of en bloc open surgical biopsy and/or lumpectomy for diagnosis/treatment of\n           the index breast cancer.\n\n        3. No prior or planned neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.\n\n        4. Adequate breast size for safe cryoablation. Female breast cancer patients with breasts\n           too small to allow safe cryoablation are not eligible as the minimal thickness of the\n           breast tissue does not lend itself to cryoablation.\n\n        5. Unifocal primary invasive ductal breast carcinoma diagnosed by core needle biopsy.\n\n        6. Patients with prior in situ or invasive breast carcinomas are eligible if the prior\n           carcinomas occurred in the contralateral breast or in a separate quadrant of the same\n           breast. Patients with prior in-situ or invasive breast carcinomas in the same quadrant\n           of the ipsilateral breast are not eligible.\n\n        7. Tumor enhancement on pre- study MRI.\n\n        8. Tumor size \u22642.0 cm in greatest diameter.\n\n        9. Tumor with <25% intraductal components in the aggregate.\n\n       10. Histology and prognostically favorable (Luminal A) breast cancer based on analysis of\n           core needle biopsy specimen.\n\n       11. Clinically node negative based on examination and axillary ultrasound, or\n           histology-confirmed negative nodes based on fine or core needle biopsy."

Largest size measured by required scans (mammogram, ultrasound,\n             and MRI) will be used to determine eligibility.\n\n          9. Tumor with <25% intraductal components in the aggregate. NOTE: The percent\n             intraductal component form the patient's diagnostic biopsy must be available prior to\n             registration.
