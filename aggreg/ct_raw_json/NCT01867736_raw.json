Single or sequential de novo or restenotic lesions (stenosis \u2265 70% diameter reduction\n             or occlusion) in the infrapopliteal arteries \u2265 30 mm. Lesions should not extend\n             beyond the ankle joint.\n\n          5. A maximum of 2 different vessels can be treated: successful wire crossing is required\n             for the first target vessel before randomization occurs.\n\n          6. Subject with PAD or critical limb ischemia according to the current guidelines in\n             need for urgent revascularization to relieve symptoms and improve walking capacity.\n\n          7.
