As the immune system plays a key role in angiogenesis induction and maintenance in\n      cancer, it could serve as a surrogate marker of angiogenesis in cancer patients.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of bevacizumab treatment on\n      circulating immune cells in high grade glioma patients and to search for a link between the\n      variation of these cells and the response to treatment."
