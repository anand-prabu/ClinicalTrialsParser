This study compares a form of dynamic psychotherapy\n      called supportive-expressive psychotherapy to medication and to placebo.\n\n      Participants are evaluated on 2 occasions, 1 week apart, before they are randomly assigned\n      to receive either supportive-expressive psychotherapy, sertraline (Zoloft) (followed by\n      venlafaxine [Effexor] if patients do not respond to sertraline), or placebo. The active\n      phase of treatment lasts 4 months. The frequency of patients' visits depends on the assigned\n      treatment.\n\n      Patients who are randomized to receive medication or placebo are initially seen on a weekly\n      basis, then less often, depending on the rate of symptomatic improvement. Patients who are\n      randomized to psychotherapy are seen twice a week for the first 4 weeks, then once a week\n      for the remaining 12 weeks. Outcome is monitored at week 2,4,6,7,8, 12, 15 and 16.  At the\n      end of the first 16 weeks of treatment, patients are thoroughly evaluated. Those who have\n      responded to treatment are assigned to a continuation phase and are seen once a month for\n      another 16 weeks.  At the end of the 16-week continuation phase, patients are again\n      evaluated and all treatments are stopped.  Follow-up continues every 3 months for up to 2\n      years to ensure that the patients' depression remains under control."
