The standard DOVE intervention is a brochure based 10 minute intervention that the home visitor reviews with the women.  It consists of information about IPV, its effects on pregnancy and infant health, community resources and a plan for individual safety options.  For the eMOCHA DOVE interventon, the DOVE 10 minute brochure intervention will be converted from the paper format to a vusually colorful interactive presentaiton loaded into the home visitor device using the eMOCHA application.  The format will be completely activiated and implemented by the women.  She uses small ear buds and a touch screen, so how she responds and interacts with the media enhanced eMOCHA DOVE intervention is private."

            "textblock": "This study addresses PA-11-104 calling for Reducing Health Disparities among Minority and\n      Underserved Children.  The Institute of Medicine,  World Health Organization  and Centers\n      for Disease Control and Prevention  recognize that prenatal home visitation, which improves\n      the well-being of mother and children, presents an opportunity to provide early intervention\n      to reduce intimate partner violence (IPV) and the impact the exposure has on the children.\n      Major challenges for  nurses and other home visitors (HV) are to accurately identify abused\n      women and facilitate their accessing resources needed to change their situation.  HVs often\n      find it difficult to assess and intervene for IPV in the intimacy of home settings. The use\n      of mHealth technology may increase the sensitivity of screening instruments and reduce\n      communication barriers between HVs and clients regarding IPV, as well as enhance\n      implementation of IPV interventions and allow for a more standard delivery of an\n      intervention. Building on the successful trial testing the DOVE IPV intervention in prenatal\n      home visiting programs (NR009093), we propose to test mHealth technology using an\n      open-source application, eMOCHA, to improve assessment of IPV and to deliver the DOVE\n      intervention.  The proposed eMOCHA DOVE study will first (Specific Aim/Phase 1) compare\n      sensitivity and specificity of two different approaches for IPV assessment; paper and pencil\n      versus the eMOCHA mHealth technology. Phase 2 (Aim 2) will compare effectiveness of the DOVE\n      intervention delivered in standard form (paper brochure) versus mHealth eMOCHA DOVE\n      application. In Phase 1 women enrolled in a perinatal home visiting program and consenting\n      to the study, will be randomized to one of the two assessment groups and assessed for IPV at\n      enrollment, birth and 2 months post birth. Women who are IPV positive (IPV+) at any of the\n      assessment times will be re-randomized to receive the DOVE intervention by one of the two\n      approaches. 1600 Medicaid eligible pregnant women in a perinatal home visiting program (800\n      from urban Baltimore and 800 from rural Virginia) will be recruited for Phase I and 400 IPV+\n      women (200 from each site) for Phase II. Women participating in Phase 2 will receive 6 home\n      visit interventions over 6 months. Maternal outcomes related to IPV and mental health and\n      selected infant outcomes will be collected at enrollment, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months after\n      entry into Phase 2.  Specific Aim 1 will use logistic and linear regression models to\n      examine the proportion of women experiencing IPV through mHealth technology versus paper and\n      pencil on the same validated assessments. Specific Aim 2 (comparing effectiveness of two\n      intervention administrations) will be assessed with logistic and linear regression models\n      for categorical (proportion abused and premature infants) and continuous outcome variables\n      (e.g. depression, frequency and severity of physical, psychological, sexual IPV, use of\n      community resources) respectively. Study findings will assist nurse home visitation programs\n      to use best approaches for routine assessment of IPV and implement empowerment interventions\n      to reduce IPV and improve maternal infant health outcomes."
