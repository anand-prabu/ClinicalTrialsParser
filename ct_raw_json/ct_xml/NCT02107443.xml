    <textblock>
      This randomized research trial studies standardized geriatric assessment (GA) or usual care
      in improving communication and quality of life in older patients with advanced solid tumors
      or lymphoma and caregivers. A GA measures the issues important to older patients, including
      function, psychological status, cognitive abilities, social support, and the impact of
      medical problems on quality of life. A GA may improve communication between patients and
      their doctors in addressing patient concerns. It is not yet known whether a standardized GA
      is more effective than usual care in improving communication and quality of life in older
      patients with solid tumors or lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if providing information from geriatric assessment to patients, their
      caregivers and oncologists improves patient satisfaction with communication with the
      oncologist regarding age-related concerns.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if providing GA information to patients, their caregivers, and oncologists
      increases discussions about age-related issues during clinic consultation.

      II. To determine whether initially providing patients, their caregivers, and oncologists
      with GA information plus recommendations prior to their treatment influences quality of life
      of older patients receiving treatment.

      III. To determine whether providing patients, their caregivers, and oncologists with GA
      information plus recommendations influences caregiver satisfaction with communication about
      age-related issues.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Exploratory aims will evaluate whether the number of discussions about age-related issues
      during the clinic visit correlates with patient satisfaction and will explore if
      communication about age-related issues influences how patients, caregivers, and oncologists
      make decisions for cancer treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients and their caregivers (if participating) complete the GA informational
      intervention and receive recommendations guided by GA results provided by the oncology team
      to discuss and implement for each age-related issue at baseline.

      ARM II: Patients and their caregivers (if participating) complete the GA at baseline.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, 10-14 weeks, and 20-24
      weeks.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  History of cancer

          -  Diagnosis of an advanced solid tumor malignancy; in most situations, this would be a
             stage IV cancer; a patient with a diagnosis of stage III cancer can be included if
             all other inclusion and exclusion criteria are met and the patient is not planning to
             initiate treatment for curative intent; patients with lymphoma are eligible if all
             other inclusion and exclusion criteria are met

          -  Must be undergoing the decision for first line treatment with chemotherapy and/or
             monoclonal antibody therapy and/or targeted therapy for the current diagnosis with
             their primary oncologists; patients for whom radiation is being considered are
             eligible as long as radiation is being considered for non-curative (i.e., palliative)
             purposes; patients are not required to ultimately receive these therapies

          -  Have at least one geriatric assessment domain impaired other than polypharmacy

          -  Have not previously received chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, or targeted
             therapy for the current diagnosis of advanced cancer; patients with a history of
             radiation, surgery, or hormonal treatment are eligible; patients who received
             adjuvant chemotherapy are eligible; a patient may also be enrolled on a treatment
             trial and participate in this study, if all other inclusion and exclusion criteria
             are met

          -  Able to provide informed consent or, if the physician deems the patient to not have
             decision-making capacity, a patient-designated health care proxy must also sign
             consent in accordance with institutional policies

          -  Subject has adequate understanding of the English language because not all GA
             measures have been validated in other languages

          -  Entry criteria for caregivers: a caregiver can be anyone age 21 or over who is able
             to understand spoken English and understand the study process and provide informed
             consent; one caregiver for each patient will be eligible and must be chosen by the
             patient; for the purposes of this study, a caregiver is defined as a valued and
             trusted person in a patient's life who is supportive in health care matters by
             providing valuable social support and/or direct assistive care; the caregiver
             accompanies the patient to medical appointments, is able to listen and give
             thoughtful advice and may be a family member, partner, friend, or professional
             caregiver

          -  INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR CAREGIVERS: selected by the patient when asked if there is a
             &quot;family member, partner, friend or caregiver (age 21 or older) with whom you discuss
             or who can be helpful in health-related matters&quot;; patients who cannot identify such a
             person (&quot;caregiver&quot;) can be eligible for the study; a caregiver need not be someone
             who lives with the patient or provides direct hands-on care; a caregiver can be any
             person who provides support (in any way) to the patient

          -  INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR CAREGIVERS: if a health care proxy signs consent for or with a
             patient, and wants to participate in the caregiver portion of the study, this same
             person will always be the caregiver selected; if a health care proxy does not want to
             enroll as a caregiver in the study or, if enrolled, chooses to stop their own
             participation in the caregiver portion of the study, but is able to assist the
             patient in completing the study, the patient can still participate; in other words,
             the health care proxy can choose NOT to participate in the caregiver portion of the
             study; this does not preclude the patient from participating in the patient portion
             of the study with the health care proxy's assistance

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have surgery planned within 3 months of consent

          -  Patients who do not have decision-making capacity (decisionally or cognitively
             impaired) AND do not have a health care proxy available to sign consent will be
             excluded from the study

          -  EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR CAREGIVERS: caregivers unable to understand the consent form
             due to cognitive, health, or sensory impairment will be excluded

          -  EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR CAREGIVERS: a caregiver can only participate if the patient
             agrees to his/her participation
