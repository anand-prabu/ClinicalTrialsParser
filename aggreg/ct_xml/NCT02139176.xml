  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In sub-Saharan Africa, engaging men in HIV prevention, care, and treatment has proven
      challenging. Along all steps of the HIV care-seeking cascade, men exhibit worse care-seeking
      behaviors than women. They are less likely to be tested for HIV, initiate combination
      antiretroviral therapy (cART), and be retained in cART care. Additionally, men rarely engage
      in the care of their female sex partners, even though couple care-seeking is associated with
      marked improvements in condom use within HIV-discordant couples. Option B+, Malawi's program
      for providing immediate, lifelong combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) to all
      HIV-infected pregnant women at the time of diagnosis, is an important entry-point for
      involving male partners in care.

      This is a pilot randomized controlled trial (N=200 women) comparing two strategies of male
      partner involvement within the Option B+ program. In both arms (patient referral and
      contract referral) women will be encouraged to invite their male partners to accompany them
      to the clinic for couple HIV counseling and testing. In the  contract referral arm, if the
      couple does not present within one week, the male partner will receive a home visit
      encouraging them to present to the clinic. We will compare the two arms for 1) uptake of
      couple HIV counseling and testing (cHCT), 2) uptake of cART for women, and 3) linkage to
      care for HIV-infected men. Results are expected to inform a larger trial and ultimately
      improve care-seeking in Malawi's HIV program.

      Objective 1: Determine acceptability of male partner recruitment for cHTC within an Option
      B+ context. We will assess acceptability of eligible females to participate in this pilot
      RCT and reasons for non-participation.

      Objective 2: Assess whether study arm (patient referral versus contract referral) is
      associated with cHTC uptake. We will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of
      male partner recruitment. This study will contain two arms: patient referral and contract
      referral for uptake of cHTC (primary outcome).

    <description>It will be assessed whether the female partner brings her male partner to the antenatal clinic for couple HIV counseling and testing (as recorded on study case report forms).

    <description>It will be assessed whether the female participants return for their first Option B+ visit (using the clinic's routine Option B+ records). Time to first visit will be assessed using a Kaplan Meier curve and a log rank test.</description>

    <description>It will be assessed whether HIV-infected male partners are linked to care within one month of learning their HIV positive result with their partner. This will be assessed from abstraction of routine clinic records at Martin Preuss Center. We will use the Kaplan Meier method to plot outcomes and a log rank test to compare time to linkage to care between arms.</description>
