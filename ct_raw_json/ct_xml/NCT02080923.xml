  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a test of the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a brief
      motivational interview style intervention. The intervention will take place in the pediatric
      emergency department of the Boston University Medical Center by a trained interventionist
      and will follow an intervention manual developed by a team of dating abuse and brief
      intervention experts. The study will involve two randomized groups of youth age 16-18: one
      group will receive the intervention and the other will not. The study will compare changes
      in data from baseline to 3- and 6-month follow-up for those in both groups. Outcomes
      including dating abused related knowledge, attitudes about the use of violence to resolve
      conflict, and dating abuse behavior (perpetration and/or victimization) will be assessed.

      The hypothesis of this study is that youth who receive the intervention will show
      improvements in dating abuse related knowledge, attitudes and behavior that are maintained
      for 6 months, while those in the control group will show no similar change.

      Emergency departments offer a unique setting through which we can reach adolescents who have
      perpetrated Adolescent Dating Aggression (ADA). The Project READY (Reducing Aggression in
      Dating Relationships for Youth) brief intervention manual and training was developed by Dr.
      Emily Rothman, who is a former shelter worker, batterer intervention counselor, and dating
      violence expert, with input from research experts in brief intervention, an expert in
      adolescent batterer intervention, psychologists, low-income youth of color from the Start
      Strong Initiative, and others, with funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
      The READY intervention intercepts youth who utilize an urban emergency department for
      non-acute health care needs (e.g., cuts, sprains), provides them with tailored feedback
      about their relationship behavior, and uses motivational interviewing techniques and
      prepared worksheets to move them forward on a readiness-to-change continuum towards
      non-violent and respectful relationship behavior. For example, after being provided with
      information about acts considered unhealthy in a relationship, a participant is asked to
      generate a list of &quot;pros and cons&quot; about what he or she does to solve conflicts with
      partners, brainstorm alternatives that he or she would use, list reasons why the
      alternatives might not work in the moment, and troubleshoot those potential problems.
      Participants are then offered a menu of referrals and invited to select those that they
      would use (e.g., free mental health and substance abuse counseling, sexual health testing,
      gang prevention resources).

      The proposed randomized controlled trial (RCT) research study will build upon our completed
      small-scale feasibility pilot project (N=27), which was conducted in 2012- 13. For the
      proposed study, we will recruit a sample large enough (N=334 at baseline) to evaluate
      whether the intervention improves ADA-related knowledge, positively changes ADA-related
      attitudes and behavioral intentions, and reduces self-reported perpetration behavior after
      3- and 6-month follow-up periods. The study will enroll youth ages 16-18 years old. Notably,
      the setting for this intervention test will be an urban pediatric emergency department that
      primarily serves low income youth.
