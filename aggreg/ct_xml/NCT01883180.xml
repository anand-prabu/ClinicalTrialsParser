    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the incidences of viral infection in haploidentical
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients receiving different dose of antithymocyte
      globulin (ATG) for acute graft-versus-host disease(aGVHD) prophylaxis. Our first objective
      was to evaluate the effect of different dose of ATG on post-transplant viral infection, and
      second object was to investigate the optimal dose of ATG for aGVHD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT)is the only therapeutic option
      for many hematological malignancies. Unfortunately, about 75% of patients who require
      allo-HSCT lack human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donors. The alternative is
      hematopoietic stem cells from an HLA-mismatched family donor. However, this strategy, which
      is called haploidentical HSCT, may be associated with high risk of early death and severe
      GVHD.

      Opportunistic infections are common complications after allo-HSCT. Due to the absence of
      effective preventive and therapeutic drugs for most viruses, viral infections has become one
      of the most important causes of death. The immunosuppression regimen including ATG has been
      shown effective to prevent severe GVHD in haploidentical HSCT. But this strategy delays
      immune reconstitution, and therefore increase the risk of viral infection.

      The optimal dose of the different ATG preparations with respect to prevention of GvHD is not
      fully understood today.  The total doses between 6 mg/kg to 15 mg/kg are effective for
      prevention of GVHD, but the dose above 10 mg/kg may increase the development of viral
      infection.

      In this trial, we will focus on viral infections in patients treated with 7.5mg/kg or
      10mg/kg of ATG. The incidence of post-transplant viral infections and GVHD will be compared
      between different dose arms.
