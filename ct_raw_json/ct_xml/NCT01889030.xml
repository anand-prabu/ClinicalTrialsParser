  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, cross-sectional, national multicenter study, trying to obtain
      local data about the global cardiovascular risk profile of patients attending ambulatory
      offices of general practitioners and cardiologists.

      The aim of the study is to describe how physicians diagnose and stratify their patients in
      cardiovascular primary prevention setting and to highlight if patients are stratify through
      objective tools (risk scores and in this case, wich of them are used) or in subjective ways
      (clinical evaluation).
