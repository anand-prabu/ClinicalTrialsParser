      The purpose of this study is to see if the CoaguChek XS is accurate in measuring
      International Normalized Ratio (INR) in patients with Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome
      (APL) receiving warfarin therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome (APL) is an autoimmune disease that increases ones risk
      for blood clots.  Therefore, these patients receive anticoagulation therapy with warfarin.
      Point of care devices such as the CoaguChek XS are often used to monitor International
      Normalized Ratio (INR) in patients on warfarin.  However, the antibodies present in patients
      with APL may lead to false INR results when using the CoaguChek XS.  This study will compare
      the accuracy of the CoaguChek XS in measuring INR in patients with APL by measuring INR by
      the CoaguChek XS and a standard lab as a reference point.  Patients on warfarin for
      indications other than APL will be measured by both methods as well to serve as a control
      group.
