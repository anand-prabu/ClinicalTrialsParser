      This is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, single-arm, nonrandomized, open-label and dose-escalation
      study of weekly carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Cd-qw) for patients with progressive multiple
      myeloma. The Phase 1 dose escalation portion will enroll patients into sequential
      dose-escalating cohorts consisting of 3 patients each to establish the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) of carfilzomib administered weekly as a 30 minute intravenous (IV) infusion with
      dexamethasone. The Phase 2 portion will enroll patients using the MTD established for
      carfilzomib from the Phase 1 portion of the study. Dexamethasone will be administered IV or
      PO at the same dose and schedule as used in the Phase 1 portion of the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1/2 study in patients with progressive multiple myeloma is designed to achieve
      the following: to determine the MTD of carfilzomib and dexamethasone administered once
      weekly (Cd-qw) for 3 consecutive weeks in a 28-day cycle and to determine the magnitude of
      responses achieved in patients treated with the MTD.

      The Cd-qw dosing schedule proposed in this protocol may be beneficial from a patient
      convenience perspective compared to the twice-weekly dosing schedule, however, as the
      clinical benefit and safety of weekly carfilzomib administration has not been assessed in
      multiple myeloma patients, patients who progress on weekly carfilzomib will be allowed 1
      attempt to recapture response by increasing the dose frequency to the twice-weekly
      carfilzomib dosing schedule that has demonstrated efficacy and tolerability. This
      information will be valuable in assessing the dose intensity impact on the suppression of
      multiple myeloma in the relapsed setting.

      Finally, this protocol will eliminate the requirement for fluid administration with
      carfilzomib after Cycle 1 and will reduce the time that is required to treat the patient in
      clinic. This modification will be studied for its effect on the carfilzomib safety profile.

    <description>Phase 1: Carfilzomib will be administered as a 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. On only Day 1 of Cycle 1, all patients will receive carfilzomib at 20 mg/m2. All subsequent carfilzomib doses (45, 56, 70 or 88 mg/m2) will be administered according to the dose assignment for each cohort.
Phase 2: using the MTD established for carfilzomib from the Phase 1 portion of the study (except on Cycle 1 Day 1 the carfilzomib dose will be 20 mg/m2); this arm will be administered drug on the same schedule as in Phase 1.</description>
