An oral treatment is more accessible to\n      patients than drugs given by injection or by inhalation.\n\n      Patients with confirmed PCP are randomized into one of three treatment groups. Group A\n      receives SMX/TMP. Half of group A receives dapsone placebo (placebo is an inactive\n      substance) daily plus trimethoprim placebo; the other half receives clindamycin placebo plus\n      primaquine placebo. Group B is given dapsone plus trimethoprim. Half of group B receives\n      SMX/TMP placebo; the other half receives clindamycin placebo plus primaquine placebo. Group\n      C is given clindamycin plus primaquine. Half of group C receives SMX/TMP placebo, the other\n      half receives dapsone placebo plus trimethoprim placebo. Treatment lasts 21 days; dosages\n      will be adjusted for patients weighing less than 50 kg and more than 80 kg. Patients with a\n      history of intolerance to SMX/TMP for whom rechallenge is considered medically\n      contraindicated may be randomized to one of the non-sulfamethoxazole-containing arms."
