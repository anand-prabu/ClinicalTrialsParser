            "textblock": "This is a multicenter prospective investigation to assess the clinical outcomes of patients\n      with an isolated pelvic ring injury. The study team plans on enrolling 60 subjects. This\n      group will include both patients treated with and without surgical repair of the pelvic ring\n      injury.\n\n      Concomitant injuries will be accounted in two ways first by tracking the patient's ISS\n      (Injury Severity Score), second by tracking lower extremity fractures and lumbar spine\n      injuries that require fixation.   All patients will be enrolled within 2 weeks of injury to\n      allow collection of outcome information asking the patients to score in a manner reflecting\n      their perceived pre-injury level of function.  The outcome instruments administered will\n      include the short-musculoskeletal functional assessment (SMFA), the Oswestry Disability\n      Score, Majeed Pelvis Score,  and a visual analog pain score.\n\n      Patient demographics including age, income level, educational level, family support, and\n      work status will be recorded.  Additional demographic information associated with motivation\n      of recovery from injury will be collected at the time of enrollment.  Associated aspects of\n      the injury including neurologic, urologic, or bowel injuries associated with the injury will\n      be documented.  All operative complications or wound infections involving the care of the\n      pelvic ring injury will also be recorded.  Injury classification and operative data of\n      surgical repair will also be collected.   At time of follow-up neurologic deficits, evidence\n      of painful hardware, limb length discrepancy will be documented.\n\n      Initial radiographs and CT imaging will be taken in accordance with standard clinical care\n      at participating centers.  The decision for operative or non-operative management will be\n      made at the discretion of the treating surgeon.   At 6 months and 1 year follow-up time\n      points, plain film radiographs including an AP Pelvis, 40 degree inlet and 40 degree outlet\n      views will be made with a calibrated marker as described by Suzuki et al.  Calibrated\n      markers are available in standard clinical practice in Orthopaedic Surgery outpatient clinic\n      radiology units.  Use of the calibrated marker requires only that the marker, a metal ball\n      25mm in diameter,  is included in the x-ray beam adjacent to the patient at the time of\n      taking the radiograph. Radiographs are routine clinical practice at the follow-up time\n      points in these  patients. Outcome instruments will be administered to the patient at these\n      time points as well."
