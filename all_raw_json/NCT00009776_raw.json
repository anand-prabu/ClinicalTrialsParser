Combining monoclonal antibody\n      therapy with cyclosporine and paclitaxel may be an effective treatment for non-Hodgkin's\n      lymphoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody\n      therapy combined with paclitaxel and cyclosporine in treating patients who have recurrent or\n      refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."

Patients receive\n      unlabeled MOAB Lym-1 IV followed by a tracer dose of indium In 111 MOAB Lym-1 IV on day 0.\n      On day 7, patients receive unlabeled MOAB Lym-1 IV followed by Y90 MOAB Lym-1 IV. Patients\n      in cohorts 2-4 also receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 9. Courses repeat every 8\n      weeks for a total of 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of Y90 MOAB Lym-1 until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 3 months for 21 months, and then every 6\n      months for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 36 months."
