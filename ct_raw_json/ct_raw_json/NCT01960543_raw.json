In these\n      situations, regional anesthesia is recommended as it is associated to less postoperative\n      cognitive dysfunction. However, hypotension during the process may impair ischemic\n      cardiopathy and induce a cerebrovascular stroke. Selection of the right anesthetic agent and\n      the administration of vasoactive drugs during the process can minimize these risks. Although\n      bupivacaine and levobupivacaine share pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, the\n      studies show conflicting results. The aim of this study is to investigate if there are\n      clinically relevant differences between these two drugs in terms of hemodynamic parameters\n      during the surgical process with special focus on the effects on regional cerebral oximetry\n      and cognitive status after surgery."
