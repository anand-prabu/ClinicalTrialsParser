In Denmark patients are offered six laser treatments covered\n      by the public health insurance. There is a lack of good follow-up treatments to this regime\n      that can extent the efficacy of the laser treatment. Eflornithin cream is an approved\n      treatment for reduction of facial hair growth which has proved to give an additional\n      efficiency when used in combination with laser treatments.The efficacy when used after laser\n      hair removal is not known.\n\n      Aim: To investigate whether an extended efficacy of laser hair removal can be achieved with\n      application of Eflornithin cream twice daily for six months after completion of laser\n      treatments.\n\n      Method: in a split-face trial to apply Eflornithin cream twice daily for six months. Outcome\n      measures are investigator evaluation, blinded on-site evaluation, patient's assessment score\n      and clinical photos."
