            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is a condition that can lead to multiple myeloma, a type\n      of blood cancer. In many high-risk cases, SMM can develop into multiple myeloma in less than\n      2 years. The current standard of care for SMM is follow-up without treatment until multiple\n      myeloma develops. However, some drugs are being studied to see if they can slow down or\n      prevent the disease from progressing. One such drug is MLN9708. It has shown some results\n      against multiple myeloma. Researchers want to combine MLN9708 with dexamethasone to see how\n      it works against high-risk SMM.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To see if MLN9708 with dexamethasone is a safe and effective treatment for high-risk\n      smoldering multiple myeloma.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine\n           samples will be collected. Imaging studies and a bone marrow biopsy may also be\n           performed.\n\n        -  Participants will take MLN9708 and dexamethasone on a regular schedule for 28 days.\n           They will take each drug four times at regular intervals during each cycle of\n           treatment.\n\n        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.\n\n        -  Participants will have 12 cycles of treatment. After four cycles, patients will be\n           recommended to have their own stem cells collected and stored. This will allow the\n           potential application of a highdose melpahalan/autologous stem cell transplant in the\n           event there is a need in the future (not part of this study).\n\n        -  After 12 cycles, participants will keep taking MLN9708 as long as the disease does not\n           progress and the side effects are not too severe."
