Chronic\n      kidney disease was diagnosed as decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 60\n      mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2. Study groups were arranged as group 1 consisting of HD receiving patients,\n      group 2 consisting of stage 1-4 CKD patients and group 3 consisting of patients with normal\n      kidney functions (control group). Demographic properties and the rate of PEX were evaluated\n      and compaired between the groups."
