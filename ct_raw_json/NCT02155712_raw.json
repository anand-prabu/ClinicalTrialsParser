Patient has a Body Mass Index (BMI) > 40.\n\n          2. Patient has a diagnosis of avascular necrosis or inflammatory arthritis.\n\n          3. Patient has an active or suspected latent infection in or about the affected knee\n             joint at time of study device implantation.\n\n          4. Patient has a neuromuscular or neurosensory deficiency, which limits the ability to\n             evaluate the safety and efficacy of the device.\n\n          5. Subject is diagnosed with a systemic disease (e.g. Lupus Erythematosus) or a\n             metabolic disorder (e.g. Paget's Disease) leading to progressive bone deterioration.\n\n          6. Patient is immunologically suppressed or receiving steroids in excess of normal\n             physiological requirements (e.g. > 30 days).\n\n          7. Patient is diagnosed with lumbar radicular pain.\n\n          8. Patient has a known sensitivity to device materials.\n\n          9. Patient is a prisoner."
