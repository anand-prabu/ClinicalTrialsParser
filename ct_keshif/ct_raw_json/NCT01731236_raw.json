            "textblock": "The principal goal for the study is to examine the role gut flora plays in modulating\n      metabolism of dietary carnitine in humans. We hypothesize that levels of carnitine and its\n      metabolites, trimethylamine (TMA), trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), and other gut flora, can\n      be detected in human plasma and urine, and changes in response to dietary intake of red\n      meats (Koeth et al, 2010, unpublished data). We also hypothesize that metabolism of\n      carnitine may differ between men and women, and between those with low versus high\n      cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease) and metabolic\n      syndrome (insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, obesity, hypertension). We further hypothesize\n      that specific metabolites of carnitine are produced in a fashion dependent upon the action\n      of intestinal microflora (gut flora), and can be reduced by transient suppression or\n      modulation of gut flora via short-term broad spectrum antibiotic therapy, or by\n      reconstitution of microflora composition via probiotic therapy, in healthy subjects.\n\n      The purpose of this pilot study is to establish the methodology and pursue further\n      understanding of the human metabolism of dietary carnitine and factors that may influence\n      carnitine metabolism in humans. Findings of these pilot observations are important in\n      providing proof-of-concept, and in determining the best ways to identify these potentially\n      vulnerable subjects for future intervention studies.\n\n      This is a prospective, randomized, 3-Arm study of 4-week duration per subject."
