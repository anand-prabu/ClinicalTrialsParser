      The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a difference in cerebral
      oxygenation as measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in children with concussion and
      healthy controls.

        This pilot study will employ a prospective cohort study design.  Children aged 10-18 years
        will be recruited within the Johns Hopkins Hospital Pediatric Emergency Department (JHH
        PED) to participate in this study.  All children must be conversant in English.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All Participants

          -  Age 10-18 years at time of visit

        Concussion Group

          -  Present to JHH PED within the first 24 hours following trauma.

          -  Diagnosis of concussion as defined by the 3rd International Conference on Concussion
             in Sport (McCrory), including the presence of any one or more of the following:

               1. Symptoms (ie. headache, neck pain, nausea/vomiting, dizziness, blurred vision,
                  balance problems, sensitive to light, sensitivity to noise, feeling slowed down,
                  feeling in a fog, difficulty concentrating, difficulty remembering, fatigue,
                  confusion, drowsiness, more emotional, irritability, sadness, nervous)

               2. Physical Signs (ie. loss of consciousness, unsteadiness)

               3. Impaired brain function (ie. confusion)

          -  Glasgow Coma Score of 13-15 upon arrival to JHH PED.

          -  Loss of consciousness of less than 15 minutes (if applicable).

          -  No structural intracranial injuries identified on neuroimaging (if completed).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        All Participants

          -  History of prior concussion or traumatic brain injury within preceding 6 weeks.

          -  History of prior intracranial disease or mass (ie. tumor, intraventricular
             hemorrhage, etc.)

          -  Presence of intracranial hardware.

          -  Complaints of respiratory distress, tachypnea or hypoxia, which may affect regional
             cerebral oxygen saturation.

          -  Inability to stand secondary to lower extremity disease or trauma, which is required
             for completion of SCAT2.

          -  Inability to complete SCAT2 questionnaire secondary to developmental delay.

          -  Child in foster care or legal guardian not available.

          -  Participant known to be pregnant, which alters total body blood flow and likely
             affects regional cerebral oxygen saturation.

          -  Non-English speaking.
