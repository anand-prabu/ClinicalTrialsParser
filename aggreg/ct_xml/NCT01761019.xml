  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral therapies for psoriasis, including methotrexate and acitretin, are often less effective
      when used as monotherapy (without other oral medicines or creams) than are newer biologic
      injected drugs. However, these oral medications are also less expensive than biologic agents
      and may be safer for use in some patients. The purpose of this study is to determine if
      adding a topical psoriasis medicine, Taclonex topical suspension, will improve the severity
      of psoriasis in patients already on methotrexate or acitretin and to determine if adding
      this topical suspension will reduce the desire of such patients to switch to a biologic
      agent to treat their psoriasis.

    <description>We will measure the difference in percent of subjects who wish to change to another systemic therapy at baseline vs at week 12.
Subject satisfaction:  We also ask subjects for their level of satisfaction with current treatment at baseline and week 12. They will be given the following options: &quot;very satisfied&quot;, &quot;satisfied&quot;, &quot;somewhat disappointed&quot; or &quot;very disappointed&quot;. We will then determine the effect of adding Taclonex  topical suspension to a single systemic agent on subject satisfaction by calculating percentage of subjects who were more satisfied, less satisfied, or had no change in their level of satisfaction with their treatment regimen at baseline vs week 12.</description>
