Together, these data will advance\n      the investigators understanding of how neural systems support recovery from stroke. The\n      investigators will use a MRI technique that allows us to assess the health of a brain\n      structure called myelin. This structure is important as it allows information to travel down\n      nerves faster; the more myelin the quicker the signal can be conducted. The investigators\n      aim is to test whether or not movement training can restore myelin in the brain. If movement\n      training does restore myelin in the brain, the investigators will have identified an\n      important new target for rehabilitation interventions."

TRAIT employs an open source Kinect sensor, which tracks 3-D joint movement.  Participants are asked to control an on-screen icon using movements of their paretic arm to intercept a moving object as it emerges from the side of a computer screen. Once intercepted, they must accurately throw the object to hit a target. Participants move up through 10 levels of the game as their skill improves.  Participants will complete 10 TRAIT training sessions in 4 weeks for a total of 10,000 experimental movements.",
