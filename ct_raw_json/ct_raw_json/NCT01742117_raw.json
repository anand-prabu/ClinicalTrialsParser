            "textblock": "Clopidogrel is an anti-platelet medication approved by the U.S. Federal Drug Administration\n      (FDA) for use in patients who undergo Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) with coronary\n      stent implantation. Anti-platelet medications work to prevent blood clots from forming. Some\n      studies have suggested that patients who have a certain genetic liver enzyme abnormality\n      (known as cytochrome P450 2C19 [CYP2C19] *2 or *3 allele) may have a reduced ability to\n      activate clopidogrel, and therefore may have a lowered response to clopidogrel.  It is\n      thought that perhaps people who have a coronary stent procedure may have this genetic liver\n      enzyme abnormality. There is a research genetic test available to determine whether or not\n      someone has this genetic liver enzyme abnormality.  Ticagrelor, is a newer anti-platelet\n      drug that is not dependent on the CYP2C19 liver enzyme for its activation and hence in poor\n      clopidogrel metabolizers, alternative drugs like Ticagrelor have been recommended for use as\n      an anti-platelet agent after PCI. The purpose of this study is to determine if genetic\n      testing can identify the best anti-platelet therapy, for patients who undergo a coronary\n      stent placement and do not activate clopidogrel very well."

Patients\n      who undergo PCI will be randomized to a conventional therapy arm (i.e., to receive\n      clopidogrel 75 mg once daily without prospective genotyping guidance) versus a prospective\n      CYP2C19 genotype-based anti-platelet therapy approach (ticagrelor 90 mg bid in CYP2C19 *2 or\n      *3 reduced function allele patients, clopidogrel 75 mg once daily in non-*2 or -*3 CYP2C19\n      patients).  Buccal swabs will be obtained for those subjects randomized to the prospective\n      genotyping arm. All subjects will have a blood sample drawn for DNA analysis but genotyping\n      using these DNA samples will be performed only after completion of the duration of\n      anti-platelet therapy (i.e., after one year).  The primary endpoints will be assessed\n      prospectively and will be compared between the conventional arm and the prospective\n      genotyping arm among those identified as reduced function CYP2C19 allele carriers according\n      to the 1-year genotype results."
