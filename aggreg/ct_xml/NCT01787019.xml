  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if earlier initiation of oral (by mouth as opposed
      to tube) feedings in premature infants results in earlier attainment of full oral feedings
      and/or discharge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infants will be enrolled and randomized at 30 0/7 weeks postmenstrual age.   The Earlier
      Oral Feeding group will initiate oral feedings at 30 0/7 weeks postmenstrual age.  The Later
      Oral Feeding group will initiate oral feedings at 33 0/7 weeks postmenstrual age.  The
      number of oral feeding attempts will be advanced according to a feeding progression protocol
      for both groups.  Successful completion of a feeding is defined as oral completion of the
      full volume of a feeding within 30 minutes, without a bradycardic episode (heart rate &lt;100
      beats per minute) or desaturation (oxygen saturation decrease &gt;5% from baseline values).  If
      infant does not successfully complete &gt;95% of the total prescribed volume of a feeding, the
      remainder of the volume will be supplied via gastric tube.  All oral feedings will be
      performed by bedside nurses, or by a parent with observation by the nursing staff, with
      continuous cardiorespiratory and pulse oximetry monitoring.  Individual oral feeding
      attempts for both groups will continue until one of the following occurs despite appropriate
      pacing of the feeding: 1) the feeding is completed 2) feeding duration of 30 minutes 3)
      adverse event during a feeding [multiple bradycardic episodes (3 episodes of heart rate &lt;100
      beats per minute), bradycardia with choking episode, single severe bradycardia (heart rate
      &lt;60)].  If the infant experiences an adverse event during an oral feeding attempt, oral
      feeding attempts will be held for 2 days.
