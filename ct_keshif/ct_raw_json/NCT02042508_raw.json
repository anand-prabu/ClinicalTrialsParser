This preliminary study does not include a\n      control group.\n\n      The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a hybrid reconditioning programme\n      (electrostimulation of the lower limb muscles associated with voluntary strengthening of the\n      upper limbs) on a specially developed rowing machine in patients presenting stabilized\n      paraplegia of a traumatic origin. This study will bear on the increase in maximal aerobic\n      capacity (VO2max) between the start and end of the 9-month reconditioning programme."
