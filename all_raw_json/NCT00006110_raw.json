Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor\n      cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming\n      normal cells. Combining chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, and surgery may be a more\n      effective treatment for breast cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy, monoclonal\n      antibody therapy, and surgery in treating women who have stage II, stage III, or stage IV\n      breast cancer."

Patients then undergo surgery with or without\n                adjuvant radiotherapy and/or oral tamoxifen.\n\n             -  Regimen II (HER-2 overexpressing patients only): Patients receive doxorubicin and\n                cyclophosphamide as in regimen I.

Patients then\n                receive trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes weekly on weeks 29-69 if they did not\n                receive radiotherapy or on weeks 36-76 if they did receive radiotherapy.\n\n        -  Adjuvant therapy: Patients who are assigned to receive adjuvant therapy (HER-2\n           overexpressing patients only) receive doxorubicin IV and cyclophosphamide IV over 30\n           minutes on day 1 every 3 weeks for a total of 4 courses. After completion of course 4,\n           patients receive paclitaxel IV and trastuzumab IV over 90 minutes weekly on weeks\n           13-24. Patients then may undergo radiotherapy followed by trastuzumab IV over 30\n           minutes weekly on weeks 29-69 if they did not receive radiotherapy or on weeks 36-76 if\n           they did receive radiotherapy.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 125 patients (100 in the neoadjuvant group and 25 in the\n      adjuvant group) will be accrued for this study within 5 years."
