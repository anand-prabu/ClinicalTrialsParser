Biological therapies, such as\n      lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from\n      growing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pidilizumab, can block cancer growth by blocking the\n      ability of cancer to grow and spread. Giving lenalidomide with pidilizumab may work better\n      in treating relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma."
