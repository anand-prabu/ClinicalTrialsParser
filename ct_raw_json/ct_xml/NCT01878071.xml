  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, greater emphasis has been placed on the link between oral and systemic
      health. Obesity, a growing medical problem worldwide, has been associated with multiple
      chronic inflammatory diseases such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. With
      respect to the effect of obesity on periodontal health, it has been shown that obese
      subjects exhibit higher inflammation around natural teeth and are at increased risk of tooth
      loss than individuals with normal weight. Peri-implantitis, an inflammatory condition of
      bacterial origin that occurs around oral implants and resembles periodontal disease, has
      become a serious concern for the dental profession given its increasing prevalence and
      challenging treatment. There is also strong evidence that individuals with a history of
      periodontitis are also at risk for peri-implantitis. However, knowledge about the
      pathogenesis and treatment of peri-implantitis is scarce. Hence, it is extremely important
      to understand the implications of excessive body fat on peri-implant health.  Based on the
      current understanding on the effect of obesity on systemic and local inflammation around
      natural teeth, the investigators hypothesize that obesity will have a significant impact on
      peri-implant health by inducing an increased inflammatory response as measured by clinical
      as well as molecular markers of inflammation.
