      The investigators hypothesize that formula that includes patient weight and glucocorticoid
      dose can be used to safely initiate insulin treatment in diabetic/hyperglycemic patients who
      are to be treated with pharmacological doses of glucocorticoids.

      The target fasting and pre-meal FSG will be 90-140 mg/dL, and the random FSG will be less
      than180 mg/dL, taking into consideration the ADA/AACE target glucose levels in non-ICU
      patients (15).

      The G/L Protocol will include 0.2 unit/kg/day as insulin glargine once daily if the dose is
      between 40-80 units, or twice daily if the dose is less than 40 or more than 80 units; plus
      0.2 unit/kg/day as lispro divided between three meals for all insulin-naïve patients. A
      &quot;coverage&quot; dose of 0.1 unit/kg/day of lispro for each 10 mg of prednisone or its equivalent
      will be divided between 3 meals. The maximum starting &quot;coverage&quot; dose will be 0.4 units/kg
      per day.

      The prandial dose of lispro will be increased by 10% if the pre-lunch, pre-dinner, or
      bedtime FSG is between 141-200 mg/dL, and by 20% if the pre-lunch, pre-dinner or bedtime FSG
      is &gt;200 mg/dL. The prandial dose of lispro will be decreased by 10% if the pre-lunch,
      pre-dinner, or bedtime FSG is between 70-89 mg/dL, and by 20% if the pre-lunch, pre-dinner
      or bedtime FSG is less than 70 mg/dL.

      The G/L/N Protocol will include 0.2 unit/kg/day as insulin glargine once daily if the dose
      is between 40-80 units, or twice daily if the dose is less than 40 or more than 80 units;
      plus 0.2 unit/kg/day as lispro divided between three meals for all the insulin-naïve
      patients. A &quot;coverage&quot; dose of 0.1 unit/kg/day of NPH for each 10 mg of prednisone or its
      equivalent will be given twice daily with the administration of the glucocorticoid. The
      maximum starting &quot;coverage&quot; dose will be 0.4 units/kg per day.

      The NPH dose will be increased by 10% if the pre-lunch, pre-dinner, or bedtime FSG is
      between 141-200 mg/dL, and by 20% if the pre-lunch, pre-dinner or bedtime FSG is greater
      than 200 mg/dL. The NPH dose will be decreased by 10% if the pre-lunch, pre-dinner, or
      bedtime FSG is between 70-89 mg/dL, and by 20% if the pre-lunch, pre-dinner or bedtime FSG
      is less than 70 mg/dL.

      In both protocols glargine dose will be increased by 10% if the fasting glucose value is
      141-200 mg/dL and by 20% if the fasting glucose value is more than 200 mg/dL, and decreased
      by 10% if the fasting FSG is 70-89 mg/dL and by 20% if the fasting FSG is less than 70
      mg/dL.

      If the patient had an outpatient regimen which includes a total daily dose of insulin (TDI)
      that exceeds 0.4 unit/kg/day, then the same TDI will be continued with 50% given as glargine
      once daily if the dose is between 40-80 units, or twice daily if the dose is less than 40 or
      more than 80 units; and 50% given as lispro divided between three meals. The patient will
      still be randomly assigned to either one of the two protocols as described previously.

      If the patient were on a TDI less than 0.4 unit/kg/day in addition to oral antidiabetic
      medications as an outpatient, then all the oral antidiabetic medications will be
      discontinued and the patient will be started on 0.5 unit/kg/day divided as 50% glargine
      given once daily if the dose is between 40-80 units, or twice daily if the dose is less than
      40 or more than 80 units; and 50% lispro divided between three meals. The patient will still
      be randomly assigned to either one of the two protocols based upon even and odd hospital
      numbers.
