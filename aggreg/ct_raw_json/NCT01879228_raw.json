            "textblock": "In recent years, diabetes has emerged as one of the most significant co-diseases that many\n      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients develop. Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes results when either the\n      body does not make enough insulin or the body does not respond correctly to this insulin.\n      Insulin is a hormone which is made by cells in the pancreas and helps carry glucose (sugar)\n      from the food we eat to the cells of the body for energy. While cystic fibrosis related\n      diabetes (CFRD) has many features similar to both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, it is very\n      different; therefore, treatment and care of CFRD is not the same.\n\n      The purpose of this research study is to examine and understand the various mechanisms that\n      contribute to CFRD and gain a better understanding of potential means to treat CFRD. The\n      primary objective is to determine effectiveness of chronic incretin-based therapy vs.\n      placebo on insulin secretion in CF patients with indeterminate glucose tolerance, impaired\n      glucose tolerance, or CFRD."

Arginine is a naturally occurring amino acid (substance) in the body. It will be given in the veins to make the pancreas secrete insulin. After the first injection of arginine, a glucose infusion will be started in order to raise the level of sugar in the blood to 230 mg/dl. Once the level is achieved, arginine will be injected again and blood samples are measured. After a 2 hour break, the glucose infusion will be started to achieve a blood sugar of 340 mg/dl and the arginine injection will be repeated. Comparison of responses at baseline and after 6 months of incretin-based therapy (Sitagliptin) or placebo will be performed using statistical methods.",
