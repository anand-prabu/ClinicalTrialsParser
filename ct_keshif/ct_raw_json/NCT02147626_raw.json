The American Heart Association has recently issued guidelines\n      that physicians should include history of the hypertensive pregnancy disorder, preeclampsia,\n      as a risk factor for CVD. Indeed, research demonstrates that roughly 2 out of 3 women with a\n      history of preeclampsia will die from CVD. This study will work with patients with prior\n      preeclampsia and with the Preeclampsia Foundation, a patient- based organization, to create\n      an online lifestyle modification program ( accessible by computer or smart phone) for women\n      with recent preeclampsia to reduce CVD risk. The study is a randomized controlled trial to\n      test the program's acceptability, use, and impact on diet, postpartum weight retention,\n      physical activity, blood pressure, and patient knowledge and self-efficacy to improve\n      health."
