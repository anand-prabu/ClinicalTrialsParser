            "textblock": "BACKGROUND: Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is the commonest type of acute\n      coronary syndrome (ACS) and has a poor long-term prognosis. Guidewire-based coronary\n      pressure measurement of the myocardial fractional flow reserve (FFR) is a\n      prognostically-validated invasive method for measuring coronary lesion severity in patients\n      with stable coronary artery disease. FFR measurement in patients with unstable coronary\n      disease has theoretical limitations and is not fully validated in NSTEMI.\n\n      AIM: To prospectively evaluate ischaemia and infarction with adenosine stress perfusion\n      cardiac MRI in medically-stabilised NSTEMI patients in whom FFR has been measured.\n\n      METHODS: In the FAMOUS-NSTEMI clinical trial (NCT registration 01764334),\n      medically-stabilised patients with recent NSTEMI will have lesion-level ischaemia measured\n      with FFR in all coronary artery stenoses amenable to revascularisation, as clinically\n      appropriate.\n\n      Consecutive study participants will be invited to have an adenosine (140 \u00b5g/kg/min) stress\n      3.0 Tesla cardiac MRI scan to assess myocardial perfusion on up to three occasions: 1)\n      before coronary angiography, 2) within 10 days post coronary angiography and finally, 3) 6\n      months after hospital admission. MRI will also assess myocardial pathophysiology including\n      ischaemia, oedema, haemorrhage and infarct scar. MRI will provide the reference dataset.\n      Guidewire-derived parameters were obtained and assessed blind to the MRI results.\n\n      The primary outcome is the correspondence between the presence or absence of an\n      inducible-myocardial perfusion defect and FFR \u2264 or > 0.80 in the MRI scans at baseline or\n      post-angiography. Secondary outcomes include the correlation between measures of infarct\n      severity as revealed by MRI (infarct size, myocardial salvage, microvascular obstruction,\n      myocardial haemorrhage, myocardial strain) and invasive measures of coronary function (1)\n      coronary collateral supply (fractional coronary collateral supply), (2) microcirculatory\n      resistance (index of microvascular resistance), and (3) vasodilator capacity (resistive\n      reserve ratio).\n\n      The project was funded by the British Heart Foundation and Chief Scientist Office. The\n      pressure wires were provided through a restricted grant from St Jude Medical. The funders of\n      the study have no involvement in the study design, analysis, interpretation, or presentation\n      of the results.\n\n      VALUE: This study will provide clinically important information on the relationships between\n      coronary artery and microcirculatory function measured invasively and ischaemia and MI\n      pathologies, as revealed by non-invasively by MRI."
