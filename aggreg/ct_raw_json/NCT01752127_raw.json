Although\n      these are thought to be superior in effect and stability compared to ZES and EES of previous\n      generation, there are few clinical data regarding the high risk groups of diabetes patients\n      or small vessels lesion. Moreover, looking at the 8.3% of restenosis in Resolute All Comer\n      study (23% diabetes), the investigators could not know the outcome in high risk patients\n      such as diabetes or small vessels lesion. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate\n      the effectiveness and safety of Resolute Integrity or Xience Prime in diabetes or small\n      vessels lesion patients."

Only if deployment of the allocated stent is not possible, crossing to other stent would be allowed.\nDirect stenting or bifurcation stenting is allowed.\nPredilation before stenting, IVUS examination, and administration of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor would be determined by investigator.",
