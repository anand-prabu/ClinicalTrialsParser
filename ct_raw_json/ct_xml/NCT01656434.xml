    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the contraceptive efficacy of a nomegestrol acetate +
      17ß-estradiol (NOMAC-E2) combined oral contraceptive (COC) in healthy, sexually-active
      American women at risk for pregnancy. Vaginal bleeding patterns of women taking NOMAC-E2
      will be assessed and compared to those of women taking a norethisterone acetate + ethinyl
      estradiol (NETA-EE) COC. The safety of NOMAC-E2 will also be assessed.

      Participants will be randomized to receive either NOMAC-E2 or NETA-EE in a 3:1 ratio. As of
      Amendment 1 (which increased the sample size of the NOMAC-E2 group), the randomization ratio
      will be adapted accordingly for participants randomized after the sample size increase.
