  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is frequently seen in the ED, post-concussive symptoms
      are common post-injury, and few MTBI patients receive treatment or follow-up for these
      symptoms. Cell phones are ubiquitous, text messaging (SMS) is a cheap and increasingly
      common form of communication, potentially allowing for accurate assessment of symptom
      patterns after MTBI and provision of basic education support . The investigators seek to
      assess the feasibility of using SMS to collect symptoms related to MTBI in patients either
      discharged from the ED or admitted to the inpatient trauma unit. The investigators also seek
      to explore how SMS-based symptom reports correlate with phone-based follow-up reports at 14
      days and whether additional SMS-based educational feedback alters daily symptom patterns.
