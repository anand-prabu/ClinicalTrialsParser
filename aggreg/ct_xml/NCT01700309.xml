  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing throughout the world. Obesity is seen
      as one of the most important public health threats because of the significant impact of
      chronic conditions associated with obesity. Obesity during adolescence is a strong precursor
      of obesity and related morbidity in adulthood.

      Interventions aimed directly at reducing weight or preventing increase in weight shows
      limited results on long term effects and it is shown that increase in activity has more
      impact on health outcome than on weight-loss. Further, weight-loss does not seem to be an
      appropriate measure of therapeutic interventions for growing children. The hypothesis of
      this study is that focusing on increasing meaningful physical activity through individual
      tailored counselling will have positive effects on the adolescents' fitness (health) and
      quality of life. Thus, the overall purpose of the study is to examine the extent to which a
      web-based intervention influences physical activity, fitness and quality of life in
      over-weight and obese adolescents Further, the aim is to explore and describe how
      adolescents experience being over-weight and obese, what they perceive as meaningful
      physical activity and finally how adolescents experience lifestyle changes as demanded in
      the intervention study.

    <textblock>
      The target group is overweight adolescents, meaning their BMI is over or equal to the 95th
      percentile (BMI&gt;25) and they should not have severe health problems as a result of their
      overweight. For adults, BMI (Body Mass Index; weight in kilograms divided by the square of
      height in meters) values at or above 25 indicate overweight and a BMI at or above 30 defines
      obesity. No such generally accepted definitions exist for children and adolescents. However,
      international standardized cut points have been proposed, among others by Cole et al (2000)
      and experts support the use of BMI cutoff points for children. The cut points proposed by
      Cole et al (2000) are widely used and take age, gender and sex into consideration in the
      estimation. The focus is primarily to prevent a negative development, and the aim is that
      the school health service in the future might implement a modified version of this strategy
      for working with overweight adolescents.

      The design of the study is a complex intervention study with a multi-method design,
      consisting of a quasi-experimental trial and a qualitative study. The sample will be drawn
      from schools in Oslo. Overweight adolescents will be  selected and placed in the
      intervention group or control group respectively. The sampling will be based on objective
      measures of weight and height and using Cole's index to define overweight and obesity.
      Weight and height will be measured by the school nurse and will be coordinated with her
      regular meetings with the adolescents in 8th grade.. The study group will receive the
      web-based intervention and the control group will receive standard care. At baseline, 3
      months and 1 year both the experimental group and the control group will be measured at
      relevant variables. In the qualitative part of the study, in depth interviews with the
      adolescents in the intervention group will be performed and they will write daily
      unstructured blogs on the web. The sampling procedure for the qualitative part of the study
      will follow the sampling procedure of the intervention study. From the intervention group, a
      strategic or purposive sample of adolescents will be asked to participate in the qualitative
      part (Gerrish and Lacey 2006). A sample of maximum variation according to gender and
      sosio-demographic variables is intended. Sampling continues until saturation is reached and
      the adolescents will be interviewed in depth before the intervention starts, further at 3
      and 12 months after the intervention is ended.

    <description>The intervention will consist of three meetings between the adolescent, the parents and the researchers, and weekly web-based health-counselling. The adolescents will set goals and make an individual activity plan on the web-page. During the study period all activity will be registered by the adolescents. The researchers will perform weekly counseling based on Selfdetermination Theory and Motivational Interviewing. The webiste also allows for the adolescents to communicate with eacother and with the counsler through a blog.</description>
