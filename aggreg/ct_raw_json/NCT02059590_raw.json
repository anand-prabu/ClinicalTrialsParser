In addition,\n      identify the metabolic profile of BAL8728 in human plasma, urine and/or feces after a single\n      intravenous dose of pyridinylmethyl-14C-labeled BAL8557 and evaluate the pharmacokinetics of\n      BAL8728 and BAL4815.  Safety and tolerability after a single intravenous dose of\n      pyridinylmethyl-14C-labeled isavuconazonium sulfate will also be evaluated."
