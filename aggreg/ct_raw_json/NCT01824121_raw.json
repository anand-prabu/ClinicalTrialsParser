Each patient will undergo two infusions, one with the stem cells and one without, at\n      an interval of 6 months.  The sequence of the two infusions will be assigned randomly;\n      patients and assessors will not know the sequence (double-blind).  Patients will be\n      followed-up for up to 1 year after the last infusion, with regular assessments to assess\n      safety, efficacy on motor and cognitive functions, and effects on the brain by neuroimaging\n      techniques.\n\n      The study has a preliminary phase with 5 patients all given stem cell therapy alone,\n      designed to assess safety"
