Patients receive autologous DC transfected with autologous prostate carcinoma RNA\n      intradermally once weekly on weeks 0-3 for a total of 4 doses.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of DC until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at weeks 6, 8, 10, and 12; every 3 months for 9 months; and then\n      annually for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients will be accrued for this study within 20 months."
