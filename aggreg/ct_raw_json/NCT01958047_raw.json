Each race group comprises 8 female subjects and 8 male subjects.\n\n      Screening assessments are performed from Day -22 to Day -2, and subjects are admitted to the\n      clinic on Day -1, where they remain until Day 4. On Day 1, the subjects receive a single\n      oral dose of ASP3652, and are discharged on Day 4 when all assessments have been performed\n      and if there are no medical reasons to stay longer. An end of study visit (ESV) is performed\n      7-14 days after discharge.\n\n      For each race group, plasma samples for PK and PD analysis are collected. Vital signs,\n      safety electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements, safety laboratory assessments, physical\n      examination, adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications are monitored throughout\n      study.\n\n      In order to identify potential relationships between dietary intake and the PK of a single\n      dose of ASP3652, all subjects record their diet for 3 days during the screening period in\n      order to assess daily dietary intake (including total daily caloric intake; daily\n      cholesterol intake; and total fat, saturated fat, carbohydrate and protein as a percentage\n      of total calories)."
