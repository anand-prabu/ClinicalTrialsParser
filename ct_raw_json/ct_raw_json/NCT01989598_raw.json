To evaluate the antitumor activity of trametinib determined by overall response rate\n      (ORR) in patients that are stratified into grouped based on: biomarker positive\n      (neuroblastoma RAS viral [v-ras] oncogene homolog [NRAS], v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma\n      viral oncogene homolog [KRAS], v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 [BRAF]\n      mutated) and biomarker negative (without NRAS, KRAS, BRAF mutation).\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) and duration of response (DOR) in the two\n      stratified groups.\n\n      II. To document ORR after the addition of GSK2141795 (Akt inhibitor GSK2141795) to\n      trametinib in patients who have developed progressive disease or have achieved less than a\n      partial response (PR) after 4 cycles of treatment.\n\n      III. To evaluate PFS and DOR in patients receiving trametinib plus GSK2141795. IV. To\n      evaluate the safety profile of trametinib with and without GSK2141795.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To explore the relationship between clinical response and pharmacodynamic (PD) markers.\n\n      II. To explore the relationship between v-maf avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene\n      homolog (MAF) expression as determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR),\n      chromosomal abnormalities detected by florescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and clinical\n      response.\n\n      III. To explore the role of integrin beta7 as a biomarker of MAF expression. IV. To explore\n      the relationship between objective clinical response as well as progressive disease and the\n      tumor mutational profile.\n\n      V. To explore mechanism of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/v-akt Murine Thymoma Viral\n      Oncogene Homolog 1 (AKT) and retrovirus-associated deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence\n      (RAS)-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)-mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (ERK)\n      activation and correlate these with clinical response and PD markers.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive trametinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every\n      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with\n      progressive disease or who achieve less than PR after 4 courses may also receive Akt\n      inhibitor GSK2141795 PO daily on days 1-28.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks."
