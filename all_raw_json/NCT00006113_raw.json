Biological therapies such as interferon gamma and interleukin-2 use\n      different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop cancer cells from growing. Combining\n      vaccine therapy with biological therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying giving vaccine therapy together with interferon\n      gamma and interleukin-2 in treating patients with stage III or stage IV melanoma."

Melanoma\n      peptides (MART-1:26-35, gp100:209-217, and tyrosinase:368-376) are pulsed separately onto\n      ADCs, which are also treated ex vivo with CD40-ligand, interferon gamma, interleukin-4,\n      sargramostim (GM-CSF), and Candida albicans skin test reagent. Patients receive each\n      melanoma peptide pulsed ADC vaccine separately via 3 successive 10 minute infusions on day\n      1. Patients then receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously every 12 hours on days 2-6. Treatment\n      repeats every 2 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, then every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3\n      years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-41 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24\n      months."
