Improving\n      gastric accommodation and prokinetic effect seem to be an attractive physiological target in\n      patients with FD. Motilitone (Dong-A ST, Yongin, Korea) is a new herbal drug that was\n      launched in December 2011 in Korea for treating patients with FD. The current study aims to\n      evaluate effects of motilitone on gastric accommodation and emptying after a meal in a group\n      of healthy volunteers using three-dimensional gastric volume measurements by magnetic\n      resonance imaging (MRI). Healthy volunteers are randomly allocated to receive either\n      motilitone or placebo in a double blinded manner. After 5 days of treatment, subjects\n      undergo gastric MRI. The primary endpoint is gastric accommodation."
