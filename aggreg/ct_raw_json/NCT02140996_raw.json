If none of the patients in the 1st cohort experience Dose limiting toxicity (DLT), a 2nd cohort will receive 1 dose of 1x1010 VP.

The patients in the 4th cohort will receive 1 injection of 1x1011 if no DLT occurs in the preceding cohort.\nIf 1 patient out of 3 experienced DLT, the cohort will be expanded to 6 patients. If \u22641 DLT out of 6 subjects is observed in this cohort, the study will proceed onto the next dose level. If \u22652 is observed in these 6 patients, the next lower dose cohort will be expanded to 6 patients."

            "textblock": "In epithelial cancer, MUC-1(mucin-1) overexpression is thought to disrupt E-cadherin\n      function, leading to anchorage-independent tumor cell growth and metastases. Elevated levels\n      of MUC-1 expression have been found in patients with epithelial cancers of breast, ovarian,\n      colon and lung. Furthermore, overexpression of MUC-1 is independently correlated with\n      adverse clinical phenotypes, metastases and resistance to chemotherapy. In animal models,\n      suppressing the expression of MUC-1 reduces the rates of growth and metastasis and increases\n      the sensitivity of the cancer to chemotherapy-induced cell death.\n\n      In this study, an adenoviral Ad-sig-hMUC-1/ecdCD40L vector encoding a fusion protein in\n      which the hMUC-1 epithelial antigen is attached to the CD40L (CD40 ligand). The preclinical\n      results have also shown that two subcutaneous Ad-sig-hMUC-1/ecdCD40L vector injections can\n      induce immunity which suppresses the growth of hMUC-1 tumor cells in 100% of the vaccinated\n      mice without Interleukin (IL) 2 stimulation being required, this suggests that the\n      Ad-sig-hMUC-1/ecdCD40L vector prime-hMUC-1/ecdCD40L protein boost has the potential to be an\n      effective vaccine in epithelial tumors. Therefore, the safety and tolerability of the\n      Ad-sig-hMUC-1/ecdCD40L vector vaccine will be tested in this phase I non-randomized open\n      label dose escalation trial for men or women with metastatic or recurrent epithelial cancers\n      of the lung, breast, ovary, prostate and colon."
