A healthy endothelial lining acts as\n      a defense mechanism against vascular injury, mediating vascular tone, vascular structure,\n      and blood-vessel wall relations. Endothelial dysfunction marks the occurrence of\n      cardiovascular injuries and is a critical step in the development of cardiovascular disease.\n      Individuals with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) have an increased risk of cardiovascular\n      disease and this may be related to poor blood vessel function. Interventions to improve\n      blood vessel function in CKD are needed.  Exercise training has been shown to improve blood\n      vessel function in older subjects and those with heart disease but this has not been\n      investigated in CKD.  The National Kidney Foundation recommends exercise for dialysis\n      patients to reduce cardiovascular risk however there is very little data regarding the\n      benefits of exercise in earlier stages of CKD.  The purpose of this study is to determine\n      the effect of 12 weeks of exercise training on blood vessel function in moderate to severe\n      CKD."
