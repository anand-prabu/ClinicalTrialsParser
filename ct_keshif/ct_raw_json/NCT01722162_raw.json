Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that\n      blocks the ability of tumors to grow and spread by inhibiting the growth of blood vessels\n      that feed them. Patients with colorectal cancer can develop a resistance to the effects of\n      bevacizumab. Levocetirizine may decrease tumor resistance to bevacizumab. Giving\n      bevacizumab, capecitabine, and levocetirizine dihydrochloride together may be an effective\n      treatment for refractory colorectal cancer."

Patients with previously\n             treated brain metastases are eligible.  Patients with known brain active metastases\n             must be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because\n             they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the\n             evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.\n\n          -  Patient must not have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of\n             similar chemical or biologic composition to levocetirizine, capecitabine,\n             bevacizumab, or other agents used in the study.\n\n          -  Patient must not have known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency or\n             severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min by Cockcroft and Gault\n             formula) as this would prelude use of capecitabine.\n\n          -  Patient must not have known proteinuria \u2265 500mg/24 hours.\n\n          -  Patient must not have an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited\n             to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable\n             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that\n             would limit compliance with study requirements.\n\n          -  Patient must not be pregnant and/or breastfeeding.  Patient must have a negative\n             urine pregnancy test within seven days of study entry.\n\n          -  Patient must not be known to be HIV-positive on combination antiretroviral because of\n             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with levocetirizine, capecitabine, and\n             bevacizumab.  In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections\n             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.
