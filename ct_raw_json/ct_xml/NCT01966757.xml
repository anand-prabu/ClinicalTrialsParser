  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (NCL) also known at Batten's disease is the most common
      neurodegenerative disorder in children.  Families often report the patient has a sleep
      disturbance.  This is a questionnaire to be completed by the family to better understand the
      sleep pattern and sleep difficulties experienced by individuals who have been diagnosed with
      NCL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (NCL) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder in
      children characterized by seizures, blindness, ataxia, myoclonia and loss of cognition.
      There are 12 clinical types identified with a concurrent genetic abnormality.  The diagnosis
      is determined by gene testing and skin biopsy findings although genetic testing has
      supplanted skin biopsy in most cases.  Numberous studies have confirmed the presence of
      sleep disorder in patients with NCL but these cases were documented over a decade ago.  The
      investigators would like to study the prevalence of sleep disorders in this group of
      patients. The investigators will distribute a Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ)
      to the family of the patient to complete and provide a information regarding the patient's
      sleep. In addition to the validated sleep questionnaire a separate demographic questionnaire
      will be given to the family to identify the type of NCL, presence or absence of blindness,
      presence or absence of seizures, interventions tried to treat sleep disturbance.  The last
      questions of the study are asking for the presence or absence of Restless Leg Syndrome
      symptoms.
