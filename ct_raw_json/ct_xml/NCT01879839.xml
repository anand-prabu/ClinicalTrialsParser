  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effect of a diet prior to administration of contrast
      agent in terms of a preventive procedure which leads to an attenuation of the
      contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN).

      Patients with a known kidney disease are especially at risk. A potential beneficial effect
      of a diet prior to intervention has been shown in investigations in mammals, therefore this
      study will investigate if a pre-interventional diet in patients with known kidney disease
      and scheduled contrast agent examination can attenuate or prevent a post-interventional loss
      of kidney function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with contrast agent examinations are at risk for contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN)
      and in succession acute renal failure which is associated with significant morbidity and
      mortality. None of the currently used preventive procedures show a benefit in terms of a
      CIN-prevention.

      Experimental data suggests, that a pre-interventional caloric restriction might provide
      kidney protection in this context. This clinical trial investigates if this phenomenon is
      also applicable in humans. Patients with increased risk for a post-interventional renal
      failure due to known chronic kidney disease are randomized in 2 groups. Patients of the diet
      group receive a calorie restriction to 60% of the calculated daily energy rate from day -4
      until day -1 (included) pre-intervention (day 0 corresponds to day of intervention).
      Patients of the control group receive alimentation ad libitum.

      Primary objective is the increase of serum creatinine in mg/dl 48 h after begin of
      intervention in comparison to baseline value obtained in the morning of the day of
      intervention (day 0) in order to analyse if a pre-interventional calorie restriction as a
      preventive strategy leads to an attenuation of post-interventioal kidney injury.

      Hypothesis: A four day calorie restriction reduces the increase of serum creatinine after
      administration of contrast agent in patients with known chronic kidney disease.
