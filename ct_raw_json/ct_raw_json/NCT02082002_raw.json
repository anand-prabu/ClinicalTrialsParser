The MFIS is a structured, reliable, self-report questionnaire that the patient can generally complete easily, with little or no intervention from an interviewer.

Four sessions are recorded every two hours, each lasting until the patient falls asleep or for 40 minutes of continuous awake state. The sleep latency is assessed in each of the four recordings and it is defined by the elapse time in minutes on each trial before sleep onset: the patient is considered asleep after three 30 seconds EEG epochs of stage N1 of non-REM sleep, or one 30-second epoch of any other sleep stage.",
