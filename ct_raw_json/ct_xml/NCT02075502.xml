  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to determine the effect of a community-based walking
      exercise program with detailed training, monitoring, and coaching (TMC) exercise components
      enhanced by community-based participatory research (CBPR) practices and motivational
      interviewing (TMC+) on the primary outcome of peak walking time (PWT) in patients with
      peripheral artery disease (PAD). The investigators will test the hypothesis that PAD
      patients randomized to the exercise program in the community setting incorporating TMC+ will
      improve walking ability compared with patients who receive the standard of care (exercise
      advice). Secondary hypotheses include an improvement in claudication onset time (COT),
      patient-reported outcomes, peak oxygen consumption, functional ability, and an increase in
      total volume of activity and adherence to exercise (measured with activity monitors) for
      patients in the TMC+ group. An additional secondary hypothesis is a significant improvement
      in outcomes for patients receiving a combination of endovascular therapy (ET) and
      community-based walking exercise.

    <description>The exercise therapy program with training, monitoring and coaching enhanced by community-based participatory research (CBPR) and motivational interviewing (TMC+) is a comprehensive approach to community-based walking exercise for improving PAD patient outcomes. The components of TMC+ are optimal training guidelines for patients (i.e., T), monitoring from both investigators and patient self-monitoring (i.e., M), coaching from investigators on how to improve patients' walking ability (i.e., C), and finally enhancements from CBPR practices and motivational interviewing (+).</description>
