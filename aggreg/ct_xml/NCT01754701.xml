    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether iron therapy given to iron-deficient
      Ugandan children with moderate-to-severe anemia and clinical malaria is better absorbed and
      incorporated into red blood cells if it is given concurrently with antimalarial treatment on
      Day 0 (immediate group) or 4 weeks after antimalarial treatment on Day 28 (delayed group).
      Use of iron stable isotopes 57Fe and 58Fe will permit measurement of red blood cell iron
      incorporation on Day 0 and Day 28 in all children. The investigators hypothesize that red
      cell iron incorporation at the time of initial supplement administration will be greater in
      children receiving delayed vs. immediate iron (Aim 1), and children in the delayed group
      will also have greater hematological recovery on Day 56 than children in the immediate group
      (Aim 2).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 1 million children &lt; 5 y living in sub-Saharan Africa die from severe anemia
      annually. This severe anemia frequently results from coexisting iron deficiency and malaria
      infection, but the standard of care, concurrent iron therapy and antimalarial treatment, has
      proven ineffective at curing the profound anemia and has promoted proliferation of the
      parasite in some studies. The pro-inflammatory immune response mounted against malaria
      down-regulates iron absorption in the gut, making provision of oral iron supplements during
      malarial infection of questionable utility. The present study proposes to use iron stable
      isotopes and a randomized design to test whether starting 4 weeks of iron therapy
      immediately after antimalarial treatment or 4 weeks later is associated with greater iron
      incorporation into red blood cells at the time of initial administration of iron therapy and
      improved long-term hematological recovery. One hundred severely anemic (hemoglobin 5-7.9
      g/dL) Ugandan children 6-36 mos with clinical signs of malaria who present to the Pediatric
      Acute Care Ward of Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, will be randomized to start iron
      immediately after antimalarial treatment on Day 0 (immediate group) or 4 weeks later on Day
      28 (delayed group). Children will be assessed at the hospital on Day 0, Day 28 and Day 56
      and will receive bi-weekly home visits for the 56-day study duration. The specific aims and
      corresponding hypotheses of the proposed study are:

      Aim 1: Identify the sequencing of antimalarial treatment and iron therapy that results in
      the greatest red cell iron incorporation at the time of initial iron supplement
      administration. The working hypothesis is that red cell iron incorporation will be greater
      at the time of initial supplement administration in children starting iron 4 weeks after
      antimalarial treatment (delayed group) compared to children starting iron concurrently with
      antimalarial treatment (immediate group), due to more complete parasite clearance and
      resolution of inflammation, permitting better iron uptake, distribution, and utilization.

      Aim 2: Determine whether long-term hematological recovery is impacted by immediate vs.
      delayed iron. The working hypothesis is that delayed iron treatment will be associated with
      greater hemoglobin and improved iron status at Day 56 compared to immediate treatment due to
      more complete parasite clearance and consequent improved iron absorption and use in the
      delayed group.

      The results of this study will establish a physiologically-based framework for the optimal
      timing of antimalarial treatment and iron therapy upon which future interventions aimed at
      improving iron status in malaria-endemic regions can be built, thus helping to reduce the
      morbidity and mortality and ensure the full neurobehavioral development of the millions of
      severely anemic children suffering from iron-deficiency and malaria.
