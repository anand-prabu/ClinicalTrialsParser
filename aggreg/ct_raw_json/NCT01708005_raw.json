The development of new therapies has\n      primarily focused on preventing the progression of AD. This therapeutic strategy involves\n      being interested in patients with an early stage of AD such as a mild cognitive impairment\n      (MCI). We hypothesized that the combination of Lecitone\u00aeSe with 200 IU/day of vitamin D can\n      slow or even improve cognitive decline, particularly executive functions.\n\n      The primary objective of this trial is to compare the effect after 12 weeks of the oral\n      intake of Lecitone\u00aeSe-Vitamin D3 with the effect of a placebo on changes in performance\n      obtained in the TMT B in the older adults with a MCI.\n\n      The secondary objectives of the study are as follows:\n\n        -  To compare the effect after 12 weeks of the oral intake of Lecitone\u00aeSe-Vitamin D3 with\n           the effect of a placebo on changes in executive performance in patients with a MCI.\n\n        -  To compare the effect after 12 weeks of the oral intake of Lecitone\u00aeSe-Vitamin D3 with\n           the effect of a placebo on changes in variability of stride time in patients with a\n           MCI.\n\n        -  To compare the effect after 24 weeks of the oral intake of Lecitone\u00aeSe-Vitamin D3 with\n           the effect of a placebo and a delay phase of supplementation on changes in executive\n           performance in patients with a MCI.\n\n        -  To compare the effect after 24 weeks of the oral intake of Lecitone\u00aeSe-Vitamin D3 with\n           the effect of a placebo and a delay phase of supplementation on changes in variability\n           of stride time in patients with a MCI.\n\n        -  To determine the compliance and tolerance of the oral intake of Lecitone\u00aeSe-Vitamin D3\n           in patients with a MCI."
