    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of clofarabine,
      idarubicin, cytarabine, vincristine, and dexamethasone, with or without rituximab, can help
      to control mixed phenotype acute leukemia.  The safety of this combination will also be
      studied.

      Study Drug Administration:

      The study drugs will be given in what are called cycles.  Each cycle is 28 days.

      Induction:

      The first cycle of study drugs is called Induction.  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you
      will have up to 2 Induction cycles.  During Induction cycles, you will receive:

        -  Clofarabine by vein over about 60 minutes on Days 1-4.  If the doctor thinks it is in
           your best interest, you will only receive it on Days 1-3.

        -  Idarubicin by vein over about 30-60 minutes on Days 1-3, about 1-2 hours after you
           receive clofarabine.   If the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you will only
           receive it on Days 1 and 2.

        -  Cytarabine by vein over about 2 hours on Days 1-4, about 3-6 hours after you receive
           clofarabine.

        -  Vincristine by vein over about 15-30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15.

        -  Dexamethasone by vein over about 10-30 minutes on Days 1-4 and 15-18. If you have a
           certain type of leukemia and the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you will
           also receive rituximab by vein over about 4-6 hours on Days 1 and 11.  The study staff
           will tell you if you will receive rituximab.

      If the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, your dose will be reduced after Induction.

      Consolidation:

      If the disease responds to the study drugs during Induction, you may receive up to 6 more
      cycles of study drugs.  This is called Consolidation.  During Consolidation cycles, you will
      receive:

        -  Clofarabine by vein over about 60 minutes on Days 1-3.  If the doctor thinks it is in
           your best interest, you will only receive it on Days 1-2.

        -  Idarubicin by vein over about 30-60 minutes on Days 1-2, about 1-2 hours after you
           receive clofarabine.

        -  Cytarabine by vein over about 2 hours on Days 1-3, about 3-6 hours after you receive
           clofarabine.  If the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you will only receive
           it on Days 1 and 2.

        -  Vincristine by vein over about 15-30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15.

        -  Dexamethasone by vein over about 10-30 minutes on Days 1-4 and 15-18.

        -  If you have a certain type of leukemia and the doctor thinks it is in your best
           interest, you will also receive rituximab in Consolidation Cycles 1-3, by vein over
           about 4-6 hours on Days 1 and 11.  The study staff will tell you if you will receive
           rituximab.

      Study Visits:

      Before each cycle, you will have a physical exam.

      Every 3-7 days, blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      At the end of every cycle (+/- 7 days), you will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy
      collected to check the status of the disease and for cytogenetic testing.

      If the disease appears to get better, you will have these study visits less often.  Blood
      will be drawn every 7-14 days, and you will only have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy when the
      study doctor thinks it is needed.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue receiving the study drugs for 1-2 induction cycles and then up to 6
      consolidation cycles.  You will no longer be able to receive the study drugs if the disease
      gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study
      directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after you have completed the end-of-study
      visit, unless you will have maintenance treatment as discussed by you and the study doctor.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      You will have an end-of-study visit about 30 days after you stop receiving the study drugs.
      At this visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate and/or
           biopsy.

        -  If you can become pregnant, you will have a urine pregnancy test.

      This is an investigational study.  Clofarabine is FDA approved and commercially available to
      treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children. Idarubicin and cytarabine are FDA
      approved and commercially available to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  Rituximab is FDA
      approved and commercially available to treat various types of lymphoma and leukemia.  The
      use of these drugs in combination with vincristine and dexamethasone to treat mixed
      phenotype acute leukemia is investigational.

      The study doctor can explain how the drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this study.  All will take part at MD Anderson.
