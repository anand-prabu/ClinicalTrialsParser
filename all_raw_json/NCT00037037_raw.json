Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim may increase the number of\n      immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood. Combining vaccine therapy with\n      sargramostim may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy with or\n      without sargramostim in treating patients who have metastatic melanoma."

Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment\n      arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive melanoma peptide vaccine comprising tyrosinase leader injected\n           at 2 separate sites, Melan-A ELA injected at another site, NY-ESO-1a and NY-ESO-1b\n           combined and injected at one site, and MAGE-10.A2 injected at another site,\n           intradermally once weekly on weeks 1-6.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive vaccine as in arm I. Patients also receive sargramostim\n           (GM-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning 2 days before each vaccination and continuing\n           for 5 days.\n\n      Treatment in both arms continues through week 6 in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 2 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients (10 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 18 months."
