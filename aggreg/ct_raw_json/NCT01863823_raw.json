Test subjects also\n      received various treatments.\n\n      We collected data of HPS, HPF , PCR and UBT before treatment on 202 symptomatic patients and\n      148 asymptomatic individual groups. After drug treatment, we run HPS, HPF, PCR and UBT\n      tests. If the tests of HPS, HPF and PCR show negative that indicate success of oral H.pylori\n      eradication. If the test of UBT show negative that indicate success of stomach H.pyloi\n      eradication. We also compare the suceess rate of eradication on stomach infection with and\n      without oral H. pylori infection."
