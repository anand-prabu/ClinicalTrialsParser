Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of the cancer\n      cells. Combining interferon alfa with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of fluorouracil plus interferon alfa in\n      treating patients who have advanced metastatic carcinoid tumors."

Treatment continues every 12 weeks in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at weeks 1, 7, and 11 of each course.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study."
