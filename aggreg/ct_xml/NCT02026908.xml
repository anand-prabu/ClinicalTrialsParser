    <textblock>
      This is an open-labeled, non-randomized feasibility study to evaluate the safety of prostate
      artery embolization (PAE) for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to
      benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

      This pilot study will be a single center, open labeled, non-randomized feasibility study to
      evaluate the initial safety of PAE for the treatment of symptomatic bladder outlet
      obstruction.  50 adult male subjects will be enrolled in this study.  If eligible patients
      will undergo the prostate artery embolization procedure in the Interventional Radiology
      department.  An angiogram of the prostate arteries will be done.  Small beads called
      Embospheres will be injected into the prostate artery to slow blood flow to the prostate in
      the hope of providing relief with minimal side effects and complications, for lower urinary
      tract symptoms caused by BPH.  After the procedure the patient will be followed at 4 weeks,
      12 weeks, 6 months, 12 months post procedure and then annually for up to 4 years.

    <description>The number and the severity of adverse events will be recorded to evaluate safety. Events will be reported by subjects and the severity of events will be graded using the following scale:
Mild (grade 1): the event causes discomfort without disruption of normal daily activities Moderate (grade 2): the event causes discomfort that affects normal daily activities Severe (grade 3): the event makes the patient unable to perform normal daily activities or significantly affects his/her clinical status Life-threatening (grade 4): the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event Fatal (grade 5): the event caused death</description>
