This study is an open label study of vitamin D supplementation\n      in patients with active or latent tuberculosis in which active disease patients take\n      100000units of vitamin D every 8 weeks during their tuberculosis treatment. Genotyping for\n      relevant vitamin D pathway polymorphisms will be carried out and related to clinical and ex\n      vivo markers of vitamin D response. Latent patients will only be studied for vitamin D\n      response ex vivo. Our hypothesis is that response to vitamin D in both monocytes and T cells\n      will be related to polymorphisms in the DBP gene, and that this may relate to clinical\n      response in terms of post supplementation vitamin D level."
