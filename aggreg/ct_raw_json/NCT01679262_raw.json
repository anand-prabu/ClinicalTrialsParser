However, direct confirmation of optimal size of oropharyneal\n      airways (OPAs) in individual using fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) is lacking as now. The\n      purposes of this study were to directly determinate the proper size of OPA in individual by\n      FOB via different sizes of OPA in adults under general anestheisia. Additionally, we examine\n      the relationships among the size of OPA, straight length from the incisors to the tip of the\n      epiglottis by laryngoscopy, patient height, and external facial measurements."

When the size of OPAs was longer than distance from the incisors to the tip of the epiglottis, OPAs were partly withdrawn and repositioned the distal end of OPAs is placed just above the tip of epiglottis.
