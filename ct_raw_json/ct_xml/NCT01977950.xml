      The purpose of this study is to estimate the prevalence of nutritional risk and examine
      nutritional care practices in the hospitalized elderly at one large university hospital in
      Norway.

      A cross-sectional study was designed and carried out at a university hospital in Norway. The
      study was developed by a collegium at a nursing bachelor education program in a
      multidisciplinary collaboration with representatives from the university hospital and other
      experts. Data on nutritional risk and nutritional care practices of elderly patients were
      collected by 173 second year nursing students at the university college in question who were
      undergoing their acute and clinical care practice studies on 20 wards at the university
      hospital. Nine nutritional screening days were conducted in the academic years 2011/2012 and
      2012/2013. On the screening days the students filled in the questionnaire for each patient,
      including questions about age, gender, length of hospital stay, normal weight in recent
      months, weight, height, BMI, nutritional risk and nutritional care practices. The students
      measured weight and height whenever possible, and screened the patients for nutritional
      risk. Data were collected by using a stratified sampling technique along with adequate power
      calculations to improve the representativeness of the sample. The researchers received
      anonymously completed questionnaires and screening forms from the students and never met the
      patients.

        Patients were recruited from a large University hospital in Norway. The university
        hospital covers about 10% of the Norwegian population, providing healthcare services for
        approximately half a million people living in urban and rural municipalities. The patient
        population is thus heterogenic with respect to ethnicity and socioeconomic factors. All
        somatic wards having nursing students in acute care clinical studies in autumn 2011 were
        included in the study. The study sample comprised 14 of 16 medical and surgical somatic
        wards. Additionally, one rehabilitation ward, one specialized short time unit, one
        emergency medicine ward, and one cardio-monitoring ward were included.

        Eligible patients were selected by the nursing students in cooperation with the ward
        nursing staff.
