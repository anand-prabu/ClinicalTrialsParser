  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current standard prophylactic immunosuppression in renal transplantation includes
      tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor, dosed twice daily. In Canada, oral tacrolimus has been
      available as a twice daily formulation marketed as Prograf® since 1997. It has recently
      become available in an extended release formulation called Advagraf®, which is dosed once
      daily. Advagraf® has been demonstrated to be therapeutically equivalent to Prograf® in the
      renal transplant maintenance population, and as a result it has been is approved as an
      alternative to the twice daily formulation in these patients. There is an evolving and
      expanding positive clinical experience with Advagraf® in kidney transplantation and it has
      shown to be preferred by many patients, due to the diminished dosing frequency. In clinical
      trials, Advagraf® has been shown to have other potential benefits over Prograf® such as less
      inter and intra-patient variability, improved cardiovascular profiles, and improved kidney
      function. Compared to Prograf®, Advagraf® also has a lower Cmin or 'trough' concentration as
      well as a lower Cmax or 'peak' concentration. The purpose of this study is to convert
      stabilized renal transplant patients currently receiving Prograf® to Advagraf®, to
      investigate these potential therapeutic benefits.

      The Framingham Risk Score and the Reynold's Risk Score are currently recommended by the
      Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) to predict 10-year cardiovascular risk in the general
      population. Surrogate markers are widely used in clinical trials to shorten follow-up
      durations. In this study, the investigators will use the Framingham Risk Score and Reynold's
      Risk Score to quantify changes in estimated cardiovascular risk. The investigators also
      intend to examine novel inflammatory markers to investigate cardiovascular risk.

      The investigators hypothesize that the more consistent drug exposure and lower Cmax noted
      with Advagraf® will decrease Framingham Risk Score, Reynolds Risk score as well as markers
      of inflammation in kidney transplant recipients.
