    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well brief behavioral therapy works in improving
      sleep disorders in patients with stage I-III breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Sleep
      disorder counseling may reduce fatigue and insomnia as well as improve the well-being and
      quality of life in patients with breast cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine recruitment rates to the proposed randomized controlled trial (RCT).

      II. Determine the rate of intervention adherence. III. Determine the feasibility of training
      Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) clinical research staff to successfully deliver
      the Brief Behavioral Therapy (BBT) intervention.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Obtain preliminary estimates for the effect of the intervention (compared with control)
      on insomnia as measured by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI).

      II. Obtain preliminary estimates for the effect of the intervention (compared with control)
      on sleep quality as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).

      III. Obtain preliminary estimates for the effect of the intervention (compared with control)
      on circadian rhythm as measured by the two-oscillator cosinor parameter estimates based on
      actigraphy data.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Obtain preliminary estimates for the effect of the intervention (compared with control)
      on quality of life as measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy
      (FACIT) total score and subscales.

      II. Obtain preliminary estimates for the effect of the intervention (compared with control)
      on general mood as measured by the Profile of Mood States (POMS) total score and subscales.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo BBT intervention, comprising insomnia education, stimulus control,
      discouragement of napping and encouragement of exercise, and sleep compression over two 60
      minute face-to-face sessions in weeks 1 and 2 or 3, and four 15 minute telephone sessions in
      weeks 2, 3, 5, and 6 or 2, 4, 5, and 6.

      ARM II: Patients undergo Healthy Eating Education (HEAL) comprising nutritional education
      and suggestions for symptom management over two 60 minute face-to-face sessions in weeks 1
      and 2 or 3, and four 15 minute telephone sessions in weeks 2, 3, 5, and 6 or 2, 4, 5, and 6.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 month.

    <description>Will be evaluated by calculating and testing the overall mean percent delivery using a random effects model (residual maximum likelihood [REML] estimation), where the intercept represents the mean delivery and three independent random effects are included.

    <description>The difference between arms will be assessed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The response will be the post-intervention outcome. Arm will be the factor, and baseline will be the covariate. Appropriate contrasts will be used to estimate the difference between arms in change from baseline. Initially, the arm*baseline interaction will be assessed with an F test. If this interaction is insignificant at the 0.05 level, it will be dropped from the final model. If the interaction is significant, then mean change from baseline at various levels of baseline will be reported.</description>

          -  Be receiving chemotherapy in either weekly, 2-week or 3-week cycles and have at least
             6 weeks of chemotherapy treatment remaining; patients are eligible any time before
             chemotherapy cycle 3 if on a 2- or 3-week cycle, or cycle 4 if on a 1-week cycle
             (Note: use of biologics [e.g., Herceptin (trastuzumab)] is permitted)

               -  For patients on a weekly regimen, there should be at least 3 dosages of
                  chemotherapy remaining

               -  For patients on either a 2 week or 3 week cycle, there should be at least 2
                  dosages of chemotherapy remaining

               -  Patients will not be dropped from the study if their chemotherapy is
                  discontinued after they are enrolled

          -  Report sleep disturbance of 8 (sum total of all 7 items) or greater on the Insomnia
