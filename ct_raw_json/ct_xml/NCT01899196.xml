      Participating country: France

      Objectives Principal objective the inflammatory profile of the epicardial adipose (EAT)
      tissue between HIV-infected and uninfected patients undergoing cardiac surgery for coronary
      artery bypass graft (CABG)

      Secondary objectives the volume of EAT between HIV-infected and uninfected patients
      undergoing cardiac surgery the relations between the adipocytokines and cytokines profile in
      the EAT and coronary artery lesions.

      the relations between the adipocytokines and cytokines profile in the EAT and in the
      systemic circulation.

      the histological and inflammatory profiles of the EAT and the subcutaneous adipose tissue of
      each patients.

      Methodology multicentric, national, comparative study

      Estimated enrolment   30 subjects (total and 15 per group) HIV-uninfected will be matched to
      HIV+ by age (± 5 years) and gender

        1. 15 HIV+ undergoing CABG

        2. 15 HIV- undergoing CABG

      Outcomes Primary outcome:

      • Inflammatory balance and profile (expression of adipocytokines, chemiokines and cytokines,
      and renin angiotensin system) in the EAT

      Secondary outcomes :

        -  Macroscopic profile of EAT (adipocytes, fibrosis, endothelial cells)

        -  Secretome of EAT

        -  Comparative inflammatory and macroscopic profile between EAT and subcutaneous adipose
           tissue

      Eligibility Inclusion criteria

        -  Men or women &gt; 18 years old, HIV1 + for more than 6 months

        -  Planned first cardiac surgery for CABG

      Non-inclusion criteria History of cardiac surgery

      Statistical methods Comparative analysis using parametric and non parametric tests

      Estimated planning or Study / Trial timetable Study start date: May 2013 Enrolment period:
      24 months Subject participation duration: 1 day Total study duration: 24 months Estimated
      study completion date: May 2015
