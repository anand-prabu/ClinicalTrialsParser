            "textblock": "Growth factor signals are important in carcinogenesis and progression of prostate cancer,\n      and fibroblast growth factors (FGF) have important roles in this regard. FGF ligands (FGF1,\n      -2, -6, -8, and -17) and FGF receptors (FGFR1 and FGFR4) have all shown to be significantly\n      overexpressed in prostate cancer1-5.  And, the recent studies have demonstrated that the\n      critical roles of the FGF family members are mediated by the signaling between epithelial\n      and stromal compartments, thus, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)6,7.\n      Moreover, a recent study has shown that FGF-2 is a mediator of second wave angiogenesis and\n      tumor progression in men during the formation of castration-resistant tumors. Therefore,\n      inhibition of signaling via FGF axis might be a viable strategy for the treatment of\n      castration-resistant prostate cancer.\n\n      TKI258, an oral multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor is known to potently\n      inhibit the class III, IV, and V RTKs, showing biochemical 50 percent inhibitory\n      concentration(IC50) values <20 nmol/L for VEGFRs (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3); the\n      platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\u03b2 (PDGFR-\u03b2); fibroblast growth factor receptors 1,\n      2, and 3 (FGFR-1,2,3); fetal liver tyrosine kinase receptor 3 (FLT-3); and KIT Ret, tyrosine\n      kinase A (TrkA), and csf-1 RTKs. Due to the unique inhibitory activity on FGF pathways,\n      TKI258 has shown significant activity in a variety of tumor xenograft models in athymic\n      mice, including acute myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, and colon- and prostate-derived\n      models9.\n\n      Castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPC) are one of the challenges in oncology practice.\n      Although there have been advances in chemotherapy10, new hormonal agents11, and\n      immunotherapeutics12, patients in this subgroup still have limited life expectancy.\n      Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify therapeutic targets and clinical development\n      of target agents for the treatment of CRPC. For this end, sorafenib has been tested in\n      multiple phase II studies earlier13-17; however, the clinical efficacy was very limited. The\n      low efficacy of sorafenib might be partly explained by the lower potency in inhibition of\n      RTKs. Considering nanomolar concentration range of IC50 for TKI258 compared with micromolar\n      concentration for other multi-TKIs, the efficacy of TKI258 should be evaluated in CRPC\n      patients."
