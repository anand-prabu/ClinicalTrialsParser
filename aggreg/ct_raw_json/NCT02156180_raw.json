            "textblock": "Head and neck cancer diagnosis is devastating as it frequently disrupts one's ability to\n      communicate, swallow and breathe. Each year, physicians diagnose approximately 650,000 cases\n      of head and neck cancer worldwide. Many people with head and neck cancer have their cancer\n      detected late, and this can result in a poor clinical outcome.  One strategy to improve the\n      clinical outcomes for people with a head and neck cancer is to develop a non-invasive\n      screening assay using breath biomarkers.  Such a diagnostic tool will identify at-risk\n      individuals early, and potentially offer improved and cost-effective treatment.\n\n      The idea of using human breath samples to detect cancer began with the observation that dogs\n      can be trained to \"sniff out\" certain types of cancers from urine and blood. Since then the\n      presence of various volatile organic compounds from many types of cancers, including: lung,\n      skin, breast, prostate, and bladder have been characterized.  These studies are ongoing, but\n      promise to revolutionize the way we screen cancer in the future.\n\n      In this pilot study, we aim to determine specific volatile organic compounds present in\n      breath samples of patients with oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancer before and after tumor\n      resection, or before and after definitive chemotherapy/radiotherapy.  As head and neck\n      cancer can result in significant functional deficit, early detection is the key to improving\n      clinical outcome.  Much anecdotal evidence exists for the presence of distinct odor\n      emissions from the tumor bed of head and neck cancer patients.  Therefore, the\n      identification of specific volatile organic compound to head and neck cancer will\n      undoubtedly lead to a novel, cost-effective screening strategy for early detection of head\n      and neck cancer."
