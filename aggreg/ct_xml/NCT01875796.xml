  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis dependence is the most common illicit substance dependence and people with cannabis
      dependence are highly vulnerable to anxiety disorders. The co-occurrence of anxiety
      disorders among those with cannabis dependence is a pressing public health matter given
      elevated anxiety is related to poorer cannabis treatment outcomes. Cannabis-related problems
      among those with anxiety disorders may be maintained by a reliance on cannabis to manage
      anxiety. Investigations of the treatment of these conditions when they co-occur have been
      virtually absent. Motivation enhancement therapy (MET) combined with cognitive-behavioral
      therapy (CBT) is an efficacious intervention for cannabis dependence, yet outcomes are
      highly limited for anxious patients. Transdiagnostic anxiety treatments can facilitate the
      treatment of patients with anxiety psychopathology regardless of the specific type of
      anxiety disorder. One such treatment, False Safety Behavior Elimination Treatment (FSET),
      may be particularly useful with cannabis dependent anxious patients as it focuses on the
      elimination of behaviors that may be effective in decreasing anxiety in the short-term, but
      can maintain and even exacerbate anxiety in the long-term (i.e., false safety behaviors).
      The use of cannabis to manage anxiety can, therefore, be targeted in such a treatment. This
      project tests the feasibility and utility of a novel, integrated approach to treatment of
      patients with cannabis dependence and anxiety disorders. Phase I of the project includes
      development and refinement of a specialized group protocol (i.e., Integrated Cannabis and
      Anxiety Reduction Treatment or ICART) for integrating MET-CBT for cannabis dependence with
      FSET. The initial protocol will be modified based on the experience gained during group
      treatment with the integrated treatment. Phase II will be a randomized controlled trial
      examining the relative efficacy of the refined ICART treatment versus MET-CBT alone. After
      post-treatment assessments, the ICART group will be followed for 3 months to examine
      maintenance of gains; the participants originally assigned to the control condition will be
      offered ICART. It is hypothesized that ICART will produce better outcomes than the control.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of cannabis dependence

          2. An additional diagnosis of an anxiety disorder

          3. Patient reports that at least some of his/her cannabis use is aimed at reducing
             anxiety and/or for social facilitation.

          4. Patient reports that cannabis is his/her substance of choice for anxiety management.

          5. The onset of the cannabis dependence must not be reported to precede that of the
             anxiety disorder.

          6. Concurrent use of psychotropic medications (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake
             inhibitors) is permitted as long as patients have been on a stable dose for at least
             three months prior to entering the study and they are willing to remain stable on
             their medication for the duration of treatment.

        (f) Age between 18 and 65 years. (g) English language fluency. (h) Willing and able to
        provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Alcohol or illicit substance (non-cannabis) dependence.

          2. Cannabis use behavior sufficiently uncontrolled that proper participation in study

          9. Report of current participation in or intent to participate in an additional (i.e.,
             treatments other than MET-CBT or MET alone) anxiety or substance abuse treatment
             method during the course of the study.

         10. Unwilling to maintain stable dose of regularly-dosed medications during the study
