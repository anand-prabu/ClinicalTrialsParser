Experimental recombinant adenovirus-transfected DCs, which engineered\n      to express MUC1 and Survivin are used for DCs-based immunotherapy. Based on the results of\n      our previously performed preclinical study with DCs vaccine combined with CIK cells, the\n      investigators plan to perform the clinical trial."
