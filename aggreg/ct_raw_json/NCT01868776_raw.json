Patients presenting with\n      toothaches will be given either a buffered numbing solution or a nonbuffered numbing\n      solution.  Neither the patient nor the operator will know which solution they will receive.\n      Root canal treatment will be performed on the tooth and the ability of the buffered versus\n      non-buffered numbing solutions will be compared."
