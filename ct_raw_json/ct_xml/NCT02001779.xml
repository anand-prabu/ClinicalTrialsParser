    <textblock>
      Stenting the biliary obstruction is considered to be the preferred palliation modality to
      relieve pruritus,cholangitis,pain and jaundice in patients without surgical indications of
      malignant biliary obstruction.An unicentral clinical trial has demonstrated the safety and
      technical feasibility of an irradiation biliary stent insertion in patients with biliary
      obstruction caused by adenocarcinomas, such a treatment seems have benefits in relieving
      jaundice and extending survival when compared to a conventional biliary stent.However,the
      small sample size,the population distribution of two groups will influence the final results
      in obtaining a powerful statistical conclusion.Therefore,a multicentric study was designed
      to prospectively compared the responses to the treatment with this irradiation biliary stent
      versus the conventional biliary self-expandable stent in patients with inoperable biliary
      obstruction caused by cholangiocarcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biliary obstruction is a common condition caused by various carcinomas.The clinical process
      is usually silent and insidious,only 10-20% patients can be surgically removed once
      obstructive jaundice occurred.The long-term survival rate after resection remain
      dismal.Relief of obstructive jaundice plays major role on prognosis in patients without
      surgical indications.For unresectable patients,stenting the biliary obstruction is
      considered to be the preferred palliation modality to relieve pruritus,cholangitis,pain and
      jaundice.Although a number of new techniques for treatment of malignant biliary obstruction
      have been developed,there have been no significant differences in survival or quality of
      life comparing surgery bypass versus plastic stent insertion,metal stent insertion versus
      plastic stents insertion,or covered stent versus uncovered stents insertion in such
      patients.Our previous unicentric clinical trial has demonstrated the safety and technical
      feasibility of a biliary intraluminal irradiation stent insertion in patients with biliary
      obstruction caused by adenocarcinomas, such a treatment seems have benefits in relieving
      jaundice and extending survival when compared to a conventional biliary stent.However,the
      small sample size,the population distribution of two groups will influence the final results
      in obtaining a powerful statistical conclusion in the overall survival and stent patency
      between two groups.Therefore,a multicentric study was designed to prospectively compared the
      responses to the treatment with this irradiation biliary stent versus the conventional
      biliary self-expandable stent in patients with inoperable biliary obstruction caused by
      cholangiocarcinoma.
