    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to implement a Collaborative Translational Research Center (TRC)
      Network Study which aims to assure optimal two-way communication between ophthalmologists
      and their patients' primary care physicians (PCP). The Collaborative TRC Network Study will
      have 2 objectives:

        -  To design and develop common research protocols to develop a 4-year retrospective
           database (2007-2010) that compiles electronic billing and medical chart information
           that can be used to study individual-level, clinical-level and system-level factors
           that impact access to and quality of vision care;

        -  To evaluate adherence to dilated fundus exams (DFEs) follow-up as the primary
           measureable quality indicator, and its relationship to the patients' demographics,
           ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), severity of diabetic retinopathy (DR), other
           ocular and medical co-morbidities, presence of HA1C, and primary care provider (PCP)
           communication.

      By enhancing communication and strengthening the clinical information exchanged between PCPs
      and eye care professionals, this Collaborative TRC Network study will help to overcome
      barriers to obtaining ongoing DFEs and reduce disparities in vision care utilization.

      Since its inception in October 2010 Collaborative Network Research Study at the Wills Eye
      Institute has aimed:

        1. to establish a retrospective analysis of existing ophthalmic data sets to assess and
           evaluate system-level and individual-level factors that impact access to and quality of
           vision care in patients with diabetes;

        2. to implement telephone-based and educational interventions to improve DFE follow-up
           adherence in African Americans with diabetes utilizing a prospective, cluster-based,
           randomized cohort design;

        3. to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of using a non-invasive, non-mydriatic
           fundus camera (Nidek) in a community-based pharmacy setting to screen and detect
           diabetic retinopathy and other ocular diseases among individuals with diabetes.
