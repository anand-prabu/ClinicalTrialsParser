  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-year Phase II trial of a HIV prevention strategy designed to significantly
      reduce population-level HIV incidence. The study design is a two-arm community randomized
      controlled trial of Comprehensive Triaged HIV Prevention (CTHP) which includes: (a) Access
      to an HIV center which will provide free HIV testing and counseling, (b) Educational
      activities related to HIV risk behavior, (c) Special counseling sessions for HIV-infected
      clients, (d) A onetime provision of a small amount of food or health products for sex
      partners of persons testing positive for HIV or reporting HIV risk behaviors when they come
      to receive HIV testing, (e) A post test support club for persons infected with HIV, (f) An
      income generation training program for people testing positive for HIV, (g) Transportation
      assistance in visiting the HIV Care and Treatment Clinic in the area for those who test
      positive for HIV, and, (h) Counseling and transportation support for those on medical
      treatment for HIV to assist them in attending scheduled appointments, and receiving and
      taking their medications as recommended by the clinic staff. The study will take place
      within two communities located in Kisarawe district, Tanzania. The intervention will occur
      over an 18-month period with outcomes assessed at baseline and post-intervention. The study
      hypothesis is that individuals in the intervention community will have a lower incidence of
      sexually transmitted infections (STIs) than those in the control community.
