Assess the impact of food on the bioavailability of Ro 31-7453 in patients\n      with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, crossover study. Patients are randomized to one of two\n      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral Ro 31-7453 under fasting conditions on day 1.\n      After a 1-week washout period, patients receive oral Ro 31-7453 under fed conditions. Arm\n      II: Patients receive fed treatment as in arm I on day 1. After a 1-week washout period,\n      patients receive fasted treatment as in arm I. Both arms: At the start of week 3, patients\n      may continue to receive oral Ro 31-7453 every 12 hours on days 1-4. Treatment repeats every\n      3 weeks for at least 24 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients are followed at 7 days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients (5 per arm) will be accrued for this study."
