  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a potentially serious complication of ovarian
      stimulation in IVF (In Vitro Fertilisation). The main objective of this study is to describe
      the incidence of moderate or severe forms of OHSS in women between 18 and 36 years of age
      treated with HP-hMG.
