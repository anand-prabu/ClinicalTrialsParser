            "textblock": "The ongoing global rise in the prevalence of overweight and obesity among all ages and among\n      all ethnic groups, figures into a real epidemic phenomenon.  This is accompanied by a higher\n      incidence in serious health risks, already present at an early age, \"switching-on\" the\n      engine towards obesity-related co-morbid diseases and morbid obesity. Weight loss is the\n      only way to avoid systemic and cardiovascular complications of obesity.\n\n      Weight loss devices  have been recently introduced in bariatric surgery, also in children.\n      They mostly require invasive procedures to be applied. Mini-invasive devices would be needed\n      to obtain weight loss in the pediatric population,  since the early age of involved\n      patients.\n\n      Obalon intragastric balloons, are swallowable devices. They are filled with liquid or air,\n      and have been used to induce weight loss in obese adults. The investigators aimed to perform\n      a pilot study in pediatrics, and monitor weight loss, metabolic and cardiovascular\n      parameters modifications, after up-to-3 Obalon\u00ae Gastric Balloons placement."
