Treatment continues\n      for at least 3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Tumors are measured every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
