    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to assess the safety of PLX-PAD to treat pulmonary
      arterial hypertension (PAH). PLX-PAD is a cell-based product made of allogeneic
      Mesenchymal-like Adherent Stromal Cells (ASCs), derived from human full-term placentas
      following an elective caesarean section.  This year-long study will evaluate the safety of
      three different dose levels of PLX-PAD, each given as a single intravenous infusion.  This
      study will also evaluate effects that PLX-PAD may have on PAH, such as changes in the
      ability to exercise and on other tests used to measure the disease severity.
