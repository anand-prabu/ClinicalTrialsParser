            "textblock": "The purpose of the study is to assess a new treatment for patients with liver tumor\n      metastases from colorectal cancer. The treatment has never been used in humans before. The\n      treatment foresees the use of two compounds: AvdinOX and  [177Lu]DOTA-biotin.\n\n      AvidinOX is a new compound, essentially a natural protein obtained from hen eggs, while\n      [177Lu]DOTA-biotin is a new chemical compound resulting from the combination of the\n      DOTA-biotin (also deriving from a natural vitamin which is biotin) with the 177Lutetium, an\n      atom which emits radiation.\n\n      AvidinOX will be injected directly into the metastases in the liver and  [177Lu]DOTA-biotin\n      will be injected into the arm vein.\n\n      One specific property of AvidinOX is that it chemically links to the tumor tissues when it\n      is injected while maintaining the capacity to take up  [177Lu]DOTA-biotin. Once locally\n      bound in tumor tissue, AvidinOX becomes an \"artificial receptor\" for intravenously injected\n      [177Lu]DOTA-biotin, which allows an internal radiation therapy of the tumor tissue.\n\n      The treatment of liver metastases with local injection of AvidinOX and the following\n      intra-venous injection of  [177Lu]DOTA-biotin could be simpler and more tolerable than the\n      current available treatments."
