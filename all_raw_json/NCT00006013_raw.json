Determine the toxicity of SU5416 in\n      this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive SU5416 IV over 1 hour twice weekly.\n      Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients\n      are followed for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-38 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
