Prevalence estimates will be further stratified: by\n      whether infection with the virus(es) is known, as reported by patients and/or their\n      physician prior to study testing, vs. unknown; by presenting cancer type, and by\n      self-reported risk factors for each virus.\n\n      Secondary Objectives\n\n        -  Evaluate known sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral factors that are\n           significantly associated with previously undiagnosed HIV, HBV, and/or HCV infection in\n           a population of people with newly diagnosed cancer.\n\n        -  Among patients who are identified as having HIV, HBV, and/or HCV, evaluate the timing\n           and type of treatments received, both for the viral infections and the cancers.\n\n        -  Evaluate type and rate of cancer treatment-related adverse events in patients with HIV,\n           HBV, and/or HCV infection.\n\n        -  Using simulation modeling that is directly informed by the data obtained from this\n           study, determine the cost-effectiveness (expressed as cost per infection detected and\n           cost per year of life gained) of (1) routine, universal screening and (2) risk\n           factor-directed screening of newly diagnosed cancer patients for HIV, HBV, and/or HCV\n           vs. current care.\n\n      Tertiary Objective\n\n      Create a biorepository of stored serum for future translational medicine studies that may\n      include identifying genomic and viral factors that increase the risk of serious adverse\n      effects among participants infected with HIV, HBV, and/or HCV being treated for invasive\n      cancers."
