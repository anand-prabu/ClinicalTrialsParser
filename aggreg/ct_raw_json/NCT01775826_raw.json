However, we do not measure sitting time very accurately and when we\n      ask people to tell us how much they do, their answers are unreliable. Our study will use\n      small sensors to objectively measure when people sit or do physical activity, and we will\n      use sophisticated computational techniques to summarize these movement patterns."
