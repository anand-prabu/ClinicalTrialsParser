    <description>Part-1 (dose escalation): Sym004 will be administered as an intravenous infusion at a dose range of 6 to 18 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) as defined in the protocol until unacceptable toxicity, progressive disease, or withdrawal of consent in combination with 1 of the 3 platinum-doublet chemotherapy regimens as intravenous infusion: cisplatin/gemcitabine (cisplatin on Day 1 plus gemcitabine on Days 1 and 8, every 3 weeks), cisplatin/pemetrexed (cisplatin plus pemetrexed on Day 1, every 3 weeks), or carboplatin/paclitaxel (carboplatin plus paclitaxel on Day 1, every 3 weeks). Platinum-doublet chemotherapy will continue for a maximum of 6 treatment cycles. Part-2 (dose expansion): After the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined in Part-1, up to 44 additional subjects will continue to receive the preferred Sym004/platinum doublet treatment in Part-2.</description>

             consent

          -  Histologically-confirmed NSCLC Stage IV disease (according to the seventh edition of
             the lung cancer staging system)

          -  Eligibility for platinum-based chemotherapy

          -  Tumor tissue available for EGFR expression analysis

          -  Measurable disease defined as 1 or more target lesions according to Response
             Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)

          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 1

          -  Other protocol defined inclusion criteria could apply

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous therapy for Stage IV NSCLC, or neo- or adjuvant chemotherapy or
             chemoradiotherapy within the previous 6 months

          -  Previous investigational drug or any anticancer therapy in the 30 days (or 5
             half-lives for non-cytotoxics, whichever is shorter) prior to the start of trial
             treatment

          -  In countries where anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors are available for the
             treatment of NSCLC, subjects need to have been screened for ALK fusion gene
             rearrangements and excluded if positive, unless previously treated and progressed on
             an appropriate tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy

          -  In countries where EGFR TKIs are available for the treatment of NSCLC, subjects need
             to have been screened for EGFR mutations and excluded if positive, unless previously
             treated and progressed on an appropriate TKI therapy

          -  Concurrent chronic immunosuppressive or hormone anticancer therapy (except other
             physiologic hormone replacement)

          -  Known brain metastases (unless asymptomatic and treated) or leptomeningeal
             metastases, including suspected leptomeningeal spread with positive cytology

          -  History of any other malignancy within 5 years (except basal cell carcinoma of the
             skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix)

          -  Other protocol defined exclusion criteria could apply
