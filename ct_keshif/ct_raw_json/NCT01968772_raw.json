            "textblock": "Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain syndrome with no known etiology. Fibromyalgia is generally\n      diagnosed in patients reporting widespread musculoskeletal pain, and tenderness. In addition\n      to widespread pain, fibromyalgia is also characterized by chronic fatigue, depression, sleep\n      disturbances, and poor concentration. It has been reported that approximately 3.5% of women\n      and 0.5% of men in the United States suffer from fibromyalgia. While the primary cause of\n      fibromyalgia remains unclear, a growing body of evidence indicates that the widespread pain\n      associated with fibromyalgia is due to abnormalities in the central nervous system. The pain\n      threshold, both mechanical and thermal, in fibromyalgia sufferers are lowered such that it\n      requires a lesser than normal stimulus to elicit pain.\n\n      Recent reports suggest that fibromyalgia is an oxidative stress disorder and deficiency in\n      trace elements and antioxidants play an important role in the development of fibromyalgia.\n      Magnesium is a trace element that is important for many metabolic functions. It affects cell\n      membrane permeability and electrical activity. The similarity in the clinical symptoms of\n      fibromyalgia and magnesium deficiency along with the histopathological findings of tender\n      points (such as hypoxia and adenosine triphosphate deficiency) raises the possibility that\n      magnesium may play a role in fibromyalgia etiopathogenesis.\n\n      In this pilot study we propose to explore the feasibility and ease of 2 times a day\n      application of a topical solution to the arms and legs. We will also gather preliminary data\n      on whether transdermal magnesium chloride can improve quality of life in women with\n      fibromyalgia."
