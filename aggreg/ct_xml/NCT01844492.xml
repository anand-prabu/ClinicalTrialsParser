  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One in five deaths in the U.S. occurs in or shortly after discharge from an intensive care
      unit (ICU), typically following decisions made by surrogate decision makers to forego life
      prolonging treatment. A large body of empirical research has identified deficiencies in care
      processes that contribute to three important problems: 1) family members often struggle in
      the role of surrogate, 2)leading to lasting psychological distress associated with the ICU
      experience  patients near the end of life frequently receive invasive, expensive treatment
      that is inconsistent with their values and preferences, and 3) end-of-life care is a major
      contributor to health care costs.[8, 9] Although advance care planning can prevent some
      unwanted treatment, many patients wish for a trial of intensive treatment when the prognosis
      is uncertain, and therefore it seems likely that the need for interventions to improve
      &quot;in-the-moment&quot; decisions by surrogates will persist.[10, 11]

      The long term goal of the investigators research program is to develop, test, and
      disseminate strategies to improve surrogate decision making for incapacitated patients and
      to mitigate adverse psychological outcomes among surrogates. In a pilot project, the
      investigators developed the PARTNER intervention (PAiring Re-engineered ICU Teams with
      Nurse-driven Emotional Support  and Relationship-building), an interdisciplinary
      intervention that 1) gives new responsibilities and advanced communication skills training
      to existing ICU staff  (local nurse leaders and social work members of the ICU team); 2)
      changes care &quot;defaults&quot; to ensure frequent clinician-family meetings; 3) adds protocolized,
      nurse-administered coaching and emotional support of surrogates before and during
      clinician-family meetings, and 4) increases use of palliative care services for patients
      with a poor prognosis. The investigators 2-year pilot study documented that the intervention
      is feasible, sustainable, and is associated with shorter ICU length of stay and cost
      savings. The objective of this proposal, which is the next step in pursuit of the long term
      goal, is to conduct a stepped wedge randomized controlled trial testing the PARTNER
      intervention in 5 ICUs among 1000 patients with advanced critical illness and their
      surrogates.

    <description>In general terms, the PARTNER intervention gives 1) new leadership responsibilities and advanced communication training to the local nurse leaders and social work members of the ICU team and 2) makes systems-level changes to reliably achieve desired care practices. One PARTNER interventionist is assigned as the &quot;main support&quot; for each family, and, through detailed hand-offs and introductions, the ICU's other interventionists fill in when needed. The interdisciplinary intervention  1) gives new responsibilities and advanced communication skills training to existing ICU staff  (local nurse leaders and social work members of the ICU team); 2) changes care &quot;defaults&quot; to ensure frequent clinician-family meetings; 3) adds protocolized, nurse-administered coaching and emotional support of surrogates before and during clinician-family meetings, and 4) increases use of palliative care services for patients with a poor prognosis.</description>
