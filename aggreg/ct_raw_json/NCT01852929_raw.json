Subjects with apnea will be given a test of perceptual skill\n      learning (the Visual Discrimination Task (VDT)) that has previously been shown to depend on\n      sleep.  Subjects will be tested on this task before and after sleep.  The difference in\n      performance after sleep compared to before sleep provides a measure of sleep dependent\n      learning.  Participants will be tested on one night when they have less apnea because they\n      are  using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) as prescribed by their physician,\n      which is well known to reduce apnea; and on another night when they are in their native\n      state and have a greater degree of apnea.  Memory performance will be compared between the\n      two nights to determine how apnea affects sleep dependent memory."

Subjects are standardly tested in the hour prior to their typical bedtime, and re-tested after spontaneously awakening after a night of sleep.  Sleep is known to consolidate learning on this task, such that  more robust learning occurs after an interval of sleep compared to when the patient is awake over the same interval (Stickgold et al, J Cog Neurosci,2000; Stickgold et al., Nat Neurosci, 2000).  Our aim is to determine if sleep dependent learning is disrupted by apnea, and preserved when apnea is eliminated.",
