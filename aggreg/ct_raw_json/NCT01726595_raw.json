            "textblock": "The investigators hypothesize that doctors and nurses can undergo a brief period of training\n      and then use ultrasound to accurately measure blood flow in a forearm artery after a brief\n      period when this flow is interrupted with a blood pressure cuff, a measurement the\n      investigators call reactive hyperemia.  Reactive hyperemia indicates whether  the small\n      blood vessels in the body are healthy -- lower reactive hyperemia indicates worse small\n      blood vessel function.  When measured by experienced ultrasound experts, low reactive\n      hyperemia strongly predicts death in critically ill patients with infection (severe sepsis).\n\n      The investigators are conducting this study to determine if doctors and nurses, without\n      specific pre-existing expertise in ultrasound, can be trained to make these measurements\n      accurately.  If so, the investigators will prove that these measurements can be applied\n      reliably in real-world practice.\n\n      The investigators also hypothesize that reactive hyperemia predict the outcomes of illness\n      not just in patients with severe infection, but in other critically ill patients as well.\n\n      Finally, the investigators hypothesize that reduced blood flow after blood pressure cuff\n      occlusion is linked with other abnormalities of blood, previously identified in critically\n      ill patients.  For example, red blood cells from patients with severe sepsis have been shown\n      to be stiffer than normal, so they are less able to flow along the small blood vessel\n      passages of the body.  Red blood cells become stiffer when there is a certain type of stress\n      in the body known as \"oxidative stress.\"\n\n      If the investigators show that low reactive hyperemia, stiff red blood cells, and oxidative\n      stress are linked, the investigators hope to develop new treatments that reduce oxidative\n      stress, reduce the stiffness of red blood cells, and in turn improve reactive hyperemia.\n      Improvements in reactive hyperemia indicate improvements in small blood vessel function.\n      Better small blood vessel function means better delivery of oxygen throughout the body.  The\n      investigators believe that this will improve outcomes for critically ill patients."
