A\n      target of 353 patients (inpatients or outpatients) with schizophrenia will be enrolled in\n      the study and will receive injections of study drug (paliperidone palmitate) on Days 1 and\n      8, and thereafter at a monthly flexible dose, based on patients' tolerability and/or\n      efficacy. The study will consist of a screening period of up to 1 week before treatment, a\n      25-week treatment period, and a follow-up period approximately 30 days after the last\n      injection of study drug. Upon meeting the entry criteria for the study, patients will\n      receive a total of 8 intramuscular (IM) injections of paliperidone palmitate during the\n      treatment period as follows: 150 mg equivalent (eq) on Day 1, 100 mg eq on Day 8, and\n      subsequent monthly IM injections with a flexible dose range of 75-150 mg eq. If the patient\n      reports any signs or symptoms of worsening of schizophrenia, the investigator may prescribe\n      a rescue medication (quick-relief or fast-acting medications that usually work right away to\n      relieve symptoms) such as lorazepam (an antianxiety drug) to control agitation,\n      irritability, restlessness, and hostility. Safety will be monitored throughout the study."
