Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow doctors to give\n      higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which\n      treatment regimen is more effective for breast cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of standard\n      cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil with that of high-dose combination\n      chemotherapy plus peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating women who have stage II\n      or stage IIIA breast cancer."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of high dose cyclophosphamide and thiotepa with\n      peripheral blood stem cell support vs conventional cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and\n      fluorouracil (CMF), both following doxorubicin induction, in women with high risk breast\n      cancer.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by the number of\n      positive axillary nodes (4-9 vs at least 10) and by center. Patients are randomized to one\n      of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive induction therapy consisting of doxorubicin\n      IV every 3 weeks for 4 courses followed by consolidation therapy consisting of\n      cyclophosphamide IV, methotrexate IV, and fluorouracil IV every 3 weeks for 8 courses. At\n      week 4 of consolidation therapy, patients receive radiotherapy to the breast, chest wall,\n      and axilla over 3-5 weeks or as appropriate. Following recovery from consolidation therapy,\n      patients receive maintenance therapy consisting of oral tamoxifen daily for 5 years. Arm II:\n      Patients receive induction therapy as in arm I followed by consolidation therapy consisting\n      of stem cell mobilization with high dose cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours and filgrastim\n      (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning 24 hours after cyclophosphamide and continuing until blood\n      counts recover. At 13-28 days following peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection and/or\n      autologous bone marrow collection, patients undergo chemoablation consisting of thiotepa IV\n      and cyclophosphamide IV continuously over 4 days followed 72 hours later by PBSC infusion\n      with or without autologous bone marrow. Following hematologic recovery, patients receive\n      radiotherapy and maintenance therapy as in arm I. Patients are followed every 6 months for 2\n      years, then annually.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: More than 600 patients will be accrued for this study over 5 years."
