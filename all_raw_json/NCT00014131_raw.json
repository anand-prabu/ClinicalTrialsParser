Patients with multiple persistent sites of metastatic\n      disease following harvest receive systemic therapy (biologic therapy and/or chemotherapy)\n      during tumor cell line expansion. Over 2-4 months, the tumor cell line is expanded, treated\n      with interferon gamma, and irradiated.\n\n      Patients undergo leukapheresis to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The PBMC\n      are incubated over 7 days with sargramostim (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 to produce dendritic\n      cells (DC). The DC are incubated over 2-3 days with the irradiated tumor cells from the\n      autologous tumor cell line for antigen loading of the DC.\n\n      Patients undergo delayed tumor hypersensitivity testing 1 week prior to vaccination and\n      again at week 4. Patients receive vaccine therapy comprising autologous treated tumor cells\n      and DC suspended in GM-CSF subcutaneously weekly for 3 weeks. Vaccine therapy continues\n      monthly for 5 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for 4 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (40 per stratum) will be accrued for this study."
