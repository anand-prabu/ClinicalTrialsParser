            "textblock": "Introduction: Bruxism is an oral parafunctional habit of clenching and / or grinding of\n      teeth, which can occur during daytime (diurnal bruxism) and / or during sleep (nocturnal\n      bruxism), whose prevalence in adults is 20% and 8% respectively. The peripheral,\n      psychosocial and centers factors are associated with the origin of bruxism, which can\n      trigger masticatory muscle pain, neck pain, headache, low threshold of pain sensitivity,\n      limited jaw opening, negatively influence sleep quality and oral health and be related to\n      affective disorders (anxiety, stress and depression). The objective of this study is to\n      compare two physiotherapy interventions with dental treatment in pain, limited jaw opening,\n      sleep quality, anxiety, stress and depression and oral health quality in individuals with\n      bruxism. Methods: Participants will be randomly assigned to three groups: Group 1 (n = 20)\n      will perform massage techniques and muscle stretching exercises, Group 2 (n = 20) relaxation\n      therapy and imagination and Group 3 (n = 20)dental treatment. All participants will perform\n      the same assessment procedures (pre, post and two months after intervention). The intensity\n      of the pain will be assessed by visual analog scale (VAS), pain  threshold by algometer,\n      mandibular depression by paquimeter, sleep quality by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index,\n      anxiety by State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, stress by Perceived Stress Scale, depression by\n      Beck Depression Inventory and  oral health quality by Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14).\n      Significance is considered 5%."

The primary clinical outcomes will be pain, assessed\n      with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Algometer (pain threshold) and mandibular\n      depression asseded with paquimeter. Secondary outcomes will be sleep quality (Pittsburgh\n      Sleep Quality Index -PSQI), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - STAI), stress(Perceived\n      Stress Scale -PSS), depression (Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and oral health quality\n      (Oral Health Impact Profile -OHIP-14). Evaluations will be performed before(baseline), after\n      (6 weeks) and with a follow-up 2 months after treatment. Data will be collected by a blinded\n      examiner. Individuals of physiotherapy intervention groups will hold 12 individual sessions,\n      lasting 40 minutes each, twice a week, by the same therapist, duly qualified. Will be\n      requested to carry out specific exercises at home. Individuals of dental treatment group\n      will be two sessions of individual restoration, with an interval of one week and will last\n      two hours. Participants will be reassessed 30, 60 and 90 days after treatment ended.\n      Significance level is established at 5%."
