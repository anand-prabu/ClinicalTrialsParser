It also aims\n      to examine whether MWM can enhance the sleep quality of PWD and their family caregivers and\n      promote their well-being.\n\n      This is a mixed methods study with the quantitative paradigm being the main research\n      approached used. The quantitative arm will be a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The\n      qualitative arm will adopt a naturalistic approach through interviewing for data collection.\n      Recruited subjects from the community centres of non-government organizations (NGOs) will be\n      randomly allocated to the intervention and control group.\n\n      The outcome measures of the PWD will include Rating Anxiety in Dementia (RAID), Geriatric\n      Depression Scale (GDS), Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Community version (NPI), Pittsburgh\n      Sleep Quality Index (PQSI), Quality of Life - Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD), and\n      Non-pharmacological Therapy Experience Scale (NPTES), whereas the outcome measures of the\n      family caregivers will be Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Zarit Burden Scale\n      (ZBD), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and World Health Organization Quality of\n      Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF).\n\n      To address the research questions, data will be collected at baseline (T0), at immediately\n      after week 6 of the intervention protocol (i.e. the mid-way in the intervention protocol)\n      (T1), immediately post-intervention at 12-weeks (T2), and 3 months post-intervention (T3).\n      The qualitative arm of this study will contribute to the understanding of issues and effects\n      of MWM as an intervention. Its finding will complement the results obtained from the RCT."
