A recently\n      developed clinical practice guideline led by Taddio et al. provides evidence-based\n      recommendations for the management of immunization pain in children. User-friendly\n      educational tools based on the guideline have also been developed, including a factsheet and\n      educational video. The primary objective of this study is to assess whether these materials\n      can increase utilization of pain -relieving strategies by parents during immunizations.\n      Parents will be recruited during their infant's 2-month or 4-month scheduled visit to\n      receive either the educational material related to immunization pain management\n      (intervention group) or general information about immunization (control group). The study\n      team will then follow these infants at their current and upcoming immunizations visit and\n      document the pain management strategies utilized,  infant pain responses, and parental\n      satisfaction with pain management."
