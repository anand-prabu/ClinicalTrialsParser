    <textblock>
      this study aims to verify the adequacy of doses of antibiotics prescribed in clinical
      practice for the treatment of ventilated acquired pneumonia (VAP) in the intensive care unit
      (ICU) with the pharmacodynamic efficacy criteria considered relevant literature. The impact
      of these pharmacodynamic parameters on the clinical and microbiological VAP will be
      evaluated.

          3. High risk of multidrug-resistant bacteria, defined as either at least 6 days of
             mechanical ventilation OR antibiotic treatment in the previous 15 days

          4. Implementation of a prior distal respiratory sample for microbiological diagnosis by
             bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) OR distal sampling by protected catheter (PDP)

          6. Implementing a medical examination

          7. Obtain the written consent of the patient, one of its relatives or trusted person
             previously designated or emergency clause.
