Determine whether treating head injured patients with valproate sodium will\n      reduce the risk of developing seizures as a result of the head injury.\n\n      II.  Determine the safety of valproate, the appropriate dose, and the effect valproate may\n      have on the recovery of the brain's ability to compute numbers, solve problems, remember\n      information, and control the movement of limbs after head injury."

On days 2 through 7, controls receive\n      2 doses each of phenytoin and placebo daily, intravenously. From day 8 through 6 months,\n      controls receive placebo IV 4 times daily, then placebo tablets are administered.\n\n      On day 1, the experimental group receives a loading dose of valproate sodium intravenously\n      over 1 hour within 24 hours of injury.  Then, patients are divided into 2 subgroups.\n\n      From day 2 through 1 month, one group of patients receives valproate IV 4 times daily over 1\n      hour until tablets are tolerated.  Patients receive placebo tablets by mouth 4 times daily\n      from month 2 through month 6.\n\n      On day 2, the other group of patients receives valproate IV 4 times daily and continues for\n      6 months until tablets (same dose) are tolerated.\n\n      If patients remain seizure free between day 8 and 6 months, the number of valproate or\n      placebo tablets are tapered over 1 week.\n\n      Each patient receives a full neuropsychological and psychosocial examination at 1, 6, and 12\n      months after injury.\n\n      Untreated observation of patients continues until 2 years after injury."
