Both hypertension and CKD are major independent risk factors for\n      cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death in the US.  Fortunately,\n      lowering blood pressure to recommended treatment targets not only slows the progression of\n      CKD, but also improves cardiovascular outcomes. Controlling hypertension in this patient\n      population, however, can be quite challenging.  A lifestyle modification that effectively\n      reduces blood pressure in both pre-hypertensive and hypertensive adults is the Dietary\n      Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet.\n\n      The purpose of this pilot study is to (1) determine the extent to which the DASH diet lowers\n      blood pressure in hypertensive adults with moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) (estimated\n      glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 30-59 ml/min/1.73m2) and (2) establish that the DASH diet\n      can be safely consumed by this patient population."
