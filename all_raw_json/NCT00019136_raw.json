Interleukin-2 combined with white blood cells that are gene-modified to recognize and\n      kill ovarian cancer cells may be an effective treatment for recurrent or residual ovarian\n      cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-2 plus gene-modified white\n      blood cells in treating patients who have advanced ovarian epithelial cancer."

Patients are stratified by eligibility to receive\n      interleukin-2 (IL-2) (yes vs no).\n\n      Patients undergo leukapheresis. The collected peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) are\n      stimulated with allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) followed by retroviral\n      transduction with antiovarian cancer MOv-gamma chimeric receptor gene (MOv-PBL). MOv-PBL are\n      then reinfused IV over 30-60 minutes followed by IL-2 IV over 15-30 minutes every 12 hours\n      for up to 8 doses (if eligible). This course may be repeated at least once, beginning 2-3\n      weeks later. Patients receiving allogeneic PBMC-stimulated PBLs receive donor PBMCs\n      subcutaneously at 1 and 8 days after each MOv-PBL infusion instead of IL-2.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients in each stratum receive escalating doses of MOv-PBL until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at\n      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 10 patients receive\n      MOv-PBL, without IL-2, followed by immunization with donor PBMCs as above.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 and 8 weeks and then periodically for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 13-50 patients will be accrued for this study."
