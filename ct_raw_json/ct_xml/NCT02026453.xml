  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will test two interventions to improve the accuracy of medication histories obtained at
      hospital admission. The interventions will target elderly and chronically ill patients prone
      to erroneous medication histories and resultant medication errors. For targeted patients, we
      will test the effect of using pharmacists and pharmacy technicians to obtain an initial
      medication history. This will be studied using a randomized controlled trial of usual care
      (which involves nurses and physicians) vs usual care + pharmacists vs usual care + pharmacy
      technicians to obtain an admission medication history.

      Our overarching hypothesis is that by leveraging pharmacists and pharmacy technicians we can
      minimize admission medication history errors and related downstream events.

    <description>The project was originally funded to measure the effect of these interventions on medication history errors.  We are currently applying for more funding which would allow us to use the more meaningful, more downstream outcome of medication order errors, and this will become the primary outcome if funding for such is received.</description>
