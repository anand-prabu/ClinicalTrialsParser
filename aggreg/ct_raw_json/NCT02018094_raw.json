From a questionnaire-based audit we performed\n           including vascular departments across the entire country, practice varies in both\n           course duration (single dose \u2192 5 days antibiotic course) as well as choice of\n           antibiotics.\n\n        -  The guideline at our institution suggests the 5-day course of antibiotic prophylaxis.\n           The course duration varies depending on the clinical picture as well as microbiology\n           results and recommendations.\n\n        -  There are no randomised control trials that have investigated this aspect of patient\n           care. We have set up one such trial and through it, we are looking to establish a\n           standard practice which will hopefully be as beneficial as possible to the patient but\n           also cost-effective for NHS."
