  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical radicular pain is a common, disabling problem, occurs in 83:100,000 individuals per
      year. Symptoms are most often caused by intervertebral disc herniation (21.9%) or central or
      foraminal stenosis from spondylosis (68.4%). Patients complain of pain in the head, neck,
      scapula or arm. The diagnosis of radicular pain is made clinically by history and physical
      examination, supported by imaging studies and electrodiagnostic tests. No study has compared
      the differences in pain, medication utilization, functional outcomes, or patient
      satisfaction between interlaminar and targeted epidural injections in the cervical spine. In
      theory, the technique of targeted epidural steroid delivery with a catheter has a lower risk
      of accidental vascular trespass or disc penetration during the procedure, and far less risk
      of dural penetration or spinal cord injury at rostral levels of the cervical spinal cord as
      compared with the interlaminar technique. The investigators hypothesize that this technique
      results in superior pain control, decreased medication use, improved function and fewer
      repeat injections. This data could improve patient safety and affect the evolving treatment
      guidelines for cervical epidural injections.
