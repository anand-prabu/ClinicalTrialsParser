Six vaccinations of the WT1 peptide preparation (1.0 ml of emulsion) will be administered on weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, & 10. All vaccinations will be administered subcutaneously with vaccination sites rotated among extremities. Injection sites will be pre-stimulated with Sargramostim (GM-CSF 70 \u03bcg) injected subcutaneously on days -2 & 0 of each vaccination. Note: during each vaccination, the Sargramostim (GM-CSF)& the vaccine emulsion will be administered to the same anatomical site. Patients will be observed for at least 30 minutes after vaccination. Patients, who are clinically stable (no active infection with fevers & no cardiovascular or respiratory compromise) & have not had disease progression, may receive up to 6 more vaccinations administered appropriately every month. The use of post-stem cell transplant maintenance with lenalidomide is allowed starting 3 months or more after transplant."

Because cancer is produced by the patients own body, the immune system does\n      not easily recognize and fight cancer cells. The immune system needs to be \"trained\" to do\n      this.\n\n      This disease has been selected for this study because the Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1) protein is\n      often present in myeloma cells. WT1 is a gene that is involved in the normal development of\n      kidneys and other organs. When the WT1 gene becomes abnormal, it can make proteins involved\n      in the development of cancer. This study will determine whether the WT1 vaccine causes an\n      immune response which is safe and able to keep the myeloma from coming back."
