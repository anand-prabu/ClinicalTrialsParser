            "textblock": "Nowadays there is a rising need for non-pharmacological cervical ripening methods as the use\n      of prostaglandins is frequently limited by various contraindications. Dilapan-S is a\n      hygroscopic uterine neck dilator. Its mode of action consists in the hydrophilic properties\n      of the device absorbing fluids from surrounding tissue structures, thus expanding the volume\n      of Dilapan-S sticks which subsequently exert radial pressure on the surrounding structures\n      (uterine neck) to dilate progressively. Endocervical pressure on the uterine neck results\n      not only in its mechanical dilatation but pressure on endocervical structures also\n      stimulates the production of endogenous prostaglandins, which promote cervical ripening\n      through its collagenolytic action. Although Dilapan-S is widely used in labor pre-induction,\n      published study data comparing its clinical efficacy and safety in females with/without\n      caesarean section in medical history are lacking."
