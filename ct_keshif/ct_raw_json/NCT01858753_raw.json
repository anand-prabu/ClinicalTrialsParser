Diagnosis of cancer, including basal cell carcinoma, unless successfully treated or\n             in remission for a minimum of 6 months\n\n          8.

Pregnant or lactating women, or women trying to become pregnant during the study\n\n         13. Subject has any disorder that may prevent compliance, such as history of chronic\n             alcohol or drug abuse, significant mental or nervous disorder or other illness that\n             would, in the Investigator's opinion, interfere with the study\n\n         14.
