        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient from 18 to 85 years old

          -  A symptomatic unruptured saccular intracranial aneurysm with  a neck ≥4mm (or a dome
             to neck ratio &lt;2) and a parent vessel diameter between 2.5 to 5.0 mm (inclusive) in
             both the anterior and posterior circulation of the brain, that is amenable to
             stent-assisted coiling. &quot;Symptomatic&quot; is defined as any neurological symptoms
             attributed to the target aneurysm.

          -  Life expectancy &gt;6 months

          -  Signed Informed Consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Aneurysm with branches from the aneurysm base

          -  Rapidly growing aneurysm

          -  Daughter aneurysm

          -  Aneurysm with partial or complex calcifications

          -  Females who are nursing, pregnant or intend to become pregnant during the study.
             Females of child-bearing potential must have a urinary pregnancy test within 7 days
             of enrollment and use an approved highly efficient contraceptive method during the
             study

          -  Multiple untreated cerebral aneurysms at study entry

          -  Recent history of stroke, TIA, subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage, or
             major surgery within one month of enrollment

          -  Previous brain surgery or irradiation of the target treatment territory that would,
             in the opinion of the investigator, interfere with the treatment of the target
             aneurysm

          -  Admission platelet &lt;150,000 or any known hemorrhagic diathesis, coagulation
             deficiency, or on oral anticoagulant therapy

          -  Underlying unstable Coronary Artery Disease, cardiac insufficiency or Myocardial
             Infarction

          -  Contraindication to angiography such as elevated creatinine or known allergy to
             angiographic contrast

          -  Contraindication to CT and/or MRI scans

          -  Known allergy to the metal component of the Penumbra Liberty Stent System

          -  Evidence of active infection (WBC &gt;10x109/L)

          -  Any medical conditions that will not allow the necessary follow-up for this study
             (e.g., pre-existing neurological or psychiatric diseases)

          -  Current substance-abuse/illicit drug use

          -  Angiographic evidence of an arterial stenosis proximal to the target lesion that
             could prevent device deployment

          -  Contraindications to study medications (heparin, aspirin, clopidogrel, and
             radiographic contrasts)

          -  Patients unable to sign Informed Consent due to the emergency conditions of the
             intervention
