One intervention will target\n      150 minutes per week of home-based moderate exercise (e.g. brisk walking), consistent with\n      current recommendations.  The other intervention will target a decrease in time spent in\n      sedentary behaviors (e.g. sitting) of 60 minutes per day.  Both interventions will wear an\n      activity armband which will allow them to self-monitor their activity or sedentary behavior\n      in real time using a smartphone.  The armband will also provide objective data to an\n      interventionist that will facilitate the intervention.  The main outcome will be time spent\n      in moderate exercise."

            "textblock": "Specific Aims: This application proposes to randomize community-dwelling, older adults to\n      one of two, 12-week activity interventions that target either increased moderate-to-vigorous\n      physical activity (MVPA) or decreased sedentary behavior (SED).  The primary aim of this\n      research is to evaluate the effect of a behavioral intervention targeting decreased SED vs.\n      increased MVPA on objectively monitored activity (minutes of SED and MVPA).   The secondary\n      aim is to evaluate the effect of the SED intervention vs. the MVPA intervention on\n      functional and psychosocial outcomes.  To the investigators knowledge, this research will\n      provide unique experimental evidence that SED can be altered in an older adult population\n      and will yield key pilot data on the expected effect size for an intervention targeting SED\n      vs. MVPA.\n\n      Background:  The older adult population is the least active age group in the U.S. by two\n      distinct metrics: a lack of MVPA and a high rate of SED (sitting without any significant\n      exertion).  This represents a public health opportunity because engaging in 150 minutes of\n      MVPA is known to improve the risk of morbidity, mortality, and physical function. SED has\n      emerged as a risk factor for adverse outcomes, independent of MVPA, and observational\n      studies indicate that more SED is linked to an increased risk of clinical outcomes\n      (mortality, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease) and worse aging outcomes, e.g. physical\n      function. However, there exists no experimental data comparing interventions to reduce SED\n      vs. increase MVPA in older adults.\n\n      Summary of Methods: The investigators propose a 2-arm randomized trial that will target\n      increasing MVPA (Get Active) vs. decreasing SED (Sit Less) among community-dwelling, older\n      adults from the Pepper Center Mobility Registry.  The intervention will consist of a\n      combination of in-person (Weeks 1-4, 6, 8, 10) and phone-based (Weeks 5, 7, 9, 11)\n      individual counseling and will utilize the BodyMedia\u00ae Fit System (wearable armband with\n      technology interface) to provide real-time feedback on daily MVPA or SED, which can be used\n      by the subjects to self-monitor and by the interventionist to improve adherence.\n      Assessments at baseline and 12 weeks will include objectively monitored minutes of MVPA and\n      SED by a blinded armband, physical function (short physical performance battery, 400 meter\n      walk, grip strength, gait speed), and assessment of subjective MVPA, SED, physical function,\n      and psychosocial outcomes by questionnaires."
