  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib study will investigate dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of afatinib and ruxolitinib combination therapy, based on the preclinical data that
      inhibition of IL-6R/JAK1 signal transmission pathway will increase sensitivity to afatinib.
