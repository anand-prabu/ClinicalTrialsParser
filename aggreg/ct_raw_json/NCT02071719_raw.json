Five kinase inhibitors (sunitinib, everolimus, temsirolimus, sorafenib and\n      pazopanib) are now approved for clinical use. Response rates differ among these agents,\n      importantly depending on line of treatment. In first-line treatment sunitinib results in 47%\n      objective response rates, where in second-line after cytokines 34% responds. Thus far, it is\n      unclear which patient with advanced renal cell cancer will respond to targeted therapy. In\n      order to select patients for targeted therapies, several profiling approaches have been\n      explored but to date no adequate and reliable test is available. It is assumed that\n      responses to targeted agents depend on specific receptor and protein signalling activities\n      in tumor tissues. Therefore, we propose that protein phosphorylation profiling with\n      phosphoproteomics may be a potential clinical diagnostic tool to predict for tumor response\n      to targeted therapy."
