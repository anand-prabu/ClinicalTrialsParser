  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesis is that the combined use of elastography and color doppler
      ultrasonography can increase positive-predictive value of breast screening with ultrasound.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Asymptomatic women who undergo breast screening with ultrasound and has breast masses
           of Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category 3 or higher will be
           examined with conventional B-mode US as well as combined elasto-doppler US by breast
           radiologists.

        -  The likelihood of malignancy and BI-RADS category of the breast masses are assessed for
           each dataset of B-mode US alone and B-mode US with elasto-doppler US, respectively.

        -  Reference standard: histologic confirmation or stability for 2 yrs of follow-up
           examination.

        -  The positive-predictive value, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy
           (assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) are evaluated
           and compared between B-mode US alone and B-mode US with elasto-doppler US.
