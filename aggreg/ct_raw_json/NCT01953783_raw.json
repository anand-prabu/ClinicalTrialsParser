On Days 14 and 21, patients may be administered a single 4.0-mg capsule of MLN9708.  Patients will return to the clinic in the evening before Days 14, 21, 28, and 35 for a 24-hour overnight clinic visit.\nPart B: Eligible patients from Part A may continue into Part B once they have completed their Day 35 assessments in Part A.  Patients may receive MLN9708 capsules administered orally at a dose of 4.0-mg once weekley on Days 1, 8, and 15 of 28-day cycles.  Patients will continue in this study until disease progression of unacceptable toxicity."
