The study has two parts.  It involves\n      intravenous (IV) infusion of the investigational drug and a procedure to measure\n      concentrations in the fat tissue.  Both parts of the study will be conducted in participants\n      with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Part A and B of the study might take up to 7 weeks to\n      complete."
