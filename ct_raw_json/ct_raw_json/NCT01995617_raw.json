History of invasive pneumococcal disease (i.e., sepsis, meningitis or pneumonia with\n             bacteremia).\n\n         18. History of drug or alcohol abuse that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would\n             interfere with the subject's ability to comply with the study requirements.\n\n         19. Any other condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator would make the subject\n             unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with the study requirements."
