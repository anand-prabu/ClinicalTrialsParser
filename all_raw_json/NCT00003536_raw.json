Antineoplastons are naturally occurring substances that may\n      also be made in the laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells. It\n      is not yet known whether giving antineoplastons with chemotherapy is more effective than\n      chemotherapy alone in treating women with refractory breast cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying methotrexate alone to see how well it\n      works campared to methotrexate and antineoplaston therapy in treating postmenopausal women\n      with advanced refractory breast cancer."
