  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PG-analogues induce hyperemia as one of side effects in addition to IOP reduction.

      IOP reduction is caused by direct FP receptor stimulation, but the cause of hyperemia is not
      clarified.

      Because FP receptor stimulation induce intrinsic production of PGs, hyperemia or IOP
      reduction may be due to secondary induced PGs.

      Thus, pretreatment with NSAID may affect the PG-analogue induced hyperemia or IOP reduction.
