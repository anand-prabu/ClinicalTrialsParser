Determine the toxic effects of this drug in\n      these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide IV over 1 hour once a week for 4\n      weeks. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients are followed until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-38 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
