Past or existing non-exudative AMD in study eye decided by investigator that have\n             affected macular detection or central vision;\n\n          2. Subretinal hemorrhage in study eye and bleeding area \u22656 disc areas;\n\n          3. History of vitreous hemorrhage within last month;\n\n          4. The maximum diameter of scar and fibrosis area \u2265500\u03bcm at subfoveal in study eye;\n\n          5. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) or drug treatment of CNV within last 6 months in study\n             eye, or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy in fellow eye within\n             last month;\n\n          6.
