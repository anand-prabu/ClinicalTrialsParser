  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare accuracy of ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) to core needle biopsy
      (CNB) of ultrasound detected abnormal axillary lymph nodes in patients with newly diagnosed
      invasive breast cancer or suspected invasive breast cancer.

      Hypothesis: FNA and CNB have equivalent diagnostic accuracies

      In order to prove our hypothesis, we will perform FNA and CNB on the same lymph node in each
      consented patient. The two samples will be evaluated separately by different pathologists
      blinded to the material in the other sample.

      The results of the biopsies will be compared to the gold standard (lymph node excision).

    <description>Accuracy will be determined by comparing the results of the FNA and CNB performed on the same lymph node to the gold standard using a paired test of equivalence. The gold standard is the final pathologic diagnosis of excised lymph node containing biopsy marker (either sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary dissection). Surgical excision of pre-operatively sampled lymph node marks the end of study participation for each patient.</description>
