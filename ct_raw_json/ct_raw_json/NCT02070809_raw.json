The complex healing process make the wound easy to get a tendency of nonhealing\n      and result in a heavy burden of life quality. Nowadays surgical repairing is still the main\n      method, such as traditional split-thickness skin graft, flap transplantation or\n      tissue-engineered substitute transplantation. However, none of these methods could have\n      effective and satisfy outcomes. Because none of these treatments could repair skin on both\n      structure and function. Therefore, as a new treating technology the tissue-engineered skin\n      has been widely used recently and shows good response. As a consequence, the investigators\n      provide a quick and effective method to rebuilt complete structure and function of the skin\n      based on tissue-engineered skin technology. This method is composite of skin grafting over\n      human acellular dermal matrix scaffold the investigators used before with skin basal cell as\n      seed cells, moreover it was finished in the surgery without culturing the cells and could\n      greatly reduce the time. To further test the efficacy and safety of this new method, the\n      investigators propose a prospective randomized controlled multicenter trial to compare this\n      method with traditional skin graft. If this method could actually increase wound take rate,\n      improve the skin quality and restore skin function in some extent, it should resolve the\n      problem of wound repair to a large extent."
