Contrary to Indirect Pulp\n      Capping (IPC), in this technique only the central infected part of the caries is removed in\n      first visit and the rest of the caries will be lined by a suitable material to suppress the\n      remained cariogenic biomass and seal the cavity. This will help the pulp to defend and\n      survive. After a period, the cavity is re-opened and the rest of the caries which is darker,\n      harder and with less bacteria will be removed and the tooth is restored permanently.The aim\n      of this study was to compare the effect of different lining materials in clinical and\n      radiographical symptoms in stepwise excavation without re-enter after one year."

The common material which is applied as a liner over the\n      remained caries in SE is Calcium Hydroxide(CH). There are several reports of the solubility\n      of this liner over time which could interact with sealing of the cavity in long term. It\n      seems that a material with antibacterial activity, good sealing ability and suitable\n      mechanical properties could cause SE be done efficiently with good prognosis.\n\n      MTA is a biomaterial that has been introduced since 1993 with antibacterial property and\n      good sealing ability. A New Endodontic Cement, Calcium Enriched Mixture (CEM) cement with\n      good antibacterial effect like CH with sealing ability that is proposed to be similar to MTA\n      according to its double sealing property. CEM cement has been suggested as a suitable\n      material in pulp capping of permanent molars with irreversible pulpitis."
