      The purpose of this study is to measure and contrast implicit and explicit learning
      performance in patients with schizophrenia relative to young and elderly healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study involving schizophrenic patients (Group 1) and young and
      elderly healthy volunteers (Group 2 and 3 respectively). No investigational medicinal
      product will be administered. For all participants enrolled (Group 1 to 3) the study will
      consist of an eligibility screening examination (from Day -21 up to and including Day 1) and
      3 cognitive assessment days. Cognitive assessments will be made on 2 subsequent days (Days 1
      and 2) which are separated by overnight sleep. In addition, a session will be performed on
      Day 7. Completion of the cognitive test batteries can occur at any time during the day
      provided that the completion time is comparable on all test days. For each participant, the
      maximal study duration will not exceed 4 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Group 1 (patients with schizophrenia):

          -  Be a man or woman between 18 and 55 years of age, inclusive

          -  Has a known history of schizophrenia of at least 12 months by the referring
             psychiatrist

          -  Receives stable antipsychotic drug therapy (maximally 2) for at least 6 weeks prior
             to screening

          -  Medically stable on the basis of clinical judgment by the investigator

          -  Group 2 (young healthy volunteers): be a healthy man or woman between 18 and 55 years
             of age, inclusive

          -  Group 3 (elderly healthy volunteers): be a healthy man or woman between 65 and 85
             years of age, inclusive

          -  All participants (Group 1 to 3) must be capable of completing the cognitive test
             battery

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Receives treatment with benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressant or anticholinergics

          -  Has a positive urine screen for drugs of abuse or alcohol breath test

          -  Has a recent history (within previous 6 months) of alcohol or drug abuse

          -  Has psychological and/or emotional problems, which would render the informed consent
             invalid, or limit the ability of the participant to comply with the study
             requirements

          -  Has any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the
             wellbeing of the participant or the study or prevent the participant from meeting or
             performing study requirements

          -  Group 1 only: a diagnosis of substance dependence within 3 months prior to screening
             evaluation (patient with a positive drug screen at screening may be included provided
             use does not lead to a diagnosis of substance dependence and patient consents to
             abstain from illegal drugs at any time during the study)
