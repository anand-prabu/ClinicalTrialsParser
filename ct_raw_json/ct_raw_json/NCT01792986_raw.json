Ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, which must be\n             obtained prior to initiation of any study procedures.\n\n          3. Prior evidence of pre-diabetic state, with one of the following:\n\n               1. Pre-diabetic with a measured HbA1c \u22656.0% or fasting glucose >100 mg/dL without a\n                  clinical diabetes diagnosis\n\n               2. Clinically-diagnosed type II diabetic with HbA1c \u22656.0% or fasting glucose \u2265110\n                  mg/dL and whose disease is controlled by diet alone.\n\n          4. Evidence of metabolic syndrome by having at least 3 of the following 5 criteria:\n\n               1. Fasting glucose level >100 mg/dL.\n\n               2. Blood pressure \u2265135 mmHg systolic or \u226585 mmHg diastolic, or use of an\n                  antihypertensive medication.\n\n               3. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol <40 mg/dL in males or <50 mg/dL in females.\n\n               4. Triglycerides \u2265150 mg/dL or use of a cholesterol-lowering medication.\n\n               5. Waist circumference >40 inches (102 cm) for males or >35 inches (88 cm) for\n                  females (or body mass index >25 kg/m2).\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Pregnant and/or lactating women and women of child bearing potential who are not\n             using acceptable means of contraception. Women of childbearing potential must be\n             using adequate measures of contraception (as determined by the Principal\n             Investigator) to avoid pregnancy and should be highly unlikely to conceive during the\n             study period. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at\n             screen.\n\n          2. Diabetics taking any of the following anti-diabetic medications: insulin, metformin,\n             thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, meglitinides, or\n             incretins.\n\n          3. Prior experience with fasting more than once per month (for 20 hours or more), on\n             average during the last year.\n\n          4. Very low BMI (<18.5 kg/m2) or high BMI (>40 kg/m2).\n\n          5. Individuals who are nutritionally compromised, as assessed by the Principal\n             Investigator.\n\n          6. Any immunodeficiency or prior solid organ transplantation or renal disease.\n\n          7. Participation in any other clinical trials involving investigational or marketed\n             products within 30 days prior to entry in the study.\n\n          8. Other conditions that in the opinion of the Principal Investigator may increase risk\n             to the subject and/or compromise the quality of the clinical trial."
