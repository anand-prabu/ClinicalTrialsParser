The investigators propose the following objectives to\n      achieve this goal.\n\n      Key objective 1: develop a measure (item bank) for measuring mobility in persons with lower\n      limb loss\n\n      Key objective 2: study health profiles of lower limb prosthetic users\n\n      Key objective 3: validate the measure in a longitudinal study of people receiving\n      replacement prosthetic limbs\n\n      Key objective 4: study longitudinal health patterns of persons with lower limb amputation"
