Trametinib (2mg) will be administered orally on a daily basis.\n\n        2. Digoxin (0.25mg) will be administered orally on a daily basis.\n\n      on a 8-week cycle, duration of treatment can last from 8 to 104 weeks.\n\n      endpoints\n\n        1. Toxicities will be assessed via nCi's CTCae v4.1 toxicity criteria.  DLTs will be\n           defined based on the rate of drug-related (definitely or probably) grade 3-5 adverse\n           events experienced within the first 8 weeks of study treatment.  The MTD will be\n           exceeded if more than 20% of patients on the study experience DLTs.\n\n        2. Responses will be measured by ReCiST v1.1 every 8 weeks. Response duration will be\n           defined as time from first documented response until disease progression.  PFS is time\n           from treatment until disease progression.\n\n        3. Patient tumor sensitivity to the drug combination will be quantified by the amount of\n           subcutaneous established tumor growth inhibition in nSG mice by 5d/week oral gavage\n           with drugs.\n\n        4. Tumor nRaS status will be determined by tumor Dna extraction, PCR amplification of\n           exons and Sanger sequencing of nRaS.\n\n        5. History of prior MaPK inhibitor therapies will document MeK inhibitor exposures.\n\n        6. Sodium pump  subunit expression will be analyzed by pretreatment tumor\n           immunohistochemistry and a qualitative 0 to 3+ grading system."

Recently they have extended the experiments to examine melanoma sensitivity to\n      novel compounds. In screens of FDA approved drugs, they found several cardenolides including\n      digoxin that reproducibly exhibited greater toxicity to primary human melanomas as compared\n      to a range of normal human cells. They then examined the anti-tumor efficacy against primary\n      human melanomas growing in vivo as xenografts. While trametinib, vemurafenib, and digoxin\n      and digitoxin individually slowed the growth of human melanomas xenografts, they did not\n      cause tumor regression. However, the combination of digoxin or digitoxin and trametinib\n      caused substantial tumor regression using melanomas obtained from multiple patients, some\n      with BRAF mutations and some without. The effects were dramatically better than trametinib,\n      digoxin, digitoxin or vemurafenib alone. No difference in efficacy for the combination was\n      seen in BRAF mutant and BRAF wild-type samples."
