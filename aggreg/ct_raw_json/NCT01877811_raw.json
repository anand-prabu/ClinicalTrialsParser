Four groups of patients will be treated in Phase 2:\n\n        -  group A: patients with advanced unresectable melanoma with acquired resistance to BRAF\n           inhibitors (ie, patients who have achieved a CR or PR as a best response to treatment\n           with a prior BRAF inhibitor and subsequently became resistant) and patients who\n           discontinued treatment with a BRAF inhibitor due to intolerance\n\n        -  group B: patients with advanced unresectable melanoma with primary resistance to BRAF\n           inhibitors (ie, patients who maintained stable disease or had progressive disease as a\n           best response to treatment with a prior BRAF inhibitor)\n\n        -  group C: patients with advanced unresectable melanoma who are na\u00efve to treatment with\n           BRAF inhibitors\n\n        -  group D: patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who are na\u00efve to treatment with\n           BRAF inhibitors\n\n      Each phase of this study will consist of a 28-day screening period. Patients will be treated\n      in 28-day treatment cycles until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of\n      consent, or protocol specified parameters to stop treatment. Patients in Phase 1 will be\n      followed for a minimum of 6 months after the last dose of study treatment, and patients in\n      Phase 2 will be followed to collect further anticancer information for up to 12 months after\n      the end-of-treatment visit for the last discontinued patient on the study."

Patients may have received any number of prior systemic treatments for their cancer.\n             However, for patients in Phase 2, groups A and B, prior treatment with only 1 BRAF\n             inhibitor or MEK inhibitor monotherapy is permitted. Phase 2 patients with metastatic\n             colorectal cancer (group D) must have received 1 or more fluoropyrimidine,\n             oxaliplatin, or irinotecan based chemotherapy.\n\n          4. The patient has measurable disease and documented progression on or after last prior\n             treatment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version\n             1.1\n\n          5. The patient must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status\n             of 0 or 1 for Phase 1 or 0, 1, or 2 for Phase 2.\n\n          6.

For patients in Phase 2 groups C or D only, the patient received previous treatment\n             with a selective BRAF inhibitor or MEK inhibitor (prior treatment with sorafenib\n             allowed).\n\n          3. The patient was treated with systemic anticancer therapy or investigational agent\n             within 3 weeks prior to start of study drug treatment (6 weeks for bevacizumab and\n             immunotherapy).\n\n          4. The patient had major surgery within 21 days or less prior to starting of the study\n             drug or who have not recovered from adverse effects of such therapy.\n\n          5. The patient had radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to start of study drug treatment.\n\n             Patients must have recovered from all radiotherapy-related toxicities.\n\n          6. The patient has known central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Patients with any\n             clinical signs of CNS metastases must have a CT or MRI of the brain to rule out CNS\n             metastases in order to be eligible for participation in the study. Patients who have\n             had brain metastases treated with radiotherapy or surgically removed with no residual\n             disease confirmed by imaging should be clinically stable and off corticosteroid\n             treatment at least 3 weeks prior to start of study drug treatment.\n\n          7. The patient has a QTc interval greater than 470 msec.\n\n          8. The patient has a major active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics.\n\n          9. The patient has a severe or unstable medical condition such as congestive heart\n             failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class III or IV), ischemic heart disease,\n             uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, psychiatric condition, as\n             well as an ongoing cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication (\u2265grade 2, according to\n             NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] v4.03), myocardial\n             infarction within 6 months prior to starting study treatment, or any other\n             significant or unstable concurrent medical illness that in the opinion of the\n             investigator would preclude protocol therapy.\n\n         10.
