            "textblock": "Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterised by progressive and generalised loss of skeletal\n      muscle mass and strength with a risk of adverse outcomes such as physical disability, poor\n      quality of life and death (Goodpaster et al, 2006; Delmonico et al, 2007). The contributing\n      factors are those related to ageing process, non-optimal diet, bed rest or sedentary\n      lifestyle, chronic diseases and certain drug treatments. Most of these factors are present\n      in the older population with comorbidity, frequently institutionalized to receive a\n      professional long-term care.\n\n      Since the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (Cruz-Jentoft et al, 2010)\n      recommends using the presence of both low muscle mass and low muscle function (strength or\n      performance) for the diagnosis of sarcopenia, interventions should be focused in both\n      criteria. The aim of this study is to prevent loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength in\n      institutionalized elderly with sarcopenia.\n\n      To this purpose, the investigators study undertakes two physiotherapy interventions to\n      preventing/treating Sarcopenia, namely, improvement of strength in peripheral muscle, and\n      improvement of strength in respiratory muscle. Both interventions are common in the\n      following features: supervision, duration, frequency and intensity of the training program.\n\n      The primary outcomes are those related to muscle function: strength and performance.\n      Secondary outcomes will be related to costs and health status: number of falls and\n      fractures, exacerbations of chronic diseases, hospitalizations and deaths during the year\n      after concluding the physiotherapy interventions."
