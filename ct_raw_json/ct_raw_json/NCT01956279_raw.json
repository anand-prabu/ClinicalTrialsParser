Similarly, it is\n             theoretically possible that pregnenolone could be metabolized to other steroids such\n             a DHEA, potentially resulting in hair, skin, or other steroid-related changes.  Since\n             we have determined in our prior study that pregnenolone administration does not\n             result in downstream elevations in DHEA, DHEAS, estradiol, or testosterone, these\n             possibilities may be unlikely.\n\n          -  Women who are breast-feeding.\n\n          -  Use of narcotic interventions.\n\n          -  Known allergy to study medication.\n\n          -  History of moderate or severe TBI (with loss of consciousness greater than 30\n             minutes)\n\n          -  A clearly defined disease entity that accounts for the Veteran's symptoms.\n\n          -  Current DSM-IV/DSM-IVTR/DSM-V diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, schizophrenia or other\n             psychotic disorder, or dementia.\n\n          -  Subjects with a DSM-IV/DSM-IVTR/DSM-V diagnosis of alcohol or substance dependence\n             (other than nicotine or caffeine) within the last month.\n\n          -  Subjects with a current suicidal or homicidal ideation necessitating clinical\n             intervention or representing an imminent concern.\n\n          -  If in the judgment of the PI it is not in the subject's best interest to participate.\n\n          -  Final eligibility decisions will be determined by the PI."
