  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compared to conventional radiotherapy with photons (CRT), particle therapy (PT) has the
      potential to inflict maximum damage on tumors with minimum collateral damage to neighboring
      healthy tissue. Given that the cost of particle therapy (PT) is considerably higher than
      that of conventional radiotherapy (RT) with photons, it is necessary to establish whether
      these higher costs are worthwhile in light of the expected advantages. Thus, clear evidence
      of the situations in which PT outperforms conventional photon treatment is needed.

      In a previous ROCOCO study (lung stage I-IIIB) an inhomogeneous group of patients with
      regard to tumor stage and size was included1.  Conformal radiotherapy and Intensity
      Modulated Radiotherapy were used in the comparison. In this study patients with smaller
      tumors are included (stage I). A stereotactic treatment schedule and more advanced treatment
      techniques, such as CyberKnife, RapidArc, IMRT and Tomotherapy, are eligible for these kind
      of lesions. As a result the comparison as demonstrated in our previous study maybe invalid.
      We propose to investigate to what extend proton and 12C-ion therapy decrease the amount of
      irradiated normal tissue compared to state of the art photon modalities in stage I lung
      cancer patients.

      For this in silico planning study all treatment plans will be performed in centers that are
      already operating and have experience in treatment planning. IMRT treatment plans will be
      calculated in Eindhoven (NL), Tomotherapy plans in Deventer (NL), Cyberknife plans in Liege
      (BE) and RapidArc treatment plans in Hasselt (BE). Proton treatment plans will be performed
      at the University of Pennsylvania (USA) and the C-ion treatment plans at the University of
      Marburg (GE).

      A dataset with state-of-the-art image data is available. 25 patients will be included
      according to a-priori defined selection criteria. Each patient will function as his or her
      own control. For this reason, the number of patients per tumor group can be limited to 25
      patients per tumor group (power = 80%, alpha = 5%).

      The datasets will be stored on a secure website hosted by MAASTRO. High quality CT-images
      will be used for radiotherapy treatment planning. Secondary image information such as
      FDG-PET and MRI will be used for GTV delineation. GTV and all relevant OARs will be
      delineated in MAASTRO (NL). The GTV to PTV margin will be determined by the individual
      institutes according to the treatment technique and treatment modality.

      Photons will be planned with state of the art treatment techniques. Protons will be planned
      using active beam delivery with Intensity Modulated proton therapy (IMPT)and carbon-ions
      with a  pencil beam delivery treatment planning technique with gantry. Each participating
      center will use its own treatment planning system according to standard practice at that
      center. The same tumor dose, overall treatment time (OTT) and an equal number of fractions
      will be used for all treatment modalities.

      Photon, proton and C-ion treatments will be compared based on dosimetric parameters on
      normal tissues. DVH's will be calculated for the OARs. In addition, the NTCP for a fixed
      tumor dose will be determined. Cobalt Gy equivalent doses will be used when reporting the
      proton and carbon-ion dose. In the case of protons, a constant RBE value of 1.1 will be used
      for both the tumor and the normal tissues. The RBE of carbon-ions will be calculated based
      on the models used by the participating centers.
