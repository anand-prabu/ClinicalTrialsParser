            "textblock": "Currently, there is no direct, reliable, bed-side, and non-invasive method for assessing\n      changes in brain activity associated with concussion. Event Related Potentials (ERPs), which\n      are temporal reflections of the neural mass electrical activity of cells in specific regions\n      of the brain that occur in response to stimuli, may offer such a method, as they provide\n      both a noninvasive and portable measure of brain function. The ERPs provide excellent\n      temporal information, but spatial resolution for ERPs has traditionally been limited.\n      However, by using high-density electroencephalograph (EEG) recording spatial resolution for\n      ERPs is improved significantly. The paradigm for the current study will combine\n      neurophysiological knowledge with mathematical signal processing and pattern recognition\n      methods (BNA\u2122) to temporally and spatially map brain function, connectivity and\n      synchronization.\n\n      The proposed study will provide additional evidence for the utility and contribution of the\n      BNA\u2122 test (reflecting temporal and spatial changes in brain activity as well as brain\n      functional connectivity associated with concussion) in concussion management.\n\n      The BNA test is basically divided to 3 phases - first EEG data is collected from subjects\n      using an EEG system while the subject is performing a cognitive task in front of a computer.\n      The EEG data is then analyzed using the advanced BNA\u2122 technology. Finally, a report of the\n      BNA\u2122 test is generated."

Follow-up testing for concussed athletes - Concussed athletes will complete a series of\n           post concussion follow up visits. Each will consist of BNA\u2122 test, ImPACT\u2122 test, and\n           exam by neurologist or neurology nurse practitioner.  The first visit will be within 72\n           hours of injury and re-evaluations will occur weekly until BNA has normalized AND\n           subject is asymptomatic. Subject may return to play at that point and subject will have\n           a final additional BNA\u2122 test one week after the athlete returns to full activity. If\n           participant is still symptomatic and/or BNA is still abnormal at 6 weeks reevaluations\n           go to every 2 weeks for up to three months or clearing of symptoms AND normal BNA\u2122.  If\n           not back to baseline at three months, monthly reevaluations until study completion.\n\n        2.
