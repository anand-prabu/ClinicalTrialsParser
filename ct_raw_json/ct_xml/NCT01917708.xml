      This is a randomized, open-label multicenter pilot study comparing two dose numbers of
      abatacept.  The study is assessing the tolerability of 4 and 6 doses of abatacept when
      combined with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil as graft versus host disease
      prophylaxis in children undergoing unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplant for serious
      non-malignant diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) represents the only viable cure
      for children who suffer from a wide variety of rare, serious non-malignant diseases, such as
      Fanconi Anemia, Hurler syndrome, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.  A major obstacle
      to the success of HSCT is morbidity and mortality from graft versus host disease (GVHD),
      driven by donor T cells recognizing and reacting against disparate host antigens. This trial
      is being conducted as a step toward testing the long-term hypothesis that the costimulation
      blockade agent abatacept can be added to a standard post-transplant GVHD prophylaxis
      regimen, cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil, to improve disease-free survival after
      unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using low dose total body
      irradiation based conditioning for children with non-malignant diseases. This study will
      have the following Specific Aims.

      Specific Aim #1: To conduct a randomized, open-label multicenter pilot, assessing the
      tolerability of two dose numbers of abatacept (n=20).  Patients will be randomly assigned to
      receive four doses (arm A;10 mg/kg IV on days -1, +5, +14 and +28), a schedule well
      tolerated by adolescents and adults with hematologic malignancies in a previous pilot, or
      six doses (arm B;10 mg/kg IV on days -1, +5, +14, +28, +56 and +84).  Abatacept will be
      combined with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil.

      Specific Aim #2: to compare the immunological effects of four and six doses.
