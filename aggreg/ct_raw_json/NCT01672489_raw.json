To test the hypothesis that ocular measures of alertness (percent of time\n      with eyes closed, eye tracking and Johns' Drowsiness Score) are related to abnormal driving\n      performance (driving out of the lane) and \"microsleeps\" during on road (track) driving.\n\n      Specific Aim 2a. To test the hypothesis that autonomic measures, ECG, respiration (measured\n      with the Bioharness), skin conductance level and peripheral blood flow (measured with the Q\n      sensor), are related to abnormal driving performance (driving out of the lane) and\n      \"microsleeps\" during on road (track) driving\n\n      Specific Aim 3.
