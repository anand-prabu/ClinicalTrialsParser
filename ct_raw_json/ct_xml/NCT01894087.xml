  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unintentional poisoning is a developing public health problem in the U.S. Unintentional
      poisoning (or &quot;overdose&quot;) deaths increased 157% among adults between 1999 and 2008. There
      were ~700,000 emergency department (ED) visits due to overdoses in 2007. Medication-related
      overdoses, particularly prescription opioid overdoses, have accounted for much of this
      increase. There have been parallel increases in sales of opioids (with a 6 fold increase
      between 1997 and 2007), as well as both medical and non-medical use of prescription opioids.
      Prescription opioids are now among the most common of drugs used non-medically in the U.S.

      The specific aims of this project are to: 1) Develop an ED-based tailored brief prescription
      opioid overdose prevention intervention. We will examine therapeutic alliance, perceived
      satisfaction, and perceived utility of the intervention; 2) Examine intervention effects on
      precursors of overdose risk behavioral change immediately post-intervention. We will compare
      intervention and control participants on knowledge, self-efficacy, readiness to change, and
      behavioral intentions regarding overdose risk behavior; and 3) Examine intervention effects
      on overdose risk behaviors six months post-intervention. We will compare intervention and
      control participants on: 1) use of high dose/quantity of opioids; 2) using opioids in
      combinations with certain psychoactive substances (i.e., alcohol, heroin, cocaine, and
      sedatives); and, 3) route of administration.

    <description>Participants will receive a therapist-led, computer-assisted intervention session with a master's level therapist. The interventions are designed to address extramedical prescription opioid use and overdose risk behaviors. This includes a review of the participants' strengths, values, and goals; feedback regarding their opioid use and overdose risk behaviors; developing a discrepancy between their opioid and other drug use and ability to meet goals and values; and the formulation of a &quot;change plan&quot; for each participant.</description>
