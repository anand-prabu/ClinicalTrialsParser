Systemic chemotherapy consists\n      of leucovorin calcium on days 8-14 and fluorouracil on days 9-13. Courses repeat every 4\n      weeks for a total of 12 weeks.\n\n      If biopsy-proven metastatic disease develops, treatment may be stopped at the investigator's\n      discretion. Continuation of regional therapy should be considered for extrahepatic failure.\n      No concurrent radiotherapy is permitted.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years, then every 6 months for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: It is expected that 50 patients will be entered over approximately 5\n      years."
