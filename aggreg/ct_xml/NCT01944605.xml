  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (CA) is a leading public health problem causing nearly one
      third of a million deaths annually in the US, accounting for half of all cardiovascular
      deaths and surpassing deaths from stroke, heart failure, and breast and lung cancer
      combined. Twenty to fifty percent of CA patients (pts) can be resuscitated initially but
      many die before hospital discharge or suffer permanent neurologic damage. Therapeutic
      hypothermia (TH) improves survival and neurological outcomes. Despite aggressive, targeted
      post arrest management, including TH, approximately 50% of pts die before leaving the
      hospital due to global ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) known as the &quot;post arrest
      syndrome&quot;, 1 which is a sepsis-like state characterized by elevated markers of cellular
      inflammation and injury. It is believed that TH works by decreasing the body's basal
      metabolic rate (BMR) and attenuating the systemic inflammatory response (SIR). However,
      specific triggers of the intense pro-inflammatory response are unclear. This &quot;gap&quot; in
      knowledge must be closed to identify targeted therapy to decrease IRI and improve outcomes.

      Blood flow to the gut is decreased markedly and intestinal tissue becomes ischemic during CA
      and CPR, particularly when vasoconstrictor drugs such as epinephrine, are given. IRI of the
      intestine increases intestinal permeability leading to intestinal microbial translocation
      and endotoxin release that can stimulate and perpetuate systemic inflammation and cause
      subsequent multi-organ dysfunction. Endotoxin also increases body temperature and energy
      expenditure and may attenuate TH induced reductions in BMR and hence, decrease efficacy. The
      purpose of this novel pilot study is to detect systemic endotoxin release following CA in
      humans and determine association with cytokine activation, and BMR alterations during TH.

      Hypothesis 1 Intestinal ischemia during and following Caridac Arrest leads to increased gut
      permeability and endotoxin release that stimulates the Systemic Inflammatory Response that
      is responsible for subsequent death and disability after resuscitation.

      Hypothesis 2: Different degrees of systemic endotoxin activity variably affect Basic
      Metabolic Rate during Therapeutic Hypothermia

      Serial samples of blood, stool and expired gas will be measured at predetermined timepoints
      after ROSC from cardiac arrest.
