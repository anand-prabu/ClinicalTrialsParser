  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, stratified, and randomized, open-label, placebo study in subjects
      with asthma to compare inhalers, ELLIPTA a new dry powder inhaler (DPI) and metered dose
      inhalers (MDI). This study is conducted to evaluate subject's preference of several
      inhaler-specific attributes individually between an existing MDI and the ELLIPTA a dry
      powder inhaler. Subjects who have not used the ELLIPTA inhaler in the past 6 months and
      their asthma must be controlled on their current therapy were enrolled. Subjects meeting the
      eligibility criteria will be stratified according to their current inhaler use (stable for
      the past 3 months): 1.) Currently using a DPI as an inhaled asthma controller therapy OR 2.)
      Currently using an MDI as an inhaled asthma controller therapy (No fluticasone MDI use in
      the last 3 months) OR 3.) Currently using no inhaled asthma controller therapy (this
      includes patients using a LTM and/or SABA only). Once stratified, eligible subjects were
      randomized (1:1) to one of two sequences for using the inhaler: ELLIPTA inhaler once daily
      in Period 1 followed by MDI twice daily in Period 2 or MDI twice daily in Period 1 followed
      by ELLIPTA inhaler once daily in Period 2 for for 5-9 days each. In addition, subjects will
      be randomly assigned (1:1 allocation) to receive one of two sets of questions: Version 1
      presents response options in the order of ELLIPTA inhaler, MDI, No preference; Version 2
      presents response options in the order of MDI, ELLIPTA inhaler, No preference. At the end of
      the second trial period, subjects answered questions which assessed their preference of
      inhaler attributes. ELLIPTA is a registered trademark of the GSK group of companies.
