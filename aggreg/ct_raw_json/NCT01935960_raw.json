To correlate the pharmacokinetics of 9cUAB30 with toxicity. II. To compare observed\n      toxicity between placebo controls and each dose level. III. To assess for any change in\n      single dose pharmacokinetics (PK) after repeat dosing (day 1 vs. day 36).\n\n      IV. To assess the following potential biomarkers of UAB30: telomerase activity (measurement\n      of telemetric repeats in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs]); gene expression of\n      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase in PBMCs; gene expression of cytochrome P450,\n      family 2, subfamily B, polypeptide 6 (CYP2B6) in PBMCs.\n\n      V. To perform exploratory analysis of the following biomarkers in skin, in a subset of\n      willing participants from University of Wisconsin (UWI) and University of Alabama at\n      Birmingham (UAB): terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated deoxyuridine\n      triphosphate (dUTP) nick end labeling (Tunel) assay; B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia\n      (CLL)/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2); proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA); tumor protein p53 (p53);\n      ornithine decarboxylase (ODC); cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2); matrix metalloproteinase 2/matrix\n      metalloproteinase 9; keratin 1/keratin 10; 9cUAB30 skin concentrations.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment\n      arms.\n\n      ARM I: Participants receive retinoid 9cUAB30 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1 and 8-36.\n      Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      ARM II: Participants receive a placebo PO QD on days 1 and 8-36.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7 and 30 days."
