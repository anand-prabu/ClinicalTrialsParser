  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that over 1 million people in the United States have HIV infection. While
      HIV is treatable, there are still high rates of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder
      (HAND). HAND is defined by low scores on memory testing. To meet the criteria for HAND, an
      HIV-infected individual has to have a low score on at least two different memory tests. It
      is estimated that 20-50% of people living with HIV have HAND. It is therefore still a common
      problem. While individuals with HAND typically improve on antiretroviral therapy for HIV,
      often this improvement is incomplete. Also, there are over 20 antiretroviral medications
      approved for HIV in the US. It is not clear if the specific choice of antiretroviral
      medication makes a difference in the improvement of HAND.

      In this study, the investigators will examine the addition of zidovudine or placebo to a
      standard medication regimen for individuals with HAND. Zidovudine (typically referred to as
      AZT) was the first medication approved for the treatment of HIV. It has been approved for
      over 25 years. Early studies of AZT showed that it was beneficial for individuals with HAND.
      However, these early studies typically used AZT alone without other antiretrovirals. As a
      result, the clinical benefit of AZT was time limited due to the emergence of HIV resistance
      to the drug. Since then, new therapies have been approved for HIV and current guidelines
      state that 3 drug regimens be used to avoid resistance. The question remains if the addition
      of AZT into a standard regimen would allow for greater improvement in subjects with HAND.

      To address this question, the investigators have designed a small preliminary study in which
      subjects with HAND who have never been on treatment for HIV are given a standard of care HIV
      regimen plus either AZT or placebo. The standard of care regimen
      (raltegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine) is one of the first choice HIV regimens in the US. The
      investigators will enroll a maximum of 46 subjects (23 subjects in each arm). Subjects will
      also be followed by their primary HIV medical provider. For the study, subjects will be
      followed for 48 weeks. There are three followup visits: 12 weeks, 24 weeks, and 48 weeks.
      Memory testing will be performed at baseline and each followup visit. Blood will also be
      taken at baseline and the three followup visits to measure changes in inflammation. A lumbar
      puncture will be performed at baseline and at 24 weeks to measure changes in inflammation
      and amount of HIV virus in the spinal fluid. There is also an optional lumbar puncture at
      the last study visit of 48 weeks.

      AZT is typically well tolerated, but side effects such as nausea and headache can occur. The
      most common side effect of lumbar puncture is headache. Subjects will be monitored closely
      for side effects at each study visit as well as a once monthly phone call from the study
      coordinator.

      Due to the small nature of the study, the investigators do not expect to find clinically
      meaningful memory differences between the two groups. Instead, the investigators will be
      looking for small changes in memory testing as well as changes in inflammation in the blood
      and spinal fluid over the course of the study. If these small changes are found, the results
      would be used to create a study looking at AZT addition in a larger group of individuals
      with HAND.
