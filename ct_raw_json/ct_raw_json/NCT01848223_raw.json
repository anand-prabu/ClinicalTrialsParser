            "textblock": "The aim of this study is to investigate the quality of life (QoL) of late postmenopausal\n      Finnish women. In 1995, 71 women were recruited through an advertisement in a local\n      newspaper in the area of Turku in Finland. Exclusion criteria were: a history of previous\n      head injury, neurological, cardiovascular, endocrinological or mental disease, medicated\n      hyperlipidemia, malignancies, abuse of alcohol or medicines and smoking (over 10 cigarettes\n      daily). Inclusion criteria were: previous hysterectomy for a benign reason and\n      postmenopausal status (serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level over 26 U/l). Finally,\n      65 women were approved for the study.\n\n      Originally the study was a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind,\n      cross-over trial. It included three different periods in which different medications were\n      administered: three months of estrogen/placebo therapy, a one month wash-out period and\n      three months of placebo/estrogen therapy. The women were randomized into two groups, where\n      the other group received first a placebo and then estrogen and the other received first\n      estrogen and then a placebo. Women completed questionnaires at the beginning of the study\n      and after the both periods. After the survey women got to choose if they wanted to continue\n      with the hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or not.\n\n      Questionnaires were sent to the same women six years later. The intention was to estimate\n      the present QoL of the women. Also their use of HRT, possible chronic diseases and\n      medications were evaluated.\n\n      This study is the 17 year follow-up study to the investigation described above. The goal is\n      to measure the QoL of the same women and estimate the factors affecting it in late\n      postmenopausal age. The questionnaires used are the Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ), the\n      Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire (BNSQ) and a common\n      questionnaire to define the women's current life situation, their education and working\n      background, their state of health, medications, the use of HRT and recent life events. The\n      women also filled in the same questionnaires 17 years ago in relation to the first part of\n      the study, and six years after it relating to the first follow-up study. The results of this\n      study are compared to the former investigation results. The above mentioned randomization\n      system is not used this time but the women are processed as only one group. The women are\n      now acting as their own controls and their answers are compared to the responses they gave\n      17 years earlier. In this way it is possible to determine, if the woman's QoL has changed\n      during aging, and if the change is for the better or worse. The women were already\n      postmenopausal 17 years ago, so the effect of climacterium should be bypassed by now.\n      Therefore, when the results of this study are compared to the former results, it is possible\n      to separate the effect of the climacterium, and on the other hand, the effects of aging, on\n      the QoL and on some symptoms attached to the perimenopausal phase."
