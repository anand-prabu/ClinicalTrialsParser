Among these methods, transient\n      elastography is the most promising. The method has been investigated mainly in patients with\n      viral hepatitis. Several studies have shown, that the optimal cut-off value of TE for\n      detection of liver cirrhosis by transient elastography is highly dependent on the aetiology\n      of the underlying liver disease. Only a few studies have evaluated the value of transient\n      elastography for patients with autoimmune liver disease and here primarily patients with PBC\n      and PSC. For patients with autoimmune hepatitis the data is limited. We prospectively\n      investigated the diagnostic accuracy of TE in autoimmune hepatitis compared to liver\n      histology with and without inclusion of the macroscopic appearance using mini-laparoscopy"
