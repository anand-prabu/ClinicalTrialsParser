    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind placebo controlled study targeting individuals with active Behcet's
      Syndrome who have oral ulcers and are resistant (have not responded after 4 weeks) to
      conventional treatments.  Maximum allowable dose of colchicine (0.6mg twice a day) and
      stable dose for 4 weeks before enrollment.  Prednisone or equivalent (&lt; 10mg/day) permitted
      if dose stable for 6 weeks prior to enrollment.

      The study will investigate the safety of tocilizumab for this vasculitic condition in
      addition to its efficacy.

      The planned sample size is 30 participants per arm for a total of 60 participants. The study
      would be for 3 months, with a safety follow up at 2 months after study termination.

      Study participants will stay on their current treatments and either tocilizumab or placebo
      infusions will be given every 4 weeks in addition. Patients will be randomized to Actemra IV
      8mg/kg Q 4 weeks X 3 doses or placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Behcet's syndrome is a vasculitis that causes oral and genital ulcerations, skin lesions,
      eye disease and arthritis, in addition to vascular complications with thrombophlebitis,
      thrombosis and rarely central nervous system involvement. IL-6 activity has been suggested
      in the pathogenesis in some studies. Tocilizumab with its unique mode of action among
      biologic agents may be a good candidate in this orphan disease.
