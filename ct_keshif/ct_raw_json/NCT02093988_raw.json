            "textblock": "Topical: Administration of medication directly at location where desired (Ex. surgical\n      site). Local Intravenous (IV): Administration of medication into a vein (goes to whole\n      body). Systemic\n\n      Blood loss during major paediatric spine surgery is significant, and it is well established\n      that patients undergoing such surgery have a substantial risk for requiring a blood\n      transfusion immediately after surgery. Given the cost and associated risks with foreign\n      blood product transfusion, a significant effort has been directed towards reducing\n      transfusion requirements through various methods of blood conservation.\n\n      Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic antifibrinolytic that functions through competitive\n      blockade of the lysine-binding sites of plasminogen, plasmin, and tissue plasminogen\n      activator resulting in the inhibition of fibrinolysis and clot degradation (see schematic\n      below). When used through intravenous method (IV), it has been shown to safe, efficacious,\n      and effective in reducing transfusion requirements and blood loss during immediate period\n      after surgery of various orthopaedic procedures, including major surgeries of the spine. A\n      growing body of evidence has supported the topical application of TXA in lower extremity\n      joint reconstruction, among other procedures, in which a salt water solution containing TXA\n      is placed directly in the surgical incision prior to closure (i.e. topical administration).\n      The reason for the use of TXA topically arises from reports of blood clotting events thought\n      to be attributable to IV administration of TXA. Although these potentially catastrophic\n      events are rare, interest in using TXA topically has grown based on evidence demonstrating\n      less than one-tenth the serum concentrations of TXA with topical application as compared IV\n      dosing."
