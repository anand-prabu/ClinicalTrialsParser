Determine whether an educational intervention to enhance the effectiveness of\n      ondansetron can prevent acute postchemotherapy nausea and emesis in cancer patients. II.\n      Assess any potential effectiveness of the intervention on delayed postchemotherapy nausea\n      and emesis in these patients. III. Examine the effect of the intervention on patient\n      expectations.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by\n      center and chemotherapy agent (cisplatin vs carboplatin vs doxorubicin). Patients are\n      randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive standard educational\n      materials. Arm II: Patients receive specific intervention material in addition to standard\n      educational materials. Patients then complete a patient information questionnaire. Patients\n      receive ondansetron orally or IV over 10-15 minutes in addition to the first 2 courses of\n      chemotherapy. Patients complete a nausea and emesis questionnaire after each of their first\n      2 chemotherapy treatments.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 patients (150 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
