Although zidovudine (AZT) has shown promise in prolonging life in\n      patients with AIDS and severe ARC, it has significant blood toxicities. It would be\n      beneficial to combine AZT with another antiviral agent that does not have the same toxicity.\n      DS might be a suitable drug since it has shown antiviral activity against HIV in the\n      laboratory, and in preliminary studies it has shown little toxicity. Also, the combination\n      of DS with AZT has been shown to be more effective than either alone."

If the initial dose of DS is\n      tolerated without significant side effects, the next group of patients will receive a higher\n      dose. A third group of patients will be given either a higher or lower dose depending on the\n      results of the earlier groups. Patients will be evaluated every other week for 12 weeks,\n      then monthly for the remaining 16 weeks. Patients will have the option of continuing DS\n      until the entire study is completed if the drug is well tolerated. Inhaled pentamidine for\n      the prevention of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia is allowed, but other investigational drugs\n      are not. Drug effects on the HIV virus, immune function, and clinical condition will be\n      monitored during the periodic evaluations."
