            "textblock": "Despite many advances in neonatal care, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains a leading\n      cause of morbidity and mortality among premature infants. NEC is the most common\n      life-threatening gastrointestinal emergency encountered in the neonatal intensive care unit,\n      affecting between 3.8% and 13% of very low birthweight (VLBW) infants (1-3).  More recently\n      interest has intensified regarding the possible association between \"elective\" red blood\n      cell (RBC) transfusions in premature infants and the subsequent development of NEC (4-9).\n      On a physiological basis, a few explanations for transfusion-associated NEC have been\n      proposed: 1) the physiological impact of anemia that can initiate a cascade of events\n      leading to ischemic-hypoxemic mucosal gut injury predisposing to NEC [10]; and 2) increased\n      splanchnic blood flow following RBC transfusion leading to reperfusion injury of gut mucosa.\n\n      Aim 1.  This study will quantify inflammatory cytokine profiles in anemic infants cared for\n      in the NICU prior to and after transfusion with packed red blood cells (PRBC), as dictated\n      by current clinical guidelines for treatment of anemia, and prospectively assess for\n      clinical signs and symptoms of NEC following each transfusion event.\n\n      Aim 2.  Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) isolated from the pre- and post-transfusion\n      blood samples will be assessed in vitro for neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) formation.\n\n      Aim 3.  A) To determine whether significant anemia preceding a RBC transfusion is associated\n      with impaired intestinal oxygenation, and whether a RBC transfusion temporarily increases\n      splanchnic oxygenation. We postulate that the CSOR will be low (<0.75) at baseline\n      measurement in infants with hemodynamically significant anemia, and that RBC transfusion\n      will temporarily increase intestinal perfusion in that particular group of babies.\n\n      B) To determine whether alterations in mesenteric regional oxygenation saturation(rSO2) can\n      predict the development of NEC in VLBW infants. We hypothesize that overall\n      cerebro-splanchnic oxygenation ratio (CSOR) values will be significantly lower among very\n      low birth weight (VLBW) infants that develop NEC, when compared to CSOR values obtained in\n      infants that do not develop NEC following RBC transfusion."
