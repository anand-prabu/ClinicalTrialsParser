The aim of the medicaments is to control behavior and allow safe\n      completion of a dental procedure. Homeopathic remedy is safe and can be effective to control\n      behavior and decrease anxiety in children during dental treatment.\n\n      Aim: 1. To explore the efficacy of homeopathic drugs in decreasing children's dental anxiety\n      before dental treatment.\n\n      2. To assess the effectiveness of homeopathic remedy in facilitating dental treatment for\n      anxious children.\n\n      Methods: prospective, double-blind study. Thirty healthy children (5-12 years-old) will\n      receive homeopathic remedy\\placebo before dental treatment. Anxiety reduction will be\n      measured using: saliva cortisol levels, saliva \u03b1-amylase levels, facial image scale (FIS),\n      and Houpt behavior scale.\n\n      Expected results: the homeopathic remedy will reduce anxiety and increase child cooperation\n      during dental treatment."
