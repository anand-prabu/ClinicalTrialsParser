Under-treatment can lead to severe and\n      irreversible disease progression and associated loss of vision. Over-treatment is expensive,\n      uncomfortable and potentially increases the risk of complications.  A self-monitoring device\n      such as DigiSight can help subjects keep close control of their treatment, but alleviate the\n      burden of in office monitoring visits.   A decreased number of office visits in combination\n      with the home self-monitoring may provide an effective alternative dosing regimen, allowing\n      the physician and subject to closely track the disease progression and treatment effect\n      without the demands of monthly or frequent visits to the office."
