            "textblock": "FINFIB 2 is an observational investigator-driven study that seeks to examine current\n      treatment practice for atrial fibrillation (AF) in Finland. It will produce important\n      information such as whether the introduction of the new agents has taken place in accordance\n      with the treatment guidelines in different parts of Finland.\n\n      Working hypothesis is that the treatment of AF has improved since the introduction of new\n      antiarrhythmic drugs and anticoagulants. However, the investigators also expect to find out\n      that there are geographical differences in the use of these agents. The expect outcome is\n      that the investigators will identify these differences and be able to better homogenize the\n      treatment of AF in different parts of the country and different levels of the health care\n      system.\n\n      The study data will be obtained in the form of a cross-section sampling over two weeks. All\n      patients with ECG-diagnosed AF who attend emergency clinics for examination or treatment of\n      arrhythmia or other cardiac diseases during the study period will be included. The\n      investigators estimate the number of patients will be about 1000. Aside from background\n      information, risk data (e.g. CHA2DS2VASc), symptoms (EHRA classification), medication,\n      examinations and the choice of treatment, the only data recorded about each patient with AF\n      will be date of birth and gender. The patients will be divided into four groups according to\n      type of AF: 1. New onset AF, 2. Paroxysmal AF, 3. Persistent AF, 4. Permanent AF. The data\n      will be obtained by the local study doctor using online, protected data collection program.\n      The data will be stored on a secured server, which can be accessed for data entry by the\n      investigators at the study centers. The database is not a personal data register, as\n      identity codes will not be stored at any point and individual patients cannot be identified\n      later through the database. Only the investigator group will have the rights to use the\n      database."
