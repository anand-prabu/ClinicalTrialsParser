  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The LOOP study aims to clarify whether stroke and peripheral emboli can be prevented by
      monitoring the heart rhythm with a small device (called a loop recorder). The recorder which
      is placed under the skin on the front of the chest wall allows monitoring of the heart
      rhythm 24-hours a day 7 days a week.

      The study has 6,000 participants with risk factors for stroke (age &gt;70 years, and at least
      one of the diseases: diabetes, hypertension, heart failure or previous stroke) but without a
      history of atrial fibrillation, of which 1,500 will have a loop recorder implanted and 4,500
      will be included in a control group. Participants are randomised to receive a loop recorder
      or not (control).

      If a participant has atrial fibrillation of more than 6 min duration the study participant
      will start oral anticoagulation therapy according to local guidelines.

      Background:

      Stroke is a major health problem, which affects approximately 16,000 people annually in
      Denmark, causing severe and burdensome consequences for its victims, who suffer a
      significant loss in quality of life (QOL), and their families. Stroke is often caused by
      atrial fibrillation (AF), which is the most common type of cardiac arrhythmia. Effective
      management of AF with anticoagulation therapy is available and may have considerable
      benefits for patients as well as society. Difficult to detect, however, asymptomatic AF is
      usually only diagnosed by chance. Recently developed technology (implantable loop recorder;
      ILR) allows continuous long-term electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring and may constitute a
      substantial improvement in AF diagnosis.

      Primary objective:

      The primary objective of this study is to determine, whether patients with increased risk of
      stroke have a high occurrence of AF without symptoms when studied by continuous ECG
      monitoring using an ILR and whether the risk of stroke and peripheral emboli can be reduced
      by initiating anticoagulation therapy according to pre-specified local study guidelines;

      Secondary objectives:

      a) Whether analysis of ECG intervals obtained from a single ECG lead (from the ILR ) and
      from conventional ECG can predict future development of AF; and b) Whether the use of an
      expensive monitor technology - such as an ILR - for the diagnosis of AF will be cost
      effective in a health economics analysis due to a reduction in the number of strokes.

      Study design:

      Randomized, un-blinded, controlled parallel two group trial.

      Endpoints:

      Primary endpoint: Strokes and peripheral embolic episodes. Secondary: AF burden, major
      bleeding complications, death or acute (non-elective) hospitalisation due to cardiac reasons
      or complications, health economy, QOL, presence of brain infarcts and white matter
      hyper-intensity on MRI, safety aspects of device implants, inflammation markers and AF,
      genetic prediction of stroke, cardiac fibrosis on MRI, electrocardiographic markers to
      predict AF and stroke.

      Sample size:

      In total 6,000 subjects will participate: 1,500 randomised to receive an implantable loop
      recorder (ILR group) and 4,500 randomised to receive standard care (control group).

      Summary of Subject Eligibility Criteria:

      Subjects will be 70 years of age or older and will have at least one of the following
      diseases: hypertension, diabetes, heart failure or previous stroke (and biologically a
      candidate for OAC).

      ILR group:

      Patients randomised to the ILR group will receive the monitoring device and if AF is
      detected anticoagulation therapy will be given according to study guidelines.

      Control group:

      Patients will be treated according to standard care.

      Study Duration:

      The study comprises a screening period of up to 12-18 months followed by at treatment phase
      of a minimum of 36 months. The total study duration will therefore be approximately 5 years.

      Screening and Randomisation:

      Treatment: After randomisation patients allocated to the ILR group should receive the
      implantation as fast as possible, and preferably within 4 weeks.

      Statistical Considerations:

      The population is expected to have a stroke risk of 0.7%/year if AF is not present and
      2%/year if AF is present. Approximately 20% are expected to have AF during monitoring for a
      period of more than two years, which is a conservative estimate since 10% in the ASSERT
      study cohort (pacemaker patients over the age of 65 with hypertension but without a history
      of AF) had AF in the course of 3 months ECG monitoring. As a result, there will be
      approximately four non-AF patients (controls) per experimental subject (AF). We expect to
      have an accrual interval of two years and additional follow-up after the accrual interval of
      2 years. The population will consist of patients at risk of developing stroke due to AF and
      patients at risk of developing stroke unrelated to AF. The AF-related strokes are expected
      to be reduced by oral anticoagulation therapy (hazard ratio 0.2), while strokes unrelated to
      AF will not be influenced by this. Thus, the overall hazard ratio is expected to be 0.65
      (35% reduction of stroke in the ILR group). With a power of 80% and a type I error of 5% we
      need 584 patients in the ILR group. We have increased the sample size to 1.500 patients in
      the ILR group to increase the possibility to reach secondary endpoints. If the event rate is
      lower than expected follow-up can be increased. With a follow-up of 3 years, the total
      number of strokes is expected to be 230 and the study is expected to continue until this
      number of events has been reached.

      Primary Endpoint Analysis:

      The principal analysis for the primary endpoint (time to one of the events in the combined
      endpoint) will employ the intent-to-threat principle and use a survival analysis. For each
      randomised group, Kaplan-Meier curves will be estimated, graphically displayed and compared
      using a logrank test. A co-variate adjusted analysis of the combined primary endpoint using
      a Cox proportional regression model will be performed as a supportive analysis. The hazard
      ratios and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be estimated. Subjects completing
      the study and not reaching the composite endpoint will be censored.

      Secondary Endpoint Analysis:

      All time-to-event secondary endpoints will be analysed similarly to the primary endpoint.

      Sample Size:

      Hazard rates have been estimated from previous studies, including the ASSERT study. Assuming
      12-18 months recruitment period and 36 months follow-up period and a randomisation ratio of
      one active vs. 9 controls (where active subjects will receive an ILR and subsequent
      anticoagulation therapy if subclinical AF is detected)  a total of 584 subjects randomised
      to ILR group will provide a power of 80% and a type I error of 5% we need 584 patients in
      the ILR group. By increasing the number of study participants in the ILR group we expect to
      reach statistical power to evaluate secondary endpoints. If the event rate is lower than
      expected follow-up can be increased. With a follow-up of 3 years, approximately 20 stroke
      patients in the ILR group are needed. The total number of strokes is expected to be 230 and
      the study is expected to continue until this number of events are reached.

      Event Committee:

      An event adjudication committee will classify endpoint events throughout the study.

      Funding:

      Research grants have been obtained from the Danish National Foundation for Strategic
      Research (DKK 15.6 mio), the Research Foundation for the Capital Region of Denmark (DKK 2.0
      mio) and the Danish Heart Foundation (DKK 150.000). Medtronic (manufacturer of the ILRs will
      donate an unrestricted research grant to the study covering costs related to 900 ILRs (which
      has a value of DKK 5.4 mio (reduced price) or DKK 22.5 mio (ordinary list price)) and a
      grant to cover salary for research nurses at the hospitals (DKK 1.9 mio).

      Additional research grants will be applied for from private and public research foundations
      as well as from industry.

             long-lasting persistent or permanent)
