  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to conduct a phase 2 study to assess whether the addition of acitretin to
      vemurafenib therapy is able to decrease the rate of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC)
      development, a known side effect of vemurafenib therapy, in patients with advanced melanoma.
      Further, we seek a preliminary assessment as to whether the addition of acitretin to
      vemurafenib enhances the clinical efficacy of this anti-melanoma agent.

    <description>The study period during which all AEs must be reported begins after informed consent is obtained and initiation of study treatment and ends 30 days following the last administration of study treatment or study discontinuation/termination, whichever is earlier.

    <description>Vemurafenib is self-administered at a dose of 960 mg (four 240 mg tablets) twice daily. The first dose should be taken in the morning and the second dose should be taken in the evening approximately 12 hours later. Each dose can be taken with or without a meal.  Acitretin will initially be dosed at 25 mg orally per day with dosing altered every two weeks with a 50 mg dose.</description>

          -  Appropriate tumor imaging studies (i.e. CT scan chest, abdomen and pelvis or PET/CT
             scan) performed within 28 days of study registration.

          -  Patients with melanoma measurable by RECIST 1.1 criteria will be monitored using this
             system for evidence of disease response/progression.

          -  Patients with a known history of brain metastases must have a diagnostic quality MRI
             of the brain or contrasted CT scan of the head performed within 28 days prior to

          -  Female patients of child bearing capacity must have had 2 negative urine or serum
             pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial
             acitretin prescription. The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the
             prescriber when the decision is made to pursue acitretin therapy. The second
             pregnancy test (a confirmation test) should be done during the first 5 days of the
             menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of acitretin therapy. The second
