  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to improve the prognosis of the development of alcohol consumption
      by considering a variety of biological, psychological and social risk and protective
      factors. Therefore, young people who have been hospitalized due to acute alcohol
      intoxication within the past 5 to 12 years will be interviewed in order to assess aspects of
      healthy or impaired psychosocial development. The study will also include a control group of
      young adults who were in hospital due to other medical conditions. The identification of
      relevant cases will be based on medical records of several children's hospitals. These
      records will be analysed with regard to potential predictors of developmental hazards and
      protective factors.
