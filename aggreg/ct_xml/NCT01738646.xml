  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown that bevacizumab has significant anti-tumor activity in patients with
      recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. Vorinostat has modest anti-tumor activity against
      malignant glioma and can enhance the action of both chemotherapy and anti-angiogenics.
      Patients will be treated with a combination of bevacizumab and vorinostat.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no effective therapy for patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)
      hence such patients remain a major unmet need in oncology. The investigators have recently
      demonstrated that bevacizumab (BV), a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular
      endothelial growth factor, has significant anti-tumor activity among recurrent glioblastoma
      multiforme patients. Vorinostat has modest anti-tumor activity against malignant glioma and
      can potentiate the action of both chemotherapy and anti-angiogenics. The current study is
      designed to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of vorinostat when combined with BV among
      recurrent glioblastoma multiforme patients.

    <description>MRI evaluations for assessment of radiographic response and response will be classified according to the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria. Brain MRI will be performed prior to the initiation of every other cycle. Comparisons of objective assessments, excluding progressive disease, are based upon major changes in tumor size on the Gd-MRI scan compared to the baseline scan.  Determination of progressive disease is based upon comparison to the previous scan with the smallest measurements.</description>

             stereotactic biopsy.

          -  An interval of at least 12 weeks from the end of prior radiotherapy unless there is a
             new area of enhancement consistent with recurrent tumor outside of the radiation
             field, or there is biopsy-proven tumor progression

          -  An interval of at least 4 weeks from prior chemotherapy [6 weeks for nitrosoureas, 1
             week for daily administered chemotherapy (metronomic dosing)] or investigational
             agent unless the patient has recovered from all anticipated toxicities associated
             with that therapy.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0-1.

          -  Hematocrit ≥ 29%, hemoglobin ≥ 9, absolute neutrophil ≥1,500 cells/microliter,
