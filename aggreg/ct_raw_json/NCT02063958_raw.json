Hsp90 has\n      been found to be expressed in 95% of subjects with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.\n\n      This study will determine the MTD of SNX-5422 when given in combination with everolimus in\n      patients with neuroendocrine tumors.The clinical starting dose of 50 mg/m2 qod for SNX-5422\n      in combination with daily everolimus is 50% of the SNX-5422 qod mono-therapy MTD. The choice\n      to continue once every other day SNX-5422 dosing is based on the safety and efficacy\n      profiles from prior studies, so that drug holidays are interspersed into weekly dosing. The\n      planned subsequent dose levels are 75% and 100% of the SNX-5422 qod mono-therapy MTD."
