Mental condition that may interfere with his/her ability to give an informed consent\n             or interfere with his/her ability or willingness to fulfill the requirements of the\n             study.\n\n         18. Condition that would place excessive demands on the implant (e.g., Charcot's joints,\n             muscle deficiencies, multiple joint disabilities, skeletal immaturity, etc.).\n\n         19. Collateral ligament insufficiency.\n\n         20. Immunosuppressive disorder (e.g., AIDS, etc.) that would require cytotoxic drugs,\n             corticosteroids, large dose of irradiation, or antilymphocytic serum.\n\n         21.
