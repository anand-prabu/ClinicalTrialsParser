To study the effect of antioxidants in cases of oligohydramnios.\n\n        2. To study the effect of antioxidants on mode of delivery and neonatal outcome.\n\n        3. To commence special recommendations from the study about the use of antioxidants in\n           cases of oligohydramnios of unknown cause and cases of oligohydramnios associated with\n           pregnancy induced hypertension.\n\n      Inclusion criteria:\n\n      Patients with gestational age between 30-34 weeks with:\n\n        -  Oligohydramnios of unknown cause.\n\n        -  Oligohydramnios assosiatd with Pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH).\n\n      Exclusion criteria:\n\n        1. Premature rupture of membranes.\n\n        2. Oligohydramnios in postdates pregnancy (>41 weeks).\n\n        3. Fetal anomalies.\n\n        4. IUGR.\n\n        5. Patients using non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\n      Assessment of the patients:\n\n      The target population was assessed to find the participating women suitable for the study,\n      this assessment was done to verify inclusion criteria and to exclude any women has any of\n      the exclusion criteria.\n\n      Ultrasongraphic evaluation:\n\n      Ultrasongraphy was done for estimation of amniotic fluid index by measuring the vertical\n      diameter of the pockets of amniotic fluid in four sections of the uterus and add them\n      together. This gives them a number known as amniotic fluid index (AFI).
