The decision to continue with\n      surgery and need to possibly refer the patient to the Boston Children's Hospital Sports\n      Concussion Clinic after the SCAT3 will remain at the surgeon's discretion.\n\n      Information will be gathered from the questionnaire and the SCAT3, then entered into the\n      REDcap database under a de-identified subject number."
