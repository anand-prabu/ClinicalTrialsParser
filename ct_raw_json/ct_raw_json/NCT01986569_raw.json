Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is currently the most\n      commonly used method for determining ER status. A investigational imaging tracer named\n      16-alpha-[18F]-fluoro-17-beta-estradiol, or [18F]fluoroestradiol ([18F]FES) acts similarly\n      in vivo to estradiol and binds to estrogen receptors (ERs). Previous studies in human have\n      shown the efficacy of [18F]FES PET in detecting ER positive breast cancer without any\n      observed toxicity. The investigators hypothesized that [18F]FES PET imaging can\n      noninvasively assess ER status in recurrent or metastatic breast cancer lesion . In this\n      study, a positive and negative percent agreement between IHC and [18F]FES will be\n      determined."
