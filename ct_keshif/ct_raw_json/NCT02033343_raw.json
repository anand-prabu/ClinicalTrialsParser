            "textblock": "Prostate cancer now accounts for one third of all new cancer diagnoses in men and\n      approximately 30% of men will have external beam radiotherapy as their primary local\n      therapy. Prostate motion during radiotherapy can be divided into interfraction and\n      intrafraction motion. Interfraction motion has been well established and has been largely\n      overcome by daily online image verification with either ultrasound, online CT or implanted\n      fiducial markers, however motion during the radiation beam on time (intrafraction motion) is\n      not corrected and can be the cause of significant errors in radiation dose delivery.\n\n      The most common technology utilised in 2012 to allow prostate gating is the Calypso system.\n      The Calypso system consists of implantable electromagnetic transponders, an array that\n      contains source and receiver coils, computers for data analysis and display purposes, and an\n      infrared camera system to localise the electromagnetic array in the treatment room. The\n      array is placed over the patient, and the source coil in the array emit an electromagnetic\n      signal that excites the transponders. Once the transponders are excited, the source coils\n      are turned off and the receiver coils detect the signal emitted from the excited\n      transponders. This process is repeated at a rate of 10 Hz, providing a realtime\n      radiofrequency localisation of the prostate triangulating three implanted beacons. The\n      current study will investigate using the continuous prostate positioning data from Calypso\n      to integrate with the treatment beam delivery and allow real-time adaptation based on the\n      prostate motion. This is called Realtime Dynamic Multileaf Collimator (DMLC) tracking. In\n      this technique the multileaf collimator motion is altered in the gantry head in real time\n      during beam delivery to account for the measured prostate motion.\n\n      The proposed study is examining the dosimetric impact of accounting for intrafraction motion\n      with Calypso and DMLC tracking. We hypothesise the improvements in delivered prostate dose\n      with DMLC tracking will be even greater than gating. This improved treatment delivery will\n      ensure that the prostate cancer receives the appropriate dose and that normal tissues are\n      spared from extra radiation."
