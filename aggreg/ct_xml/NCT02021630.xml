  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal is designed to examine the impact of bariatric surgery on the health of
      patients and their families. The shared environment of spouses/cohabitating partners
      suggests that patients' families are exposed to the extensive diet and lifestyle changes
      required of patients following bariatric surgery.

      The specific aims of this proposal are to:

        1. Collect clinical data (e.g., weight, blood pressure, body composition, blood sample),
           as well as monitor physical activity and eating patterns, before and after bariatric
           surgery (Adults Only).

        2. Analyze clinical data, physical activity and eating patterns to determine how the
           health of patients and their families change after one family member completes
           bariatric surgery (Adults Only).

        3. Determine the feasibility of recruiting patients, spouses/partners and their children.

        Patients enrolled in the bariatric surgery program at Geisinger Medical Center's Center
        for Nutrition and Weight Management along with their spouse/partner and/or child(ren) ages

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients who receive surgery have been cleared medically and psychosocially for
             surgery. Thus, surgical candidacy criteria will serve as eligibility criteria for the
             current study for surgical patients.

          -  Cohabitation with patients will be considered inclusion criteria for
             partners/spouses.

          -  Children between the ages of ≥5 - ≤ 16, who cohabitate with the patient the majority
             of the time will be asked to participate by providing assent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Report current or planned use of weight loss medications (including OTC), or other
             weight loss strategy.

          -  Report pregnancy, lactation, or plans to become pregnant during study duration.
