    <textblock>
      Unfortunately, despite the best clinical efforts with surgical intervention and chemotherapy
      many patients with high grade and advanced stage renal cell carcinoma (RCC) progress and die
      of their disease. In United States approximately 13,000 individuals die from RCC each year.
      The primary cause of failure is microscopic spread of the tumor prior to complete surgical
      extirpation of detectable disease and the heterogenous nature of the metastatic cells. These
      cells are resistant to all forms of therapy including chemotherapy, radiation, and escape
      from immune surveillance by a variety of mechanism. This results in low 5-year survival
      rates (approximately 10%) in patients with metastasis. Novel immunotherapeutic strategies
      provide a hope in circumventing the drug resistant RCC and improve the survival of patients
      undergoing surgery. RCC, like melanoma is one of the most immunogenic tumors and partial
      successes have been achieved by a variety of immunotherapeutic strategies show partial
      successes. Although vaccines have been highlighted in clinical trials since the mid-1970s
      with subcutaneous autologous irradiated tumor cells most of these studies were in patients
      with advanced disease. These approaches resulted in rare if any clinically relevant benefits
      to patients. However, new vaccines in other cancers have shown responses equivalent to
      chemotherapy with minimal toxicity [1]. The use of immune adjuvant strategies to increase
      the therapeutic immune responses to tumor vaccines enhanced the proportion of patients with
      therapeutic responses to vaccination to 10%-15% on average. Only during the last decade has
      it become clear that failure of immune system to respond to the tumor vaccine is the main
      obstacle that limits the efficacy of vaccine based immunotherapies. The precise reason for
      failure of the immune system in cancers is very complex particularly as it relates to (1)
      the escape of growing or metastasizing tumor from immune surveillance [2-4] and (2) low
      immunogenicity of autoantigens associated with malignant neoplasms. This human clinical
      trial will investigate the dose limiting toxicity of a polyvalent immune enhanced vaccine as
      a first step towards developing a multipronged approach to triggering the immune system to
      attack and destroy micrometastatic disease. Investigators hypothesize that the allogeneic
      RCC cell genetically modified to express α (1,3)galactosyltransferase (enzyme responsible
      for producing the strong xenoantigen on the cell surface of the cellular immunotherapy) will
      augment the efficacy of cellular immunotherapy and thereby improve patient outcomes. In this
      Phase 1 Trial investigators plan to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      Hyperacute®-Renal (HAR) immunotherapy in subjects with clinically metastatic renal cell
      carcinoma.
