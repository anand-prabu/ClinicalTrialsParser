Although recovery during lunch breaks is the most common within-workday\n      break, it has received only minor research attention. Therefore, we will study whether lunch\n      breaks including a relaxation session or exposure to nature have more favorable outcomes\n      than usually spent lunch breaks concerning: a) recovery processes, b) health, c) well-being,\n      d) job performance and e) creativity. We approach recovery by combining the theoretical\n      frameworks of work and environmental psychology."

            "textblock": "We conduct an intervention study in a sample of 200 knowledge-workers who engage in\n      different lunch break activities for 15-minutes per day, two weeks in a row. We randomly\n      assign participants to three experimental conditions: 1) exposure to nature, 2) relaxation\n      and 3) control group (lunch break spent as usual). Online questionnaires before and after\n      the intervention assess long term changes regarding recovery processes and the major outcome\n      variables. Before, during and after the intervention, SMS and paper-pencil questionnaires\n      measure the same constructs four times a day with fewer items. We also measure blood\n      pressure and collect saliva samples to map cortisol excretion across the intervention\n      period. A timed experimental task (i.e., the Alternative Uses Task) is used to examine\n      differences in creativity between the three groups after the intervention period.\n\n      By combining the knowledge of work and environmental psychology about recovery and\n      restorative experiences, by merging three recovery perspectives (settings, processes, and\n      outcomes) and by using data triangulation, we produce valid results that broaden our view on\n      mechanisms underlying recovery and enhance our understanding about their links to\n      psychological, behavioural and physiological outcomes, resulting in a more comprehensive\n      picture of work stress recovery in general."
