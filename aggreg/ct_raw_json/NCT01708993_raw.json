Each patient must sign a consent form prior to\n             enrollment in the trial to document their willingness to participate.\n\n        Patients who cannot give informed consent (i.e. mentally incompetent patients, or those\n        physically incapacitated such as comatose patients) are not to be recruited into the\n        study. Patients competent but physically unable to sign the consent form may have the\n        document signed by their nearest relative or legal guardian. Each patient will be provided\n        with a full explanation of the study before consent is requested.\n\n          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Patients registered on this\n             trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre.

Investigators must assure\n             themselves that the patients registered on this trial will be available for complete\n             documentation of the treatment, adverse events, response assessment and follow-up.\n\n          -  In accordance with NCIC CTG policy, protocol treatment is to begin within 5 working\n             days of patient randomization.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Patients with a history of other malignancies, except for adequately treated\n             non-melanoma skin cancer or solid tumours curatively treated with no evidence of\n             disease for > 3 years.\n\n          -  Patients who are on immunosuppressive therapy or have known HIV infection or active\n             hepatitis B or C.\n\n          -  Patients with active or uncontrolled infections or with serious illnesses or medical\n             conditions which would not permit the patient to be managed according to the\n             protocol.\n\n          -  Patients with significant cardiac (including uncontrolled hypertension) or pulmonary\n             disease, or active CNS disease or infection.\n\n          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to the study drug(s) or their components.\n\n          -  Patients with history of central nervous system metastases or untreated spinal cord\n             compression.\n\n          -  Patients who have neuropathy \u2265 grade 2 (patients planned for docetaxel Arms C and D\n             only).\n\n          -  Women must be post-menopausal, surgically sterile or use two reliable forms of\n             contraception while on study and for 6 months after discontinuing therapy. Women of\n             childbearing potential must have a pregnancy test taken and proven negative within 7\n             days prior to registration/randomization and must not be lactating.
