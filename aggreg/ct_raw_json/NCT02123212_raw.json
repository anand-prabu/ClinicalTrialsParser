Additional\n      data will be collected to assess linkage to care for those testing positive, feasibility,\n      and acceptance of the new strategy by medical staff, cost effectiveness, and patient impact.\n       The sites used three models to measure the net effect of change:\n\n      One site used study coordinators to actively screen and recruit patients who met the\n      inclusion criteria for birth-cohort screening. Study coordinators were located at two\n      internal medicine clinics, where they approached eligible participants in person. A control\n      group was pulled from an additional two internal medicine clinics, which screened using a\n      risk-based strategy.  A cluster randomized cross-over approach was used, so that the\n      intervention and control clinics switched at the midpoint of data collection, allowing all\n      four clinics to participate in both arms of the study.\n\n      A second site reached out directly to the patient using direct communication through the\n      mail. Mailers contained HCV guidelines, the importance of screening, laboratory slips and\n      locations for patients to act directly on their own behalf.  This site used simple\n      randomization of patients who used the health system in the past, met the definition of\n      birth-cohort membership (born during 1945 to 1965) and had not previously tested positive\n      for hepatitis C.  The patients received up to 5 mailings including prepaid, lab registration\n      forms that they were instructed to bring to an affiliated lab location for testing.\n\n      A third site implemented a physican best practice alert into the Epic electronic health\n      record system of their clinic setting.  This site had the pop-ups enabled for Medical\n      Assistants (MAs) who were asked to pend the lab to the order in the chart for the clinician.\n       When MAs open the chart of an arrived, untested patient, they are alerted to pend the\n      Hepatitis C antibody test order when entering patient vitals prior to the patient seeing the\n      physician. When the clinician subsequently opened the same patient chart, the lab order was\n      present in the orders section of the chart for signature and execution or deletion depending\n      on the circumstances of the patient encounter.  As a back-up pathway alerted the physician\n      directly in the event that the MA bypassed or did not open the prompt.  This alert details\n      the CDC recommendations for age-based screening and links to the proper Hepatitis C antibody\n      test order and diagnosis code for them to address with the patient.\n\n      This site used a cluster randomized experimental design in which physicians and MA's from\n      specific primary care practices were consented into the study.  Experimental clusters\n      received an education about HCV testing and the implemented best practice alert.  Control\n      clusters received only education about HCV testing."
