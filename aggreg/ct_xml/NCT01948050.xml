  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study designed to collect preliminary data on safety and efficacy of
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to relieve pain in cancer patients who
      developed neuropathic pain in the affected area after a surgical intervention, radiation
      therapy, or chemotherapy to treat the disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study that aims to determine the effect of repetitive tDCS stimulation,
      performed on five consecutive days at intensity of 2 mA, on pain and somatosensory
      abnormalities in patients with neuropathic pain that followed surgical, radiation or
      chemotherapeutic treatment, and to evaluate safety of tDCS in the same model.
