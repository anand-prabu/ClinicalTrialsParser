            "textblock": "Neuroblastoma is the most common tumour of childhood after brain tumours. Approximately half\n      of cases are high risk and despite extensive treatments outcome is very poor. More than 60%\n      of high risk patients suffer relapse or further spread of their disease and long-term\n      survival is below 10%. Existing imaging techniques are not sensitive enough to accurately\n      assess the level of risk which is critical in determining the best choice of treatment. This\n      study will compare a new type of imaging against the existing imaging techniques. The new\n      scans use a new tracer called [124I]mIBG which is taken up by the cancer tissue much more\n      than by normal tissues. This tracer can be used with a 3D imaging technique called PET/CT to\n      pinpoint where the disease has spread and quantify the amount of disease. Patients will be\n      those scheduled to have an [123I]mIBG scan for routine care during a planned break in\n      treatment."
