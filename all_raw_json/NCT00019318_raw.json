Determine the toxic effects and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of\n      depsipeptide in patients with incurable solid tumors (per 3/29/00 notification, only\n      patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma are being accrued). II. Determine antineoplastic\n      activity of depsipeptide in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive depsipeptide IV over\n      4 hours on days 1 and 5. Treatment continues every 21 days in the absences of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of\n      depsipeptide. If 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity at a given dose level,\n      escalation ceases and the maximum tolerated dose is defined as the previous dose level .\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 48 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24\n      months."
