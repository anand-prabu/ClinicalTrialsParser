The use of eflornithine may be an effective way to prevent the\n      development of prostate cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to determine the effectiveness of eflornithine in\n      preventing prostate cancer in patients who are at high risk of developing the disease."

Patients are\n      stratified according to age (35 to 60 vs 61 to 70) and presence of localized cancer (yes vs\n      no).\n\n      All patients receive oral placebo daily for 4 weeks. Patients who are compliant and take the\n      placebo 5-7 days each week are randomized to one of two arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral placebo daily.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive high-dose oral eflornithine (DFMO) daily. Treatment continues\n           for 1 year in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per arm) will be accrued for this study\n      within 3 years."
