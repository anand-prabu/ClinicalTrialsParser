            "textblock": "In this study, the investigators propose to develop a real-time adherence intervention based\n      on SMS (i.e., text messages), wireless adherence monitoring (with the Wisepill device), and\n      engagement of social support that is tailored to rural sub-Saharan Africa. The investigators\n      will build on research by others who have shown SMS reminders improve adherence and viral\n      suppression in Kenya, albeit with relatively small effect sizes and suboptimal virologic\n      failure rates even in the intervention arm. Moreover, little is known about which patients\n      benefit from SMS, why they benefit, and what can be done to further improve adherence and\n      treatment success rates. Understanding the mechanisms of effect will make it possible to\n      design and test evidence-based interventions with the highest likelihood for efficacy.\n\n      In a cohort of HIV-infected individuals starting ART and being monitored with Wisepill, the\n      investigators will test 1) daily SMS reminders, 2) weekly SMS reminders, 3) SMS reminders\n      linked to real-time detection of missed doses, and 4) SMS reminders plus SMS notifications\n      of 48+hour gaps in adherence to members of social support networks. The investigators will\n      conduct qualitative interviews to learn the experiences of participants and members of their\n      social support networks with the different types of SMS. This staged approach will allow us\n      to fully understand and compare the additive effects and acceptability of SMS-based\n      interventions. The investigators will also determine behavioral effect mechanisms, as well\n      as compare the impact of each type of SMS with a control population receiving only Wisepill\n      monitoring on adherence and HIV RNA."
