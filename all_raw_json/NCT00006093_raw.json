Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 6-12 patients receive escalating doses of EMD 121974 until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which more than 2\n      of 6 or 4 of 12 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined,\n      additional patients are treated at the MTD.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 6 patients will be accrued for phase I of this study within\n      2-3 months. A total of 23-38 patients will be accrued for phase II of this study within 5-10\n      months."
