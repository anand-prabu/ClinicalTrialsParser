Hemorrhagic fluid and fibrin\n      together may cause adhesion formation and therefore postoperative ileus, retardation in\n      regaining the gastrointestinal functions as well as prolongation of the operation itself.\n      Dragging the uterus out of the abdominal cavity during cesarean section before removing the\n      placenta (extra-abdominal removal of the placenta) may decrease the amount of blood flowing\n      into the abdominal cavity during removal of placenta. In this study the investigators aimed\n      to evaluate the influence of intra abdominal vs extra abdominal removal of placenta on\n      duration of operation, the amount of aspirated fluid during the operation, difference\n      between postoperative hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, postoperative pain score, additional\n      need of analgesia, postoperative bowel movements, postoperative endometritis and wound\n      infection."
