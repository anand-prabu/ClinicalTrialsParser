The standard for monitoring hemoglobin (Hb) is the\n      measurement of blood samples. The novel technique of non-invasive continuous measurement of\n      Hb using Pulse CO-Oximetry may allow measuring Hb without obtaining blood samples.\n\n      This new technique has not been tested yet in children undergoing anesthesia for elective\n      surgical  procedures. In this study the investigators compare the non-invasive Hb\n      measurement with Masimo\u00ae technology (SpHb) with the standard Hb measurement using ABL-800\n      Flex (BGA) and Siemens Advia (labHb, reference method) before the children undergo the\n      surgical procedure."
