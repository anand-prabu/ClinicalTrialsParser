Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicity of dolastatin\n      10 in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast phase, refractory or relapsed\n      acute leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndromes. II. Assess the possible antileukemia effect of\n      this treatment in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive dolastatin 10 intravenous (IV)\n      bolus once every 3 weeks. Patients receive 2-12 courses of therapy in the absence of disease\n      progression and unacceptable toxicity. In the absence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the\n      first cohort of 3 patients, subsequent cohorts of 3 patients each receive escalating doses\n      of dolastatin 10. If DLT occurs in 2 of 3 patients at a given dose level, then dose\n      escalation ceases and the next lower dose is declared the maximum tolerated dose. Patients\n      are followed until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue up to 25 patients within 8 months."
