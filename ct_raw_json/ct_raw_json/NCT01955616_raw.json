The study will look at how well RM-131 affects the frequency of spontaneous bowel\n      movements over a 14-day period. The study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of\n      the study drug and evaluate whether the study drug relieves the uncomfortable GI symptoms\n      related to chronic constipation in patients who are unsatisfied with other therapies they\n      have tried for constipation."
