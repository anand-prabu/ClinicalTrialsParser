A survey will be sent to these individuals to\n      assess their knowledge and understanding of frozen embryos and if they would be interested\n      in embryo donation.\n\n      The second phase of research will randomize these patients into two groups: control and\n      intervention.  The control groups will receive their standard of treatment regarding frozen\n      embryos, which consists of receiving a yearly storage bill.  The intervention group will\n      receive a letter from their physician of record and a follow up phone call from a research\n      assistant offering the opportunity to schedule a consult with a licensed social worker at\n      Boston IVF.  The consult is meant to serve as a chance to discuss the difficult decision\n      around embryo disposition.  The consult for these patient will be free of charge, covered\n      with funds from our grant. Additional enhanced support services and educational services\n      provided by embryologists, nurses and physicians in the Frozen Embryo Donation Service will\n      be offered. These enhanced services will also be free of charge to subjects.\n\n      The third phase of the study includes the mailing of a letter to a random sample of patients\n      with embryos frozen in storage at Boston IVF. This letter will be an invitation to contact\n      Boston IVF to schedule a consult with a licensed social worker to discuss embryo disposition\n      options.  The consult for these patient will be free of charge, covered with funds from our\n      grant."
