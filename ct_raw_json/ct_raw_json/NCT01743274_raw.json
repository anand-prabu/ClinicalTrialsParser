In particular, we will evaluate the impact of changes in procedural strategy\n      resulting from the use of OCT on the value of fractional flow reserve (FFR) obtained after\n      angioplasty and stent implantation of a lesion responsible for non-ST segment elevation\n      acute coronary syndromes."
