Cytokine plasmatic elimination with\n      continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) presents frequent complications, known as\n      \"dialytrauma\", and a high resource cost both technical and human. The study primary\n      end-point is to demonstrate a non-inferiority survival of continuous venovenous hemodialysis\n      (CVVHD) plus an adsorption  membrane respect to CVVH plus an adsorption membrane. As\n      secondary end-points investigators will try to demonstrate immunomodulation and technical\n      superiority of CVVHD respect to CVVH. In order to achieve these objectives investigators\n      have designed a randomized controlled trial that will include those patients whom present\n      severe sepsis and AKI meeting CRRT initiation criteria. During the first 72 hours\n      investigators will measure plasmatic elimination capacity of main cytokines,\n      lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and other clinical and prognostic relevant molecules.\n      Investigators will also measure hemodynamic, respiratory, and metabolic parameters. Adverse\n      effects related to CRRT (\"dialytrauma\") will also be registrated. Finally, investigators\n      will analyze 90 days survival. Demonstration of a non inferiority survival added to a\n      superior immunomodulating capacity and a minor complication rate with its consequent lower\n      cost, should settle the based evidence principles that recommend the use of CVVHD asociated\n      to an adsorption membrane in severe septic patients with AKI whom need CRRT."

            "textblock": "Investigators will warrant a correct protocol application. Study data will be reviewed by an\n      external monitoring committee from the clinical assay research central unit (UCICEC -\n      IDIBELL). Monitors will contrast registered data from the collection data form (CDF) with\n      data from patient\u00b4s medical record. All patient\u00b4s medical records will be indefinitely saved\n      in electronical format to be reviewed if necessary.\n\n      Patients who meet inclusion criteria will be randomized for one of both arms with aleatory\n      assignation using a randomisation sequential (RndSeq) program for Statistical Package for\n      the Social Sciences (SPSS). Adverse events will be reported (in less than 24 hours if\n      severe) to the sponsor center to be properly evaluated. If the severe adverse event (SAE) is\n      finally evaluated by the study board as related to the intervention arm, urgent notification\n      to health authorities must proceed and study should be interrupted until further decision.\n\n      Sample size assessment has been calculated to provide a power of 80% at a significance level\n      of 0.05 to detect a non inferiority survival at 90 days. Assuming a severe sepsis and/or\n      septic shock 50% survival in our community, investigators determined that 100 patients\n      population size, 50 patients in each arm, would be enough to demonstrate the primary outcome\n      measure.\n\n      Missing data will try to be avoided by an exhaustive patient\u00b4s follow up by study\n      investigators. Intention to treat analysis (ITT) will be the main strategy and statistical\n      substitution techniques for missing data will be applied when necessary. Per protocol\n      analysis will also be done to avoid possible bias in this non inferiority study.\n      Out-of-range results will be identified and processed with adequate statistical techniques.\n\n      Data registry has been created to include all variables with written individual data\n      collection forms (DCF). Data will be bedside registered by the study members but final\n      software database registration will be done by the statistics outside investigator who has\n      no contact with patients situation. Cytokines and LPS levels will be introduced in DCF when\n      measured (every six months).\n\n      Statistical analysis will be done by the statistics investigator who wont have any role in\n      patient\u00b4s selection, randomization, or follow up. SPSS v. 18.0 for statistical analysis will\n      be used. Variable distribution will be studied and logarithmic transformation will be used\n      on those variables that don't present normal distribution, presumably cytokine and LPS\n      levels. Univariate analysis comparing clinical, demographic, biochemical, metabolic,\n      hemodynamic and respiratory baseline variables between both arms (CVVHD-ST150 and\n      CVVH-ST150), will be done with two-tailed t test for continuous variables and chi-square\n      test for categorical variables. Variables determined several times (T0, T24, T48, T72) will\n      be analysed using a one-way repeated measures ANOVA test in order to demonstrate differences\n      between both arms. Multivariate analysis will be completed to control those clinically\n      relevant confounding variables as well as to discover baseline differences. According to\n      hypothesis and to the dependent variable on study investigators will use a survival analysis\n      (to study mortality) with a cox regression model, or a hierarchic multiple linear regression\n      model when the dependent variable is continuous (for example dialytrauma score). Arm\n      intervention (CVVHD, CVVH) will be considered as the main independent variable adding other\n      control independent variables.\n\n      As the study is measuring cytokine and LPS levels in five different moments (T0, T24, T48,\n      T72), in order to maximize statistical power and reduce control variables number, the area\n      under the curve (AUC) we\u00b4ll be determined for every cytokine and LPS during the first 72\n      hours. Due to this statistical maneuver investigators will obtain a continuous variable that\n      represents each cytokine-LPS level during the biochemical study period (72 hours). To\n      evaluate if the arm intervention improvement in terms of efficacy and safety could be\n      related to cytokine and/or LPS levels during the first 72 hours, a mediation complementary\n      analysis will be done considering cytokine-LPS (represented by AUC) as a mediator between\n      the independent variable (intervention arm) and the effect we study.\n\n      Data dictionary.
