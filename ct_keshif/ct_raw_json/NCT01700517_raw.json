            "textblock": "Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a worldwide realized procedure, with 600.000 surgeries\n      performed per year in the United States, with a 673% increase estimated until 2030.\n      Functional and pain management improvement is expected in 90% of patients, with 85% of them\n      satisfied after the procedure.\n\n      Immediate postoperatory pain control is an important aspect to be considered. Patients\n      submitted to TKA endure pain with variations between 40-80 (according to analog visual scale\n      -AVS - which goes from zero to 100) during the immediate postoperatory, with slow decline in\n      the first 24 hours. Pain classified as severe occurs in 60% and moderated in 30% of patients\n      submitted to TKA during this period of time. Therefore adequate pain management allows an\n      earlier rehabilitation, with a higher satisfaction rate and decrease the hospitalization\n      period.\n\n      A multimodal control of pain can be reached by using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, COX-2\n      anti-inflammatory inhibitors, peripheral nerve blocks and intra-articular anesthetics\n      injections and decrease use of opioids given of potential collateral effects. Peripheral\n      blockings are associated to the smallest rate of collateral effects and complications when\n      compared to the spinal anesthesia and analgesia controlled by the patients. Studies\n      comparing the effects of the femoral and sciatic-femoral blocking guided by ultrasonography\n      for the analgesia control after TKA were not found.\n\n      The objective of this article is to evaluate the effect of femoral and sciatic-femoral block\n      using ultrasonography by the analog visual scale (AVS) of pain in postoperatory of patients\n      submitted to TKA, opioid consumption and complications associated to anesthesics procedures."

Patient and researcher did not know at which group patient belongs. This measurement was realized during immediate pre-op, and 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after surgery. After this the average of pain for each group was analyzed.",
