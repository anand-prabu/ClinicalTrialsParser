The maximum tolerated course is defined as\n      the course at which no more than 2 patients develop at least grade 3 dose-limiting toxicity\n      and no more than 1 patient develops at least grade 4 dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, every 3 months for 2 years, and then\n      every 6 months for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 8-32 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-3\n      years."
