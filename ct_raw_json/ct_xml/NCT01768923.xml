      To investigate the effect of two tight-control treatment strategies, aiming at 1) 2011
      American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) definition
      of remission compare with 2) minimal disease activity (Disease Activity Index in 28 joints
      [DAS28] &lt;2.6), on arterial stiffness in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred RA patients with active disease (DAS28 &gt;/=3.2), duration of symptoms less than 2
      years,  and are disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug naive will participate in this 1-year
      prospective, hospital-based, open-label, randomized, controlled trial.

      All participants will receive 1-year tight-control treatment. One hundred patients will be
      randomly assigned to two arms. Treatment will be adjusted according to a standardized
      protocol every 3-monthly aiming at remission defined by the 2011 ACR/EULAR definition (Group
      1, n=50, simplified disease activity score [SDAI] â‰¤3.3) or minimal disease activity (Group
      2, n=50, DAS28&lt;2.6).
