  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: the facet joints are an important pain generator in chronic neck pain. The
      beneficial effect of radio frequency treatment (RFD) of the cervical facet joints has been
      described in a Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) in patients with Whiplash Associated
      Disorders. In patients with degenerative neck complaints a positive effect has been
      described in observational studies. Given this positive effect performing a RCT of RFD in
      this patient population is indicated.

      Objective: to evaluate the effect of Radio Frequency treatment in patients with chronic
      degenerative neck pain.

      Study design: prospective, randomized, double blinded clinical trial. Study population:
      patients older than 25 years, referred to the University Pain Center of Maastricht and the
      Pain Center of Amphia hospital Breda, with chronic axial neck pain.

      Intervention: patients with at least 3 months of neck pain without radiation to the arm
      (only radiation beyond the shoulder) will be randomized in 2 groups. The first group (RFD +
      local anesthesia-group=intervention group) will receive RF treatment adjacent to the medial
      branch innervating the cervical facet joints after the application of bupivacaine 0.5 ml
      (0.25%). The second group (local anesthesia-group=control group) will only receive the
      application of 0.5 ml bupivacaine (0.25%) adjacent to the medial branch. The only difference
      between the two groups is the RF-denervation of the medial branches.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: the primary research question is to evaluate the extent of
      pain reduction induced by RF treatment (RFD + local anesthesia-group=intervention group)
      compared with the local anesthesia-group(control group.

      Following evaluation tools are used : Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), Patient global Impression
      of Change on a 7 point Likert Scale (PGIC), consumption of pain medication (MQS), Patient
      Specific Functional Scale, Quality of life scale (RAND 36), Hospital Anxiety and Depression
      scale (HADS), and Neck Disability Index (NDI, Dutch version).

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: Patients in the RFD + Local Anesthesia-group and Local Anesthesia-group will
      undergo a physical examination before and 6 weeks after the intervention, by an independent
      third party, this will be repeated at 3 and 6 months if abnormalities are observed. At each
      of these time points the patients will receive questionnaires to fill out. A puncture of a
      blood vessel is possible, diagnosed by injection of contrast, for which repositioning of the
      needle is needed. Should accidental intravascular injection of local anesthetic occur, the
      dose used is low and reports show that intravascular injection of  bupivacaine 2,5 mg does
      not pose clinical problems. The dura can be punctured; as a consequence contrast will flow
      in the cerebrospinal fluid. The procedure will be stopped and repeated after a few days. In
      theory a lesion of the nerve root is possible, but the needles are designed to avoid this,
      this complication has not been seen since more than 10 years. Up till now, a transient pain
      is occasionally described after the RF treatment. No hypesthesia or motor complications were
      reported. Since the risks of RF treatment are reported low and more related to needle
      placement there is no difference in risk and burden between the two treatment groups.
