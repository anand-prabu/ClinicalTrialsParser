  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weight loss maintenance is one of the biggest challenges in the treatment of obesity. The
      neurobiological mechanisms that are involved in successful weight loss maintenance and
      weight control are largely unknown.

      The broad aim of the study is to obtain a better understanding of alterations in mesolimbic
      reward pathways of obese people with and without successful weight loss maintenance.

      This will be achieved by integrating a functional neuroimaging (fMRI) with behavioral reward
      tasks and the modulation of the dopamine level by dopamine depletion.
