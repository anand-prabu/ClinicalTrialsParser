We usually give emphasis on the skin manifestations\n      (melanosis and keratosis) of arsenicosis that is diagnosed first. Other manifestations\n      remain un-diagnosed or diagnosed later. The severe form is the development of cancer in\n      different organs mainly skin, lungs and urinary bladder. To understand the pathophysiology\n      of the development of clinical manifestations appearing in the skin first, we need to\n      understand interior of cells other than skin. One of the dietary supplements, vitamin E is\n      found to be effective in improving the clinical signs/symptoms of melanosis and keratosis.\n      Buccal cells are also exposed to arsenic and easy to collect. To understand the\n      pathogenesis, we need to know the levels of vitamin E in patients of arsenicosis and if\n      changes, what happens when supplemented with vitamin E. The buccal cells and serum of 20\n      patients will be collected for the estimation of vitamin E both before and after\n      supplementation with vitamin E (200 IU, caplet) daily orally for 20 weeks. Similar samples\n      will be collected from 20 arsenic exposed controls and 20 healthy volunteers for comparison."
