III.\n      Evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with this treatment regimen in\n      these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral R115777 twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28\n      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed\n      every 6 months for 2 years and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-50 patients will be accrued for this study."
