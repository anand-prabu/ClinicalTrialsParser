  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Men who present with erectile dysfunction as defined as an IIEF (International Index of
      Erectile Function) score less than 21 will be evaluated for risk factors for cardiovascular
      disease (CVD).  This is a single-blind study. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion
      for treatment (ARM 1) versus placebo (ARM 2).  Adipose tissue (fat) will be harvested from
      all patients and stem cells will be cultured.  For those patients in the placebo arm the
      stem cells will be frozen for later use after one year when the patients cross over into the
      treatment arm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Baseline assessment of patients will include completion of 6 questionnaires, EKG
      (electrocardiogram), vision testing using a standard eye chart, markers of endothelial
      dysfunction hormone evaluation, laboratory blood tests, vital signs, penile ultrasound
      (optional), echocardiogram, chest x-ray,  and endothelial function assessment (Endopat).

      The adipose tissue sample is sent to Celltex's state-of-the-art laboratory in Houston,
      Texas.  For those subjects in the placebo arm, the stem cells will be frozen for later use
      after one year when the patients cross over into the treatment arm. The subject (patient)
      will receive an infusion of either autologous stem cells (cells made from his own fat
      tissue) or placebo every 2 weeks for 3 months.  Placebo will be in the form of normal
      saline.  Subjects will be closely monitored every two weeks for first 3 months and once the
      treatment is complete, subjects will be monitored every 3 months for the first year.   Each
      of the previously mentioned tests will be performed at the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month mark.
      However, the penile ultrasound (optional) and the echocardiogram will be performed only at
      the 3 and 12 month mark.
