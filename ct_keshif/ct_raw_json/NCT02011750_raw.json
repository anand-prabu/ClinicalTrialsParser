Specifically,\n      the study will test the provocative results from animal studies indicating an impact of\n      Toxoplasma Gondii (TOX) exposure on novelty seeking.  The study will also test whether\n      exposure to TOX is associated with other cognitive and behavioral changes, as well as\n      changes in overall social function.  We will also explore the relative efficacy of Sodium\n      Valproate (Depakote, DEP) in improving clinical and overall social function among TOX\n      exposed and unexposed patients.\n\n      Hypotheses\n\n        1. At baseline, TOX exposure is associated with increased novelty seeking, clinical\n           severity, and impaired cognitive and overall social function in patients with SZ.\n\n        2. Adjunctive DEP treatment improves clinical symptoms, cognitive and social function in\n           SZ, particularly among TOX exposed SZ patients.\n\n        3. Exploratory hypothesis: adjunctive DEP reduces serological indices of TOX infection\n           (VIP and TH levels)."
