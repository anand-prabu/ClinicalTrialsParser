    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label, randomized, parallel group, dose finding study to
      evaluate safety and efficacy of recombinant human luteinizing hormone (r-hLH, LHadi®),
      compared with urinary human chorionic gonadotrophin (u-hCG, Profasi®), both given
      subcutaneously, in inducing ovulation in infertile women undergoing stimulation of
      follicular growth with recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (r-hFSH, Gonal-F®).
