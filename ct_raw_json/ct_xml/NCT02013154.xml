             to (≥) 50 mL/min using the Cockcroft and Gault Method

                  receiving anticoagulation therapy, if receiving anticoagulation therapy,
                  eligibility will be based upon the international normalised ratio(INR) as
                  follows):

             participants is not required.

          -  Symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) malignancy or metastasis. Participants with
             treated CNS metastases are eligible provided their disease is radiographically
             stable, asymptomatic, and they are not currently receiving corticosteroids and/or
             anticonvulsants. Radiation must have been completed at least 14 days prior to study
             entry. Screening of asymptomatic participants without a history of CNS metastases is
             not required

          -  Clinically significant peripheral neuropathy at the time of registration

          -  Known osteoblastic bony metastasis. Screening of asymptomatic participants without a
             history of metastatic bony lesions is not required

          -  Treatment with surgery or chemotherapy within 28 days prior to study entry (42 days

             investigator, poses an increased risk to the participant
