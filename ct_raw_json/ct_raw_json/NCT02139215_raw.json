The secondary objectives are to confirm survival data, to assess the quality of\n      life of patients and to assess the health care resource utilization of patients.\n\n      Patients with a mutated KRAS gene will be treated with standard-of-care (SOC) and patients\n      with a non-mutated (wild type) KRAS gene will be treated with panitumumab.\n\n      During the course of the study, data will be collected on quality of life and work\n      productivity. Patients will be asked to fill a set of questionnaires at their recruitment in\n      the study and at every 3 months after treatment initiation."
