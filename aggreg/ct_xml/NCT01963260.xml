  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to assess the safety and tolerability of single
      rising doses of MK-8723 in healthy adult participants and adult participants with chronic
      immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) and to assess pharmacodynamics of MK-8723 in
      participants with ITP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Part 1 of the trial, safety and pharmacokinetics of MK-8723 will be evaluated in healthy
      participants. In Part 2 of the trial, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics will be
      evaluated among participants with ITP. In Part 1, dose escalation will occur in up to 5
      serial panels of partcipants (Panels A, B, C, D, and E); each participant will receive a
      single intravenous (IV) dose of MK-8723 (or placebo). In Part 2, dose escalation will occur
      in up to 3 serial panels of participants with ITP (Panels F, G and H); each participant will
      receive a single IV dose of MK-8723 (or placebo), once safety and tolerability of the
      corresponding dose is shown in Part 1.
