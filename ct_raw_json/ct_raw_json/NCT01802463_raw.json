Numerous Doppler studies have shown a decrease in\n      flow velocities in the retrobulbar arteries in what appears to be related to the degree of\n      the glaucomatous disease.\n\n      The anatomic pathway of the several arteries into the eye is intricately complicate, with at\n      least one of them (the central retina artery) penetrating the optic nerve before entering\n      the eye and supplying the innermost structures of the globe. As the optic nerve is\n      surrounded by a layer of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which is in continuity with the rest of\n      the central nervous system, this central retinal artery has also to cross this CSF\n      containing compartment. Because of the intrinsic pressure this CSF - corresponding to the\n      intracranial pressure at the orbital level - the possibility exists that this pressure\n      around the optic disc could affect the blood flow of the arteries that go through it.\n\n      The investigators will try to detect if a correlation exists between the optic nerve sheath\n      diameter and the blood flow in the retrobulbar vessels of glaucoma patients."
