    <textblock>
      Prematurity is a very important problem in this country. Prematurity can cause problems with
      organ (such as the brain, heart, kidneys) growth and development. A very important part of
      keeping premature babies healthy is ensuring good blood flow to all of these organs.

      Some premature babies have problems with their hearts and getting enough blood out to the
      rest of their bodies. This problem is referred to as hypotension (low blood pressure) and is
      found by looking at blood test values and while examining the baby. These babies will need
      medications to help their heart deliver blood to all of the important areas in their bodies.

      Babies who have hypotension requiring medications tend to have more problems than premature
      babies that don't need hypotension medication. Some of these problems include a higher risk
      of bleeding into their brain, kidney problems, liver problems, intestinal (gut) problems
      causing difficulty tolerating feeds, and a very dangerous infection of their intestines.
      Some long term effects include hearing loss, developmental delay, and learning problems in
      the future that are worse than other premature babies who did not have hypotension.
      Hypotensive premature babies also have a higher risk of death.

      The cause of hypotension in the first week of life is still not known. We know that babies
      have to get used to being in the outside world instead of in the womb. A lot of changes with
      the heart and lungs have to happen for them to not be affected by that transition. If we
      could gain a better understanding of those changes, we might be able to prevent some of
      these issues from happening.

      This study will look closely at premature babies with and without hypotension to assess the
      heart and lung changes in the first week of life. To do this, we will use monitoring
      machines and tests to get a better idea of all the changes that happen. This information
      will help all neonatologists who care for premature babies.

      Screening Phase: The subject's parents/guardians/LAR will be approached if the infant's
      birth weight makes them eligible for this research study.

      Study Phase: During this study, we will use the monitoring methods normally used in the
      Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and some new monitoring methods to find out all the
      changes that the infant's heart and lungs go through during the first week after delivery.
      During this period the study doctor and staff will:

        1. Collect demographic (age, race, ethnicity) and labor/delivery information.

        2. Perform serial physical exams to evaluate the infant's skin. We will take pictures of
           the infant's skin to monitor changes over the course of the study.

        3. Measure the temperature of the infant's chest area (routine practice) and compare it to
           the temperature in his/her toe (for research study) using special probes.

        4. Take several blood samples (2-3 drops per sample) to measure the lactate levels. This
           blood sample will be taken 4 times a day.

        5. Perform Echocardiograms (ultrasound of the heart) on a daily or more frequent
           basis.This test is being done solely for research purposes and will be paid for by the
           study.

        6. Measure the amount of blood flow reaching the infant's brain and kidneys using a
           near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) machine. This test is being done solely for research
           purposes and will be paid for by the study.

        7. Perform Electrocardiograms (ECGs) to monitor how much blood flow is reaching the
           infant's heart. The sticky pads required for this test will be attached to the infant's
           chest as part of his/her routine care. For the purposes of this study, we will
           continuously monitor the machine to record the results.

        8. Record results from any other monitoring tools the infant's doctor is using as part of
           his/her routine care. This will help us identify patterns that might lead to issues in
           premature babies. We will also be studying the effects of any medications the infant's
           doctor prescribes; especially those used for low blood pressure.

        All ELBW infants are eligible for enrollment. There will not be a placebo group. Instead,
        those infants who require treatment for hypotension will be coded as such and those who do
        not require treatment for hypotension will be considered the control group.
