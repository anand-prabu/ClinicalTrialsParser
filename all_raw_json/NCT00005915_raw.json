This does not always happen. Sometimes anti-HIV\n      drugs work at first but then stop working. When most of the usual anti-HIV drugs no longer\n      seem to work, the virus is called multidrug-resistant (MDR). This study will compare 2\n      treatment plans to try to increase the effects of anti-HIV drugs in patients with MDR virus."

Two strategies currently\n      being used are (1) STI followed by a new antiretroviral regimen and (2) immediate initiation\n      of a new antiretroviral regimen.\n\n      Patients are screened for the presence of MDR virus and a plasma HIV RNA level greater than\n      10,000 [AS PER AMENDMENT 07/03/01: greater than 5,000] copies/ml. Eligible patients attend a\n      baseline visit [AS PER AMENDMENT 07/03/01: and a subsequent randomization visit] where the\n      qualifying GART results are provided. Patients who consent to participate have phenotypic\n      antiretroviral resistance testing (PART) done on a specimen from the same blood draw that\n      was used for the GART evaluation. After PART results are available, patients are randomized\n      [AS PER AMENDMENT 07/03/01: If the predicted sensitivities are not available for some or all\n      drugs included in the PART, the patient may still be randomized.] to either a 4-month STI\n      followed by a new antiretroviral regimen or an immediate new antiretroviral regimen. The\n      antiretroviral regimens chosen are based on the patients'  history and both GART and PART\n      results. [AS PER AMENDMENT 07/03/01: Additional GART and PART may be requested after at\n      least 4 months of antiretroviral treatment.] Patients have the follow-up data collection\n      done at Months 1-8 and every 4 months thereafter. Changes in antiretroviral therapy, Grade 4\n      adverse experiences, progression of disease, and deaths are reported as they occur. Patients\n      are seen for clinical management as often as deemed necessary. All patients are followed to\n      a common closing date estimated to be 24 months after the last patient is randomized. Some\n      patients may participate in a Point Mutation Substudy [AS PER AMENDMENT 07/03/01: Plasma\n      Point Mutation Substudy and PBMC Point Mutation Substudy]."
