  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low medication adherence in patients with coronary heart disease increases mortality.

      This study investigates if an intervention of medication review and counselling can improve
      patients' medication adherence and treatment results.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the effects of medication review and Motivational Interviewing
      (MI) on patients with Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). Clinical pharmacists competent in MI and
      cardiology will conduct medication interviews and medication reviews at the outpatient
      clinic. The intervention will continue during 9 months, with interviews and reviews as
      needed.

      Follow-up of results will take place 16 months after inclusion (corresponding to 4 months
      after the end of intervention).

      The MI-Component will be quality assured by MITI 3.1-coding (Motivational Interviewing
      Treatment Integrity). The study will investigate effects on clinical outcomes, medication
      adherence, patients´ beliefs about medicines, quality of life and health economics.

    <description>The intervention starts three months post-discharge after the standard treatment at the out-patients clinic. A medication review focused on cardiovascular drugs, and a counselling session with a clinical pharmacist using Motivational Interviewing (MI)-approach, and a follow-up phone call two weeks later. For patients with negative beliefs about medicines, three additional MI-sessions in clinic or by phone are planned together with the patient. Irrespective of beliefs the intervention ends with a second medication review and counselling session, which is coordinated with the 12-months post-discharge follow-up in primary care.</description>
