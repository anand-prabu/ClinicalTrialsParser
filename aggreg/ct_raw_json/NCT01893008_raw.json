Postoperative complications\n      can result in prolonged hospital stay and increased health care costs. In cardiac surgery\n      patients a reduction of postoperative pneumonia of 50% is reported as a result of a\n      preoperative inspiratory muscle training program. While in some surgical centers IMT is\n      already used in the preoperative phase in patients undergoing esophageal resection, the\n      effect of this promising intervention has not yet been investigated in a randomised and\n      controlled study design in large surgical populations other than cardiac surgery.\n\n      Primary objective: Investigate the effect of a preoperative inspiratory muscle training\n      program on the incidence of postoperative pneumonia in patients undergoing esophageal\n      resection.\n\n      Study design: Prospective multicenter randomised controlled clinical trial.\n\n      Main study parameters/endpoints: A significant reduction in incidence of postoperative\n      pneumonia."

When patients score an RPE below 7, patients increase the inspiratory load of the threshold device with 5%  to guarantee overload during each training session. Patients have to complete 30 dynamic inspiratory efforts twice daily.\nPatients will be instructed to train at home 7 days a week until surgery with a minimum of 2 weeks.\nTraining will be started after the chemoradiation period (if applicable).",
