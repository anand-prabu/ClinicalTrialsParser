  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) reaches more than 50% in chronic heart
      failure patients (CHF). The main consequence is an increase risk of fatal and non-fatal
      cardiovascular events. A treatment by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or
      adaptative servo-ventilation (ASV) reduces this risk. Nevertheless, 75% of severe SDB cases
      remains undiagnosed and untreated especially due to cost and time delay for polysomnography
      examination which is the gold standard for SDB diagnosis. Indeed, alternative methods are
      developed. Some methods, based on nocturnal ECG analysis showed promising results but they
      are not validated and adapted for cardiac population. Thus, the goal of present study is to
      test the accuracy of ECG derived respiration signal to screen SDB in a CHF population.
