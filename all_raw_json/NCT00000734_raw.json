Also to determine whether\n      the pharmacokinetics of AZT is changed when trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SMX/TMP) is given\n      at the same time, or whether the pharmacokinetics of SMX/TMP is altered by AZT given at the\n      same time.\n\n      AZT has been effective in treating HIV infection in some patients with AIDS, and SMX/TMP is\n      an antibiotic combination which is useful in preventing or treating Pneumocystis carinii\n      pneumonia (PCP). It is important to know how drugs interact in patients because addition of\n      a second drug may change the speed at which a drug is eliminated from the body, and cause\n      increased toxic effects or decreased therapeutic effects."

Blood samples are drawn 10-20 times over a period of 12 hours and urine is collected\n      for 36 hours. Concentrations of the drugs in the blood and urine samples are determined.\n      This sequence is repeated twice, so that each patient takes AZT alone, SMX/TMP alone, and\n      the combination of AZT and SMX/TMP over a period of about 3 weeks. Patients may be included\n      in the study if they are asymptomatic, or have been diagnosed with ARC or AIDS, but not if\n      they have PCP or any other severe opportunistic infection."
