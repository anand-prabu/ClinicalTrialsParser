This is a serious health concern since\n      children who are overweight or obese are prone to other medical conditions including high\n      blood pressure, abnormal lipid profiles,and  type 2 diabetes.  Although exercise and\n      nutrition programs are recommended, evidence for the efficacy of these programs in improving\n      cardiovascular health is lacking.\n\n      Specific Aims: a) improve cardiovascular risk factors, b) increase physical fitness levels,\n      c) improve lean body mass, d) enhance QOL of the child e) influence adherence rates to\n      exercise and a healthy lifestyle change both during and beyond the conclusion of the\n      program.\n\n      Hypothesis 1a:  Compared to baseline and matched controls, children randomized to a 10 week\n      multidisciplinary fitness and nutrition program will show significant improved levels of\n      cardiovascular risk factors.\n\n      Specific Aim 2:  To determine if a multidisciplinary fitness and nutrition program, when\n      compared with a matched, WLC group will show a change in whole body assessment including a\n      decrease in fat mass, an increase in percent lean body mass, and a decrease in percent body\n      fat, as measured utilizing dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry Hypothesis 2a: Compared to\n      baseline and matched controls, children randomized to a 10 week multidisciplinary fitness\n      and nutrition program will show improved whole body assessments including.\n\n      Specific Aim 3:To determine if a multidisciplinary fitness and nutrition program, when\n      compared with a WLC group will show improved levels of fitness. Hypothesis 3a: Compared to\n      baseline and matched controls, children randomized to a 10 week multidisciplinary fitness\n      and nutrition program will show significant improvements in fitness including."
