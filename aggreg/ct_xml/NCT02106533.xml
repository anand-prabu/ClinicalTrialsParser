  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that patients with coronary
      artery disease with lower aerobic fitness exhibit greater responsiveness on improving
      ventilatory efficiency after aerobic exercise training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Measurements of ventilatory efficiency during cardiorespiratory exercise testing typically
      expressed as the minute ventilation/ carbon dioxide production ratio have been validated to
      be useful in assessing the presence and severity of both heart and lung diseases.  In this
      context, previous studies have showed ventilatory inefficiency in patients with coronary
      artery disease suggests abnormalities in the distribution of ventilation and perfusion in
      the lungs. In addition, a growing body of studies has demonstrated that lower ventilatory
      efficiency during exercise is considered an important predictor of risk mortality,
      hospitalization, and other outcomes than peak VO2.

    <description>The exercise training program was comprised of three 60-minute exercise sessions per week over a 3-month period.  Each exercise session consisted of a 5 minute warm up, 30-50 minutes of aerobic exercise performed on a treadmill and 5 minutes of cool-down exercises. Aerobic exercise intensity was set at the corresponding heart rate between the VAT and RCP.</description>
