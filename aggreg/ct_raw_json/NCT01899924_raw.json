            "textblock": "In order to test the relevance of theoretical models of cognitive functions, examination of\n      patients with cerebral lesions is of great interest. Thus, the goal of this study is to\n      assess cognitive processing in patients by a combination of behavioural clinical tests and\n      ERP (event related potentials) specific markers. Indeed, ERP technique makes it possible to\n      ascertain that a  patient or  control subject has or has not performed the task we asked him\n      to even if the subject performs the task covertly. From these ERPs markers, we can\n      investigate their respective cortical generators. By comparing the results obtained in both\n      healthy and pathological populations, we will be able to appreciate differential processing\n      of the same stimuli by two different populations and try to correlate these differences with\n      specific cerebral lesions and with different outcomes.We previously demonstrated the\n      relevance of this approach in the field of disorders of consciousness patients and we\n      project to enrich this specific approach by the addition of new markers and by its extension\n      to other fields of cognitive and behavioural neurology.\n\n      The procedure will be the following. After obtaining  written informed consent, patients\n      will be examined clinically with dedicated specialized scales (for example the CRS-R for\n      disorders of consciousness patients). Then, we will probe event related potentials by\n      stimulating these patients with various stimuli embedded in  well-designed paradigms while\n      their scalp EEG will be recorded. Following different steps of signal processing the mean\n      ERPs according to conditions will be extracted and statistical analysis will be performed.\n      At one year from the recording, outcome will be collected and correlated with the obtained\n      ERPs."
