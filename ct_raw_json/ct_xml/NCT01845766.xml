  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesized that early exercise rehabilitation for patients with severe sepsis or septic
      shock would decrease their functional disability and cognitive impairment. We plan to enroll
      patients with severe sepsis and septic shock who admitted an urban teaching hospital in
      Seoul, South Korea via ER. We will randomize those subjects into the intervention group
      which will take a standardized rehabilitation with routine clinical care for sepsis and the
      control group which will take routine clinical care for sepsis. And, we plan to assess their
      functional activity using ADL, IADL and SF-36, and cognitive function using MMSE at the time
      of enrollment, 28 days, and 6 months later.

    <description>We will assess the functional activity with 0-11 score of 6 ADL(walking, dressing, bathing, eating, getting into and out of bed, toileting)  and 5 IADL(preparing a hot meal, shopping for groceries, making telephone calls, taking medicines, managing money). If the patient has a score 4 or more, the patient will be considered to have a severe functional disability.</description>
