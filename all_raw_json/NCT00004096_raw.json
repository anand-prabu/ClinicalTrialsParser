Determine the maximum\n      tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicities of this regimen in these patients. III.\n      Determine the response rate and survival of these patients after this treatment.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of vinorelbine. Patients receive carboplatin IV\n      over 30 minutes followed by vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment\n      repeats every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of vinorelbine until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 month.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-36 patients will be accrued for this study over 6-12\n      months."
