Open-label treatment for a second HAE attack will continue until\n      10 patients have been treated for an initial attack. Safety evaluations will be performed at\n      each subsequent ecallantide-treated attack as for the initial treated attack"

Participation in another clinical study during the 30 days prior to treatment\n\n          4. Any known factor/disease that might interfere with the treatment compliance, study\n             conduct, or result interpretation\n\n          5. Congenital or acquired cardiac anomalies that interfere significantly with cardiac\n             function.\n\n          6.
