In the first phase of this study, protamine titration assays\n      will be carried out on normal pooled plasma incubated with heparin in the laboratory.\n\n      Once the correct dose of protamine required to neutralize the heparin is established in the\n      laboratory, the second phase will begin. Herein, plasma samples from patients undergoing\n      cardiac surgery (with anticoagulation with two different commercial preparations of heparin)\n      will be evaluated for residual heparin (Anti-Xa and anti-IIa levels). Protamine titration\n      assays wil then be carried out in vitro to assess neutralization of heparin."
