Besides, there are difficulties for its clinical diagnosis, lack of\n      effectiveness in the treatment and not much evidence is found regarding invasive physical\n      therapy techniques in this population.\n\n      Purpose: To determine the efficacy of a single physical therapy intervention with deep dry\n      needling on latent and active myofascial trigger points in older adults with non-specific\n      shoulder pain.\n\n      Methods: Pilot Study, Single Blind Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial on 60 subjects aged\n      65 and over, will be diagnosed with nonspecific shoulder pain. The study will be approved by\n      the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the area. Sample will be recruited at their home\n      and at a care center, and randomly will be distributed in Experimental Group (n=30), which\n      will be received a session of Deep Dry Needling on an active and a latent Myofascial Trigger\n      Points of the infraspinatus muscle; and Control Group (n=30), receiving a session of Deep\n      Dry Needling only on an active Myofascial Trigger Point. A blind examiner will be evaluated\n      Pain Intensity, Pain Pressure Threshold (anterior deltoid; extensor carpi radialis brevis)\n      and Grip Strength, before, immediately after intervention and after a week of treatment."
