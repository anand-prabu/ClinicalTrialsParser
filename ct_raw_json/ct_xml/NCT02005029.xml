  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastroparesis (slow stomach emptying) is a common feature of Parkinson's Disease.  Levodopa
      (Sinemet), a common medication for Parkinson's Disease, can make gastroparesis worse.
      Gastroparesis effects how the levodopa is absorbed and used by the body.  This study will
      explore the possibility of using Erythromycin, a drug commonly used (off label) for
      gastroparesis, along with levodopa to determine if there is improved levodopa absorption and
      motor function.

      Participants will be required to make four visits for evaluation.  Visit 1 is a screening
      visit, participants will receive the study drug or a placebo during visits 2 and 3, and
      visit 4 is a follow up visit.  Participants will provide blood and urine samples during the
      visits.   Participants will also be required to complete questionnaires and a series of
      motor tests.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have a definitive diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease (per United Kingdom
             brain bank criteria), Hoehn and Yahr stage 1-3,

          -  must exhibit unequivocal levodopa responsiveness

          -  must be able to distinguish between the &quot;off&quot; versus &quot;on&quot; state

          -  Subjects must be on a stable dose of levodopa for at least 28 days prior to

             periods

          -  Subjects may be on concomitant therapy with Monoamine oxidase B inhibitors,
             entacapone, and amantadine, though the doses of these medications must have remained
             stable for at least 28 days prior to enrollment and must be expected to remain stable
             throughout both study periods.
