    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether nicotine levels increase with electronic cigarettes. It will
      also examine whether electronic cigarettes alter lung function tests. The study will obtain
      preliminary data on the medical effects of electronic cigarettes, with two different
      nicotine flavors, tabacco and tabacco with menthol, which are available for over the counter
      purchase.

      The elctronic cigarettes and juice used in this study is available for purchase through the
      internet. An investigational new drug application (IND) is not needed for this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized two-period cross-over study in which subjects who smoke greater than 10
      cigarettes will be instructed to quit smoking and use either Joye (Ego C brand) with an 18
      mg cartridge containing either a tobacco or tobacco mentholated flavor for one week. Prior
      to starting e-cig use we will collect one blood sample for nicotine/cotinine as a measure of
      overall nicotine expsoure. Subjects will use the devise for one week and at the end of
      approximately one week of use, we will assess nicotine/cotinine concentrations (before and
      5, 1015,20 and 30 minutes after the onset of ECIG use), pulmonary function tests (before and
      5 minutes after ECIG use), and subjective impressions of satisfaction. At the end of one
      week, subjects will be crossed over to the other condition and assessments will be repeated
      after another week of E-cigarette use.

      A total of 30 smokers will be recruited from the surrounding areas via advertisements in
      newspapers and radio advertisements and UCHC broadcast e-mail. Posters will be placed in
      clinical areas to recruit from physician practices. Current smokers are being proposed for
      three reasons: 1) we wish to determine whether nicotine levels from e-cigarettes rise to the
      levels of regular cigarettes when used by regular smokers; 2) we wish to determine if there
      are any differences seen in pulmonary function when a person switches from regular
      cigarettes to e-cigarettes; 3) we wish to evaluate the level of satisfaction that regular
      smokers have with e-cigarettes. All of these questions will have implications for later,
      more extensive studies of e-cigarettes, particularly in regard to their utility as a smoking
      cessation modality.

      Once a potential study subject calls and expresses interest in the study, preliminary
      inclusion criteria will be assessed over the phone. Inclusion criteria include 1) at least
      18 years of age; 2) current use of at least 10 cigarettes daily; 3) willing to abstain from
      cigarette smoking, and substitute e-cigs,  for approximately 2 weeks; 4) able to read and
      sign a consent form; Exclusion criteria: 1) unstable medical or psychiatric disorders as
      determined by the principal investigator; 2) pregnancy; 3) known hypersensitivity to
      nicotine or propylene glycol or menthol; 4) previous myocardial infarction (M.I.) or stroke;
      5) uncontrolled hypertension [Blood pressure (BP) &gt;160/100);  6) insulin dependent diabetes;
      7) known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma.
