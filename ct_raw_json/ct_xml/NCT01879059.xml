  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of physical inactivity on variations in blood glucose and vascular health are
      not fully understood.  The purpose of this study is to determine if an acute transition from
      physical activity to inactivity alters blood glucose homeostasis and measures of vascular
      health. Specifically, the investigators wish to examine in healthy, lean physically active
      individuals (obtaining greater than 10,000 steps/day) if decreasing physical activity
      (obtaining less than 5,000 steps/day) will alter blood flow following a meal, glycemic
      control, and a marker of vascular health.  Since the investigators know that high blood
      glucose or large changes in blood glucose following a meal is associated with decreased
      vascular health, the investigators also wish to determine if the changes in vascular health
      occur before or after changes in blood glucose following a meal.  Furthermore, the
      investigators wish to examine if a one day return to physical activity (obtaining &gt;10,000
      steps/day) can restore the detrimental effects on glycemic control, vascular health, and
      blood flow following a meal.  The investigators anticipate that physical inactivity will
      decrease glycemic control, vascular health, and blood flow following a meal.  Further, the
      investigators anticipate that with physical inactivity, the investigators will see
      impairments in glycemic control before the investigators see impairments in vascular health.
       Finally, the investigators expect that a one day return to physical activity will restore
      glycemic control, vascular health, and blood flow following a meal back to pre-inactivity
      levels.
