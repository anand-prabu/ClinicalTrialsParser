            "textblock": "Chronic kidney disease is associated with the accumulation of various metabolites, i.e.,\n      uremic retention solutes. Evidence is mounting that the colonic microbiome contributes\n      substantially to these uremic retention solutes. Indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate are\n      among the most extensively studied gut microbial metabolites, and are associated with\n      cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease progression and overall mortality. Colonic\n      transit time is an important determinant of intestinal generation and uptake of bacterial\n      metabolites. However, it is unknown if accelerating the colonic transit time reduces the\n      intestinal generation and uptake of indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate. Prucalopride is a\n      selective, high-affinity 5-HT4 receptor agonist with a stimulating effect on colonic\n      motility and transit. It is currently used in treating chronic slow-transit constipation. An\n      observational study will be initiated in non-chronic kidney disease patients with chronic\n      slow-transit constipation necessitating treatment with prucalopride to observe its effect on\n      serum concentrations and intestinal generation of indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate."
