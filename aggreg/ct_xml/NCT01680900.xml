  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to determine proof in principle that vilazodone, a selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitor and 5HT1a agonist, reduces the frequency and severity of menopausal hot
      flashes relative to placebo. A secondary aim is to evaluate improvement in menopause-related
      quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a proposal to conduct a small clinical trial for proof in principle that vilazodone
      reduces the frequency and severity of menopausal hot flashes.  An additional exploratory aim
      is to identify improvement in menopause-related quality of life. Healthy, perimenopausal
      women ages 45-60 with an average of 4 or more moderate or severe hot flashes/night sweats
      per day for 3 screening weeks will be randomized to 8 weeks of treatment in a 2:1 ratio of
      vilazodone or matching placebo pills. Flexible dosing of vilazodone will start at 10 mg
      once/day for 7 days, increase to 20 mg/day for 1 more week and increase to 40 mg once/day at
      week 3 if unimproved.  The primary outcome assessments are the frequency and severity of hot
      flashes at week 4 and week 8 as assessed by prospective daily diaries (using 7-day mean
      scores from the daily diaries).  The secondary outcome is clinical improvement, defined as
      hot flash frequency &gt;=50% decrease from baseline.   Treatment-emergent adverse events will
      be monitored and patient ratings of tolerability will be obtained.
