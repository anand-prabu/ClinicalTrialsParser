            "textblock": "Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a pre-neoplastic condition formed by the metaplasia of the\n      normal squamous mucosa of the distal esophagus into a specialized intestinal mucosa. Its\n      development is mostly associated with chronic injury from gastroesophageal reflux. BE is\n      widely considered the leading risk factor for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma\n      (EAC).\n\n      Volumetric laser endomicroscopy (VLE) can be thought of as an analogous technique to\n      ultrasound, however, instead of producing an image from the scattering of sound waves, it\n      utilizes optical scattering based on differences in tissue composition to form a\n      two-dimensional image.  The benefit of VLE over ultrasound is that it is capable of\n      generating cross-sectional images of tissues with an axial-resolution of up to 10\n      micrometers, which is comparable to low-power microscopy.\n\n      The proposed trial will evaluate the ability of physicians to use VLE to visualize high\n      grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) or intramucosal adenocarcinoma (IMC) in both the\n      ex-vivo and in-vivo setting and correlate those images to standard histology of endoscopic\n      mucosal resection specimens as the gold standard."

However, the\n      endoscopic recognition of early dysplasia in BE relies on the subjective visual recognition\n      by an endoscopist. The subtle mucosal variations and early dysplastic changes in the\n      esophagus may easily be missed. The development of a wide-field, high resolution endoscopic\n      microscopy could enhance the early detection and treatment of dysplasia in BE."
