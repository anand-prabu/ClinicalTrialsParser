The\n      dressing consists of 2 stable layers that when placed together release Nitric Oxide. In\n      preclinical studies NOx delivery has caused significant vasodilation, angiogenesis and\n      demonstrated potent anti-microbial activity.\n\n      In part 1 of the study, the dressing will be applied to up to 20 DFUs for a set period and\n      the blood flow in and around the wound will be measured before and after application of the\n      dressing. Any adverse events will be recorded.\n\n      If an increase in blood flow is seen and the dressing is well tolerated, part 2 will begin,\n      which is a multi-centre, 120 patient, randomised, controlled study. 60 patients with chronic\n      DFUs will be treated with the NOx generating dressing and 60 patients will continue to\n      receive standard of care. The efficacy and the tolerability of the dressing will be\n      measured.\n\n      The NOx dressing will be changed at least every 2 days and the standard of care changed as\n      in normal clinical practice.\n\n      At weekly clinical visits the diameter, area and volume of the wound will be measured. The\n      infective status of the wound will be assessed and the inflammatory profile of the wound\n      will be measured."
