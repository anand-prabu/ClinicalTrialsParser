NIR imaging will be acquired during these\n      manoeuvers and, if detected, fluorescent structures and/or foci will be anatomically defined\n      by the surgeons.\n\n      If (\"gross\" tumoral mass and/or) metastatic deposits are seen fluorescent, the operation\n      will be then continued as usual but each anatomical piece will be controlled \"ex vivo\" for\n      its fluorescent character or not. All fluorescent foci on these anatomical pieces will be\n      identified as such by a mark and/or by a \"suture\".\n\n      If (\"gross\" tumoral mass and/or) metastatic deposits are not seen fluorescent, ICG 0.125\n      mg/kg will be given as an iv injection and the vascularization, income of the ICG in the\n      tumoral implants (judged by the surgeon the most representative of the patient's status)\n      will be dynamically studied using the PDE camera during the 10 minutes following the IV\n      injection.\n\n      If no hepatic metastases were pre-operatively documented, the surface of the liver will be\n      controlled and, if superficial fluorescent foci are observed, these will be biopsied.\n\n      In the Laboratory of Pathology:\n\n      The tumoral tissues as well as -if identified- the \"non identified as tumoral\" fluorescent\n      tissular foci will be processed as usual.\n\n      All the slides obtained will be analyzed using the near-infrared fluorescence microscope for\n      the presence or the absence of (detectable) ICG and the different ICG-positive compartments\n      (vascular spaces, interstitial spaces, normal and/or tumoral cells, macrophages,\u2026) will be\n      determined."
