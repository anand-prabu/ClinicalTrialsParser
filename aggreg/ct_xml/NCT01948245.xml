  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the investigation is to compare two catheter lock solutions
      (TaurolockTMHep100 and Heparin 100 IE/ml), on the occurence of catheter related blood stream
      infection, in patients with intestinal failure and a central venous access device for home
      parenteral nutrition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with long-term intestinal failure are dependent on Home Parenteral Nutrition(HPN)
      delivered through a central venous access device(CVAD), placed as a subcutaneous tunneled
      catheter(Broviac). Catheter Related Blood Stream Infections(CRBSI) is a frequent
      complication leading to increased morbidity, hospital admissions, cost, and risk of repeated
      replacement of their tunneled catheter. The infections often originate from contamination of
      the catheter hub, and growth of microorganisms on the inner lumen of the catheter imbedded
      in a biofilm. To prevent infections good hygiene guidelines and the use of a catheter lock
      solution is applied.

      The primary objective is to compare two catheter lock solutions, TaurolockTMHep100 and
      Heparin 100 IE/ml, on the occurence of CRBSI. The secondary objectives are to compare the
      two devices according to other efficacy parameters, time to infection, cost and resource
      utility, tolerability and safety.

      Patients with a prior high risk of CRBSI will be included. Patients will instill the
      solution in their CVAD after each infusion of HPN, varying between minimum twice per week to
      once daily, depending on their individual HPN programme.

      Before the blinded randomization the patients will be paired according to gender, age and
      prior infection risk.

      Duration of the instillation will be 12 month or until outcome(CRBSI) accure.
