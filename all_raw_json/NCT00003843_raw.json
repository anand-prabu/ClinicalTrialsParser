Patients are stratified according to UGT1 genotype (homozygous for wild type\n      vs heterozygous for abnormal allele vs homozygous for abnormal allele).\n\n      Patients receive irinotecan over 90 minutes weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 6\n      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 28 patients will be accrued for this study."
