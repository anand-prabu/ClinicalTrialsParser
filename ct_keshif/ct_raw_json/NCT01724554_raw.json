Presence of any substantial ocular disease (other than diabetic retinopathy or\n             central retinal vein occlusion) that may compromise vision in the study eye and /or\n             confound interpretation of the data; e.g. substantial cataracts, advanced glaucoma,\n             optic neuritis, optic neuropathy or atrophy, marked macular atrophy, history of\n             retinal detachment, uveitis, viral or other forms of chorioretinitis, etc.\n\n          4. Active intraocular inflammation (grade trace or above) in the study eye, or history\n             of idiopathic or autoimmune-associated uveitis in either eye.\n\n          5. Uncontrolled glaucoma in the study eye (defined as intraocular pressure \u2265 25 mmHg\n             despite treatment with anti-glaucoma medication).\n\n          6. History of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or macular hole (Stage 3 or 4) in the\n             study eye.\n\n          7. Participation in a study of an investigational drug or device within 30 days prior to\n             potential enrollment into the study.\n\n          8. Intraocular surgery (including cataract surgery) in the study eye within 60 days\n             preceding baseline.\n\n          9. History of vitrectomy surgery in the study eye.\n\n         10. Subjects with 12 or more anti-VEGF injections within 24 months prior to Screening.\n\n         11. Subjects who received anti-VEGF therapy within 30 days of Screening or received\n             steroid or laser therapy within 90 days of Screening.\n\n         12. Subjects allergic to fluorescein, povidone iodine (Betadyne) or aflibercept\n\n         13. Pregnant or breast-feeding women."
