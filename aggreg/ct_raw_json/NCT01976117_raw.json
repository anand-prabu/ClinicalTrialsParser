Currently, diagnosis of bacterial\n      colonization relies mainly upon quantitative sputum culture. However, this method lacks good\n      sensitivity. The electronic nose is a novel device made up of nanosensors capable of\n      detecting specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs). OBJECTIVES: Main 1) To assess the\n      usefulness of the electronic nose  in the diagnosis of bacterial colonization in COPD.\n      Secondary 1) To define the VOCs pattern associated with bacterial colonization. 2) To study\n      the pattern of pulmonary and systemic inflammation associated with bacterial colonization as\n      well its relationship with the aforementioned VOCs  patterns."
