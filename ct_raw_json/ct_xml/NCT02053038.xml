  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Narrowing of coronary arteries interferes with blood flow and can cause chest pain. But
      patients may have more than one narrowing and studies have shown that not all narrowings
      need to be treated. To identify the narrowings that need treating cardiologists sometimes
      quantify the extent of the narrowing by measuring fractional flow reserve (FFR, the ratio of
      the pressure in the aorta to the pressure downstream of the narrowing).This technique
      requires the administration of drugs that add cost and time to the procedure and in some
      countries are simply unavailable. As a result despite the clear health and healthcare costs
      benefits of FFR its use is limited to less than 5% of procedure. We have developed a new
      technique called the instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) that does not require the
      administration of drugs for its accurate assessment. It has been approved for use in this
      indication. This study aims to compare clinical outcomes of patients whose treatment has
      been guided by iFR to those whose treatment has been guided by FFR. If iFR is found to
      provide the same clinical outcomes as FFR its adoption will permit the clear benefits of
      this approach of identifying the coronary narrowings that really need treatment to be
      applicable to a much larger patient population and further improve healthcare costs.
