The study will include a Screening period (40 days), Treatment\n      period (16 days) and a Follow-up period (26 to 30 days). A single dose will be administered\n      on Day 1 for characterization of single dose PK, followed by twice-daily (BID) or\n      thrice-daily (TID) dosing on Days 3 to 16. Subjects may only be randomized to one cohort per\n      the randomization schedule. Up to 6 cohorts will be enrolled using a sequential panel.\n      Subjects in Cohort 1 will receive GSK2140944 (6) and placebo (2). Subsequent cohorts will\n      enroll 16 subjects such that 12 subjects will receive GSK2140944 and 4 subjects will receive\n      placebo, per dose level according to the randomization schedule. Dose escalations are\n      planned to run in successive weeks. Cohort 2 may begin dosing once subjects in Cohort 1 have\n      completed 7 days of BID dosing, PK data is reviewed and safety data from at least 6 subjects\n      is available. Each subsequent dose escalation will commence only when GSK2140944 safety data\n      and available PK data of at least 12 subjects dosed at the previous dose level have been\n      reviewed. The number of cohorts may be reduced or expanded if needed. The first planned dose\n      is 400 milligram (mg) BID but may be modified based upon emergent PK, safety and\n      tolerability data from ongoing clinical study BTZ115198 evaluating single and repeat\n      intravenous (IV) doses of GSK2140944. The projected dose for Cohort 2 is 800 mg BID, Cohort\n      3 is 1500 mg BID, Cohort 4 is 2300 mg BID or 1500 mg TID and Cohort 5 and cohort 6 will be\n      decided later. The planned maximum dose is 2500 mg TID but may be modified based upon\n      emergent safety, tolerability and PK data. Doses of GSK2140944 or placebo will be\n      administered following a moderate fat meal."
