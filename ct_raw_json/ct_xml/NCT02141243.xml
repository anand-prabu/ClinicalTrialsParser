  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is comprised of two randomized control studies, one of which aims to contribute
      data to a previous study on the effects of ankyloglossia (tongue-tie) on breastfeeding, and
      the other aims to provide new information on the effects of maxillary lip-tie on
      breastfeeding. Participants who are determined eligible for the ankyloglossia study will be
      randomly assigned to either Group AnkA or Group AnkB. Group AnkA will receive a frenotomy
      procedure for intervention #1 and a sham procedure for intervention #2. Group AnkB will
      receive a sham procedure for intervention #1 and a frenotomy procedure for intervention #2.
      Mothers will be kept blinded and then asked to complete pain scale and LATCH surveys before
      and after intervention #1. Then, intervention #2 will take place, and then the mother will
      breastfeed again and complete the same surveys again. In addition to studying ankyloglossia,
      infants presenting with Class III and IV maxillary frena will be screened for and studied
      for their effect on breastfeeding in a separate study (maxillary lip-tie study) using
      similar techniques.

      Both these studies aim to prove that the simple and low risk frenotomy procedure should be
      considered as treatment for both ankyloglossia and maxillary lip-tie, preventing
      breastfeeding complications as well as many other future problems such as with speech and
      self esteem. It is expected to see an increase in LATCH score to &gt;7 for breastfeeding
      sessions and a significant decrease in scoring on the pain scale after frenotomy
      intervention, while it is expected to see little change in LATCH and pain scale assessment
      scores after sham procedures. Overall data is not expected to vary significantly between
      Group AnkA and Group AnkB or between Group Max A and Group Max B.

    <description>All participants will receive both the lingual frenotomy and the sham procedure. For Ankyloglossia A (AnkA) group, infants will receive lingual frenotomy for intervention #1 and then a sham procedure for intervention #2.
When receiving the lingual frenotomy, the tongue of the infants will be elevated and the frenulum exposed with a grooved director or 2 cotton tipped applicators. The frenulum tissue will then be incised with a straight scissor.
When receiving the sham/placebo procedure, they will be brought into a procedure room and kept there for as long as the average experimental procedure would take (~5 minutes).</description>
