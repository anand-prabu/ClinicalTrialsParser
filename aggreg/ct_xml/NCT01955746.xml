      The purpose of this study is to explore the susceptible genes for Type 1 diabetes in Taiwan
      through the new genetic study methods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As an unclear autoimmune disorder, the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains
      elusive. Among all the methods for studying diseases pathophysiology, genetic approach has
      valuable capability as being both hypothesis-testing and hypothesis-generating. Although
      geo-epidemiological studies show relatively higher prevalence of T1D in Caucasians than in
      Asians, whether genetic factors identified in T1D of Caucasians are essential for T1D in
      Asians is not yet clarified. Although the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype variants
      have been reported to be associated with T1D, the odds ratio (ORs) is relatively low in
      Taiwan as comparing with western countries, some families are indeed more than one child
      with T1D. However, the genetic linkage study in T1D is still limited in Taiwan that hampered
      the drug development or research in T1D. Therefore, we intend to explore the susceptible
      genes for T1D of Taiwan in this study, which will provide further researcher directions for
      this disease.
