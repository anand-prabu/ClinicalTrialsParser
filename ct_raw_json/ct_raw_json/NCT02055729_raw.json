Our goal is to study the temporal evolution of the bacterial communities present in the skin and digestive flora (stool) of spinal cord injured persons having one or more sacral bedsores.  The study timespan can include treatment initiation, notably of antibiotics. Urinalysis for studying urinary flora will simultaneously occur.\nFor a description of the study population, see the inclusion/exclusion criteria.\nIntervention: Superficial bedsore sample Intervention: 3mm tissue punch biopsy Intervention: Stool sample Intervention: Urine sample"
