            "textblock": "The purpose is to transfer the embryo during the 'window of implantation', what is defined\n      as the period during which the uterus is receptive for implantation of the free-lying\n      blastocyst.  This has been a subject of debate since many years (Bourgain et al, 2007).\n\n      Succesful implantation requires a co-ordinated series of events allowing a timely dialogue\n      between a receptive endometrium and the intrusive blastocyst (Tabibzadeh, 1998). The period\n      of receptivity is thought to be 3 days in human (Rogers et al, 1989; Yoshinaga, 1988;\n      Psychoyos, 1993; Harper, 1992). It is suggested that blastocyst apposition begins about day\n      LH+6 and is completed by day LH+10 (Lessey, 2000).\n\n      A number of structural and functional endometrial changes have been suggested to play a role\n      in the implantation process: the formation of luminal epithelial pinopodes (Enders et al,\n      1973), expression of adhesion molecules and growth factors and cytokines (Lessey, 2000).\n      Most of them are related directly or indirectly to progesterone secretion and influence on\n      the endometrium.\n\n      In the Centre of Reproductive Medicine of the Brussels University Hospital, the\n      investigators start progesterone supplementation 5 days before the transfer of a day 3\n      embryo. In order to mimic the natural cycle, since progesterone starts to rise 2 to 3 days\n      before ovulation, due to the LH-stimulated production by the peripheral granulosa cells\n      (Speroff). In fresh IVF-cycles, progesterone is started from the day of oocyte retrieval.\n      HCG administration in fresh cycles will lead to an increase in progesterone levels and\n      therefore, endometrium will progress quickly, compared with frozen-thawed cycles which are\n      hormone supplemented (Nawroth).\n\n      In other centres, progesterone supplementation is generally started 3 days before the embryo\n      transfer.\n\n      In this trial, the investigators want to determine the optimal duration of progesterone\n      supplementation: 3 or 5 days before embryo transfer."
