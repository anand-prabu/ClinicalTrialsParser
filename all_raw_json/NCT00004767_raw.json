(Discontinued 11/97) Any patient who develops\n      hyperammonemia is treated with intravenous sodium benzoate, sodium phenylbutyrate, and\n      arginine hydrochloride; benzoate and phenylbutyrate are not given to patients with AA.\n\n      If ammonium stabilizes at normal or near normal levels, intravenous medications are\n      gradually replaced by oral medications.  If there is no         significant decrease in\n      ammonium within 8 hours, patients begin hemodialysis.\n\n      Concurrent therapy with ondansetron, high caloric intake, and mannitol for elevated\n      intracranial pressure is allowed.  Dietary and intravenous nitrogen is prohibited.\n      (Discontinued 11/97)"
