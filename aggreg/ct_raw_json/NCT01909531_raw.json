            "textblock": "Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery is a treatment that can improve some of the motor\n      symptoms associated with several movement disorder diseases. DBS is recommended for patients\n      with Parkinson's disease who respond well to medication, but still experience frequent\n      wearing off of medications with return of symptoms. Patients may also be experiencing\n      troubling medication side effects such as dyskinesias, sleepiness, hallucinations,\n      confusion, and  behavioral/personality changes. DBS is also used for patients with Essential\n      tremor who have undergone long trials of medication therapy and are still symptomatic. The\n      goal of DBS surgery is to capture that best response to medication and hold it through the\n      day. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved DBS as a treatment for essential tremor\n      in 1997 and for Parkinson's disease in 2002.\n\n      The goal of DBS surgery is to improve the quality of life of patients and their families by\n      reducing motor symptoms such as slowness, stiffness and tremor and possibly reducing\n      medication.   In order to help with our understanding of its effects, we will collect\n      information on patients who will be undergoing or have undergone DBS surgery.\n\n      St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center / Barrow Neurological Institute is one of only a\n      few hospitals in the United States offering a new procedure known as asleep DBS surgery,\n      performed under general anesthesia,  as well as the traditional awake DBS procedure;\n      therefore it is important that this new asleep surgery option be studied and compared to\n      awake DBS surgery.\n\n      Objectives include:\n\n        -  Comparison of data collected for both the awake and asleep DBS           procedures\n           during the pre-operative and post-operative periods including testing, diagnosis,\n           surgical treatment, target accuracy, complications, motor function and quality of life\n           outcomes.\n\n        -  Comparison of the differential effects of STN and GPi  DBS on gait and balance control\n\n        -  Investigate the effects of DBS on the saccadic eye movements."

These data will be obtained using a portable gait system (consisted of small light-weight sensors) and force plate setup.  During balance tests, the patients will be asked to hold on to railings in case of loss of balance and asked to wear gait belt during these evaluations.  A member of the research team will be close to the patient to hold them in case of any loss of balance to avoid falls.",
