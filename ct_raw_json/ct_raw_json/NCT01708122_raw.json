The current standard practice is to use\n      Lidocaine jelly (a local anesthetic) given through the urethra to lubricate and decrease\n      pain. In this study, an additional medicine (fentanyl) is used to reduce pain that occurs\n      during and after the above procedure."

            "textblock": "In this double-blind study, a nasal spray of either the drug (fentanyl -- an opioid\n      analgesic) or placebo (normal saline) is administered before the procedure. There is a 50%\n      chance that patients receive the drug or the placebo. In either case, local Lidocaine jelly\n      is used as an anesthetic in the urethra. Each patient is compensated for time and traveling\n      after the completion of his/her participation.\n\n      Patients are asked to arrive between 7 and 11 PM on the evening prior to their procedure for\n      an overnight admission to 5 East ward, on the 5th floor of the Harbor UCLA Medical Center in\n      Torrance, California, United States. Once there, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, oxygen\n      saturation -- amount of oxygen in the blood, and breathing rate) is checked and an\n      intravenous line is placed. Before, during and after the procedure, patients are asked to\n      rate their pain on a scale of 0 to 10 with 0 being \"no pain\" and 10 being \"the worst pain\n      possible.\"\n\n      Regardless of whether patients are assigned to receive fentanyl or placebo, they receive the\n      standard of care for this cystoscopic procedure.\n\n      Once in the cystoscopy room, patients receive the study drug by nasal (into the nose) spray.\n      The study drug is supplied in a pre-filled syringe that contains either 100 mcg of fentanyl\n      or placebo (normal saline with no active medicine in it). Once the study drug is given, the\n      vital signs are closely monitored(checked) until the effect of drug wears off, usually\n      between 2 and 4 hours.\n\n      Blood samples are drawn on several occasions. This blood is used to see how much of the\n      study drug (fentanyl or placebo) appears in the blood.\n\n      Adverse effects: The well-known adverse effects of opioids may occur after nasal as well as\n      conventional routes of administration; however, severe adverse effects such as respiratory\n      depression or hypotension do not seem to occur in any appreciable frequency.\n\n      Intranasal fentanyl has been used safely and effectively in many studies. There are no\n      reports of any serious side effects with the small dose (100 mcg) that is being used in this\n      study. Intranasal fentanyl is generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events. In\n      cancer patients treated for breakthrough pain, the main treatment related side effects were\n      nausea, vertigo, dizziness, constipation, and somnolence. For local side effects, fentanyl\n      displays little local irritation, nasal discomfort or taste experiences. Nasal irritation,\n      skin pain, nasal mucosa ulcers and dysgeusia have been occasionally reported as minor side\n      effects.\n\n      The following minor side effects have been reported with other forms of fentanyl (oral,\n      patch or intravenous): anxiety; confusion; difficulty walking; dizziness; drowsiness; dry\n      mouth; headache; itching; nausea and vomiting.\n\n      The following severe side effects have not been reported with intranasal fentanyl but have\n      been reported with other forms of fentanyl (oral, patch or intravenous): allergic reactions\n      (rash; hives; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face,\n      lips, or tongue); excessive dizziness; excessive drowsiness; fainting; fatigue;\n      hallucinations; muscle rigidity; seizures; shock (changes in skin color); slow heartbeat;\n      respiratory depression or slowed breathing; trouble breathing and feeling of weakness.\n\n      Advantages to patients:  If effective, less pain during and after the cystoscopic procedure\n      and better tolerance of the procedure.\n\n      Advantages to humanity: If effective, nasal fentanyl could be used as a means to reduce pain\n      before and during cystoscopic procedures.\n\n      These benefits may not happen and unexpected side effects may develop."
