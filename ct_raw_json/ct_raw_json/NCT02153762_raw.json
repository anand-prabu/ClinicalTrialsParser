BRTs are often used along with topical steroids\n      (medicated creams), such as Locoid lotion, on skin with AD, and as a monotherapy (single\n      treatment) on both non-diseased and diseased skin.  Since BRTs help to restore components of\n      skin that are absent in skin with AD, it is believed that long-term BRT use may reduce\n      further development of further AD. This is an open-label, single site study."
