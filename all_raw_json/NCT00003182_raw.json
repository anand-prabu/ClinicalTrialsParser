Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicity of\n      gemcitabine used in combination with cisplatin in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma\n      of the head and neck. II. Determine the toxicity profile of this combination treatment in\n      these patients. III. Assess the response rate of treatment in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of gemcitabine. Patients receive gemcitabine as an\n      IV bolus on day 1 every 2 weeks. Cisplatin is administered on day 1 every 2 weeks. In the\n      absence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first 3 patients treated, subsequent cohorts\n      of 3 patients each receive escalating doses of gemcitabine on the same schedule. If 1 of 3\n      patients in each cohort experiences DLT, an additional 3 patients are enrolled at that same\n      dose level. If 2 of 3 patients experiences DLT in the cohort, then dose escalation ceases\n      and the next lower dose is declared the maximum tolerated dose. Patients are assessed for\n      response every 2 weeks. Patients may continue treatment for up to 9 months or until disease\n      progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 3 patients will be accrued for phase I and 20-40 patients will\n      be accrued for phase II of this study."
