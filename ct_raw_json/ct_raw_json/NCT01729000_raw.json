Study\n      signs were placed at the bedside and on the isolette sides of each infant with the\n      appropriate study group guidelines.\n\n      The investigators goal was to target the time period these infants are at high-risk for\n      infection or NEC and its associated mortality.  The targeted time was the first 4 weeks of\n      life or longer while intravenous access is still required.  The average age for the first\n      episode of late-onset sepsis is 22(+/-0.5) days (median: 17 days; 75th percentile: 28 days;\n      95th percentile: 57 days).  The majority of infections that occur after 4 weeks of life are\n      in patients still requiring IV access (peripheral or central).  The presence of an\n      intravenous line in this group of preterm infants correlates with the presence of risk\n      factors for infection that would necessitate the need for intravenous access including:\n      parenteral nutrition, lipid infusion, use of broad spectrum antibiotics, and the intravenous\n      line itself (if it is a central venous catheter).  This strategy focused on the individual\n      infant's risks, limits exposure to and decreases cost of intervention."
