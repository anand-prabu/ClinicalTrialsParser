            "textblock": "In recent years, there has been an emphasis on the creation of \"enhanced-recovery\",\n      \"fast-track\" or \"multi-modal\" pathways to improve perioperative care (1-4). The goal of\n      these programs is to reduce the length of hospital stay, decrease narcotic usage while\n      improving pain control, accelerate post-operative recovery, and expedite return to baseline\n      functional status. Pathways often are developed by a team of surgeons, nurses, pain\n      specialists, anesthesiologists and other support staff. These pathways include preoperative,\n      intraoperative and postoperative components. Preoperative components involve optimization of\n      chronic medical conditions prior to surgery, counseling on surgical expectations and\n      postoperative recovery, limiting preoperative fasting, and cessation of harmful habits\n      including smoking and alcohol use. Intraoperative components include temperature\n      maintenance, fluid balance, avoidance of nasogastric tubes, avoidance of unnecessary\n      peritoneal drains and mechanical bowel preparation, and appropriate analgesia. Postoperative\n      components often involve multi-modal analgesia, early return to activity and early return to\n      a regular diet.   The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a multi-modal pain\n      regimen in the field of Urogynecology."
