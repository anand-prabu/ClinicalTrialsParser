Following SBRT patients will be evaluated by their medical oncologist for consideration of adjuvant chemotherapy, starting 6-8 weeks post-RT. All patients will be followed for one year. Patients will be assessed for toxicity by their radiation oncologist at 4 to 6 weeks post-RT and during chemotherapy by their medical oncologist. Follow up after completion of all treatment will consist of CT chest scans at 6 and 12 months post-SBRT and toxicity assessments every 3 months from the end of SBRT for one year."

SBRT has become the standard of care for treating inoperable small NSCLCs\n      (tumors for which surgery is not an option), but it is an investigational treatment for\n      larger tumors. The type of chemotherapy the patient receives will be a standard chemotherapy\n      and will be decided by the study doctor."
