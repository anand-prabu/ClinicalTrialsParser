Although\n      there is increasing experimental evidence from animal models that surgical decompression of\n      the spinal cord improves recovery after tSCI, clinical studies have not shown conclusive\n      data yet. The main explanations for this lack of convincing evidence are relatively small\n      sample sizes in previous studies, their predominantly retrospective nature, suboptimal\n      measurement methods for the assessment of neurological deficits, and inappropriate recording\n      and documentation of potential confounding factors."

            "textblock": "Although injuries to the spinal column represent a relatively small proportion of all\n      traumatic injuries, spinal injuries have one of the highest impacts on functional outcomes\n      and employment status. Even more than an injury of the spinal column, traumatic spinal cord\n      injury (tSCI) is a devastating disorder severely affecting patients' physical and\n      psychosocial well-being. The incidence of tSCI is estimated to be 11 to 53 new cases per\n      million population per year.\n\n      This is a multi-center, prospective, observational cohort study to evaluate if early (\u2264 12\n      hours after the tSCI) surgical decom\u00acpression is superior to late (> 12 hours and < 14 days\n      after the tSCI) in improving neurologic motor outcomes in patients with acute traumatic\n      spinal cord injury.\n\n      The study will enroll 300 patients with anticipated 1:2 ratio of early vs. late surgery.\n      This CIP is not limited to cervical spinal cord injuries, does not consider a diagnostic MRI\n      as mandatory and will be conducted in a European setting where patients are generally\n      transported more swiftly to the treating institution when compared to other geographic\n      regions in the world.\n\n      Patients will be evaluated according to the schedule set forth in this CIP. The schedule\n      includes evaluations at pre-surgery, post-surgery, 72 hours post injury, 12 weeks \u00b1 2 weeks;\n      6 months \u00b1 30 days; 1 year \u00b1 30 days. The enrollment period is expected to be approximately\n      36 months and subjects will be followed-up for 12 months for the evaluation of the primary\n      endpoint. The study duration is approximately 48 months."
