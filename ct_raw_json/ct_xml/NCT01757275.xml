          -  One endoscopically confirmed bleeding gastric or duodenal peptic ulcer, at least 5 mm
             in diameter, classified as Forrest Ia, Ib, IIa, or IIb. Photo documentation of the
             source of bleeding should be provided.

          -  Successful haemostasis (which is considered to have been established if bleeding has
             stopped and, if applicable, formerly bleeding vessels are flattened or cavitated)
             achieved by endoscopic treatment and confirmed by site staff.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Endoscopic suspicion of gastric malignancy or juxta pyloric stenosis as judged by the
             investigator.

          -  Sign of multi PUB or concomitant other gastro bleeding from esophageal varices,
             reflux esophagitis, gastritis, Mallory Weiss rifts, ulcus simplex, Dieulafoy's
             lesion, colon, small bowel, or ulcer distal to the stom in Billroth-resected
             patients.

          -  Need for treatment during the first 7 days of the study with NSAIDs, Cyclooxygenase-2
             (COX-2) inhibitors, acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) (including low dose) or clopidogrel.

          -  Planned treatment with: warfarin (including other vitamin K antagonists), cisapride,
             phenytoin, atazanavir, nelfinavir, digoxin, methotrexate, clopidogrel, tacrolimus,
             theophylline, lidocaine, nifedipine.

          -  Chemotherapy or radiation therapies within 2 weeks prior to randomisation or planned
             during the course of the study.
