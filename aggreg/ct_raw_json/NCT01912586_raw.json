            "textblock": "Although the high prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED) was detected among male patients\n      after the treatment for colorectal cancer,  published reports depicting  the erectile\n      dysfunction experience of patients with colorectal cancer ot underpin service development\n      are insufficient. Furthermore,unlike patients with prostate cancer, men with colorectal\n      cancer are not routinely offered information and treatment for erectile dysfunction.However,\n      investigations on patients after surgery for prostate cancer could provide some potentially\n      useful insights. The ability of sildenafil and vacuum erection device (VED) to aid in the\n      return of erections after nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy has been established, which\n      may benefit rectal cancer patients after surgery with ED.\n\n      Laparoscopic surgery, although technically demanding and associated with a long learning\n      curve, has the advantage of clear visualization for the smallest structures,including the\n      autonomic nerves. Laparoscopic resection for rectal cancer could thus facilitate\n      preservation of the pelvic autonomic nerves.\n\n      This study aimed to identify whether early intervention is effective at reducing the rate of\n      ED at 12 months."
