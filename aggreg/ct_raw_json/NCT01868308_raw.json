            "textblock": "Preterm Birth is a complex syndrome for which several different biologically plausible\n      pathways have been proposed, including mechanical uterine distension, abruption,\n      inflammation, and/or activation of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-axis. However, despite\n      our knowing the complexity of this syndrome and the different pathways involved, there is a\n      paucity of clinical studies investigating whether detection of more than one of these\n      pathways in a single patient might enhance the identification of those at greatest risk for\n      preterm birth. We propose investigating the predictive value of a panel of biomarkers\n      associated with two biological plausible pathways - membrane breakdown and cervical\n      remodeling - that must be involved in the pathogenesis of preterm birth. Specifically, we\n      propose measuring cervical length and collecting cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin as well as\n      a panel of novel cervicovaginal biomarkers that reflect molecular pathways involved in\n      cervical remodeling in a prospectively collected cohort of symptomatic women with singleton\n      fetuses at high risk for preterm birth. Through this study we hope improve risk\n      stratification of this high risk cohort."
