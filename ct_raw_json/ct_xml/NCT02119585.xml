  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), respiratory system function may be severely
      impaired for several reasons including anaesthesia effects, hyperdynamic volume state with
      fluid overload and ischemia reperfusion injury. In particular, reperfusion syndrome is
      characterised by the release of several inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and oxygen
      free radicals which may contribute to alveolar endothelial barrier dysfunction. The object
      of this study is to investigate the respiratory system mechanics impairment in its
      partitioning between lung and chest wall.

      We hypothesize that impairment of respiratory system mechanics (of both lung and chest wall)
      occurs after reperfusion phase of liver. This impairment is associated with the systemic
      inflammatory response following liver reperfusion.
