It is characterized by myofascial trigger point.  This\n      trigger point is clinically classified as active or latent.  Some studies have demonstrated\n      the potential relevance of latent trigger point. In fact, its presence may cause muscle\n      activation pattern alterations, increase nociceptive sensitivity and cause sympathetic\n      activity alterations. Nevertheless, the vast majority of individuals, even asymptomatic,\n      have latent trigger point. High prevalence of myofascial trigger points subsists at cervical\n      and scapular regions.\n\n      There is few data regarding myofascial trigger point physiopathology. Furthermore, a\n      diversity of therapeutic interventions consisting of trigger point inactivation and\n      interruption of the vicious cycle is suggested in literature. Nevertheless, the\n      effectiveness of these different interventions in trigger points and the duration of the\n      effects are not yet fully clarified."
