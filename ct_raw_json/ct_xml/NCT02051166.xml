      It is widely recognized that the global social and economic burden of Chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD) is high; affecting an estimated 64 million people worldwide. It was
      reported the prevalence of COPD in China population over 40 years old is about 8.2% (Zhong
      Nanshan et al, 2007). According to the report on China Chronic Disease, COPD is the second
      disease of Disability Adjusted Life Years.  The economic burden of COPD is tremendous in
      China. Cost analysis in 2006 showed that every COPD patient in urban would pay 1732.24 $ on
      medical cost every year, indirect cost on nurse and traffic is 231.6 $, total cost would
      account for 40% of average family income in 2006(Chiang CH.,2008).AECOPD is one of most
      important cause leading to COPD death. Corticosteroid is essential for AECOPD management and
      recommended by domestic and international guidelines. But it shows that corticosteroid use
      for treating AECOPD in China is around 70% from market research in big hospitals, and less
      report about how steroid is used for AECOPD management was published, including
      distribution, dosage, treatment duration, etc.  The healthcare resources utilization for
      treating AECOPD in China is also unclear.
