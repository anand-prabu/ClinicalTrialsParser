Assessment of safety and efficacy will be performed at each quarterly visit and\n      each visit will also include laboratory tests and ECG examination. During the visits the\n      clinical benefit will be assessed by Investigator according to the revised European\n      LeukemiaNet response criteria. The dose of Givinostat will be modified for protocol\n      specified toxicities. The treatment may continue up to Marketing Authorization of\n      Givinostat. Patients may discontinue study treatment at any time and remain on study therapy\n      as long as they derive clinical benefit. Safety will be monitored at each visit throughout\n      the entire duration of the study. In case the approved label will not cover the whole study\n      population, Givinostat will be provided by the Sponsor to those patients not fulfilling the\n      criteria for the approved label of the drug that are still deriving benefit from Givinostat\n      at the time of its commercial availability."
