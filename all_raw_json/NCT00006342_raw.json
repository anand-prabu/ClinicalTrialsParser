Determine the frequency of chromosome 3, 11, and 21 aberrations in peripheral\n      blood lymphocytes (PBL) specifically associated with acute myelogenous leukemia in patients\n      with adult or pediatric Hodgkin's disease treated with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. II.\n      Determine the frequency of these aberrations in patients with pediatric central nervous\n      system tumors treated with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. III. Determine the\n      glutathione-S-transferase allotype, associated with human toxicological response to\n      carcinogen exposure, for these patients. IV. Determine the frequency of t(14;18) gene\n      rearrangement, associated with deregulation of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene in non-Hodgkin's\n      lymphoma, in PBL of these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: An extra tube of blood is collected before, every 4 weeks during, and every 3\n      months after radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. DNA is isolated from the blood sample and the\n      GSTM1, GSTT1, and various cytochrome P (CYP) 450 genotypes are determined by polymerase\n      chain reaction (PCR). Mononuclear leukocytes are analyzed for chromosome aberrations on\n      chromosome numbers 3, 11, and 21. Pretreatment karyotype and frequency of translocations are\n      determined for each patient. Peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA is also examined for t(14;18)\n      gene rearrangements.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
