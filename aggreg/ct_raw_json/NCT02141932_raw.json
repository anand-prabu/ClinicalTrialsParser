In special it is important to\n      reveal if carotid artery stenosis is present as such a finding will directly influence on\n      treatment and follow-up.\n\n      For the diagnosis of carotid artery stenosis due to atherosclerosis ultrasound examinations\n      is the cornerstone, but computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging may be better in\n      some cases. Development of high quality pocket-sized ultrasound scanners has allowed for\n      semi quantitatively bed-side assessment of the carotid arteries and the heart.\n\n      The investigators aim to study the feasibility and reliability of bed-side assessment of the\n      carotid arteries and the heart by pocket-sized ultrasound scanners and the clinical\n      influence of this examination when performed by experienced users.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that a significant proportion of this patient population can\n      be clarified bed-side with no need of further imaging procedures for the assessment of the\n      carotid arteries and the heart."
