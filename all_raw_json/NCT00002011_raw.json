The photopheresis instrument will separate the\n      patient's white blood cells and some plasma from other blood components and return the\n      majority of blood components to the patient. The separated white blood cells and plasma will\n      be exposed to UVA (Ultraviolet A) light while outside  the body. The UVA light\n      photoactivates the 8-MOP drug which is now located in the DNA of the collected cells. After\n      this exposure, the patients photoactivated white blood cells will be returned to the patient\n      by venous access."
