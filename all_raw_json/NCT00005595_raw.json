Determine the efficacy of arsenic trioxide in terms of rate of response\n      (complete or partial remission), duration of response, relapse free survival, and overall\n      survival in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's disease. II. Evaluate the\n      toxicities of this agent in this patient population. III. Elucidate the mechanism of action\n      of this treatment by measuring induction of apoptosis and caspace activation when given to\n      these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-2 hours\n      daily for up to 60 days. After 4-6 weeks of rest, patients receive up to 5 additional\n      courses of therapy of 25 days each followed by 4-6 weeks of rest. Patients with a complete\n      response (CR) receive 1 additional course of 25 days after achieving CR. Treatment continues\n      in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed\n      monthly for 6 months, every 2 months for 6 months, every 3 months for 12 months, and then\n      every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
