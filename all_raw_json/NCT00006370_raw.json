Determine the tumor response rate of yttrium Y 90 SMT 487 in patients with\n      refractory small cell lung cancer or advanced metastatic breast cancer expressing\n      somatostatin receptor. II. Determine the safety of this treatment regimen in these patients.\n      III. Determine the overall survival of these patients with this treatment regimen. IV.\n      Determine the quality of life in these patients with this treatment regimen. V. Determine\n      the frequency of tumors which are positive (3+ or 4+) for OctreoScan scintigraphy in this\n      patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive yttrium Y 90 SMT 487 IV over 10-15\n      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 6-9 weeks for up to 3 courses in the absence of\n      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at\n      course 3, week 6. Patients are followed at 6 and 12 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-29 patients will be accrued for this study."
