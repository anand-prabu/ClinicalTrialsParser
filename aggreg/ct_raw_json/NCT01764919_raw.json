Ability to return for all study assessments.\n\n          8. Clinically euthyroid, or on stable thyroid replacement therapy.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Patients who ar unable to comply with study requirements.\n\n          2. Indication, in the opinion of the principal Investigator for urgent surgery that\n             would preclude the time needed for PET-CT scanning, or clinical instability that\n             precludes PET-CT scanning.\n\n          3. History of an inherited mitochondrial disorder (eg. Leber's hereditary neuropathy,\n             neuropathy, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa and ptosis [NARP], myoneurogenic\n             gastrointestinal encephalopathy [MNGIE], myocolonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers\n             [MERFF] and mitochondrial myopathy, encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and\n             stroke-like syndrome [MELAS])\n\n          4.

Body mass that exceeds the rating of the CT table.\n\n          6. Hypersensitivity to iodine.\n\n          7. Pregnant or breast-feeding.\n\n          8.
