            "textblock": "Revlimid is an important imid based therapy of myeloma.  However patients will still relapse\n      after this drug and then have limited options.  Abraxane has shown efficacy in a number of\n      cancers, putatively through intratumor concentration by SPARC (secreted protein acidic and\n      rich in cysteine). (Taxanes have shown a modest activity in myeloma.  Interestingly,\n      Revlimid can upregulate the levels of SPARC.  Thus, investigators will test the toxicity and\n      efficacy of a combination of Revlimid and Abraxane in relapsed/refractory myeloma.\n\n      Investigators will perform a phase I/II trial of Revlimid daily for 21 days and Abraxane\n      weekly for 3 weeks in patients who have failed Revlimid but have adequate blood counts and\n      renal function and minimal neuropathy.  For study purposes, 1 cycle is considered to be 4\n      weeks (20 days). Subjects will get Abraxane for three weeks and will be off of this\n      treatment for 1 week. There are 10 visits per cycle. Accrual will be on standard 3 patient\n      cohorts.  Once the maximum tolerated dose is reached, the level below will be expanded to 25\n      patients for a pilot phase II trial.  All treatments will be performed until progression.\n      Assessments will be made at least at the 2, 4, and 6 month timepoints and monthly thereafter\n      until progression.\n\n      Since both drugs can cause myelosuppression, investigators will start with doses below their\n      standard doses as single agents.  Investigators will use 100 mg/m2 of Abraxane weekly for 3\n      weeks and 10 mg Revlimid daily for 21 days, with a dose escalation for Revlimid to 15 mg and\n      to 25 mg.  Dose de-escalations will also be performed for both drugs as necessary.\n      Investigators will explore whether SPARC  (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine)\n      expression is altered by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry."
