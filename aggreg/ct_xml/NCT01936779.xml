  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High levels of fatty substances in the blood increase the risk of developing heart disease.
      Investigators know a lot about one of these fatty substances, cholesterol. However, there is
      another fatty substance in the blood called triglyceride. Investigators do not understand
      much about what regulates the rate at which the liver produces triglyceride and liberates it
      into the bloodstream after eating a meal(s). It is known that taking fish oil lowers the
      amount of blood triglyceride however, it remains unclear how this happens. Investigators
      will study if changes in liver fat metabolism, after taking fatty acids found in fish oil
      (n-3 fatty acids)can explain the lowering of blood triglyceride. Investigators also want to
      know if taking fish oil alters the amount of fat that accumulates within the liver.

      Investigators will recruit men and women with no medical condition or relevant drug therapy
      that affects liver metabolism.

      Purpose and design:

      Investigators are asking the research question: &quot;How do specific fatty acids, such as those
      found in fish ((n-3) fatty acids) influence postprandial liver fat metabolism?&quot;

      It is known that n-3 fatty acids lower plasma triglyceride concentrations but it remains
      unclear how this happens.

      To address this research question investigators want to undertake detail physiological
      studies, in a randomised study where individuals will be studied before and after taking n-3
      fatty acids or a placebo oil.
