      Primary Objectives: - To explore the benefit of an early switch from docetaxel/prednisone to
      cabazitaxel/ prednisone in men with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)
      who do not achieve ≥30% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline from baseline by cycle 4
      with the initial docetaxel treatment. - To evaluate the circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with
      clinical response/resistance to docetaxel or cabazitaxel treatment  Secondary Objectives: -
      To assess efficacy and safety of the two treatment strategies, switch from
      cabazitaxel/prednisone to docetaxel/prednisone and docetaxel/prednisone to
      cabazitaxel/prednisone. - To evaluate efficacy in patients receiving initial taxane
      treatment before the switch and efficacy under the alternate taxane after the switch within
      each initial treatment group.

      Patients will be treated until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, death or
      patient's refusal of further study treatment. All patients will be followed until death or
      the study cutoff date, whichever comes first. Study cut-off will be 6 months after the last
      patient last treatment. Patients alive at the cut-off date will be followed for overall
      survival.  Collection of survival data after the cut-off date will be done every year for a
      maximum of 3 years.
