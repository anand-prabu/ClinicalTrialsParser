      The purpose of this study is to see if the combination of Vemurafenib with Decitabine
      improves the low therapy response rate in subjects with malignant melanoma.

      Primary Objectives Evaluate the safety and tolerability of the proposed schedule of
      Decitabine and Vemurafenib in the treatment of metastatic melanoma.

      Ensure appropriate demethylation occurs. This will be assessed by measuring the percentage
      of Hemoglobin F by HPLC before and 2, 4 and 8 weeks after treatment with Decitabine,
      assuming a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) or the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) does not occur.
      This data will be used to calculate the ideal cohort for the phase II portion.

      Assess tumor response rates by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors &quot;RECIST&quot;
      criteria

      Secondary Objectives To measure the time to progression of patients treated with this
      combination in comparison to patients treated historically with Vemurafenib alone (the
      current standard of care in BRAF-mutated patients).
