Patients\n      are stratified according to treatment center and catheter placement (proximal to axilla vs\n      distal to axilla). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients\n      receive dalteparin subcutaneously (SC) daily. Arm II: Patients receive placebo SC daily.\n      Treatment continues for 16 weeks or until catheter removal in the absence of unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients are followed for 30 days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 345 patients (230 in arm I and 115 in arm II) will be accrued\n      for this study over 6 months."
