  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of massage therapy and occlusal
      splint therapy on mandibular range of motion (ROM) in individuals with temporomandibular
      disorder (TMD) and compare the results with those obtained in a group of individuals without
      this disorder. Twenty-eight volunteers with TMD were randomly distributed into two groups,
      massage therapy and occlusal splint. Both treatments lasted 4 weeks. Fourteen individuals
      without TMD were consecutively allocated to the control group. The Fonseca's anamnestic
      index was used to characterize TMD and allocate the volunteers to either the intervention
      groups or control group. Mandibular ROM was evaluated before and after treatment using a
      digital caliper. Two-way analysis of variance with the Bonferroni test was used for inter
      and intragroup comparisons (level of significance was set to 5%). Cohen's d was used to
      calculate the effect size.
