Therefore a fixed\n      measure is inserted between admission and discharge. we have added a \"relatively\" fixed date\n      at 6 months post stroke in order to see if change of function from specialized\n      rehabilitation will differ in a longitudinal perspective, and if possible to see if the\n      difference in time to admission (time from debut till admission in specialized\n      rehabilitation)might influence results."
