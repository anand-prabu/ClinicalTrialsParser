Determine the toxicity of decitabine combined\n      with filgrastim (G-CSF) primed allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells in patients who\n      relapsed within 1 year after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. III. Determine the\n      effectiveness in reinducing remission in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive decitabine IV for 6 hours every 12 hr for 5 days. Peripheral blood\n      stem cells (PBSC) are administered 5 days after last dose of decitabine. Donors receive\n      filgrastim subcutaneously (SQ) daily every 12 hours starting 2-4 days prior to first PBSC\n      collection. If insufficient number of cells are collected, bone marrow can be harvested for\n      supplementation. Donor cells should be collected prior to decitabine infusion. Patients\n      receive filgrastim SQ administered daily starting 1 day after PBSC infusion until blood\n      counts recover. For GVHD prophylaxis, patients receive cyclosporine IV daily on day -2, then\n      orally once dose is tolerable. Dose of decitabine is escalated in cohorts of 3-6 patients.\n      If dose limiting toxicity occurs in 2 of 6 patients at a given dose level, then that dose is\n      declared the maximum tolerated dose. Patients are followed weekly. If none of the first 5\n      patients survive in remission for more than 100 days, the study will be terminated.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 15 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years."
