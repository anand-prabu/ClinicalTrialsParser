Exclusive breastfeeding rates are even lower, with only about 9% of Croatian mothers\n      exclusively breastfeeding at 6 months, despite the WHO recommendation of 6 months of\n      exclusive breastfeeding. Currently, in Croatia, no breastfeeding information or other\n      pregnancy and parenting related written information is routinely provided to expectant\n      couples. In our study we would like to find out whether providing written breastfeeding\n      information in pregnancy and breastfeeding focused support phone calls during pregnancy and\n      after the birth of the baby result in better outcomes than providing general pregnancy\n      information and phone calls. This will be tested by randomising women, attending their\n      primary health care provider for routine antenatal visits between 27 and 32 weeks, to an\n      intervention educational program focused on promoting and supporting breastfeeding, and to a\n      control group who will receive educational support aimed at general pregnancy and parenting\n      issues. Women will be followed-up for 6 months after the birth of their baby and data will\n      be collected at 3 and 6 months on  breastfeeding rates, breastfeeding self-efficacy, quality\n      of life, social support and attitudes toward infant feeding"
