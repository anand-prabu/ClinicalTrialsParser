      This study will combine an oral drug called DFMO with celecoxib (also oral) and two IV
      chemotherapy medicines called cyclophosphamide and topotecan.

        -  To find the highest dose of DFMO that can be given with celecoxib, cyclophosphamide and
           topotecan without causing severe side effects.

        -  To find out the side effects seen by giving DFMO at different dose levels with
           celecoxib, cyclophosphamide and topotecan.

        -  To measure the levels of DFMO in the blood at different dose levels.

        -  To determine if your tumor gets smaller after treatment with DFMO, celecoxib,
           cyclophosphamide and topotecan.

        -  To determine if specific gene changes in you or your tumor makes you more prone to side
           effects or affects your tumor's response to  the combination of DFMO, celecoxib,
           cyclophosphamide and topotecan.

        -  To determine if the amount of normal chemicals in your body called polyamines go down
           in response to DFMO, celecoxib, cyclophosphamide and topotecan, and whether you are
           more likely to have a good response to the treatment if they do.

    <description>The standard  3+3 design for dose escalation will be utilized.  3-6 patients will enroll at each of 4 dose levels, but enrollment to a dosing cohort will cease after observation of DLTs in 2 or more patients. A minimum of 2 to a maximum of 24 patients will be enrolled assuming all 4 dose levels require 6 patients before an MTD is determined. A total of 12 patients may be enrolled at the study defined MTD (including those used to define the MTD) to provide additional adverse event data for safety evaluation.</description>

    <description>Reconstituted DFMO powder by mouth for 14 days and celecoxib capsule by mouth daily in each cycle. Cyclophosphamide and Topotecan IV on days 8-12 in cycle 1 and days 1-5 of cycles 2-17. Patients may continue for up to 17 cycles as long as therapy is tolerated (no DLT) and disease progression does not occur (SD or better). *Cycle 1 will include a 7 day lead-in with DFMO and celecoxib to deplete tumor polyamines.</description>

          -  Patients must be &gt; 2 years and &lt; 30 years of age when registered on study.

          -  Patients must have recurrent/progressive high-risk neuroblastoma, refractory
             high-risk neuroblastoma that had less than a partial response to standard treatment
             or persistent high-risk neuroblastoma that had at least a partial response to
             standard treatment.

          -  All patients must have at least ONE site of evaluable disease.

          -  Patients must have adequate heart, kidney, liver and bone marrow function.

          -  Patients who have bone marrow disease must still have adequate bone marrow function
             to enter the study.

             chair prior to registration.
