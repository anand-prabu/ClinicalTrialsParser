            "textblock": "An estimated 76 million adults in the United States over the age of 20 have hypertension\n      (HTN); which translates into 1 out of 3 adults. Globally the prevalence of HTN is over 25%\n      for adults, and accounts for approximately 13.5% of all deaths.  Given the aging of the\n      population together with increases in obesity and sedentary behavior, it is not surprising\n      that HTN is projected to increase significantly over the next several decades; with over 1.5\n      billion adults having HTN by the year 2025. Thus the public health implications to\n      preventing and/or reducing elevations in blood pressure are substantial.\n\n      This study compares the efficacy of two different non-pharmacologic interventions (device\n      guided breathing and isometric hand grip exercises) used alone and in combination for\n      lowering blood pressure.  This pilot study will include 30 adults with stage 1 hypertension.\n       The primary outcome is the change in blood pressure from baseline to 8 weeks.  Secondary\n      outcomes include change in blood pressure from 8 weeks to 16 weeks and acceptability of the\n      interventions by participants.  The knowledge gained from this study can provide information\n      on non-pharmacologic methods that may be useful in decreasing blood pressure.  Such\n      knowledge may be especially useful for patients for whom access to medications and health\n      care is limited and among patients unwilling to take or intolerant to pharmacologic\n      therapies."
