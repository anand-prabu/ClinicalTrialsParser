Following\n      at least 2 additional weeks, 6 patients are then given ribavirin at the lowest dose twice a\n      day for 16 weeks. They are evaluated for tolerance and the next group is given a higher\n      dose. Each successive group begins at 3-week intervals to receive doses that increase each\n      day until the MTD is reached. Blood samples taken periodically during the treatment period\n      and for 8 weeks after treatment is stopped are used to measure blood levels of ribavirin and\n      to determine the effects of ribavirin on the HIV and immune system of the patients."
