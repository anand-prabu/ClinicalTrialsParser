From Days 1-10, they receive one daily dose\n      of EC905 to obtain steady state, followed by 20 days (Days 11-30) combined dosing of EC905\n      and verapamil.\n\n      On Day 10 a 24-hour PK profile is obtained for solifenacin/tamsulosin. After the last dosing\n      on Day 30, a post-dose 24-hour PK profile for solifenacin/tamsulosin and verapamil is\n      obtained.\n\n      Additionally, vital signs, safety ECG (Electrocardiogram) measurements, safety laboratory\n      assessments, adverse events and concomitant medications are monitored throughout the\n      investigational period.\n\n      Subjects return for an ESV (End of Study Visit) 10 days after the last dosing."
