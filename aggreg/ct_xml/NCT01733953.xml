      Adult survivors of childhood cancer are at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease.
      Therapies used to treat many cancers, such as chemotherapy and radiation, likely cause
      damage to the surface of the artery wall called the endothelial layer, leading to the
      induction of atherosclerosis and eventual cardiovascular disease.  HMG coenzyme A reductase
      inhibitors, or statins, improve endothelial function independent of cholesterol-lowering.
      In addition, statins have been shown to reduce arterial stiffness and slow arterial
      thickening.  Despite strong evidence supporting the vascular benefits of statins in many
      different patient populations, these medications have never been studied in cancer
      survivors.  Therefore, the overall objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of
      statin therapy on vascular health in young adult survivors of childhood cancer.

      Twenty-four young adult (age 18-39 years old) survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia (ALL) or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) will be enrolled in a six-month randomized,
      double-blind (participants and investigators), placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial
      comparing the effects of atorvastatin versus placebo on endothelial function and other
      measures of vascular health.

      Our primary objective is to evaluate the effects of 6-months of statin therapy on conduit
      artery endothelial function in young adult survivors of childhood cancer.  The investigators
      hypothesize that, compared to placebo, atorvastatin will significantly increase brachial
      artery flow-mediated dilation in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

    <textblock>
      Adult survivors of childhood cancer are at seven times the risk of dying from cardiovascular
      disease compared to the general population.  The increased risk is thought to be the result
      of the therapies used to treat the cancer such as chemotherapy and radiation.  These
      therapies likely cause damage to the endothelial cells, which line the arterial wall and,
      when function properly, offer protection from atherosclerosis.  Young adult survivors of
      childhood ALL have reduced endothelial function, or endothelial dysfunction, compared to
      healthy controls.  Endothelial dysfunction is considered an early manifestation of
      atherosclerosis and therefore is an ideal target of therapy in order to reduce the risk of
      cardiovascular disease.  Interventions that improve endothelial function in young adult
      survivors of childhood cancer may be beneficial in terms of mitigating the medium- and
      long-term risk of developing this chronic disease.

      HMG coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins, are widely used for cardiovascular disease
      risk reduction.  These medications are primarily used to reduce levels of total- and
      low-density lipoprotein (LDL) -cholesterol.  Meta-analyses have consistently demonstrated
      that statin therapy improves endothelial function in a wide array of patient populations.
      Beyond their well-described vascular benefits, statins are an attractive therapeutic option
      for cardiovascular disease risk reduction due to their strong safety profile.

      Despite the clear potential for endothelial function improvement and cardiovascular risk
      reduction, statin therapy has never been evaluated in survivors of childhood cancer.
      Although statins have been well-studied in other patient populations at risk for
      cardiovascular disease, there is strong justification for evaluation in cancer survivors
      since the mechanisms responsible for the vascular problems in these individuals
      (treatment-induced vascular toxicity) differ from traditional atherosclerosis.  Therefore,
      the objective of the current study is to assess the ability of statin therapy to improve
      endothelial function, arterial stiffness, and arterial thickening in young adult survivors
      of childhood cancer.  The focus of the study will be on survivors of hematologic
      malignancies, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), since the
      former has been shown to be associated with endothelial impairments and both cancers share
      common treatment exposures (chemotherapy and radiation), which is likely the primary factor
      responsible for endothelial dysfunction in these individuals.

      Twenty-four young adult (age 18-39 years old) survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)will be enrolled in a six-month randomized,
      double-blind (participants and investigators), placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial
      comparing the effects of atorvastatin versus placebo on endothelial function and other
      measures of vascular health.  Following baseline testing, subjects will be randomly assigned
      (1:1) to either atorvastatin or placebo.  Participants will return at 1-month and 3-months
      for assessment of safety (blood draw and adverse event assessment) and medication compliance
      and at 6-months for assessment of safety, medication compliance, and reassessment of
      baseline variables.
