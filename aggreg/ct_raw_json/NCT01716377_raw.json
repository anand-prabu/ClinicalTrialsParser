Patients who report a neck pain\n      score > 6 will be screened for further eligibility.\n\n      Procedures (methods): Using a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial design, 60\n      high risk patients will be randomized to venlafaxine vs. placebo in the ED.  The ability of\n      venlafaxine to decrease acute and persistent musculoskeletal neck pain will be assessed\n      during serial short-term telephone follow-ups as well as more in-depth follow-ups at 6\n      weeks, 4 months, and 6 months post-MVC."
