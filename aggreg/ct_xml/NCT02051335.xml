      The purpose of this study is to determine whether scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment
      is attenuated by the administration of roflumilast in combination with donepezil.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called roflumilast. Roflumilast is being tested as a
      potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease. This study will look at roflumilast combined
      with a medication called donepezil, and their ability to reverse mimicked Alzheimer's
      disease symptoms that have been brought on by administration of a drug called scopolamine.

      The study will enroll up to 28 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of four treatment groupsâ€”which will remain undisclosed
      to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical
      need). All participants will receive the following treatments at varying time points
      throughout the study:

        -  Roflumilast Dose A tablets

        -  Donepezil 10 mg capsules

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet or capsule that looks like the study
           drug but has no active ingredient

        -  Scopolamine 0.5 mg subcutaneous injection.

      All participants will be asked to take 2 tablets and 1 capsule and will receive a
      scopolamine subcutaneous injection on the first day of 4 separate study periods.
      Participants will then be assessed for how the scopolamine affects their mental processes
      and whether the study drug improves this.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in England. The overall time to participate in
      this study is up to 95 days. Participants will make 7 visits to the clinic, including 4
      separate periods of 2 days confinement to the clinic, and a follow-up assessment 14 days
      after the last treatment period.

    <description>VRM measures the ability to encode and subsequently retrieve verbal information. This task begins with the first presentation phase in which 18 words are shown in turn on the screen. The participant is then asked to recall as many words as possible during the first immediate recall phase. The same 18 words are then shown in a second presentation phase which is followed by a second immediate recall phase. After a delay of approximately 20-30 minutes, a delayed recall stage is completed.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>PAL assesses visuospatial associative learning and memory. Boxes are displayed on the screen and open in a randomised order to reveal a number of patterns. The patterns are then displayed in the middle of the screen, one at a time, and the participant must touch the box where the pattern was originally located. If the participant makes an error, the patterns are re-presented to remind the participant of their locations. If the participant has not responded correctly within six attempts, ie, one presentation and five re-presentations, the task is terminated. As the task progresses the difficulty level increases with the number of patterns to be remembered. For participants who fail to complete all levels, an adjusted total is calculated that takes into account errors predicted in the stages that were not attempted.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>RVP is a task of continuous performance and visual sustained attention. The task consists of a 2-minute practice stage and a 7-minute assessed stage. There is a white box in the centre of the screen in which single digits from 2 to 9 appear one at a time in a pseudo-random order at a rate of 100 digits per minute. Participants must detect target sequences of digits (2-4-6, 3-5-7, and 4-6-8) and touch a button when they see the last digit of a target sequence. Nine target sequences appear every 100 numbers. A prime (A') is a signal detection measure that reflects target sensitivity regardless of the participant's tendency, or bias, to respond.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>SWM assesses the ability to retain spatial information and manipulate it in working memory. In this task, colored boxes are shown on the screen, and participants must search for blue tokens by touching the colored boxes to open them. When the blue token has been found the participant has to place the token in the black column ('home') on the right-hand side of the screen by touching this area. The participant must not return to a box where a token has previously been found. The task becomes more difficult as the number of boxes increases (one trial at each of 6-box and 8-box stages; three trials at each of 10-box and 12-box stages).</description>
