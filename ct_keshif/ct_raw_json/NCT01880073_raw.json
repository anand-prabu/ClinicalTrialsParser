            "textblock": "A thorough infertility evaluation commonly involves determining whether a woman's fallopian\n      tubes are patent.  The two most often utilized methods of evaluating the fallopian tubes are\n      hysterosalpingogram (taking an X-ray of the pelvis after injecting dye through the uterus\n      and fallopian tubes) and laparoscopic chromopertubation (a surgical procedure in which dye\n      is visualized passing through the fallopian tubes).\n\n      The FemVue Saline-Air device is a new method of assessing tubal patency.  The device\n      utilizes a mixture of saline and air bubbles that can be seen passing through the fallopian\n      tubes by ultrasound.  FemVue can be efficiently performed in a physician's office and is\n      minimally invasive.  Unlike hysterosalpingogram and laparoscopic chromopertubation, it does\n      not carry the risks of anesthesia or surgery, and doesn't expose the patient to radiation or\n      contrast.  It does, like the other two methods, carry a small risk of infection.\n\n      This study will involve using the FemVue device on patients under anesthesia in the\n      operating room before they undergo scheduled laparoscopic chromopertubation, the gold\n      standard for evaluating tubal patency.  The two methods will be compared to determine the\n      accuracy of the FemVue device."
