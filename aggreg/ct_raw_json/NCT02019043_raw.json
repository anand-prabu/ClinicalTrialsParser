The objectives are to determine to what degree the\n      intervention: (1) increases the proportion of men who undergo syphilis testing at least\n      annually (screening coverage); (2) shortens the interval between tests (screening\n      frequency); (3) reaches men at highest risk; and, ultimately, (4) results in more detected\n      cases of untreated, and especially infectious, syphilis and the incremental cost to the\n      health-care system for each additional diagnosis. The main hypotheses are that the\n      intervention will increase screening coverage to a minimum of 85% of men undergoing syphilis\n      testing annually, increase screening frequency to a median of 3 tests per person per year,\n      and increase the case detection rate by 75% or more.\n\n      The design of this study is a cluster-randomized controlled trial with stepped wedge design\n      that will gradually introduce the intervention across clinics. This pragmatic approach\n      incorporates a concurrent comparison group, allows for assessment of time trends, will be\n      well-powered, and will generate more generalizable results due to its inclusion of multiple\n      clinics. The intervention will be operationalized as standing orders for syphilis serology\n      when there is an order for HIV viral load and/or CD4 cell count. Data sources include (1)\n      syphilis tests submitted to the Public Health Ontario Laboratory; (2) a standardized\n      clinical worksheet and medical chart review to validate diagnoses for screen test positives;\n      and (3) data collected from a subset of patients via their participation in the ongoing\n      Ontario HIV Treatment Network (OHTN) Cohort Study. The latter follows adults in HIV care and\n      collects data using chart reviews and annual face-to-face interviews including measures of\n      sexual behaviour."

Team members who are physicians at these clinics will guide the specific approach that will be appropriate and sustainable for their setting. Options are quite simple. They include pre-printing a checkmark for 'syphilis serology' onto existing pre-printed requisitions for routine bloodwork; addition of the serology request form to the routine blood work package; or programming 'syphilis serology' into existing computerized routine order sets.",
