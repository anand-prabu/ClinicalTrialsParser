The role of this orientation in the treatment of patients\n      with preserved ejection fraction, however, is still unclear. The evaluation of the effects\n      of sodium restriction on neurohormonal activation and episodes of decompensation in HF-PEF\n      can promote a better understanding of the pathophysiological progression of this complex\n      syndrome."
