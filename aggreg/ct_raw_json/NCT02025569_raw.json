No studies have assessed the effectiveness of SCS on CAI.\n       Baseline information on all participants includes a demographic questionnaire, the Star\n      Excursion Balance Test (SEBT), and the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM).  Participants\n      were randomized into the SCS intervention group or the sham SCS control group.  All\n      participants received an intervention (as assigned) once a week for four weeks in addition\n      to performing a prescribed home exercise program.  At week four all participants repeated\n      the outcome measures and completed a Global Rating of Change (GROC) form.  The primary aim\n      was examined with a 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)."
