            "textblock": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by\n      motor neuron loss. Despite of many trials for disease-modifying, no treatment has so far\n      changed natural course of disease.\n\n      The investigators had performed the pre-clinical and clinical studies using autologous bone\n      marrow-derived stem cells in ALS. In the investigators' results of clinical trial,\n      intrathecal injection of autologous bone marrow-derived stem cells is safe and could slow\n      down disease progression and might be used as a disease modifying strategy in patients with\n      ALS.\n\n      In the new field, like cell therapy, it is an important issue whether a bone marrow derived\n      mesenchymal stem cells can be used as an allograft. Many investigators had showed that the\n      immunoprivileged and immunosuppressive properties of mesenchymal stem cells result from the\n      absence of major histocompatibility class II antigens and the secretion of T helper type 2\n      cytokines.\n\n      One potential advantage of allogenic bone marrow derived cells could be avoiding the need\n      for procedural delay before treatment. And it is also hypothesized that the function of\n      autologous bone marrow derived cells could be impaired in patients with co-morbidities or\n      advanced age.\n\n      This study is to evaluate safety of HYNR-CS-Allo inj(HLA-haplo matched Allogenic bone\n      marrow-derived stem cells) in patients with ALS.\n\n      The patients enrolled in the trial will be successively allocated into three cohorts for\n      HYNR-CS-Allo inj., 0.25 X 10^6 cells/kg, 0.5 X 10^6 cells/kg, 1 X 10^6 cells/kg, according\n      to the 3+3, up and down protocol design. The first treatment cohort will be 0.5 X 106\n      cells/kg dose cohort. Only a maximum of six patients will be given a particular dosage.\n\n      The scheduled assessments and visits will be carried out over three periods: run-in period,\n      treatment period, and follow-up period.\n\n      The run-in period includes the screening visit where a written informed consent is obtained\n      and the screening period where patients are assessed for eligibility. It will be completed\n      within 30 days prior to enrollment. The patients meeting inclusion criteria will start the\n      treatment period.\n\n      During the treatment period, subjects will be administered HYNR-CS-Allo inj. 2 times by\n      intrathecal administration with 28 days interval.\n\n      The Follow-up period starts once subjects complete the treatment period and will continue\n      until the final follow-up visit."
