  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether vilazodone is more effective than
      citalopram for the treatment of anxious depression. We will use neuroimaging to see whether
      there are changes in the brains of patients receiving the drug vilazodone that are different
      from those of citalopram.  These changes may show that vilazodone affects the brain
      differently than most other kinds of standard antidepressant medications.

      This study proposes to utilize recent advances in magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)
      techniques that permit reliable measurement of Glu in humans (9) to examine whether
      Vilazodone and citalopram exert differential effects on Glutamatergic neurotransmission in
      the ACC of anxious unipolar depressed patients.  Functional connectivity as measured by
      Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) MRI will be assessed to determine the relationship
      between the change in connectivity and the change in Glu levels with treatment.  We also
      propose to examine, in an exploratory fashion, the relative effect of the two drugs on BOLD
      activation in the insula cortex.
