  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The positional plagiocephaly is a condition involving craniofacial asymmetry. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the spine, the posture and the psychomotor state in children who
      were diagnosed with infant plagiocephaly.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Positional infant plagiocephaly is a clinical entity in which the shape of an infant's head
      becomes altered as the result of external forces applied to the malleable bones of the
      cranium and can occur pre- or postnatally. It is characterized by asymmetric occipital
      flattening (one side or the central part of the occiput is flattened)with ipsilateral
      frontal bossing.Viewed from above, this results in a parallelogram deformity of the head. We
      hypothesize that children who had plagiocephaly when they were infants, they have postural
      and spine implications at 3-5 years old.
