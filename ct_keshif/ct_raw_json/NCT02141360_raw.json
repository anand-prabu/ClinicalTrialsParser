These associations will be\n      examined over the acute and sub-acute period (baseline to 3 months) following injury to\n      provide information useful for optimization of MR pulse sequences for mTBI applications.\n\n      The intent of this study is to broadly generate a range of potential mTBI biomarkers\n      detectable using investigational MR pulse sequence technologies. Feasibility data attained\n      in this study may be used for engineering program decision-making and in support of future\n      scientific assessment, engineering development, published research databases or registries\n      mTBI data and images, and other purposes determined by the Sponsor. The results of this\n      study are not intended for use in regulatory submissions.\n\n      Subjects will be examined on commercially available MR scanner using investigational or\n      standard of care MR coils and a series of investigational Application Packs containing a\n      predetermined set of MR pulse sequences optimized by Sponsor."
