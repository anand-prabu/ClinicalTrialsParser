Stereotactic radiation therapy may be able to send\n      x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Monoclonal antibodies,\n      such as ipilimumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of the\n      tumor to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing\n      substances to them. Giving SBRT with ipilimumab may be effective in treating melanoma."
