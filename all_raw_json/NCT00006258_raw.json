Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining more than one drug or combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may\n      kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by\n      radiation therapy in treating patients who have surgically resected, newly diagnosed\n      medulloblastoma or supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor, or incompletely resected\n      ependymoma."

Patients with M1+ disease (i.e., evidence\n      of dissemination beyond primary tumor site) also receive methotrexate IV over 4 hours on day\n      3. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning on day 7 and\n      continuing until blood counts recover. Chemotherapy continues every 21-28 days for a total\n      of 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then\n      undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6.5 weeks beginning 3-6 weeks after completion of\n      chemotherapy.\n\n      Patients are followed at 6 weeks, then every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 1\n      year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-20 patients will be accrued for this study."
