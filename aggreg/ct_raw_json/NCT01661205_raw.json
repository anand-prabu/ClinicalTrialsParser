The AtriCure Bipolar System will be used to perform the less\n      invasive cardiac surgery and a standard electrophysiology catheter, currently available,\n      will be used to perform the catheter ablation procedure. This surgical procedure is\n      considered less invasive because it is done through tiny surgical punctures on the sides of\n      the chest near the ribs instead of one large surgical incision of the breast bone to\n      completely open the chest and access the heart, and it also avoids the need for the\n      heart-lung bypass machine."
