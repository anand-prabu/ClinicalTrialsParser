  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patient study is a phase III trial designed as a single-blinded, randomised, controlled
      multi-centre trial with repeated measurement events (ME). Patients will be evaluated by a
      blinded assessor on five occasions: twice within two weeks at baseline before intervention
      start (BL, T0), once after eight treatment sessions (T1), once after the intervention (T2),
      and once after a two month follow-up period (FU). Figure 1 illustrates the study overview.

      The study focuses on the evaluation of the YouGrabber efficacy compared to conventional
      therapy in an outpatient setting.

      Research question: Do patients after stroke in the YouGrabber training group show higher
      postintervention performance in the Box and Block Test (BBT) compared to patients in the
      conventional therapy group? Hypothesis: H0: The investigators hypothesise that there will be
      no group differences after 16 training sessions or after the two month follow-up period.

      H1: The investigators hypothesise that there will be a group difference after the 16
      training sessions and after the two month follow-up period.

      Aim: The aim of the project is to design and implement a single-blinded, randomised
      controlled multi-centre trial comparing YouGrabber training and conventional therapy in
      patients after stroke.

      Patients will be randomly allocated to either the experimental group (EG) or the control
      group (CG) after the second ME (T0). Group allocation will be based on a computer-generated
      randomisation list (one for each centre, (MATLAB, 2007b, Mathworks Inc., USA) created by a
      researcher not involved into the study. Randomisation lists and corresponding token will be
      stored in the clinics' pharmacy. Patients will draw a token before the first therapy
      session. The token will be marked and stored until study finalisation in the pharmacy.

      Group allocation will remain concealed for the independent assessor until study
      finalisation. Patients and treating therapists will be reminded not to talk about patient's
      group allocation with other therapists or participants.

      Patients in both study groups (EG, CG) will receive the same amount of 16 sessions lasting
      for 45 minutes each. During each therapy appointment patients can decide to stop the
      training at any time.

      Patients allocated to EG will have the opportunity to participate in two semi-structured
      interviews to evaluate their expectations and experiences with the virtual reality therapy
      with YouGrabber.

      Treating therapists will have the opportunity to participate in one focus group meeting to
      evaluate their experiences with the virtual reality training, its advantages and
      disadvantages. Interview and focus group participation will be voluntary.
