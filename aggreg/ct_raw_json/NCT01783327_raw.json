Youth who participate in Teens-Connect will have better metabolic control (A1c)\n                and quality of life (QOL) than those who participate in Planet D.\n\n             2. These effects will be mediated by improvements in stress/coping, self-efficacy,\n                diabetes problem-solving, and self-management.\n\n             3. Teens-Connect prescribed by providers in diabetes clinics will be a cost-effective\n                approach to reduce A1c and improve quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for youth\n                with T1D.\n\n        2. To compare the reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (RE-AIM) of\n           the two provider-prescribed psycho-educational internet programs."
