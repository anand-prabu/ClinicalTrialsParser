            "textblock": "NF2 is a condition that mainly affects the skin and nervous system. It causes non-cancerous\n      tumors to grow on the nerves around a person's body. Some signs of NF2 include a gradual\n      loss of hearing and tumors growing on the skin, the brain and the spinal cord, which can\n      lead to complications.\n\n      AXITINIB is an oral drug (taken by mouth) that is approved by the United States Food and\n      Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of other types of tumors. However, in this\n      research study, AXITINIB is considered investigational because it is not approved by the FDA\n      for treatment of your medical condition (NF2). We know a lot about how well it is tolerated\n      (handled), but we do not know if it is effective in treating your condition.\n\n      This research study will test whether AXITINIB may shrink tumors commonly found in patients\n      with NF2 or stop them from growing. This will help us to decide if AXITINIB should be used\n      to treat NF2 patients in the future. AXITINIB is a drug that has been used to treat various\n      forms of cancer. It has not been studied for the treatment of tumors in NF2 patients. We\n      have selected AXITINIB for this clinical trial in patients with NF2 and NF2-related tumors\n      because a very similar drug, bevacizumab, can shrink VS in some NF2 patients.\n\n      Pfizer, Inc., the manufacturer of the study drug, AXITINIB, will provide the AXITINIB being\n      used in this study.\n\n      Primary Objective: To estimate the objective volumetric response rates to axitinib in adult\n      NF2 patients with VS.\n\n      Secondary Objectives: To assess the toxicity of axitinib given daily in patients with NF2\n      and to examine the association of objective measures of response on MRI, i.e. volumetric\n      tumor analysis with clinical measures of response, i.e. (audiogram), as well as quality of\n      life assessments (NFTI-QOL). In addition, response in non-VS tumors, such as other\n      schwannomas and meningiomas, may be explored."
