Its\n      increasing resistance to antibiotics requires the development of new strategies for\n      prevention and control, demanding a better understanding of the modes of transmission and\n      evolutionary dynamics of this bacteria. In patients under invasive mechanical ventilation,\n      the main mode of contamination by Pseudomonas remains debated, with 3 modes of contamination\n      (endogenous, crossed transmission between patients, or environmental origin) of varying\n      importance, mainly depending on the endemic situation of the place of study.\n\n      The emergence of new genotyping technologies (DiversiLab) can now facilitate studies of\n      molecular epidemiology. Thanks to the multidisciplinary collaboration and innovative\n      techniques, the investigators wish to study the impact of the mode of contamination on the\n      outcome of ICU patients, intubated and ventilated for more than 72 hours."
