      Indication: Patients with advanced lymphoid malignancies in the absence of an HLA identical
      or mismatch donor.

      Objectives: Overall survival at one year. Efficacy &gt;60%, rejection rate &lt;20%. Inclusion
      criteria: Age: 18-65 years old, no sibling or unrelated donor identified, low grade
      non-hodgkin lymphoma in third line (who already received at least one autologous
      transplantation); hodgkin lymphoma in early relapse (&lt;1 year), who received at least one
      autologous transplantation and sensible to chemotherapy and CLL with 17p deletion or in
      relapse less than 2 year after a fludarabine nbased regimen or in relapse after one
      autologous transplantation.

      Stem cell source: Two cord blood units containing both together more than 3x107 frozen
      nucleated cells/Kg with no more than 2 out of 6 HLA mismatches between them and with the
      patients.
