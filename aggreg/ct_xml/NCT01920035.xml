    <textblock>
      Localized cooling/hypothermia using the UroCool System during robotic-assisted radical
      prostatectomy (RARP) surgery results in an improved overall return to continence, (defined
      as not wearing any protective urinary pads), compared with standard of care in men
      presenting for RARP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the use of an endorectal cooling device, UroCool, to achieve
      controlled, local hypothermia of the pelvis. The study will evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of the device in inducing hypothermia of the neuromuscular tissues impacting
      continence during RARP.

      The UroCool system is designed to apply targeted temperature control to the pelvic anatomy
      during RARP. The pelvis is cooled transrectally via a closed cycle recirculation of chilled
      sterile saline using a single-use disposable balloon catheter connected via a circulation IV
      set to a control console that is covered by a current 510(k) and commercially available.

      The UroCool polymeric catheter is designed to be inserted within the rectal cavity adjacent
      to the prostate prior to surgery and removed upon completion of surgery. It is used in
      conjunction with the InnerCool Console which circulates cold saline in a closed loop within
      the UroCool catheter to allow for therapeutic localized cooling of the prostate gland and
      surrounding areas during prostate surgery.

    <measure>Improved return of overall continence.</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days post RARP</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The primary objective of the study is an improved return of overall continence measured at 90 days post RARP surgery. A favorable outcome would be improved overall continence in the RARP with hypothermia group versus the RARP without hypothermia group.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Faster return to continence.</measure>
    <time_frame>30, 60 and 90 days</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The secondary objective of the study is to see if men will achieve a return to continence faster if treated with hypothermia. This will be assessed at 30, 60 and 90 days. A favorable outcome would be a reduced time to continence in the RARP with hypothermia group versus the RARP without hypothermia group.</description>

    <measure>Reduction of overall severe incontinence</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The third objective is to assess reduction of overall severe incontinence. Severe incontinence is defined as the need for 3 or more pads in a 24 hour period. This will be assessed at 90 days, 6 and 12 months. A favorable outcome would be a reduction of overall severe incontinence in the RARP with hypothermia group versus the RARP without hypothermia group.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is male and a candidate for robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) for
             the treatment of prostate cancer

          -  Patient is over eighteen (&gt;18) years of age

          -  Patient reads, understands and speaks English fluently (U.S. Sites only)

          -  Subject understands and agrees to all pre-operative preparation procedures including
             a &quot;self-administered&quot; fleet enema

          -  Subject understands study procedures, risks of such procedures and is willing to
             comply with all study procedures

          -  Patient is willing and able to comply with all post-surgical milestones including
             completing and returning post-surgery follow up questionnaires at specified intervals
             over a 12 month period

          -  Subject agrees to participate in the study and is willing to sign the written
             informed consent per the enrolling site's institutional procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presents with baseline or has a history of urinary incontinence

          -  Rectal or GI pathology deemed unsuitable for placement of the treatment device by the
             examining physician

          -  Prior extensive pelvic surgery such as low anterior resection, abdominoperineal
             resection, or proctocolectomy continent stool pouch, or any other extensive
             abdominopelvic surgery that would render the patient a high-risk for complications as
             deemed by the surgeon

          -  History of prior treatment of any kind for prostate cancer; e.g. radiation therapy,
             cryotherapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), hormonal or chemotherapy

          -  Prior intra-operative injuries (for example: rectal injury)

          -  Inadequate hemostasis

          -  Serious concurrent medical condition likely to result in death during the next 12
             months. Any other acute or chronic condition which the Investigator believes will
             unacceptably increase the risk of study participation or interfere with study
             procedures and assessments.

          -  Active or recent (within 1 month prior to study enrollment) participation in another
             investigational clinical research study or planned to be enrolled in another study of
             prostate therapy.
