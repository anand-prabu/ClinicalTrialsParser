On the day of\n      planning the oncologic treatment Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) will be offered to\n      patients aged 60 and up. Based on the CGA a tailored multidisciplinary intervention is\n      planned with the patients. The study aim is to test different screening methods to find the\n      best suited method to select the frail geriatric patients in order to be able to select the\n      frail patients in a planned later study, estimate the effect of CGA on these patients in\n      order to be able to calculate the needed number of patients  and to estimate the time\n      consumption in this latter study . The hypothesis is that the screening method G8 is\n      superior to Performance Status(PS) and clinical oncologist\u00b4 evaluation and that CGA improves\n      survival amongst Patients aged 60 or more with NSCLC and prevents hospitalisation and\n      complications to the oncologic treatment."
