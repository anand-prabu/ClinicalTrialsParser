      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that the vaccination with Zostavax is
      non-inferior to placebo injection in a population of patients that are currently over the
      age of 50 and on an anti-TNF.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Herpes zoster (HZ), also known as &quot;shingles&quot;, is caused by reactivation and multiplication
      of the ubiquitous varicella zoster virus (VZV) that remains latent in everyone's sensory
      neurons following varicella, or &quot;chickenpox&quot;.  Among individuals who live to age 85, the
      lifetime risk for HZ is 50%, and more than one in five individuals affected by zoster
      develop post-herpetic neuralgia, resulting in chronic pain. Other serious complications
      include encephalitis, permanent vision loss, or more rarely, dissemination and death.
      Fortunately, a live attenuated vaccine is available and can reduce HZ risk by up to 70%.
      For patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), this vaccine has great potential to provide
      improved quality of life by reducing the incidence and complications associated with zoster.
      Due to the underlying disease and/or treatments (e.g. steroids) for rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA), the risk of herpes zoster in RA patients is approximately double that in the general
      population. This increased risk should make prevention of zoster and therefore vaccination
      exceedingly important for RA patients. In fact, because of a higher overall absolute risk
      for zoster in RA, the vaccine yields a comparable or even greater absolute risk reduction to
      reduce the risk of shingles and post-herpetic neuralgia in an RA population as it does in
      the general population. However, the use of the zoster vaccine in RA patients is very low (&lt;
      5%), and less frequently used than for the general population.

      National guidelines from the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)
      recommend a single dose of the zoster vaccine for all individuals age 60 or older, with the
      vaccine more recently gaining FDA-approval for administration to persons age 50 and older.
      While a large number of RA patients would otherwise be recommended to receive this vaccine
      on the basis of age, theoretical safety concerns related to vaccination likely explain the
      very low vaccination rates observed. Currently, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA), the
      ACIP, and the ACR consider the live zoster vaccine contraindicated in patients receiving
      immunosuppressive medications, such as biologic therapies. Such contraindication stems from
      the theoretical safety concern that these individuals could develop a disseminated
      varicella-like infection from the vaccine virus strain. However, the investigators
      hypothesize that this vaccine can safely be given in this setting, as there are no published
      data to suggest that these safety concerns are warranted, and a growing body of
      observational data suggest that vaccinating RA patients receiving biologic therapies with
      this vaccine may in fact be safe. Moreover, and similarly with little or no evidence, the
      ACIP considers the vaccine safe and acceptable for patients using methotrexate at doses
      commonly used to treat RA (e.g. &lt;= 25mg/week) and for patients using glucocorticoids at
      prednisone-equivalent doses of ≤ 20 mg/day.

      In light of 1) a substantial elevated HZ risk among RA patients; 2) national data showing
      most RA patients are not vaccinated for HZ; and 3) the high effectiveness of this vaccine in
      the general population, the investigators propose to conduct the Varicella zostER VaccinE
      (VERVE) trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and long-term effectiveness of the live herpes zoster vaccine. This pilot
      study will recruit the first 125 patients of the needed 4,000 individuals age 50 years or
      older currently receiving anti-TNF therapy for RA or other inflammatory arthritis. Within a
      relevant 6 week safety window, the investigators will collect serious adverse events
      (satisfying a regulatory definition of a SAE) including non-serious events of vaccine-strain
      varicella-like infection or herpes zoster. Beyond the key public health importance of the
      clinical question being addressed, clinical trial methodological innovations proposed for
      this unique large pragmatic trial. Additionally, the investigators will study vaccine
      tolerability and long term effectiveness through a linkage to health plan data to allow for
      cost-effective follow-up while minimizing participant and study-site burden.

          -  Must be currently treated with an anti-TNF therapy at the time of vaccination.
             Specifically, most recent weekly etanercept dose must have occurred within 7 days,
             most recent adalimumab dose must have occurred within 14 days, most recent
             certolizumab dose must have occurred within 14 days, most recent golimumab dose must

             arthritis or a spondyloarthropathy such as psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing
             spondylitis or enteropathic arthritis). Based upon the age requirement and RA
             prevalence, we expect the vast majority of patients will have rheumatoid arthritis.

             chicken pox) or long-term residence (&gt;30 years) in the continental US.

          -  The first 100 patients recruited to phase I must not have received any oral or
             systemic glucocorticoids within 30 days prior to vaccination. Intra-articular

             minimum of 30 days prior to vaccination.

          -  Eligible women must be post-menopausal (&gt; 1 year since last menstrual period) or have
             a surgical history of bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior use of the zoster vaccine (Zostavax®, Merck)

             gelatin or any other vaccine component

          -  Known HIV/AIDS

          -  Currently receiving radiation or chemotherapy for any type of malignancy

          -  Any current use (within the last 30 days) of acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir

          -  Participated in an investigational study within 1 month prior to study entry

          -  Active drug or alcohol use, dependence, or any other reason that, in the opinion of
             the site investigator, would interfere with the study

          -  Significant underlying illness that would be expected to prevent completion of the
             study (e.g., life-threatening disease likely to limit survival to less than 3 years)

          -  Any other reason that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would interfere with
             required study related evaluations (e.g. uncontrolled comorbidity, life expectancy &lt;
             1 year)Patients who have household contact with varicella-susceptible pregnant women
             or severely immunosuppressed individuals without history of primary varicella.
