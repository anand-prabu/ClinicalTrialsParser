Patients are stratified according to center and grade of dysplasia at baseline (low\n      vs high). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily for 48-96 weeks.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo as in arm I. Treatment continues in both arms in\n           the absence of unacceptable toxicity or development of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus\n           or cancer at other sites.\n\n      Patients are followed at 12 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients (100 per arm) will be accrued for this study."
