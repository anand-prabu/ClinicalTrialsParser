Determine the objective response rate in patients with advanced, recurrent,\n      or inoperable ovarian epithelial cancer treated with aminocamptothecin as second-line\n      therapy. II. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Correlate\n      the topoisomerase-I levels with response in patients with accessible tumors treated with\n      this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease (measurable vs nonmeasurable). (The\n      measurable disease stratum closed to accrual effective 08/1998.) Patients receive\n      aminocamptothecin IV continuously on days 1-3. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence\n      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete response (CR)\n      receive 4 additional courses past CR. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years,\n      every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per stratum) will be accrued for this study\n      within approximately 15 months. (The measurable disease stratum closed to accrual effective\n      08/1998.)"
