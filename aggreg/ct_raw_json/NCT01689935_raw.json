            "textblock": "This research study aims to compare different methods for helping difficult to treat or\n      scarring (cystic) acne, ALA-PDT and i-PDT.\n\n      There is an investigational procedure called photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) that has been\n      reported to be very efficient for acne treatment since 2000. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses\n      a drug called ALA (aminolevulinic acid), which is marketed as Levulan\u00ae.\n\n      Levulan\u00ae is applied directly to facial/back acne. This is the way that it is usually\n      applied. Levulan\u00ae is left on the skin for three hours so the skin can absorb it. Next, the\n      skin where the Levulan\u00ae was applied is exposed to a red light for activation.\n\n      The sebaceous glands get obstructed and inflamed causing acne. ALA gets down under your skin\n      through the skin pores to where the glands are. PDT destroys the glands reducing the acne\n      lesion.\n\n      Levulan\u00ae is absorbed by normal skin surrounding the oil glands. Therefore, this procedure\n      also has some side effects. Some of the side effects include pain, burning sensation during\n      the procedure, and redness, tenderness, and swelling after the procedure.\n\n      At Massachusetts General Hospital's Wellman Center for Photomedicine, the investigators\n      developed another procedure called inhibitory-PDT (i-PDT) that is similar to ALA-PDT. i-PDT\n      is aimed at reducing the side-effects of ALA- PDT.\n\n      The difference between these two procedures is that i-PDT uses a light source that will\n      prevent Levulan\u00ae accumulation in the normal skin surface. The investigators would like to\n      find out if Levulan\u00ae will be placed only inside the sebaceous glands."
