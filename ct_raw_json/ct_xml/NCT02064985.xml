      open label, single centre, randomised, Phase IV, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and
      safety study to evaluate single and multiple doses of 45, 60, and 90 mg of ticagrelor in
      Chinese patients with stable coronary heart disease

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 36 patients will be randomized in order to ensure 10 patients per treatment are
      evaluable.Ticagrelor will be supplied as 45 mg, 60mg, and 90mg tablets. Following an 8 hour
      fast on single dose on Day 1 and Day 7; on multiple doses from Day 3 to Day 6. Prior to the
      first dose of study drug there will be a screening period of maximum of 19 days.  Patients
      will report to the clinical pharmacology unit (CPU) on Day -2 and will remain confined there
      until completion of study procedures on Day 7, the patients will be discharged on Day 8.  In
      addition, patients will return to the CPU for a follow up visit 2 to 5 days after the last
      dose.  Each patients participation, including the screening period, will take approximately
      33 days.

    <description>To assess the safety of ticagrelor in Chinese patients with stable coronary heart disease on chronic low dose ASA.
Safety will be assessed by:
Vital signs (seated blood pressure [BP], pulse)
Physical examination
