Analyze any expression of interferon-inducible genes in tumor tissues of these patients\n      after receiving this regimen.\n\n      IV. Characterize natural killer cytokine production in patients treated with this regimen.\n\n      V. Determine serum interferon gamma levels in patients treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      This is a dose escalation study of interleukin-12 (IL-12).\n\n      Patients receive an initial loading dose of trastuzumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1 of the\n      first week and a maintenance dose of trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 of each\n      subsequent week.

The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients\n      experience dose limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter for\n      survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months."
