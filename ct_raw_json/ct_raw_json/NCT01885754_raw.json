            "textblock": "Rationale: With 1.6 million new cases diagnosed each year and 1.3 million deaths, lung\n      cancer is the leading cancer-related death worldwide and it represents a pressing health\n      issue. Patients with lung cancer are more likely to experience cachexia, a severe\n      debilitating disorder causing fatigue, weight loss, muscle wasting and associated with\n      reduced physical function, increased chemotherapy toxicity and reduced survival. This\n      syndrome occurring in about 80% of advanced cancer patients is the direct cause of death in\n      about 20% of cases. However, despite the importance of cachexia in lung cancer, its\n      mechanisms ans its relation with muscle function and effort tolerance are still unknown.\n\n      Aim: To explore muscle function, signaling pathways and its relationship to impaired\n      functional capacity of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer(NSCLC); depending of whether\n      they have cachexic state at diagnosis.\n\n      Methods: This study will be conducted at the Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de\n      pneumologie de Qu\u00e9bec. 56 patients newly diagnosed of NSCLC will be recruited and separated\n      whether or not they have a cachexic state. The evaluation will need two visits separated by\n      5 days.\n\n      During the evaluation the following tests will be done:\n\n        -  Anthropometric measures\n\n        -  Level of daily physical activity\n\n        -  Pulmonary function test\n\n        -  Maximal incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test on ergocycle\n\n        -  Endurance test on ergocycle\n\n        -  Muscle function tests\n\n        -  Magnetic stimulation\n\n        -  Quadriceps biopsy"
