Insulin resistance is a\n      pathophysiologic hallmark of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The incretin effect\n      in patients with NAFLD has not been studied. The aim of this study is to quantify GLP-1\n      secretion in response to oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) in patients with NAFLD compared\n      to healthy controls. The results of this study will expand the knowledge of the\n      pathophysiology of NAFLD and serve as a rational for potential future treatment strategies."
