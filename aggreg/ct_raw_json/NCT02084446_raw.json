Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two groups\n      (everolimus with very low dose of tacrolimus versus sodium mycophenolate with low dose of\n      tacrolimus).\n\n      Approximately 120 patients who meet the inclusion criteria will receive their first dose\n      everolimus (initial dose of 1 mg twice a day) or sodium mycophenolate (initial dose of 720\n      mg twice a day) not more than 24 hours after transplantation. Everolimus trough blood levels\n      will be measured at pre-specified timepoints in order to ensure that trough levels are above\n      3 ng/ml and below 8 ng/ml for the duration of the study.\n\n      Tacrolimus will be started within 48 hours after graft reperfusion at an initial dose of 0.1\n      mg/kg/day. The dose of tacrolimus will be adjusted to target the C-0h value within the\n      pre-established desired range.\n\n      In the everolimus group with very low dose of tacrolimus, tacrolimus dose should be reduced\n      at the end of months three after transplantation. Patients with either acute rejection grade\n      \u2265 Banff IIB or more than one treated acute rejection since entering the study and patients\n      with either acute rejection during the third month will not have the dose of tacrolimus\n      reduced; however, they will be encouraged to remain in the study. These patients will be\n      excluded from the per protocol population analysis, but will be analyzed in the Intention To\n      Treat population.\n\n      If patients present delayed graft function (DGF), the start of tacrolimus can be postponed\n      for up to and including 7 days.\n\n      During the 12 months treatment period, patient visits will occur at the selection visit,\n      baseline visit, at 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks and at 3, 6 and 12 months. Day 1 is the day of the\n      first administration of everolimus or sodium mycophenolate.\n\n      Population: Study population will consist of a group of male or female transplant recipients\n      18-75 years of age undergoing primary renal transplantation and who received an organ from a\n      living or deceased donor."
