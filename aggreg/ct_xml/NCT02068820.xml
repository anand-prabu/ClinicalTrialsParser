  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesis is that if sensitivity and specificity are found to be
      significantly higher than the current reports with Technesium-99 and ISB colorimetric dye,
      SLN biopsies might allow omission of full lymphadenectomy in lower-risk cases, thereby
      limiting peri-operative morbidity. SLN biopsies might also improve the detection of
      metastatic disease, essentially lowering the recognized false-negative rate of standard
      lymphadenectomy analyzed by routine H&amp;E pathologic analysis.

    <textblock>
      The study objective is to compare two sentinel lymph node detection technologies
      [fluorescence imaging and Indocyanine Green (ICG) dye verses standard laparoscopic
      colorimetric analysis using Isosulfan Blue (ISB) dye] for sensitivity and specificity of
      detecting metastatic disease in pelvic lymph nodes of women with endometrial cancer
      undergoing robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy. The following
      three specific aims would be addressed in this research proposal:

      Specific Aim 1: To determine the ability of mapping bilaterally pelvic SLN in women with
      endometrial cancer undergoing robotic-assisted laparoscopic staging comparing two different
      methods (i.e., comparing the combination of colorimetric analysis-ISB dye + fluorescence
      imaging-ICG dye vs. colorimetric analysis-ISB dye alone).

      Specific Aim 2: To estimate the negative predictive value (NPV) of pelvic SLN in endometrial
      cancer with respect to predicting nodal metastasis.

      Specific Aim 3: To evaluate the ability of sentinel lymph nodes to increase the detection of
      metastatic disease through ultra-sectioning and immuno-histochemical (IHC) staining by
      comparing IHC results and standard hematoxolin and eosin (H&amp;E) results.
