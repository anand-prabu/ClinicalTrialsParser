      This clinical trial studies bioelectrical impedance measurement for predicting treatment
      outcome in patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia. Diagnostic procedures, such as
      bioelectrical impedance measurement, may help predict a patient's response to treatment for
      acute leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I: To determine the feasibility of obtaining standardized phase angle measurements
      (bioelectrical impedance measurement) on patients hospitalized for treatment of newly
      diagnosed acute leukemia.

      II. To evaluate the association between standardized phase angle measured at the start of
      therapy and treatment-related outcomes including treatment related mortality (defined as
      60-day mortality) III. Evaluate the association of the day 14 standardized phase angle and
      treatment related outcomes, 30-day mortality, length of hospitalization, transfer to
      intensive care unit during induction, treatment response (14 day bone marrow response,
      complete remission), receipt of post-remission therapy, overall survival.

      IV. An exploratory analysis investigating associations with the primary and secondary
      outcomes using different ways to categorize the baseline standardized phase angle and, for
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, the standardized phase angle measure obtained just
      prior to the nadir marrow.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo bioelectrical impedance phase angle measurement on day 1 of treatment.
      Patients with AML undergo a second measurement prior to the nadir marrow. Patients also
      undergo bioelectrical impedance measurements prior to any invasive procedures (bone marrow
      biopsy, leukapheresis, peripherally inserted central catheter [PICC] line placement, etc.).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for two years.
