The A1C tests should meet the following criteria:\n\n               -  They should have been taken a minimum of 90 days apart while on insulin pump\n                  therapy\n\n               -  They should not differ by more than an absolute value of 0.5% (e.g. 7% vs. 7.5%,\n                  9% vs. 9.5%)\n\n               -  They should be verifiable via source documentation\n\n               -  They should have been run by the same method/assay which may include Point of\n                  Care or local laboratory measurements. For example: Both A1Cs should have been\n                  measured by the same model point-of-care (POC) machine or both tests should have\n                  been processed in the same lab.\n\n          -  Subject has been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus  and must have been\n             diagnosed for at least one year prior to screening\n\n          -  Subject is currently transitioning from pump therapy or SAP to SAP using the study\n             pump with TS feature\n\n          -  Subject is willing to perform greater than or equal to 4 finger stick blood glucose\n             measurements daily\n\n          -  Subject is willing to perform required sensor calibrations\n\n          -  Subject is willing to wear the system (Pump, glucose sensors, meter) continuously\n             throughout the study\n\n          -  Subject is willing to upload data every 21 days from the study pump\n\n          -  Subject must have Internet access and access to a computer system that meets the\n             requirements for uploading the pumps.
