Patients are randomized to receive either a single bolus of ketamine\n      (0.3 mg/kg) or a single bolus of morphine (0.05mg/kg). All subsequent pain management will\n      be accomplished using morphine. Patient, family member, and research staff pain scores will\n      be recorded, until 3 hours post study medication administration.  Family members are\n      contacted via telephone 24 hours post-ED discharge, and again at 7 days post-hospital\n      discharge, for evaluation via Post Hospitalization Behavior Questionnaire. Narcotic\n      equivalents will be calculated for up to 3 hours post study medication administration and\n      compared between the ketamine and morphine groups."
