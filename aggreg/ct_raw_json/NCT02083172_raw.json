            "textblock": "2D-echo is the standard-of-care tool for non-invasive hemodynamic assessments in children.\n      The use of 2D-echo requires highly trained personnel, and assessments may take anywhere\n      between 30-45 minutes. The feasibility of real time hemodynamic assessments is therefore\n      limited with 2D-echo. USCOM has been introduced as a non-invasive bedside hemodynamic\n      monitoring tool that utilizes continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound. As USCOM is easily\n      portable, and measurements take only several minutes and can be conducted by trained\n      physicians or nurses, it has become an attractive method of real time hemodynamic monitoring\n      of unstable patients. While USCOM validation studies have been conducted in adult, neonatal\n      and pediatric populations, the following concerns have been raised: a) Pediatric data on the\n      agreement between USCOM and other standard methods of CO measurement (i.e. 2D-echo,\n      pulmonary artery catheterization) are conflicting with some studies reporting acceptable\n      agreement, while others report poor agreement ; b) USCOM validation and agreement studies\n      were previously conducted in primarily hemodynamically stable populations. Its performance\n      in hemodynamically unstable and mechanically ventilated patients has not been studied to\n      date in the pediatric population.USCOM is currently being  promoted as a real-time tool for\n      assessing hemodynamic status, and directing the care of unstable children without adequate\n      evidence. Therefore, this study is essential to inform the validity of USCOM and whether it\n      can or should be used when 2D-echo for real time hemodynamic monitoring in children is not\n      feasible or available."
