            "textblock": "In this single-blind, sham-controlled study, the investigators aim to assess whether\n      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS; a safe and non-invasive method for modulating\n      the activity of specific brain regions) when applied over the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) or\n      the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is able to enhance decision-making abilities and\n      reduce impulsivity levels in healthy volunteers.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that tDCS particularly over the left OFC and the right DLPFC,\n      in comparison to sham rTMS, will significantly enhance decision-making and decrease\n      impulsivity.\n\n      The investigators will enroll 110 healthy individuals aged 18-45 years. These individuals\n      will be assessed with several instruments (including clinician-administered, self-reported\n      and computer-based) Assessments will be carried out before and after a 30-minute tDCS\n      session.\n\n      Our study could result in a better understanding of the neurobiological basis of well-known\n      predisposing factors for suicidal behavior in subjects at high risk for suicide, namely\n      decision-making deficits and heightened impulsivity. Undoubtedly, a novel safe and\n      non-invasive method for decreasing the vulnerability to suicidality among high risk\n      individuals would be a promising therapeutic intervention for suicide prevention."
