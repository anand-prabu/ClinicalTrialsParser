      The purpose of this research study is to compare the effects of music and different levels
      of device-guided breathing on anxiety and shortness of breath in lung cancer survivors.

      OBJECTIVES

        1. To assess feasibility (accrual, participation, adherence, retention) of a randomized
           study of device-guided breathing and music in 75 post-treatment ESLC survivors with
           significant anxiety.

        2. To obtain preliminary data on the variability and efficacy of two doses of a
           device-guided breathing intervention versus a music control group for reducing anxiety
           (primary outcome) and for improving self-reported dyspnea and respiratory functioning
           (secondary outcomes) in post-treatment lung cancer survivors.

        3. To select the optimal dose of the device-guided breathing intervention (15 minutes
           once/day or twice/day) for subsequent randomized study.
