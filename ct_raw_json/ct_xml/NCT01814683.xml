      The main determinant of primaquine efficacy is the total dose of primaquine administered,
      rather than the dosing schedule. Previous trials have demonstrated that the standard low
      dose regimen of primaquine (3.5 mg/kg total) fails to prevent relapses in many different
      endemic locations. For this reason the 2010 WHO antimalarial guidelines now recommend a high
      dose regimen of 7 mg/kg (equivalent to an adult dose of 30mg per day), although many
      countries still recommend lower doses for fear of causing more serious harm to unscreened
      G6PDd patients.

      Shorter courses of higher daily doses of primaquine have the potential to improve adherence
      and thus effectiveness without compromising efficacy. Primaquine also has relatively weak
      but clinically relevant asexual stage activity against P. vivax so larger daily doses may
      substantially augment chloroquine's blood stage activity at low levels of resistance. In
      Thailand directly observed primaquine (1mg/kg/day) administered over 7 days was well
      tolerated and reduced relapses by day 28 to 4%. This is encouraging but not definitive since
      many relapses present after one month. Longer follow-up is needed to distinguish whether
      relapse was prevented or deferred. If the efficacy, tolerability and safety of short-course,
      high-dose primaquine regimens can be assured across the range of endemic settings, along
      with reliable point-of-care G6PDd diagnostics, then this new primaquine regimen would be a
      major advance in malaria treatment improving adherence to and thus the effectiveness of
      anti-relapse therapy.

      Due to the long duration of standard primaquine treatment regimens, courses are difficult to
      supervise, are poorly adhered to and lack effectiveness. This proposed multicentre
      randomised clinical trial will provide evidence across a variety of endemic settings on the
      safety and efficacy of high dose-short course primaquine in G6PD normal patients. In a
      parallel single arm study the investigators will also gather safety data on the use of
      weekly primaquine in patients with G6PDd. This study aims to generate evidence that will
      directly inform global public health policy for the radical cure of P. vivax. A better
      understanding of the risks and benefits of primaquine is crucial in persuading policy makers
      and clinicians of the importance of the radical cure of vivax malaria that will reduce the
      parasite reservoir and decrease transmission.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plasmodium vivax malaria is a major cause of morbidity and now recognised as an important
      contributor to mortality in endemic areas. Unlike P. falciparum malaria, P. vivax infections
      form dormant liver stages (hypnozoites) which cause relapses of the infection weeks to
      months after the initial attack for up to about 2 years. Relapse rates in South-East Asia
      commonly exceed 50%, often making relapse the main cause of vivax illness. Repeated relapse
      is particularly damaging to the health and development of children in vivax endemic areas.
      The first line treatment of vivax malaria is a combination of chloroquine (providing blood
      schizontocidal activity), and primaquine (providing liver hypnozoitocidal activity). However
      chloroquine resistance is increasing in many vivax endemic areas and adherence to 14 day
      primaquine regimens is very poor. This is a major threat to current malaria control and
      elimination initiatives. Primaquine, an 8 aminoquinoline, is currently the only licensed
      drug with activity against hypnozoites. An important constraint on the global deployment of
      primaquine is its potential to cause haemolysis in patients with glucose-6-phosphate
      dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd), which typically occurs in 2-15% (and up to 40%) of
      patients in endemic zones. Individuals who have less than 10% of normal enzyme activity are
      at risk of life-threatening haemolysis whereas those with milder variants may have
      negligible effects. In practice the lack of available robust diagnostics for G6PDd, concerns
      over drug toxicity, and the misperceived benign nature of P. vivax infection results in
      healthcare providers rarely prescribing primaquine even when recommended in policy.

      The main determinant of primaquine efficacy is the total dose of primaquine administered,
      rather than the dosing schedule. Previous trials have demonstrated that the standard low
      dose regimen of primaquine (3.5 mg/kg total) fails to prevent relapses in many different
      endemic locations. For this reason the 2010 WHO antimalarial guidelines now recommend a high
      dose regimen of 7 mg/kg (equivalent to an adult dose of 30mg per day), although many
      countries still recommend lower doses for fear of causing more serious harm to unscreened
      G6PDd patients.

      Shorter courses of higher daily doses of primaquine have the potential to improve adherence
      and thus effectiveness without compromising efficacy. Primaquine also has relatively weak
      but clinically relevant asexual stage activity against P. vivax so larger daily doses may
      substantially augment chloroquine's blood stage activity at low levels of resistance. In
      Thailand directly observed primaquine (1mg/kg/day) administered over 7 days was well
      tolerated and reduced relapses by day 28 to 4%. This is encouraging but not definitive since
      many relapses present after one month. Longer follow-up is needed to distinguish whether
      relapse was prevented or deferred. If the efficacy, tolerability and safety of short-course,
      high-dose primaquine regimens can be assured across the range of endemic settings, along
      with reliable point-of-care G6PDd diagnostics, then this new primaquine regimen would be a
      major advance in malaria treatment improving adherence to and thus the effectiveness of
      anti-relapse therapy.

      The radical cure of P. vivax in patients with known G6PDd is challenging. Current WHO
      guidelines recommend a weekly dose of 0.75 mg/kg for 8 weeks which mitigates
      primaquine-induced haemolysis whilst retaining efficacy. The weekly dosing schedule was
      derived from studies in the USA in a small number of healthy adults with the mildly
      primaquine-sensitive African A- G6PDd variant. Since host vulnerability to haemolysis varies
      between the over 100 different G6PDd variants, the available evidence is inadequate to
      ensure the universal safety of a 0.75mg/kg dose either as a single dose, as advocated for
      reducing the transmission of falciparum malaria, or a weekly dose for the radical cure of
      vivax malaria.

      Due to the long duration of standard primaquine treatment regimens, courses are difficult to
      supervise, are poorly adhered to and lack effectiveness. This proposed multicentre
      randomised clinical trial will provide evidence across a variety of endemic settings on the
      safety and efficacy of high dose-short course primaquine in G6PD normal patients. In a
      parallel single arm study the investigators will also gather safety data on the use of
      weekly primaquine in patients with G6PDd. This study aims to generate evidence that will
      directly inform global public health policy for the radical cure of P. vivax. A better
      understanding of the risks and benefits of primaquine is crucial in persuading policy makers
      and clinicians of the importance of the radical cure of vivax malaria that will reduce the
      parasite reservoir and decrease transmission.

             severe febrile condition other than malaria); coadministration of other medication
