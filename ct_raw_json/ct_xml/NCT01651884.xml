  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the changes in language processing of patients with
      chronic aphasia after receiving non-invasive brain stimulation.Previous research using
      traditional transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) using 2 sponge electrodes has
      shown that persons with aphasia show more improvement after treatment when that treatment is
      accompanied by brain stimulation. Traditional tDCS has recently been modified to deliver
      current to more specific locations in the brain. This new delivery method is called
      high-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS). It is not known whether traditional tDCS (more diffuse
      current delivery) or HD-tDCS (more focal current delivery) will be the better approach for
      enhancing treatment outcomes. To answer this question, computerized speech-language
      treatment will be administered during the application of the different forms of brain
      stimulation.

          2. factors contraindicative of tDCS administration (sensitive scalp, previous brain
             surgery)

          3. prior history of epileptic or unprovoked seizures occurring during the previous 12
             months.
