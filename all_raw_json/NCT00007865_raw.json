Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells\n      and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal\n      cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy combined with\n      rituximab in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."

Treatment continues every 21 days\n      for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who\n      are not candidates for autologous stem cell transplantation may receive 1-4 more courses of\n      chemotherapy without rituximab.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1 month.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-39 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
