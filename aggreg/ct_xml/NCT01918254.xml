  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label dose-escalation study with an extension phase will evaluate the
      safety and pharmacokinetics of RO5479599 in combination with Perjeta (pertuzumab) and
      paclitaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer expressing HER3 &amp; HER2 protein. Cohorts
      of patients will receive escalating doses of RO5479599 intravenously (i.v.) every three
      weeks in combination with Perjeta 840 mg i.v. initial dose followed by 420 mg i.v. every
      three weeks and paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 i.v. weekly. Anticipated time on study treatment is
      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

             pathology review

          -  HER2 status confirmed on same tumor/metastases by a central laboratory. BC tumors
             and/or metastases must be HER2 IHC 1+/ISH- or HER2 ICH 2+/ISH- as assessed by
