Evaluate the effect of\n      different doses of Biomed 101 on the incidence and severity of IL-2 related toxicities and\n      on the incidence and frequency of IL-2 dose reduction due to IL-2 induced toxicity.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of Biomed 101. Patients receive oral Biomed 101\n      three times daily, followed by interleukin-2 IV on days 1-5 and 16-20. Cohorts of 5 patients\n      receive escalating doses of Biomed 101 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.\n      The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 5 patients experience\n      dose limiting toxicities. Patients are followed for 1 month.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study."
