Part 2 is a randomized 3-arm Phase II study to evaluate the\n      clinical efficacy and safety of pazopanib + MK 3475 as compared to single-agent pazopanib\n      and single-agent MK 3475. The objectives of this Phase I/II study are to test the safety and\n      tolerability of pazopanib in combination with MK 3475, and study the clinical efficacy of\n      pazopanib in combination with MK 3475 in subjects with advanced RCC as compared with\n      single-agent pazopanib and single-agent MK 3475."
