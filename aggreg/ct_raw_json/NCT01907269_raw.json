The content will be uniquely tailored to each person based on barriers to\n      care, age and race/ethnicity.  We will conduct a controlled, cluster-randomized trial of\n      this intervention to determine differences in post-intervention rates of osteoporosis care\n      between two randomization arms.\n\n      We hypothesize that participants randomized to the intervention arm, compared to those\n      randomized to a control arm, will receive more osteoporosis care at 6 months\n      post-intervention, as evidenced by higher rates of: (H1) Prescription osteoporosis\n      therapies, (H2) Non-prescription therapy with calcium and vitamin D, and (H3) Bone mineral\n      density (BMD) testing."
