The proposed\n      project will be a randomized controlled trial to evaluate an innovative methodology for\n      delivering clinical hypnosis (virtual reality hypnosis) for pain control as well as a more\n      time-honored delivery system that uses audio recordings. The goal will be to reduce\n      postoperative pain in a sample of patients hospitalized for the care of severe orthopedic\n      trauma. This proposal will test innovative and low-risk approaches to reducing postoperative\n      trauma pain that are designed to reduce pain, anxiety and other complications after surgery.\n      The findings have the potential not only to reduce pain and suffering in patients who have\n      suffered severe orthopedic trauma but could be applicable to the millions of people who have\n      surgery every year. Reducing addictive opiate-based medication and health care costs are\n      both potential outcomes from this project."
