    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in 2 separate stages, the first in adolescents and the second
      in children. Both Stages 1 and 2 will use an adaptive, single or multiple cohort open-label,
      single-treatment, fasting design examining the pharmacokinetic (PK) effects of up to 2
      separate modified release formulations (B and C) of HLD200 (54 mg).

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential (i.e., post-menarche) required to have a

             results (e.g., psychosis, bipolar disorder);

          -  Known history of moderate to severe asthma;

          -  Known history of severe allergic reaction (including drugs, food, insect bites,
             environmental allergens);

          -  Known history of seizures (except febrile seizures prior to age 5), anorexia nervosa,

          -  Positive history for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV);

          -  Positive screening for illicit drug use, and/or current health conditions or use of
             medications that might confound the results of the study or increase risk to the
             subject;

          -  Use of prescription medications (except ADHD medications) within 7 days and over-the
             counter medications (except birth control) within the 3 days preceding study
             enrollment, unless deemed acceptable by the Investigator and Clinical and/or Medical
             Monitor;

          -  Blood draws of 50 ml to 249 ml within the 30 days, 250 ml to 449 ml within the 45
             days and ≥ 450 ml within the 60 days preceding study enrollment;

          -  Participation in clinical trial with an investigational drug within the 30 days
             preceding study enrollment;

          -  Intolerance to venipuncture; and

          -  Current suicidal ideation or history of suicidality determined as a significant
             finding on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) by the investigator
             (Baseline C-SSRS for adolescents; Pediatric Baseline C-SSRS for children).
