  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with heart failure are reported to have lower levels of hydrogen sulfide in their
      blood, even though sulfur is available naturally in the diet.  Hydrogen sulfide is a
      molecule that has been shown to have a number of beneficial effects and thus the low levels
      may contribute to the disease. This trial is testing whether a medical food product of
      synthetic sulfur molecules, SG1002, can overcome this deficit in blood levels of hydrogen
      sulfide.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with heart failure have been shown to have a deficit in circulating hydrogen
      sulfide levels, which, since sulfur is not readily bioavailable and is declining in food
      substances, cannot be treated adequately by diet alone.  This deficit in circulating
      hydrogen sulfide is thought to lead to increases in oxidative stress and with this,
      associated problems that can contribute to heart failure.  This is a study to evaluate the
      safety and ability of multiple doses of oral SG1002 in subjects with heart failure to
      reverse the deficits in circulating hydrogen sulfide.  The primary objective is to assess
      the safety and the ability of multiple doses of twice daily administration of SG1002
      compared with placebo to increase circulating levels of hydrogen sulfide.  Initially, a dose
      escalation study will be carried out for 21 days in 4 normal subjects, randomized 3:1
      active:placebo.  Subjects will receive a 200 mg dose BID for 7 days and in no adverse
      events, escalate to 400 mg for 7 days then 800 mg for 7 days.  Safety parameters will be
      assessed for each dose, along with pharmacokinetic analysis and markers of oxidative stress
      and heart failure.  Following completion of the normal healthy subjects, 10 heart failure
      subjects will be randomized 4:1 active:placebo and tested as described above.
