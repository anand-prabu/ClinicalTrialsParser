However,\n      since one PET study in humans has shown low occupancy of the serotonin by buspirone in\n      clinical doses and since the DRD3 has been recently implicated in anxiety, some therapeutic\n      effects of buspirone may be mediated through the DRD3. In human clinical studies, promising\n      effects of buspirone have been reported for treatment of substance dependence, including\n      tobacco, marijuana, and opiates, and clinical studies in cocaine dependent subjects are\n      underway. However, it is unclear if buspirone is producing those effects through the DRD3\n      and no human study has incorporated a PET imaging component to investigate this question; it\n      remains unclear whether buspirone significantly occupies the DRD3 at therapeutic doses in\n      humans."
