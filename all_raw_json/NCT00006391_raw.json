Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with measurable disease who achieve a\n      response may receive additional therapy at the discretion of the principal investigator.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin and topotecan until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed through day 30.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 15 patients will be accrued for this study."
