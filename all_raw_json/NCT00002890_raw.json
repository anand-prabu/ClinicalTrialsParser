Determine the safety and toxicity of yttrium-90-labeled humanized monoclonal\n      antibody M195 (90Y-MOAB HuM195) in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloid\n      malignancies. II. Determine the pharmacology and dosimetry of 90Y-MOAB HuM195. III. Study\n      the biological effects of 90Y-MOAB HuM195, including the ability to elicit human anti-human\n      antibody responses and antileukemic responses.\n\n      OUTLINE: This study seeks to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of yttrium-90-labeled\n      humanized monoclonal antibody M195 (90Y-MOAB HuM195). All patients receive a single\n      intravenous dose of 90Y-MOAB HuM195. Groups of 3 to 6 patients are treated at escalated\n      doses of yttrium-90 until the MTD is determined. Patients with active leukemia who exhibit\n      at least a 50% clearing of marrow blasts after the first dose may receive a second dose\n      after 4-8 weeks provided remaining blasts are CD33-positive, there is no evidence of human\n      anti-human antibody response, and any toxicity has resolved. All patients are followed\n      monthly for 4 months after treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 24 patients will be treated. The study is expected to require 12-18\n      months to complete."
