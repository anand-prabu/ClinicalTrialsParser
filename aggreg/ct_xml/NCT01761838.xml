  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare changes in spinal stiffness and back muscle activity
      between spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) responders, non-responders and asymptomatic
      participants. Additionally, the investigators wanted to compare the amount of lumbar
      degeneration between SMT responders, non-responders and asymptomatic participants. This
      study also determines if the presence of pain modifies post-SMT spinal stiffness and back
      muscle activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SMT is a common manual therapy for treating patients with mechanical low back pain (LBP).
      SMT is defined as a high velocity, low amplitude thrust technique. Specifically, the
      clinician stands beside a supine patient. The patient is passively side-bent towards the
      side to be manipulated. The clinician passively rotates the patient and then delivers a high
      velocity, low amplitude thrust to the anterior superior iliac spine in a posteroinferior
      direction. SMT is indicated for patients with LBP judged to have spinal hypomobility or
      malalignment. Recently, our collaborators have discovered that LBP subjects who benefit from
      SMT can be identified prior to treatment by a five-item clinical prediction rule. Compared
      to non-responders, those who respond to SMT have: 1) more than 30% decrease in the modified
      Oswestry Disability Index score, 2) a significant and immediate decrease in spinal
      stiffness, and 3) a concurrent change in lumbar multifidus muscle activity. Taken together,
      the physical changes experienced by SMT responders alone provide an unique opportunity to
      better understand the mechanisms underlying SMT.

      Since spinal stiffness is an important physical indicator of SMT response, it is important
      to understand the causal relation between pain, paraspinal muscle activity and spinal
      stiffness. Although research has shown positive correlation between pain and muscle
      activity, and between paraspinal muscle activity and spinal stiffness, the causal relation
      between pain, paraspinal muscle activity and spinal stiffness remains unknown. Given this
      background, an induction of temporary benign experimental pain to asymptomatic individuals
      can help clarify such causal relation and improve our understanding of physical responses in
      responders following pain resolution by SMT.

             within the past 4 weeks

          -  Additional exclusion criteria for asymptomatic participants include: back pain in the
             preceding year, or exceeding 1 week; missed at least 1 work day because of back pain;
