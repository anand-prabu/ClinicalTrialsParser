When patients\n      cannot articulate their needs, frustration and agitation are frequent responses, often\n      resulting in poor optimization of post-stroke function. Staff's lack of knowledge of\n      communication strategies exacerbates the problem. A key component of patient-centred care is\n      the ability of staff to communicate in such a way that allows them to understand the\n      patient's needs. Members of our team developed the patient-centred communication\n      intervention (PCCI) targeting registered and unregulated staff caring for complex continuing\n      care (CCC) patients with communication impairments post stroke. The purpose of the study is\n      to examine if the PCCI results in improved patients' quality of life and in improved staff\n      attitudes and skills in caring for patients with communication impairments."
