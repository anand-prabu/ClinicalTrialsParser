All subjects will be evaluated once at initial, 3 month, and 6 month visits. They will receive HbA1c on each visit. After the initial 3 months have been completed a 15 question Diabetes Quality of Life survey will be completed by all patients from both groups. A Usability and Satisfaction of Diabetes Doctor survey will be given to those patients who used the mobile application. At the 3 month interval the control group will be given the opportunity to use the mobile application if desired. The study group will be given the opportunity to continue or discontinue the use of the mobile application. At the 6 month interval the Usability and Satisfaction of Diabetic Doctor survey and 15 question Diabetes Quality of Life survey will be administered to evaluate all mobile application users."
