Despite\n      discontinuities in the cellular layer, the intestinal barrier function is maintained during\n      this high cell turnover rate at the apical pole of the epithelial layer. Gaps first\n      identified in vivo through acriflavine have pivotal definitions (lacked nuclei or cytosol,\n      appeared to be filled with an impermeable substance). However, Current endoscopic technology\n      does not identify whether there is material present in human gaps, so investigators could\n      not formally resolve whether human epithelial gaps compromise or defend the epithelial\n      barrier."
