  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Would rapid identification of bacteria and rapid detection of methicillin-resistant S.
      aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) (using an FDA-cleared assay) in
      positive blood culture bottles improve patient care at Mayo Clinic Rochester (or just lead
      to increased cost)?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that the FilmArray Blood Culture ID Panel will reduce the duration of empiric
      broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy typically administered in patients who have positive
      blood cultures, improving clinical outcome and reducing cost. To test this hypothesis we
      propose a prospective, randomized controlled study comparing outcomes among patients with
      positive blood cultures who receive either: Standard culture and antimicrobial
      susceptibility testing (AST) of positive blood culture bottles as is done today (control),
      standard culture and AST of positive blood culture bottles plus the FilmArray Blood Culture
      ID Panel (intervention group 1), or standard culture and AST of positive blood culture
      bottles plus the FilmArray Blood Culture ID Panel testing along with expert infectious
      diseases phone consultation (intervention group 2). In both intervention groups, results of
      the FilmArray test will be communicated by phone to the primary service, along with
      templated comments about optimal antimicrobial therapy, based on the result. (Templated
      comments will also be used in the control group). In intervention group 2, an infectious
      diseases pharmacist or physician will provide patient-specific recommendations to modify
      antimicrobial therapy, if appropriate, based on microbiology results and clinical
      information obtained through medical record review and discussion with the primary service.
