Part C (repeat doses) will assess safety, tolerability, PK, PD, immunogenicity,\n      paraclinical (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] lesion counts) disease activity and markers\n      of Th1 and Th17 mechanisms.\n\n      Part A: Each of the 24 healthy volunteers (divided in 5 groups), will take part in only 2 of\n      the planned 8 dosing sessions (A-active, P-placebo). Subjects in each group of Part A will\n      be randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio to one of the following sequences: AA, AP or PA such that in\n      each dosing session they will receive study treatment in a 3:1 ratio of active: placebo\n      respectively.\n\n      Part B: Dosing levels and regimen are dependent upon safety tolerability and PK/receptor\n      occupancy (RO) data from Part A. In Cohort 1, 12 subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio\n      to A or P. Each subject will receive the same study treatment for repeated doses. If the\n      duration of full RO from highest dose in Part A is less than 4 weeks, a second cohort of 12\n      subjects in Part B may be recruited, based on Dose Escalation Committee (DEC) decision Part\n      C: The 20 RRMS patients will be assigned to active treatments for 2 to 4 repeated doses.\n\n      Safety/tolerability  and PK data monitoring and the decision to proceed to the next dose\n      level of GSK2618960, and the decisions to proceed to Part B and Part C of the study will be\n      made by a dose escalation committee."
