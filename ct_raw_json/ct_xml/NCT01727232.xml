  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this large French multicentric retrospective study was to compare the efficacy
      and safety of two (the standard and the Rheumatoid arthritis) rituximab regimens in adult's
      immune thrombocytopenia .

      Every adult (age ≥ 18 years) seen in one of the 3 participating centre (dijon, Marseille,
      Mondor) over a 7-year period (2005-2012) with a definite diagnosis of primary ITP according
      to the American Society Hematology guidelines who received RTX regardless the regimen could
      be included.

    <description>A complete response (CR) was defined as a platelet count &gt;100 x 109/l and a response (R): by a platelet count &gt;30 x 109/l with a least a doubling of the baseline value without any rescue intervention within 8 weeks before assessment, and no response (NR) was defined as a platelet count lower than 30 x 109/</description>
