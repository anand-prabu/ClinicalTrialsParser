Long-term AD is toxic, with\n      substantial metabolic, physical, mental and sexual side-effects.  In this study, the\n      investigators propose a treatment strategy to optimize the control of high risk prostate\n      cancer by using dose-escalated external beam radiation (proton therapy or IMRT) concurrent\n      with docetaxel and adjuvant short-course AD.  The investigators hypothesize that this\n      approach will be superior to the current standard of care and obviate the need for long term\n      AD.  In this study, subjects will be randomized to either XRT with long term ADT or XRT and\n      chemotherapy and short term ADT."
