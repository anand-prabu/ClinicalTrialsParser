  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an international, multicenter, open-label study to assess the efficacy, safety, and
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of rVIII-SingleChain in pediatric patients with severe
      hemophilia A. A minimum of 25 previously treated subjects ≥ 6 to &lt; 12 years of age and at
      least 25 subjects &lt; 6 years of age who have undergone &gt; 50 exposure days (EDs) with a
      previous Factor VIII (FVIII) product are planned to be enrolled. Subjects will be assigned
      to either an on-demand or prophylaxis treatment regimen for the treatment of bleeding
      episodes and will receive rVIII-SingleChain at a dose to be determined by the investigator.
      Hemostatic efficacy will be assessed by the subject/caregiver and the investigator who will
      assess overall efficacy by a 4-point scale.

For the PK evaluation, the subjects will receive a single IV dose of 50 IU/kg of rVIII-SingleChain on Day 1 at the start of the PK evaluation period.</description>
