            "textblock": "Sleeve gastrectomy is a restrictive procedure based on the removal of a large part of the\n      gastric fundus. According to a recent randomized study, weight loss and resolution of\n      diabetes are comparable to that obtained after gastric by-pass (79.7 % versus 80.3%), but\n      with a lower morbidity. The mechanisms involved in the rapid resolution of diabetes after\n      sleeve gastrectomy remain poorly understood, as no specific study in patients with type 2\n      diabetic obese are available. An increase in post- absorptive levels of GLP -1\n      (Glucagon-like Peptide 1), PYY (Peptide YY) and insulin has been reported, but in\n      non-diabetic subjects mostly. The important caloric restriction in the early postoperative\n      period indeed improves hepatic insulin resistance, regardless of weight loss. Specific\n      metabolic and hormonal effects of this surgical procedure cannot be excluded.The aim of our\n      study is to explore the early and late metabolic effects of sleeve gastrectomy in severely\n      obese patients with non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes. We will also evaluate insulin\n      sensitivity, insulin secretion and incretin effect. We will include 14 obese patients with\n      type 2 diabetes, considered eligible to bariatric surgery according to HAS criteria, and\n      whose diabetes treatment involves only metformin, sulfonylurea and glinides. They will be\n      randomized to a 1-week caloric restriction period or no caloric restriction, immediately\n      before surgery. Test meals with dosages of blood glucose, insulin, C-peptide, adiponectin,\n      leptin, GLP-1, PYY and ghrelin will be performed before and after caloric restriction, and 1\n      week, 3 month, 6 month and 12 month after surgery."
