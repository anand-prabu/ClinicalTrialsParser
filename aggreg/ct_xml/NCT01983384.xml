  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is recent, but limited evidence to suggest that anesthetic depth is associated with
      poor postoperative cognitive outcomes.  Specifically, several studies suggest that deeper
      level of anesthesia is associated with increased incidence of postoperative delirium and
      longer-term cognitive decline.  In fact, some suggest that older patients undergoing surgery
      should routinely be monitored with an anesthetic depth monitor to allow the titration of
      anesthetics or sedation medications to lighter levels to promote better postoperative
      cognitive outcomes.  However, such a practice has never been validated or proven to be
      feasible or safe. Accordingly, the investigators plan an exploratory study to determine the
      feasibility and safety of randomizing patients undergoing major surgery to receive deep vs.
      light anesthetic levels during surgery.

      In this exploratory grant, the investigators aim to determine whether two different
      anesthetic depths as measured by an anesthetic depth monitor can be practiced uniformly by a
      number of anesthesia providers and with safety across a large group of older surgical
      patients. The investigators will use a randomized control trial design to randomize 232
      patients in receiving &quot;light&quot; vs &quot;deep&quot; anesthesia as measured by an anesthetic depth
      monitor.  Postoperative outcomes will include delirium and cognitive measurements.
