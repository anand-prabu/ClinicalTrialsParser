This study will also serve to generate baseline scanning that\n      may aid in developing analytical tools to evaluate and treat specific lung regions of\n      patients with PAP."

            "textblock": "This study will evaluate x-ray CT as a biomarker for surfactant lavage removal and evaluate\n      an UTE-Thrive MRI protocol at CCHMC as an imaging alternative to CT.  Potential subjects who\n      meet study criteria will be identified by the Pulmonary physicians at Cincinnati Children's\n      Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) and University of Cincinnati (UC) through their clinic\n      patients. The study will include two research MRIs (one pre lavage and the second 24 to 72\n      hours after the first lung lavage) and if there is a clinical CT performed pre lavage, then\n      one research CT will also be performed with the second research MRI.  All image analysis\n      will be quantitative.  Whole-lung and regional density will be calculated and evaluated\n      before and after lung lavage, for a quantification of changes in density in the left lung\n      and right lung separately.  Since the one lung will serve as control, it will allow precise\n      error estimation (which we expect to be quite small and largely related to differences in\n      lung volume). One purpose of this protocol is to further refine and develop ultra-short echo\n      time (UTE) MRI techniques since Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis (PAP) patients may have\n      multiple lavage sessions per year.  A subject may be eligible to re-enroll to participate\n      multiple times if the total number of research CTs for all enrollments is one or less for\n      that subject."

These doses to the thorax result in an effective dose to the patient of 2.5 mSv for all but the largest patients who receive an effective dose as large as 4.5 mSv. Every person in the USA receives an annual whole body radiation dose of approximately 3.6 mSv from background radiation.  Therefore, except for the largest adults in this study, the second CT scan for research purposes of this study delivers the same effective dose to the patient as approximately 8 months of annual background radiation. Therefore, the risk associated with the radiation dose of the CT scan should not be more significant than the extremely small risk of background radiation that one receives annually in the USA.",
