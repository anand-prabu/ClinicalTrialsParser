It was no significant difference in wound infection.with\n      normalsaline and tap water. 2012 The Cochrane Collaboration: Water for wound cleansing\n      systematic review of the literature that wound clean water has no effect on the rate of\n      wound infection and healing rate, conducive to personal hygiene and cost-effective. Under\n      high temperature and humid environments in our country, after surgery not bathe often affect\n      patients' satisfaction and increase the cost of dressing and manpower, Was opened a line\n      after surgery the wound can be shower? It is important about surgical wound care guidelines,\n      but also the patient daily asked a high degree of issues. Purpose of this study (1)\n      post-operative 48 hours, shower or not wound infection rate (2) post-operative 48 hours,\n      shower or not the pain score (3) post-operative 48 hours, shower or not the comfortable (4)\n      post-operative 48 hours, shower or not the care costs."

Hospital Research Ethics Committee\n      reviewed and approved, it is expected enrolled 102/04/22-102/12/30, a total of 444 cases,\n      obtained in all cases informed consent form before operation, the case from the hospital\n      Thoracic Surgery, General Surgery , thyroid surgery and orthopedic wards, outpatient closing\n      the case.\n\n      Research situations and objects: the subjects conditions: adult (minimum age> 20 years;\n      maximum age are not limit) 48 hours after surgery suture not opened the line and remove the\n      drainage tube wound, closing the case exclusion conditions include: surgical procedure\n      contamination or have been infected wounds, chronic wounds, burns,wounds, trauma wounds,\n      immune function insufficiency or use of immunosuppressive agents can not sign a consent form\n      by the end of the severe and pregnancy.\n\n      Research steps: meet the requirements of the subjects to obtain informed consent, by the\n      number of computer random number table, randomly assigned into the shower group or\n      non-shower group, n = 222, shower group will given leaflets before surgery about the wound\n      care guidelines after surgery, (48 hours after surgery, shower not a bath so that your\n      wounds will not be immersed in water, as this may reopen your wounds. please avoid the area\n      of the wound.
