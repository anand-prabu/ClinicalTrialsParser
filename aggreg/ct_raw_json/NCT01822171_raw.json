In the\n      United States patients with a diagnosis of heart failure currently experience an elevated 30\n      day readmission rate of approximately 20%. By providing patients with medication related\n      counseling at discharge by a pharmacist, home medications at discharge, and seeing the\n      patient again in a pharmacist-run Medication Therapy Management (MTM) clinic 7 days after\n      discharge, the study anticipates achieving its primary goal of showing a reduction in the\n      readmission rate. Secondary goals are: 1) to determine patients understanding of the\n      medication they are taking, 2) to evaluate satisfaction with the comprehensive discharge\n      counseling service, and 3) determine the number of interventions made and benefit of the MTM\n      clinic."
