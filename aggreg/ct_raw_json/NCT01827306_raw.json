            "textblock": "Biofreeze\u00ae is a topical analgesic, frequently used in the office or given to a patient for\n      home use as a way to mitigate pain during the course of treatment. Rehabilitative exercises\n      are considered an important component of care for shoulder pain patients, although pain can\n      be a limiting factor in the advancement of rehabilitation. The purpose of this study is to\n      evaluate the addition of Biofreeze\u00ae to an in-office group of shoulder pain patients to\n      determine its impact on pain reduction. Methods: Patients 18-64 years old with mechanical\n      shoulder pain who are candidates for FUNHAB\u00ae will be randomized into two groups (N=20). The\n      Control group (N=10) will receive FUNHAB\u00ae alone while the Intervention group (N=10) will\n      receive FUNHAB\u00ae plus Biofreeze\u00ae just prior to initiating the in-office exercise program.\n      Values of pain (NPRS) and disability (ASES) will be recorded at baseline, 2 weeks, and 4\n      weeks. Hypotheses will be addressed by repeated measures ANOVAs within and between group,\n      time, and interaction main effects. Clinical Relevance: Progression of therapeutic exercises\n      can be limited by pain and the associated disability. The ability to decrease shoulder pain\n      and disability with a topical analgesic will allow health care professionals to advance\n      patients through a therapeutic exercise program without the restriction of pain. In turn,\n      patients will correct the underlying condition of their shoulder pain at a faster rate."
