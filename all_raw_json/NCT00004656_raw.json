Measure sleeping and awake metabolic rates in various positions, i.e., reclining,\n      sitting, and standing, by whole-room indirect calorimetry and isotope dilution.\n\n      III.  Quantify activity patterns by time-motion studies using 24-hour activity records and\n      12-hour videotaping.\n\n      IV.  Correlate 24-hour activity patterns with 24-hour heart rate telemetry and short-term\n      oxygen consumption.\n\n      V.  Estimate 24-hour fecal and urinary energy losses. VI.  Determine body composition by\n      clinical anthropometry, whole-body potassium counting, and total-body electrical\n      conductance.\n\n      VII.  Calculate apparent energy needs based on measurement of energy intake and expenditure."
