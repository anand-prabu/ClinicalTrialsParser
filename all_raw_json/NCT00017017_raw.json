Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      If no more than 1 of the first 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity, then the\n      remaining patients receive a higher dose of CT-2103.\n\n      Patients are followed between 1-3 months and then every 3 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
