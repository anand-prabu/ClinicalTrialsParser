    <textblock>
      In this study patients suffering from Immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated asthma are treated
      with a method, called immune apheresis, that removes IgE from blood. In order to achieve
      this blood is taken continuously from the patient and then separated into plasma and blood
      cells by centrifuge. The plasma passes the new IgE adsorber where the IgE is specifically
      bound. The &quot;cleaned&quot; plasma re-joined with the blood cells is given back to the patient. In
      total each patient randomized to the apheresis group will undergo 3 treatments per week
      (i.e. 1 cycle) every 4 weeks over a time period of 3 months, that means 9 apheresis
      treatments in 3 cycles in total. Study hypothesis is that the new IgE adsorber is capable of
      reducing IgE in plasma/serum by at least 50% measured before the first treatment in the
      first cycle and after the last treatment in the last treatment cycle. The new adsorber can
      be safely used in patients. A group of patients with conventional drug treatment and no
      apheresis treatment serves as control.
