An acute infection requiring ongoing antibiotic therapy (e.g., UTI, indwelling\n             catheter or other potential site(s) of infection)\n\n          2. History of significant hypersensitivity reactions to PSMA ADC or any of its\n             components, or to any prior investigational or approved monoclonal antibodies (mAbs),\n             immunoglobulin (Ig) fusion proteins (e.g., circulating neutralizing antibodies), or\n             ADC\n\n          3.
