A brief, assessment tool for oral/dental health and related\n      QoL-issues to improve symptom management has been requested. The present study will be\n      conducted on behalf of and with support from the European Organisation for Research and\n      Treatment of Cancer - (EORTC) Quality of Life Group (QLG). The study represents phase IV,\n      the final step, in the development of an international, symptom specific questionnaire\n      module, focusing on oral and dental problems in relation to cancer and its treatment. Phase\n      I-III of this stepwise development process was conducted from 2008 to 2011, as an\n      international collaboration and conducted according to the guidelines for module development\n      set forth by the EORTC QLG. The resulting module, the QLQ-OH17, is now subject to an\n      international field testing and validation study as described in this project description.\n\n      The present version of the QLQ-OH17 consists of 17 items conceptualized into four multi-item\n      scales (pain/discomfort, xerostomia, eating and information) and three single items related\n      to use of dentures and future worries. The aim of the present study is to conduct phase IV;\n      an international field study to confirm the psychometric properties of the QLQ-OH17"
