The current study compared the\n      expression of EGFR in the esophageal and laryngeal mucosa of adults with GERD and LPR. Study\n      Design: Prospective based on imunohistochemical analysis of parafine embedded biopsy\n      specimens and clinical data. Methods: From August, 2004 to February 2007 a total of 24\n      adults with confirmed diagnosis of LPR and no other clinical conditions or habits  known to\n      cause chronic laryngitis were studied at a University Hospital. Biopsies of the distal\n      esophagus and the retrocrycoid laryngeal mucosa were obtained during upper digestive\n      endoscopy. Data were analyzed statistically comparing samples in each individual and between\n      individuals using the severity of histological signs of inflammation on hematoxacillin and\n      eosinophillin (HE) stains to immunohistochemical analysis of the expression of EGFR. Other\n      independent variables were severity of symptoms and signs, gender and age. Fishers\u00b4s exact\n      test and multivariance ANOVA tests were used with significance level established at 95%."
