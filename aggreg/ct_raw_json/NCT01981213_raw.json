To explore the relationship between children admitted to a paediatric department as a\n      result of suicide attempts with acetaminophen and their parents and friends. 2. To determine\n      the extent to which the children had attempted to speak to their parents or other adults\n      about their problems before their suicide attempts. 3. To determine the prevalence of\n      self-mutilation among children with suicidal behaviour. 4. To examine the reasons for these\n      suicide attempts.\n\n      C: Establishment of the expression of cytochrome P450 in a pediatric including the\n      age-adjusted activities.\n\n      Urine samples will be analyzed using an HPLC tandem mass spectrometric method, which we have\n      already established in our lab.\n\n      There will be categorized three groups for comparison:\n\n        1. An age-appropriate background population (approximately 200 patients)\n\n        2. Paediatric patients that have been admitted to Rigshospitalet, due to severe hepatic\n           injury (approximately 50 patients)\n\n        3. Other pediatric patients admitted to their local hospital because of acetaminophen\n           poisoning (approximately 200 patients) A control urine sample will be analyzed three\n           months after the suicide attempt."
