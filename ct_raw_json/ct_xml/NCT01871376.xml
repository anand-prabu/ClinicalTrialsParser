      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravitreal aflibercept injection in the treatment
      of PCV

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, one-year, multiple-dose study of 2mg aflibercept in
      patients with PCV.

      The study consists of the baseline visit on day 0 and a mandatory clinic visit every 30 days
      to assess efficacy and safety.  All patients will receive three monthly injections of 2mg
      intravitreal aflibercept injection followed by treatment every 60 days through 360 days (12
      months).  Patients can be treated every 30 days if needed.

      The fellow eye may be treated with intravitreal aflibercept injection per the investigator's
      discretion at any point during the study if evidence of disease activity are met: exudation
      or hemorrhage secondary to polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy or exudative AMD.    The fellow
      eye will not be considered the study eye.  If treatment with aflibercept is to be given in
      the fellow eye, the injections are to be administered according to the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) approved label for EYLEA®.
