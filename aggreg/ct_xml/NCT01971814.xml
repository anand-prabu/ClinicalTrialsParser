    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to a.) evaluate whether early serum infliximab levels are
      predictive of avoidance of colectomy, b) evaluate whether serum albumin levels correlate
      with serum infliximab levels, and c) evaluate whether serum tumor necrosis factor levels are
      inversely correlated with serum infliximab levels.

      In patients hospitalized for severe ulcerative colitis and treated with high-dose
      infliximab, we predict that early serum infliximab levels (24, 48, and 72 hour) will be
      positively associated with clinical response and avoidance of colectomy.

    <textblock>
      The American Gastroenterology Association (AGA) recommends infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal
      antibody to human tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF), in the treatment of patients with
      ulcerative colitis (UC) who don't achieve adequate clinical response despite treatment with
      conventional therapy. Infliximab is an FDA approved therapy for ulcerative colitis based on
      two large randomized trials, ACT I and ACT II. For patients who respond to induction
      therapy, scheduled maintenance therapy has been demonstrated to be both durable and safe.
      However, these trials did not include hospitalized patients.

      Severe flares, or fulminant ulcerative colitis, remain highly morbid and potentially fatal
      presentations of disease. Traditionally, hospitalized patients who failed high-dose
      intravenous corticosteroid therapy require life-saving colectomy. Although the advent of
      infliximab has presented an alternative rescue therapy, some patients with severe ulcerative
      colitis are non-responders to anti-TNF induction therapy and proceed to colectomy. In the
      ACT I and II trials, outpatients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis were randomized
      to placebo, 5mg/kg infliximab therapy, or 10mg/kg infliximab therapy. At 54 week follow-up,
      patients receiving infliximab had a 41% reduced risk of colectomy compared to the placebo
      group. Although infliximab at 5mg/kg was associated with a reduced risk of colectomy, only
      the 10mg/kg infliximab dosing yielded a statistically significant risk reduction.  There
      were no differences in safety between the 5mg/kg and 10mg/kg infliximab groups; similar
      rates of serious adverse events, infections, and infusion reactions were reported. Thus, at
      our institution (University of California at San Francisco), it is our standard of care to
      administer infliximab at 10mg/kg IV for patients hospitalized with severe ulcerative
      colitis.

      Dose escalation from 5mg/kg to 10mg/kg is routinely prescribed to recapture clinical
      response in subsets of patients with inflammatory bowel disease who experience loss of
      response during maintenance therapy and is supported in the FDA label for Crohn's disease.
      Loss of response to infliximab maintenance therapy is a well-recognized phenomenon, and
      there is abundant literature suggesting that durable and efficacious infliximab therapy is
      dependent upon optimizing serum infliximab levels. Specifically, high serum infliximab
      trough levels predict clinical response, but low serum trough levels and presence of
      infliximab antibodies are associated with loss of response.  However, serum infliximab
      levels are not dependent upon drug dose and pharmacokinetics alone. Concurrent
      immunomodulator use may reduce immunogenicity against monoclonal antibody therapies, and
      more recently, there has been increased recognition of the importance of patient factors as
      well. Specifically, variability in drug metabolism and clearance has been associated with
      body-mass index, sex, and severity of inflammation - as measured by C-reactive protein,
      serum albumin, and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels. It has been demonstrated that
      patients with higher serum albumin levels maintain higher infliximab concentrations, lower
      clearance, and longer drug half-lives than patients with lower serum albumin levels; and low
      serum albumin correlates with poorer clinical response. Severe colonic disease is associated
      with higher early fecal infliximab concentration, which is inversely associated with serum
      infliximab levels and response to therapy. Moreover, high serum tumor necrosis factor alpha
      levels prior to infliximab infusion predict poorer clinical outcomes and need for dose
      escalation in patients with Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis.

      Patients hospitalized with severe ulcerative colitis can least afford suboptimal infliximab
      therapy, but are at highest risk given their malnutrition and uncontrolled inflammation.
      There is a growing trend towards the use of high dose of infliximab as the first line
      therapy in these severe, hospitalized patients as they have just one infusion (dose) to
      demonstrate clinical response before they are referred for colectomy.  However, there is
      currently no pharmacokinetic data to support this practice.  There is only a small body of
      literature that serum infliximab trough levels may predict clinical outcomes in acute
      ulcerative colitis. To our knowledge, there are no studies regarding the use of early
      infliximab levels - within the first 72 hours - to predict clinical response in the
      vulnerable subset of patients hospitalized for severe ulcerative colitis.

      We propose a pilot study investigating the treatment of severe ulcerative colitis with
      high-dose infliximab (10mg/kg infusions), which is the standard of care at UCSF for severe,
      hospitalized ulcerative colitis.  This will be a prospective, multi-site study which will
      consecutively enroll hospitalized ulcerative colitis patients meeting inclusion criteria
      from anyone of four UCSF-affiliated hospitals. Per routine care, enrolled subjects will
      undergo infectious work-up, receive intravenous corticosteroids in addition to supportive
      care, and undergo evaluation by a Colorectal Surgeon. Subjects that are eligible for
      anti-TNF therapy after routine screening will begin infliximab induction therapy on hospital
      day 3 at 10mg/kg. We will perform standardized pre- and post-treatment assessments of
      disease activity (Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index - UCDAI), including acquisition
      of biochemical and endoscopic data. We will measure serum levels of tumor necrosis factor
      alpha, infliximab, and infliximab antibody throughout the course of treatment.  The primary
      outcome will be avoidance of colectomy. This study will be the first to our knowledge to
      examine the empiric use of high-dose infliximab combined with early therapeutic drug
      monitoring to guide the care of patients hospitalized with severe ulcerative colitis.  Our
      ultimate goal is to develop a rational approach to maximizing infliximab therapy in the
      setting of severe ulcerative colitis to minimize and predict primary non-response to
      infliximab induction therapy.

      Aside from drawing infliximab and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels, all other procedures
      and treatments provided to these patients are part of routine care for the patient with
      severe ulcerative colitis.  Routine care of the patient hospitalized with severe ulcerative
      colitis is summarized in the following protocol:

      On hospital days 1-2, hospitalized patients with severe ulcerative colitis undergo
      diagnostic evaluation including bloodwork (complete blood count, C-reactive protein,
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum albumin), infectious work-up (Clostridium
      difficile, stool cultures, stool ova and parasites, cytomegalovirus), and standardized
      assessment of disease activity (flexible sigmoidoscopy and calculation of UCDAI score).
      Patients are started on corticosteroid therapy (Solumedrol 40mg intravenous daily), and
      screened for eligibility for anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy (hepatitis B surface
      antibody, hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, tuberculin skin test,
      Quantiferon gold test, and chest radiograph). The Quantiferon gold tests are ordered for
      inpatients. Intravenous antibiotics are given therapeutically in the event of documented
      infection or clinical toxicity, but not prophylactically administered. Subcutaneous heparin
      is administered for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis per standard of care. On hospital day
      3, a positive or negative response to intravenous corticosteroids is determined prior to
      initiation of high-dose infliximab. Responders to medical therapy continue with an
      infliximab induction regimen (week 0, 2, and 6 infusions). After completing the induction
      regimen, patients undergo repeat flexible sigmoidoscopy and calculation of UCDAI score at
      week 8.

      Eligible study subjects will receive their first induction dose of infliximab (10mg/kg
      intravenous infusion) on hospital day 3. A pre-infusion tumor necrosis factor alpha level
      and an immediate post-infusion serum infliximab will be checked.

      On hospital day 4, a serum tumor necrosis factor alpha and a 24 hour serum infliximab level
      will be measured.

      On hospital day 5, a serum tumor necrosis factor alpha and a 48 hour serum infliximab level
      will be measured.

      On hospital day 6, a serum tumor necrosis factor alpha and a 72 hour serum infliximab level
      will be measured.

      One week after initial infusion, a serum tumor necrosis factor alpha and a serum infliximab
      level will be measured.

      Two weeks after initial infusion, a serum tumor necrosis factor alpha and a serum infliximab
      level will be measured.
