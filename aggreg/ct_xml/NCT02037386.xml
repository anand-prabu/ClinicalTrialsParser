  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intervention for coronary bifurcation lesion is about 10~20% of entire percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI). Bifurcation lesion is difficult to be treated and prognosis of PCI at
      bifurcation lesion has been poorer compared to that at non-bifurcation lesion. Furthermore,
      occlusion of side branch frequently occurred during PCI. Several techniques to prevent
      occlusion of side branch have been developed, but outcomes are not to be satisfied. H-side
      branch stent is developed to treat coronary side branch lesion and composed of proximal,
      connecting and distal parts. In vivo study performed in pigs showed effective H-side branch
      stent. This study is to confirm safety and efficacy of H-side branch stent for treatment of
      coronary side branch lesion.
