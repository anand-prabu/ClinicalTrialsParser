  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the advances in pharmacological therapy for asthma, there has been an increasing
      worldwide interest in alternative therapies for asthma. Treatments and therapies such as
      yoga, acupuncture, homeopathy, hypnosis and Buteyko and other breathing techniques have been
      used as complementary therapies however little evidence exists behind such practices.

      Data from systemic reviews and randomized control trials provide evidence of benefit
      although additional confirmation is still needed. Among the most common techniques are the
      Buteyko breathing exercises that aim to reduce minute ventilation by instruct asthmatics
      patients to breathe shallowly and slowly through the nose. The second common technique is
      the Pranayama, or yoga breathing exercises which emphasizes deep respirations and exhalation
      prolongation.

      Our goal is to assess the effectiveness of breathing exercises as a complementary therapy
      for asthma.

    <description>Patients will be thought 3 different exercises included yoga pranayama, diaphragmatic breathing and pursed lip breathing. Patients will be asked to repeat these exercises at least twice daily for a one month period. Also patients will be thought 4 different exercises which they could use in the event of an asthma exacerbation. Teaching will be supplemented by a breathing exercise brochure and patients will be asked to demonstrate proper technique at initial visit and at the return visit.</description>
