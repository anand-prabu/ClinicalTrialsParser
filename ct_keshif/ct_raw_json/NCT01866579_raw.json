As previously reported, incidence of ethambutol optic neuropathy is about 1~2%,\n      there was considerable screening efforts and medical cost is increasing. However, there is\n      no effective treatment of ethambutol optic neuropathy or no definite preventable measure.\n      Moreover, multi-drug resistance tuberculosis or extensively drug resistance tuberculosis is\n      emerging, more toxic secondary drug is used in the long-term.\n\n      It is known that retinal nerve fiber layer is increased early stage in ethambutol optic\n      neuropathy. So we decide to evaluate the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness measured by\n      optical coherence tomography in longitudinal manner."
