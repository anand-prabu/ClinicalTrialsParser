            "textblock": "Despite abundant evident supporting the use of acute reperfusion therapy in the setting of\n      acute ischemic stroke (AIS), adoption of this practice in routine clinical care is poor.  We\n      hypothesize that a significant barrier is the difficulty in weighing the benefits and risks\n      of rt-PA treatment in the care of an individual patient, a problem compounded by the time\n      urgency of decision-making and clinical fears that weigh risks of treatment more heavily\n      than benefits.\n\n      The goal of this Quality Improvement (QI) study is to leverage an IT solution that we have\n      developed, ePRISM, that executes multivariable risk models with patient-specific data so\n      that a personalized estimate of an individual's outcomes (both risks and benefits) with and\n      without rt-PA, can be generated so support safer, more effective clinical care.  Through an\n      earlier project, we will have programmed ePRISM with the best available risk-stratification\n      models and developed a clinically useful format for presenting the data to support clinical\n      decision-making in AIS.\n\n      Through QI, we propose to identify the optimal mechanism for integrating the tool within the\n      routine flow of patient care in preparation for more definitive studies, or dissemination\n      strategies, to improve the treatment of patients with AIS."
