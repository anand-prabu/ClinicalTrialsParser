            "textblock": "Transnasal esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (UT-EGD) offers physicians and patients a number of\n      advantages compared with conventional peroral EGD (P-EGD) and has become increasingly\n      popular in clinical practice over the past several years. However, insertion failure varying\n      from 2.3% to 62.7% due to tight nasal vault have been reported. Dumortire reported 17.9 % of\n      patient refused UT-EGD due to nasal pain and epistaxis remains to be a common side effect.\n      Therefore a well performed nasal anesthesia has been regarded as the most important step for\n      UT-EGD.\n\n      The concept of endoscopic guidance is actually an application of anterior rhinoscopy to\n      select the most patent meatus for nasal anesthesia and endoscopic insertion. The scope\n      should be placed in the side of the nasal cavity that is most patent. Therefore, it is\n      reasonable that a nasal examination is performed prior to UT-EGD to determine the less\n      obstructed side.\n\n      In fact, anterior rhinoscopy is a common outpatient procedure by otolaryngologists and is\n      performed with an otoscope. Instead, we use a transnasal endoscope to select the most patent\n      meatus and thus we first introduce the concept of anterior \"meatus-copy\", which is different\n      from \"meatoscopy\" for the urinary meatus.\n\n      The conventional sniff nasal patency test is an inspection of nasal passability by asking a\n      patient to compare the breathing-in air flow in either side of the nose. This is a\n      self-selected and subjective method of choosing just the right or left nostril for\n      transnasal endoscopy.\n\n      Nasal septum and nasal turbinates, especially the inferior turbinates, are erectile tissues\n      in the nose, fluctuate greatly in size depending on physiological changes (e.g. body\n      temperature and exercise) and response to inflammation. Often, the sensation of a blocked\n      nose is subjective. The otolaryngologist may find a perfectly patent airway and yet the\n      patient will insist that his nose is clogged up. Therefore, an objective method to evaluate\n      nasal patency would help to avoid a narrowed meatus, thereby reducing nasal pain and\n      epistaxis during nasal anesthesia and transnasal endoscopy.\n\n      Methods used to objectively measure nasal patency and resistance include rhinomanometry and\n      acoustic rhinometry. However, these two methods are sophisticated and not straightforward.\n      There is no literature describing the optimal selection method for transnasal endoscopic\n      insertion. Assessments of nasal patency by dynamic methods include nasal peak flow,\n      rhinomanometry, and acoustic rhinometry. However, a convenient endoscopic method of\n      evaluating nasal meatus patency has not been proposed.\n\n      Locating on the anterior portion of a meatus, the transnasal endoscope itself can act as a\n      nasoscope to look for the most patent meatus.\n\n      We found anterior meatuscopy allows the direct visualisation of the turbinates and meatus\n      without causing discomfort. Thus it may be a useful ancillary technique to select the most\n      patent meatus for scope insertion. Hence, the primary objective of this study is to evaluate\n      whether a anterior meatuscopy scoring system could reduce nasal bleeding and improve\n      tolerance associated with UT-EGD."

This procedure can provide mild vestibular anesthesia which can prevent patients from sneezing when the vibrissae hair is irritated by the endoscope tip. Instead of holding the insertion tube as usual, an endoscopist holds the bending section for better control of the distal tip during anterior meatuscopy.",

Patients are asked to indicate which of their nostrils is most patent. If neither is more patent, the right nostril is chosen by default. The middle meatus is more difficult to examine and may be less well anesthetized than other structures. Thus, the inferior nasal meatus is selected for each case because the inferior meatus is usually the largest of the three nasal meatuses.",
