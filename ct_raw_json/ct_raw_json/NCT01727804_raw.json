Patients\n      were followed up to 12 months to evaluate the formation of white-spot lesions and/or caries\n      cavities by three calibrated observers."

Subjects had to be healthy and\n             the parents or the child legal guardian need to be willing to sign the \"Authorization\n             and informed consent for research\" form. There were no gender restrictions.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  suffering from systemic diseases, had a significant past or medical history with\n             conditions that may affect oral health (i.e., diabetes, HIV, heart conditions that\n             require antibiotic prophylaxis), were taking medications that may affect the oral\n             flora or salivary flow (e.g., antibiotic use in the past three months, drugs\n             associated with dry mouth / xerostomia), had in-office fluoride treatment within the\n             last three months prior to being enrolled in the study, or were not willing to stop\n             the use of any mouth rinse during the duration of the study."

Considering the sealant scores, if the tooth evaluated presented with a caries lesion, it was considered to be a decayed tooth(with a need for treatment), regardless the sealant retention status.",
