  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will assess the efficacy of moclobemide, a selective, reversible MAO-A
      inhibitor, in facilitating smoking cessation in treatment-seeking female smokers. This
      rationale is based on several findings from previous work: 1) cigarette smoke contains
      constituents that inhibit both forms of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO-A and MAO-B); 2)
      that severity of depression symptoms after smoking abstinence is correlated with the level
      of MAO-A inhibition previously obtained from smoking; 3) moclobemide, an MAO-A inhibitor was
      found efficacious in a smoking cessation treatment trial (Berlin et al., 1995); and 4) women
      show a greater association between smoking and depression than men and women smokers in our
      previous trials report smoking to alleviate symptoms of depression to a greater extent than
      men.
