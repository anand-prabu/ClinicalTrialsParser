  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is a geriatric syndrome leading to physical deterioration including muscle wasting
      (sarcopenia) and unintentional weight loss.  There are currently no approved therapies for
      frailty.  Ghrelin is a hormone produced by the stomach that stimulates appetite centers in
      the brain. The investigators already know that a single dose of Ghrelin improves food intake
      immediately after the dose in frail older people. In this study, the investigators are
      trying to find out if repeated daily doses of ghrelin will help frail older people improve
      food intake for multiple days in a row.
