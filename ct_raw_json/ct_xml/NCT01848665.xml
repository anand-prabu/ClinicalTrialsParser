  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased core temperature (hyperthermia) has been associated with impaired neuromuscular
      performance; however, the mechanisms associated with these performance decrements and their
      potential synergies remain unclear. While the majority of research suggests that the
      observed fatigue is related to the central nervous system, the influence of changes in
      cerebral blood flow (CBF) and associated changes in cerebral alkalosis (estimated by
      end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide; PETCO2) remains unexamined. In response to
      hyperthermia, humans hyperventilate as means of heat dissipation, resulting in a hypocapnia
      (reduced PETCO2) mediated decrease in CBF and consequently, cerebral alkalosis (increased
      cerebral pH). Previous research suggests that hyperventilation induces changes in neural
      excitability and synaptic transmission; however, it remains unclear if these changes are
      related to hypocapnia mediated decrease in CBF or decreased PETCO2 or both.

      The purpose of the proposed research program is to examine the influence of changes in CBF
      and cerebral alkalosis on neuromuscular function during passive heat stress. The research
      project will consist of 3 separate experimental trials: (a) poikilocapnic hyperthermia
      (increased core temperature; decrease CBF; decrease PETCO2), (b) isocapnic hyperthermia
      (increased core temperature; no change CBF; no change PETCO2) and (c) isocapnic hyperthermia
      + indomethacin (increased core temperature; decrease CBF; no change PETCO2). During each
      manipulation, neuromuscular function will be evaluated and compared to baseline
      (normothermic) conditions using a repeated measures design.

      It is hypothesized that changes in PETCO2 and therefore, changes in cerebral alkalosis will
      contribute to neuromuscular fatigue independent of changes in CBF or increases in core
      temperature.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Motor evoked potentials are recorded from muscles following transcranial magnetic stimulation of motor cortex. The resting motor threshold is defined as the minimum stimulation intensity required to elicit a motor evoked potential. Resting motor threshold will be quantified in millivolts.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The H-Reflex is an indirect measure of motor neuron excitability. Initially, a maximal M-wave (M-max) will be elicited by stimulating (1 ms in duration; 15 s between stimuli) the median nerve incrementally (2 V increments) until the largest waveform is observed. The peak-to-peak amplitude of this waveform is considered M-max. Using similar procedures as above, a sub-maximal M-wave of 5% M-max will be elicited and the amplitude of the resultant H-reflex (a small waveform observed following the submaximal M-wave) will be calculated. The amplitude of the H-reflex will be quantified in millivolts.</description>

    <description>During maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) testing, the participants' right arm will be secured in a custom made device used to isolate forearm flexion and to measure force production by the flexor carpi radialis muscle. Participants will be asked to produce a 5-second MVC and will be verbally encouraged to maintain maximal force production throughout the duration of the contraction. MVC will be quantified as the maximum force production in newton meters.</description>

    <measure>Voluntary Activation</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline 90-minutes</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The level of neural drive to muscle during contraction is termed voluntary activation and will be estimated by interpolation of a single supramaximal motor evoked potential during the 5-second MVC contraction. If extra force is evoked by the 'superimposed' stimulus then either the stimulated axons were not all recruited voluntarily or they were discharging at sub-tetanic rates. Therefore, voluntary activation will be quantified as the amplitude of maximal voluntary force production, relative to the amplitude of the supramaximal MEP.</description>

    <description>Middle cerebral artery (MCA) blood flow velocity will be measured non-invasively by a 2-MHz transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound probe, attached bilaterally to a comfortable headband and secured anterior to the zygomatic arch, rostral of the pinna. Doppler probes will be paced over the temporal windows (near the ear) and will remain in place throughout the duration of the experimental protocol. MCA velocity will be quantified in cm/s.</description>
