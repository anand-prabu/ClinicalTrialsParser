  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of radiation on normal tissue varies widely between individuals. Consequently, a
      test to measure tissue response to radiation could be clinically useful by permitting more
      accurate titration of dosage in patients undergoing radiotherapy. Also, in view of emerging
      concerns about possible nuclear terrorism a test for exposure to radiation might also be
      useful in evaluating victims of a &quot;dirty bomb&quot; explosion. A number of different techniques
      have been previously reported in epidemiological studies for the estimation of prior
      radiation exposure.  This study explores one approach to estimating radiation exposure by
      measurement of increased oxidative stress which can be detected by a breath test.

      In this study subjects undergoing significant exposure to therapeutic radiation will provide
      breath samples for analysis in a central laboratory.  The hypothesis of the study is that
      the analysis of these samples will lead to the identification of a set of markers of
      radiation exposure.

    <description>An algorithm for scoring the radiation exposure based on analysis of breath samples will be developed and applied to each breath sample collected.  The hypothesis is that the scores will indicate radiation exposure, specifically exposure to more than 2 Gray at time points between 1 day and 7 days post exposure.</description>

          2. Subject is willing and able to cooperate with study and give signed informed consent
             to participate
