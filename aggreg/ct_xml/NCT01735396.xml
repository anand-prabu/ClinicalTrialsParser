    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of abiraterone acetate in African American/Black patients with
      castration-resistant prostate cancer.  The primary objective is to determine the correlation
      between germline polymorphisms and antitumor activity (as defined by a decline in PSA of ≥
      30%) in African American patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with
      abiraterone acetate. Patients will receive abiraterone acetate until the time of disease
      progression, in the absence of prohibitive toxicities. Patients will be followed for disease
      progression and survival.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to determine a correlation between inherited genetic polymorphisms and antitumor activity (as defined by a decline in PSA of ≥ 30%) in AA patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with Abiraterone. The primary endpoint is the percent change in PSA from baseline to 12 weeks. A decline of ≥ 30% will be correlated with germline SNPs.</description>
