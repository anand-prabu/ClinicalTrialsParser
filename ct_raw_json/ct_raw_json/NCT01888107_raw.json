The secondary aim is to investigate prospectively (a study that starts with the\n      present condition of a population of individuals and follows them into the future) the\n      prevalence of patients who met standardized remission criteria (according to Andreasen et\n      al. criteria) and the psychopathological, psychosocial and subjective predictors of\n      achieving remission."
