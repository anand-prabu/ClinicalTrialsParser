  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The TRIO-physio study is looking at how well patients with osteoarthritis recover after knee
      replacement surgery (also known as Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)).  Currently around 20% of
      patients are not satisfied after TKA.  This project will look to find out if the research
      team can identify patients who will not recover well at an earlier stage, so that these
      patients can be helped sooner.

      The study will try to determine if doing intense physiotherapy with patients who are not
      doing well at the first review (6 weeks after their operation) can improve how well they
      have recovered at one year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomised controlled trial comparing the effect of intensive physiotherapy
      compared to current standard of care therapy, targeted to patients performing poorly at 6
      weeks following total knee replacement.

      All patients will be made aware of the study pre-operatively at the recruiting centres.
      Prior to surgery they will complete the routine pre-operative outcome assessment
      questionnaires (Oxford Knee Score and EQ-5D) as part of the national PROMS program and then
      undergo the local standard total knee replacement and immediate post-operative care pathway.

      All patients will be routinely reviewed 6 weeks post-operatively by the usual clinical
      teams. At this review the Oxford Knee Score will again be assessed. Those patients who
      report a score of 26 or less (on the 0-48 OKS scoring system), which is defined as poor by
      the Kalairajah classification (Kalairajah, 2005), will be approached to consent.  If consent
      is given and the patient is eligible to enter the trial,  randomisation into one of the
      following groups will occur:  to standard care (encompassing a one off physiotherapy review,
      6 weeks of home exercise prescription and final review) or to an interventional arm, where
      18 sessions of structured physiotherapy will be administered over a 6 week period, where 6
      of these sessions will be 'contact sessions' performed under the supervision of the
      physiotherapist.

      All trial participants will be reviewed immediately post intervention (i.e. at 14 weeks post
      operation) and then by postal questionnaire at 26 and 52 weeks post-operation.

    <description>Assess patient satisfaction with knee arthroplasty.  Assessed with a specific patient satisfaction question:
Are you satisfied with your knee replacement? (Possible responses: very satisfied, satisfied, dissatisfied, very dissatisfied) Specific satisfaction with pain relief and functional ability will also be assessed.  4 additional sub-questions relating to facets of satisfaction:
&quot;How well did the surgery relieve the pain in your affected joint?&quot;
&quot;How well did the surgery increase your ability to perform regular activities?&quot;
&quot;How well did the surgery allow you to perform heavy work or sport activities?&quot;
&quot;How well did the surgery meet your expectations?&quot;
