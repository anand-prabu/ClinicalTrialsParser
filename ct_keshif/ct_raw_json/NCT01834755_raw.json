For patients\n      reaching The making decision to treat ESRD with renal replacement therapy is a complex\n      process and needs to be shared between patients, family, physician and nephrologist.\n\n      Systematic Information delivery about several treatments of ESRD is recommended for patients\n      and his family (Hemodialysis, Peritoneal Dialysis, Kidney Transplantation and Conservative\n      treatment). Some studies on the preference of patients for renal replacement therapy\n      reported a choice for PD about 50% while the registers report a low diffusion of PD (around\n      10%). Since 2009 we propose a systematic information about the different therapeutic options\n      for ESRD and identified some clinical characteristics associated to patient's preference.\n      However we want to know if psychological or physical phenotype is associated to patient's\n      preference.\n\n      The objective of the study is to highlight the relationship between psychological and\n      physical profiles and patient's preference to better understand the patient's treatment\n      preference and improve the information provided."
