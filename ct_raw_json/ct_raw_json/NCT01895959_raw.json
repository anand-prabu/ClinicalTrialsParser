High-field HRMAS NMR spectroscopy will provide sensitive measures for biochemical\n           changes within knee synovial fluid after HA injection;\n\n        2. Baseline HRMAS spectroscopy, in particular N-acetyl peaks, as well as early changes of\n           glutamate will predict patient response of pain relief after HA injection;\n\n        3. MR cartilage T1p and T2 quantifications will provide sensitive measures for biochemical\n           changes within knee cartilage matrix after HA injection.  Specifically cartilage T1p\n           and T2 will decrease in patients who respond to the treatment, indicating potential\n           beneficial effects of HA injection to cartilage preservation."
