        Inclusion Criteria:

        Individuals eligible for enrollment in this study are those:

          1. Male and female subjects from 2 to 55 years of the age at the time of Visit 1
             (including all 55 years old subjects, up to one day before their 56th year birthday),
             who are scheduled to receive vaccination with MenACWY-CRM conjugate vaccine,
             according to the local prescribing information and routine clinical practice;

          2. To whom the nature of the study has been described and the subject or subject's
             parent/legal representative has provided written informed consent;

          3. Whom the investigator believes that the subject can and will comply with the
             requirements of the protocol (e.g., completion of the Diary Card);

          4. Who are in good health as determined by the outcome of medical history, physical
             assessment and clinical judgment of the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Contraindication, special warnings and/or precautions, as evaluated by the
        investigators, reported in the MenACWY-CRM conjugate vaccine Korean prescribing
        information. In particular, should not be included in the study a subject who has ever
        had:

          -  An allergic reaction to the active substances or any of the other ingredients of the
             study vaccine; an allergic reaction to diphtheria toxoid;

          -  An illness with high fever; however, a mild fever or upper respiratory infection (for
             example cold) itself is not a reason to delay vaccination.

        Special care should be taken for subjects having haemophilia or any other problem that may
        stop your blood from clotting properly, such as persons receiving blood thinners
        (anticoagulants).
