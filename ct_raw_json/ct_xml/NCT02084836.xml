  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with increased risk for mortality, atherosclerotic cerebrovascular
      disease, coronary heart disease, colorectal cancer, hyperlipidemia, hypertension,
      gallbladder disease, and diabetes mellitus, resulting in over 111,000 deaths annually in the
      United States (Calle et al., 1999; Flegal et al., 2005).  In the US, 65% of adults are
      overweight or obese (Hedley et al., 2004).  Unfortunately, the treatment of choice for
      obesity (behavioral weight loss treatment) only results in a 10% reduction in body weight on
      average and most patients regain this weight within a few years (Jeffery et al., 2000).
      Further, most obesity prevention programs do not reduce risk for future weight gain (Stice,
      Shaw, &amp; Marti, 2006). The limited success of treatment and prevention interventions may be
      due to an incomplete understanding of the processes that increase risk for obesity. Recent
      data suggest that obese adults show abnormalities in reward from food intake and anticipated
      food intake relative to lean adults, but the precise nature of these abnormalities is
      unclear and it has not been established whether these abnormalities predate obesity onset or
      are a consequence. It is vital to elucidate risk factors for obesity onset to advance
      understanding of etiological processes and determine the content of prevention and treatment
      programs.

      The goals of this study are to (1) determine whether adolescents at high-risk for obesity,
      by virtue of having two obese parents, show abnormalities in reward from food intake
      (consummatory food reward) and anticipated reward from food intake (anticipatory food
      reward) compared to adolescents who are at low-risk for obesity, (2) determine whether
      abnormalities in consummatory and anticipatory food reward increase risk for weight gain and
      obesity onset, (3) examine moderators that may amplify the relations of consummatory and
      anticipatory food reward to unhealthy weight gain, and (4) examine changes in consummatory
      and anticipatory food reward in those participants who show obesity onset relative to those
      not showing obesity onset.
