  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, first-time-in-human study with a standard 3+3
      dose-escalation phase in subjects with advanced solid tumors followed by an expansion phase
      in patients with advanced solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A  dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of MEDI4736 (a monoclonal antibody that targets
      programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)) will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, IM,
      and antitumor activity of MEDI4637 in adult patients with solid tumors.
