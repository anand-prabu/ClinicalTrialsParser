The long-term goals of this research are to: 1) more\n      accurately inform patients/parents regarding potential neurobehavioral outcomes; 2) develop\n      sensitive measures of disease progression and central nervous system (CNS) treatment\n      outcome; and 3) help clinical researchers develop direct treatments for specific brain\n      structures/functions. The investigators hypothesize that specific and localized neuroimaging\n      and neuropsychological findings and their relationship will be distinct for each MPS\n      disorder.  It is further hypothesized that without treatment, functions will decline and\n      structure will change over time in a predictable fashion, and will be related to locus of\n      abnormality and stage of disease."

Recent treatment advances have produced amelioration of some of these\n      malfunctions, but notably brain and bone have been difficult to effectively treat.  This\n      research addresses the brain abnormalities in the MPS disorders, about which little is\n      known.\n\n      The objectives of this research are:\n\n        1. to identify abnormalities of central nervous system (CNS) structure and function as\n           well as to measure quality-of-life (QOL) in both treated and untreated MPS patients\n           over time. The investigators will accomplish this through longitudinal studies of\n           enrolled patients in designated centers in North America.\n\n        2. to develop quantitative measurements of change, including direct measurement of\n           neuropsychological function; surrogate MRI markers; and biomarkers to measure stage of\n           disease and treatment outcomes.\n\n        3. to examine the degree to which independent variables have an impact on both functional\n           and structural outcome.  Independent variables may include, but are not limited to: age\n           at first treatment, severity of disease, types of medical abnormalities, nature of\n           genetic mutation, medical events, and sensory abnormalities.\n\n        4. to examine how treatments such as Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT), Hematopoietic Cell\n           Transplant (HCT), substrate reduction, and other palliative and rehabilitative\n           therapies differentially affect CNS structure and function, as well as the subject's\n           quality of life."
