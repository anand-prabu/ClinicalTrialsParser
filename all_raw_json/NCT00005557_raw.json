            "textblock": "BACKGROUND:\n\n      Recent research has shown that sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is much more common than\n      previously thought. While it is known that in clinic samples, SDB is associated with\n      hypertension, cardiovascular disease and mortality, little is known about the natural\n      history of this disorder, particularly in the general population, nor about the causal role\n      of known risk factors. The knowledge obtained from the results of this study will help\n      advance the field of sleep disorders medicine. Information about longitudinal effects and\n      causal relationships may be applied to clinical situations, thus reducing the morbidity and\n      mortality associated with this disorder.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      In this longitudinal study, follow-up polysomnography and other protocols are conducted on\n      an established cohort of men and women (age 30-60  years at the time of initial recruitment\n      in 1989), currently enrolled in the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study. The study aims to : 1)\n      describe the natural history of SDB across middle and older age; 2) investigate associations\n      of SDB with early and intermediate markers of cardiovascular dysfunction, damage, and\n      cardiovascular disease; 3) investigate the longitudinal association of SDB in accelerated\n      cognitive decline; 4) investigate the association of SDB and adverse sleep characteristics\n      with age-related risk factors and outcomes."
