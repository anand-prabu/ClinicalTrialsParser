This seriously affects the quality of care of chronic respiratory diseases.\n\n      OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of two methods for quality control in performing\n      spirometry in primary care teams (EAP) participating in the \"Healthcare Process Chronic\n      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD )\" (multidisciplinary program between primary care\n      medicine and hospital for improved care COPD).\n\n      METHODS: Randomized controlled trial of clusters of EAP participants ( n = 17 ). The quality\n      control of spirometry in each EAP randomize into three branches:\n\n        1. Supervision from the pulmonary function laboratory of the Hospital ; computer.\n\n        2. Program incorporated into automated spirometer.\n\n        3. Spirometric usual practice (control group without any support on the quality ).\n           Spirometry EAP participants include year follow-up study . All sites use the same model\n           spirometer and have received the same previous training . In a 2nd phase results\n           implementing the most effective method shown in the 1st phase was studied.\n\n      EXPECTED RESULTS : The method for quality control more effective to obtain and maintain the\n      quality spirometry.\n\n      POTENTIAL IMPACT EXPECTED : performing spirometry quality in the EAP , improve early\n      detection (secondary prevention ) , the diagnosis of the severity and developmental control\n      of COPD."
