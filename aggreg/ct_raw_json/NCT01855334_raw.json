We will test 2 specific agents:  The mineralocorticoid receptor blocker\n      spironolactone; and L-arginine, an agent which improves NO bioavailability. Two specific\n      aims will be addressed using a prospective, double-blinded, 2x2 factorial trial in dialysis\n      dependent patients with ESRD. Subjects will be randomized to placebo, spironolactone plus\n      placebo, L-arginine plus placebo, or combination spironolactone and L-arginine therapy.\n      Diastolic cardiac function will be assessed using tissue Doppler index (TDI) determined\n      mitral annular velocities (E') on LV echocardiography, and microvascular supply will be\n      assessed using CFR\u2014the ratio of hyperemic to resting myocardial blood flow\u2014measured by\n      positron emission tomography (PET) scans at baseline, 2 weeks and after 9 months of\n      randomized therapy.\n\n      This randomized trial of spironolactone and L-arginine will provide important data about the\n      contributions of aldosterone and NO to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in ESRD,\n      will demonstrate the therapeutic potential of L-arginine and spironolactone as as targeted\n      cardiovascular therapies for use in ESRD, and will provide important insights into the\n      underlying pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease in ESRD. The results generated will\n      provide the data needed to design large-scale trials testing whether spironolactone or\n      L-arginine can improve mortality or cardiovascular outcomes in ESRD."
