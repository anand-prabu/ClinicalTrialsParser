    <description>The open-label dose escalation part of the study will be guided by a well-established statistical method/model to estimate the maximum tolerated dose(s) and/or Recommended Phase II Dose (s) guided by the safety (incidence of dose limiting toxicities), efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data.</description>

    <description>Progression-free survival is the time from date of start of treatment to the date of event defined as the first documented progression or death due to any cause.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)

          -  No more than one prior chemotherapy regimen for recurrent or metastatic ESCC (for
             Phase II only).

          -  Progression during or after platinum-based therapy for recurrent or metastatic ESCC,
             or recurrence within 6 months of platinum-based chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy for
             localized disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who received prior phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor or
             anti-receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-3 (ERBB3 or HER3) antibody treatment,
             including bi-specific antibodies with HER3 as one of the targets (patients with prior
             exposure to pertuzumab or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted agents are
             eligible)

          -  Patients who do not have an archival or fresh tumor sample (or sections of it)
             available or readily obtainable.

          -  Patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastatic involvement.

          -  Patients who have received prior systemic anti-cancer treatment, such as cyclical
             chemotherapy or biological therapy within a period of time that is shorter than the
             cycle length used for that treatment (e.g. 6 weeks for nitrosourea, mitomycin-C)
             prior to starting study treatment.

          -  Patients who have received definitive radiotherapy ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting study
             drug, who have not recovered from side effects of such therapy and/or from whom ≥ 30%
             of the bone marrow was irradiated.

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
