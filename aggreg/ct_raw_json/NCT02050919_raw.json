Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the\n      enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as epirubicin hydrochloride\n      and ifosfamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing\n      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to\n      kill tumor cells. Giving sorafenib tosylate, combination chemotherapy, radiation therapy,\n      and surgery may be an effective treatment for soft tissue sarcoma."
