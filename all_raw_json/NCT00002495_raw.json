Arm I: Radiotherapy. Subtotal nodal irradiation using megavoltage\n      equipment (4-10 MeV). Arm II: 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy followed by Radiotherapy.\n      Doxorubicin, DOX, NSC-123127; Vinblastine, VBL, NSC-49842; followed by subtotal nodal\n      irradiation as in Arm I.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 210 patients/arm will be enrolled over about 7 years."
