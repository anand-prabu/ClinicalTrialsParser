Previous diagnosis of early esophageal neoplasia is\n      based on the lugol staining which is time wasting and have many adverse events.Other\n      researches have suggested virtual chromoendoscopys are beneficial for screening esophageal\n      tumors. Therefore, the aim of the present study is 1.To investigate the diagnosing value of\n      pCLE for early esophageal squamous neoplasia according to the surface maturation\n      scoring(SMS) diagnostic criteria and 2. To assess the detection rate of early esophageal\n      squamous neoplasia by virtual chromoendoscopy(I-SCAN)."
