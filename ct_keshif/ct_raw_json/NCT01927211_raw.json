The secondary\n      objective is to assess the cosmetic outcome of the cesarean incision observed at the 1-week\n      and 6-week post-operative visits.  A panel of plastic surgeons will conduct a blinded\n      assessment of cosmetic outcome by review of photographs taken of the wounds at 1-week and\n      6-weeks.
