  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this aim, we propose to conduct a double blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized
      clinical trial to compare the clinical effectiveness of radicular pain relief by either
      acupuncture therapy or a course of pain medication (e.g., Gabapentin) using Quantitative
      Sensory Testing (QST).

    <description>Gabapentin is a commonly prescribed drug used to treat neuropathic pain.  The placebo will be used to mimic side effects common to gabapentin.  The two medication treatment groups' results will be compared to each other.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject will be between ages 18 to 65 years. Both male and female subjects will be
             recruited.

          2. Subject should have had cervical or lumbar radicular pain for at least two months.
             This requirement is to avoid the uncertainty of an unstable pain condition and to
             minimize the study variation.

          3. Subject has a pain score of 4 or above (visual analog scale, VAS: 0 - 10 from no pain
             to worst pain).

          4. Cervical or lumbar radicular pain will include, but is not limited to, such clinical
             conditions as disk herniation, spinal stenosis, and post-laminectomy syndrome.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has detectable sensory deficits at the site of QST. Sensory deficits refer to
             such conditions resulting from neurological diseases or medical conditions causing
             peripheral polyneuropathy and sensory changes, which include but are not limited to
             diabetic neuropathy, alcoholic neuropathy, AIDS neuropathy, severe thyroid disease,
             and severe liver or kidney disorders.

          2. Subject has scar tissue, infection, or acute injury at the site of QST.

          3. Subject is pregnant.

          4. Subject tests positive for illicit drugs.

          5. Subject has a pacemaker.

          6. Subject is currently taking gabapentin.
