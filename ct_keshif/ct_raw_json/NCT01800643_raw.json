            "textblock": "-  Busulfan is an alkylating antineoplastic agent used commonly during the conditioning\n           regimen (CR) in patient undergoing Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT). Due\n           to the fact that this drug has a variable metabolism in different individuals, the\n           investigators performed the plasmatic dosage of chemotherapy before starting the\n           conditioning regimen (test dose) as a way to predict the best dose to them during the\n           CR. Busulfan toxicities depends on the \"Area Under Curve\" and Concentration Steady\n           State (CSS) that the investigators see by the pharmacokinetic study.\n\n        -  The investigators randomized in two groups according to the route of drug\n           administration: Oral and intravenous. For both the investigators did test dose before\n           HSCT and in the first day of CR. The dosage of test dose was 1 mg/Kg/dose for oral\n           formulation of busulfan and 32 mg/m2 for intravenous busulfan. The dose of busulfan\n           that the investigators give for the patients during the CR depends on the\n           pharmacokinetics obtained during the test dose. On the first day of CR the\n           investigators calculated plasma levels again to make adjustments according the \"Area\n           Under Curve\" target. This is a good way to know the population pharmacokinetic study of\n           busulfan before and during HSCT.\n\n        -  To test dose analysis pharmacokinetic and analysis during CR for oral busulfan, the\n           investigators collect peripheral blood samples at the time: 0h (before taking\n           busulfan), 30', 1h, 1,5h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 5h and 6h after taking this drug. To test dose\n           for intravenous busulfan the investigators collect on time 0h, 30', 45', 1h, 2h, 3h,\n           4h, 5h, 6h and 8h after receiving busulfan. If the patient is receiving intravenous\n           busulfan during CR, the blood samples should be collected on time 0h, 30', 1h, 2h, 3h,\n           4h, 5h, 6h, 7h and 8h after taking busulfan. The blood samples will be centrifuged (4\u00ba\n           C/ 3200 rpm/10 minutes) and analysed.\n\n        -  Since pharmacokinetic study until clinical outcomes, patients will be monitored. The\n           investigators will evaluate acute and chronic toxicities after Stem Cell\n           Transplantation."
