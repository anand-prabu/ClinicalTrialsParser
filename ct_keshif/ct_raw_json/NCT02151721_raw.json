            "textblock": "-  Gefitinib is an orally active epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase\n           inhibitor (EGFR-TKI). However, 20-30% of patients with EGFR-activating mutations show\n           intrinsic resistance to EGFR-TKI.\n\n        -  EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells with BIM (BCL2L11) deletion\n           polymorphism show the impaired generation of BIM with the proapoptotic BH3 domain, as\n           well as resistance to EGFR-TKI-induced apoptosis.\n\n        -  Both BIM polymorphism (12.9%) and EGFR mutations (50% in lung adenocarcinoma) are more\n           prevalent in the East Asian than in Caucasian populations. BIM is a BH3-only\n           proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family. BIM upregulation is required for\n           apoptosis induction by EGFR-TKI in EGFR-mutant NSCLC.\n\n        -  Vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid [SAHA]) is a small-molecule inhibitor of\n           histone deacetylase (HDAC) and induces cell differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and\n           apoptosis in several tumor cells. HDAC inhibition can epigenetically restore BIM\n           function and death sensitivity of EGFR-TKI in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC in whom\n           resistance to EGFR-TKI is associated with a common BIM polymorphism. EGFR-TKI\n           resistance due to the BIM polymorphism may be able to be circumvented in combination\n           with HDAC inhibition of vorinostat with gefitinib in NSCLC."
