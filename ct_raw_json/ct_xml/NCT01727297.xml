      This study is to determine, through continuous monitoring with the Reveal implantable
      cardiac monitor (ICM), the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients suspected to be
      at high risk for having AF and to understand how physicians manage these patients after AF
      has been detected.  This study will also seek to identify what patient characteristics are
      most predictive of developing AF.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient meets the approved indications to receive the Reveal ICM

          -  Patient is suspected, based on symptomatology and/or demographics, of having atrial
             fibrillation or at high risk of having AF, as determined by the clinical investigator

          -  Patient has a CHADS2 score â‰¥ 3 OR has a CHADS2 score = 2 WITH at least one of the
             following documented: Renal impairment (GFR 30-60 ml/min, sleep apnea, coronary
             artery disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Note: stroke/TIA criterion
             as part of the CHADS2 score for this trial is limited to either an ischemic stroke or
             TIA, which occurred MORE THAN one year prior to enrollment.

          -  Patient is 18 years of age or older

          -  Patient has a life expectancy of 18 months or more

          -  Patient, or legally authorized representative, is willing to sign and date the
             consent form

          -  Patient is willing and able to be remotely monitored (i.e., eligible for enrollment
             into the Medtronic CareLink Network)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has a documented history of AF or atrial flutter

          -  Patient had an ischemic stroke or TIA within past year prior to enrollment

          -  Patient has a history of a hemorrhagic stroke

          -  Patient is currently implanted with an IPG, ICD, CRT-P, or CRT-D device

          -  NYHA Class IV Heart Failure patient

          -  Patient had heart surgery within previous 90 days prior to enrollment

          -  Patient had an MI within the previous 90 days prior to enrollment

          -  Patient is taking chronic immuno-suppressant therapy

          -  Patient is taking an anti-arrhythmic drug

          -  Patient is contraindicated for long term anticoagulation medication

          -  Patient is taking a long-term anticoagulation medication

          -  Any concomitant condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would not allow
             safe participation in the study (e.g., drug addiction, alcohol abuse, emotional /
             psychological diagnosis)

          -  Patient is enrolled in another study that could confound the results of this study,
             without documented pre-approval from Medtronic study manager

          -  Patient has a creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min or is on dialysis
