Although it was\n      never tested on HTLV-1 associated overactive bladder syndrome, an disabling disease that is\n      common seen in HAM/TSP patients but can also appear as an isolated form. Our hypothesis is\n      that urological physical therapy can improve urinary symptoms like incontinence, urgency and\n      nocturia in HTLV-1 infected population with those complains."

It is estimated that about 20 million people is infected worldwide. In Brazil\n      it is present in all states with variable prevalences. The factors associated with HTLV-1\n      transmission in Brazil are related to the social and demographic condition, characterized by\n      rural exodus and increase of urban population in the coast areas.\n\n      Several studies based in Brazil reported that the epicenter of HTLV-1 infection is on Bahia,\n      Maranh\u00e3o and Pernambuco with the highest prevalence of 1,8% in Salvador, Bahia capital.\n\n      The urinary incontinence is a bladder-sphincter disturbance often found in HTLV-1 patients.\n      In this infection the most common pathology finding is overactive bladder syndrome due\n      detrusor overactivity and sphincter-detrusor dyssynergia and the symptoms are urgency,\n      nocturia and incontinence.\n\n      This disabling disease is associated with psychosocial issues like loss of self confidence,\n      social isolation and reduced quality of life.\n\n      The physical therapy treatment have the objective of promote social adequacy and reestablish\n      the bladder function. It is based on resources like: bladder reeducation, biofeedback,\n      kinesiotherapy of the pelvic wall, utilization of vaginal cones and electrostimulation.\n\n      Those can be associated or not with anticholinergic drugs and bladder catheterization.\n\n      The need of urologic and gynecologic physical therapy follow up in patients with HTLV-1 and\n      neurogenic bladder is important to reduce disability, preserve pelvic muscles and renal\n      function."
