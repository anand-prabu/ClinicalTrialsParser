Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan followed by radiation\n      therapy and temozolomide in treating children who have newly diagnosed brain tumor."

Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses. Following completion of irinotecan\n      and if appropriate, patients may undergo a second surgical resection.\n\n      Within 2 weeks following completion of chemotherapy or within 4 weeks of following a second\n      resection, patients receive image guided external beam radiotherapy 5 days per week for 6\n      weeks. Patients with residual tumor less than 3.5 cm in maximal diameter may undergo boost\n      radiosurgery.\n\n      At 4 weeks following completion of radiotherapy, patients receive oral temozolomide for 5\n      days. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 4 months for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years."
