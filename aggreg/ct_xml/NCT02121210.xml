      Total study duration is up to 34 weeks: Up to 4-week screening period, 24-week open-label
      treatment phase, 6-week post-treatment observation. After completion of the treatment phase
      of this study, patients are eligible to enter a long term safety study (LTS11210 -
      SARIL-RA-EXTEND) for continuous treatment with sarilumab (SAR153191 [REGN88]).

          -  Moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis.

          -  Patients who per investigator judgment were incomplete responders to at least 12
             weeks of an adequate dose of continuous treatment with or who were intolerant of one
             or a combination of non-biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patients &lt; 18 years of age.

          -  Past history of, or current, autoimmune or inflammatory systemic or localized joint

          -  History of juvenile idiopathic arthritis or arthritis onset prior to age 16.

          -  Severe active systemic RA, including but not limited to vasculitis, pulmonary
             fibrosis, and/or Felty's syndrome.

          -  Prior treatment with any biologic anti-interleukin 6 (IL-6) or IL-6 receptor (IL-6R)
             antagonist therapies.

          -  Treatment with prednisone &gt; 10 mg or equivalent per day, or change in dosage within 4
             weeks prior to randomization.

          -  New treatment with or dose-adjustment of on-going nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
             (NSAIDs) or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors within 4 weeks prior to
             randomization, except for the use of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid for cardiovascular
             diseases.

          -  Use of parenteral glucocorticoids or intraarticular glucocorticoids injection within
             4 weeks prior to randomization.

          -  Prior treatment with a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor (tofacitinib).

          -  New treatment or dose-adjustment to on-going medication for dyslipidemia, such as
             statin, within 6 weeks prior to randomization.

          -  Participation in any clinical research study evaluating another investigational drug
             or therapy within 5 half-lives or 60 days of first dose of study drug administration,
             whichever is longer.

          -  Patients with a history of malignancy other than adequately-treated carcinoma in-situ
             of the cervix, nonmetastatic squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma of the skin,
