            "textblock": "Cryotherapy has a long history of safe use in various medical procedures. RejuvenAir System\n      radial spray cryotherapy is a novel procedure being developed as a treatment for conditions\n      associated with abnormal bronchial function, such as chronic bronchitis. The development of\n      appropriate reliable equipment, definition of therapeutic parameters, and an understanding\n      of the tissue effects of treatment have been established through animal studies.  This\n      clinical study is being undertaken to assess the feasibility and safety of the application\n      of a radial metered dose spray cryotherapy in the human airway and to evaluate the treatment\n      depth in human airways. The study design is  prospective, open label, single arm\n      multi-center study that will consist of up to 15 subjects at up to 3 enrolling sites in\n      Ireland, UK and The Netherlands RejuvenAir System treatment will be performed during\n      preoperative bronchoscopy 0 to 60 days prior to prescheduled lung resection in Subjects\n      requiring lobectomy or pneumonectomy for removal of peripheral tumors. Treatment will be\n      limited to areas of the bronchi within the lobe that will be removed, distal to the\n      anticipated margin of resection.  Treatment should be at least 1 cm from the bronchial\n      resection margins and away from the tumor bed. Treated airways will be inspected via\n      bronchoscopy at the time of thoracotomy, and examined histologically following surgical\n      resection. Subject participation will be from 1 to 60 days and enrollment is anticipated to\n      take 4-5 months.Total study duration is expected to last approximately 10 months."
