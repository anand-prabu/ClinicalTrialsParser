  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the study drug is safe, tolerable and active in
      reducing fluid overload/weight gain between dialysis sessions for patients with End Stage
      Renal Disease on Hemodialysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of the study drug in male and female
      patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. The study consists of a 2 week
      treatment-free run-in period where entry criteria are verified, a 4-week treatment period,
      of which the first week of treatment will be performed as an in-patient study in a clinical
      pharmacology unit (CPU) and the remaining three weeks of treatment will performed as an
      out-patient study, and a 2-week treatment-free follow-up period.

      Safety assessments will be performed at regular intervals and will include clinical and
      vital signs, clinical laboratory evaluations, ECGs, and AE monitoring. Pharmacodynamic
      assessments will include, but are not limited to, interdialytic weight gain (IDWG), blood
      pressure, and stool sodium excretion. Pharmacokinetic assessments will include blood
      sampling for measurement of study drug plasma concentrations.
