  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persons undergoing cardiac rehabilitation often have difficulties transferring the learned
      health behaviors into their daily routine which decreases their health status.
      Computer-based tailored interventions have been shown to be effective in increasing physical
      activity as well as fruit and vegetable consumption. The aim of this study is, to support
      people in transferring these two learned behavior changes and their antecedents into their
      daily life after cardiac rehabilitation in Germany, the Netherlands and China. The primary
      goal of the study is to analyze the effectiveness of a rehabilitation aftercare program with
      regard to the level of physical activity and nutrition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For cardiac patients, medical rehabilitation after severe medical incidents (e.g., bypass
      surgery, heart attack, heart failure) is a central part in the recovery process. Health
      behavior change is an important subject within rehabilitation, and patients have to learn
      how to improve their eating habits and increase their physical activity. Back home, the
      adoption, maintenance and transfer into daily life of the behavior change is difficult.
      Until now it is unclear how such a complex behavior change actually takes place and how it
      can be supported effectively. On basis of theoretical assumptions (health action process
      approach, HAPA, Schwarzer, 1992, and compen¬satory carry-over action model, CCAM, Lippke,
      2010) multiple behavior change will be observed and supported in an online intervention. To
      its effects, an intervention will be provided firstly targeting physical activity, secondly
      nutrition and compared with a waiting-list control group. Furthermore, very little is known
      about intercultural differences and therefore will be tested with rehabilitation patients
      with various cultural backgrounds. This all will be archived in the study RENATA.

      RENATA is an online based intervention for post-rehabilitative medical care, with the aim to
      integrate skills and behavior patterns, which were gained during the rehabilitation, into
      daily life of the participants. The goal is to maintain learning results for a long period
      of time, improve rehabilitation effects at a sustained basis and support the return to the
      labor market i.e. to work. The objective of this research project is to increase the
      self-regulatory abilities of participants to the extent that they are able to be regularly
      and autonomously physically active and eat healthy, so that they will increase their quality
      of life and become resilient.

      Due to the fact that there is only a limited number of evaluated programs, the present
      research project has the aim (1) to offer such a program and to test the effectiveness.
      Moreover, compared on an international level it will be considered (2) if such an aftercare
      program helps participants equally in different countries with rehabilitation systems
      varying in intensity. This question will be investigated by comparing Germany, the
      Netherlands and China. Due to the demographic changes, there are rising numbers of older
      employees in the labor market who will and should be kept in. Within this context, the last
      research aim is (3) to examine age effects in detail: Is it possible to determine
      age-specific differences in the effectiveness of the different interventions?
