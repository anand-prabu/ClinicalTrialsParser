Giving low doses of\n      chemotherapy, such as fludarabine phosphate, and total body irradiation (TBI) before a donor\n      peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also\n      keep the patient's immune response from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem\n      cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells\n      (graft-versus-tumor effect). Giving an infusion of the donor's T cells (donor lymphocyte\n      infusion) after the transplant may help increase this effect. Sometimes the transplanted\n      cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving\n      cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from happening."
