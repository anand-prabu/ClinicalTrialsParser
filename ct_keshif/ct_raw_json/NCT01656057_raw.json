            "textblock": "The last couple of years it has been shown that bile acids not only acts as simple\n      emulsifiers of fat, but constitutes a complex metabolic integrator which not only have an\n      influence on fat digestion and lipid metabolism, but also modulates the energi expenditure\n      in (brown) adipose tissue and muscle tissue. This action is due to stimulation of the\n      receptor TGR5 by bile acids. Recently scientists have discovered that this receptor in\n      rodents is also expressed on the surface of intestinal L-cells (which normally secrets GLP-1\n      in respons to nutrient stimulation). The stimulation of this receptor has shown a GLP-1\n      secretion from the intestinal cells which is interesting since GLP-1 has a central role in\n      the maintainance of a normal glucose tolerance and thus blood sugar. Given the above, bile\n      acids has an important impact on intestinal GLP-1 secretion. Whether these scientific\n      findings can be proven in human beings is uncertain.\n\n      The primary hypothesis is that stimulating gall bladder emptying via CCK in healthy subjects\n      will result in a significant GLP-1 response. We also hypothesize that adding orally\n      Metformin or a sequestrant (\"a bile acid binder\") will further enhance this GLP-1 response."
