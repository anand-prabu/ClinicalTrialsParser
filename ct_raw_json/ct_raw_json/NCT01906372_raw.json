            "textblock": "Despite its FDA approval there is very limited data on its clinical effectiveness in PM and\n      DM. There was a recent study published in the peer-review journal Drug Design, Development\n      and Therapy on a retrospective case series evaluating Acthar in the treatment of PM and DM.\n      Acthar was administered to five patients who had previously failed multiple steroid and\n      immunosuppressant treatment regimens. The patients received injections of Acthar over the\n      course of 12 weeks or more. Improvement in PM and DM symptoms related to disease\n      exacerbations was seen in all five patients. Symptom improvements included increased muscle\n      strength, resolution of disease-related skin manifestations and improvements in the ability\n      to perform tasks associated with daily living. All of these patients tolerated the treatment\n      well with no significant side effects reported. The paper, \"Treating refractory\n      dermatomyositis or polymyositis with adrenocorticotropic hormone gel: a retrospective case\n      series,\" was authored by Dr. Todd Levine, M.D., Co-Director of the Neurophysiology\n      Department at Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center, Assistant Professor at the University of\n      Arizona in Neurology, and Member of Phoenix Neurological Associates.\n\n      H.P. Acthar\u00ae Gel, or Acthar, is a prescription medication containing the hormone\n      adrenocorticotropin (hormone produced and secreted by the anterior pituitary gland), also\n      known as ACTH. H.P. Acthar Gel is a highly purified preparation of adrenocorticotropic\n      hormone (ACTH) in a gel that is designed to provide extended release of the ACTH following\n      injection. Acthar was originally approved by the FDA in 1952. It is approved for use in 19\n      different conditions including dermatomyositis and polymyositis.\n\n      Acthar is designed to provide a prolonged release of the medication after it is injected.\n      Acthar is not a steroid; it works by helping your body produce its own natural steroid\n      hormones, such as cortisol, corticosterone, and aldosterone. Acthar is an injection that is\n      given intramuscularly (into the muscle). Subjects enrolled in the study will be asked to\n      self administer Acthar two times per week. Subjects will be provided training by the\n      principal investigator on how to perform the self injections."
