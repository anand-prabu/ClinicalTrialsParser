    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy were confirmed
      based on the European Federation of Neurological Societies/ Peripheral. Nerve Society
      Guideline. Patients who meet all inclusion criteria and do not conflict with the exclusion
      criteria will receive NPB-01 (intravenous immunoglobulin) 400mg/kg/day for five consecutive
      days. Subsequently, patients receive NPB-01 1g/kg every 3weeks and evaluate the Inflammatory
      Neuropathy Cause and Treatment（INCAT） score and INCAT sensory sumscore（ISS） et al.

      As a safety endpoint, the safety of NPB-01 will be investigated the occurrence of adverse
      events by one year after the start of the study treatment.
