Some children are given\n      inhaled steroids (similar to what children with asthma use). Others are carefully watched\n      and cautioned to avoid potential triggers (certain foods, environmental allergens, etc), and\n      should episodes of croup recur they are treated with a short course of oral steroids.  The\n      purpose of our study is to compare two safe and clinically appropriate methods for treating\n      recurrent croup, daily inhaled steroids versus observation with oral steroids on an as\n      needed basis, to see if either is useful in preventing future episodes of croup."
