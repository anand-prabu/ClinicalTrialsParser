TXA functions to decrease blood loss by affecting the blood clotting system\n      within the body.  The investigators hypothesize that topical application of TXA prior to\n      closure reduces postoperative bleeding as measured by absolute changes in postoperative\n      hemoglobin levels and surgical drain output.  In addition, use of topically applied\n      tranexaminic acid may reduce the need for transfusions, the rates of hematomas, infections,\n      and length of hospital stay."
