Direct manual pressure with a gauze sponge will be applied following its application for 2 minutes, ensuring that it adheres to the bleeding bone surface.\nPreparation of  Floseal requires mixing 5,000 US units of package thrombin (bovine-derived) made up to 5 milliliters of saline solution, to the Gelatin Matrix solution. In this study, 2-4 vials (15-20 mls total) will be used."
