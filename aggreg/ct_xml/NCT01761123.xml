    <textblock>
      the purpose of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of VXA-A1.1, an
      adjuvanted adenoviral based influenza vaccine, when delivery is targeted to the ileum, using
      a radio controlled capsule.  The secondary objective is to evaluate the immune response
      (cellular and humoral) of two doses of VXA-A1.1 oral vaccine.
