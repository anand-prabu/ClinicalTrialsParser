  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GWEP1332 Part B will recruit an entirely new group of subjects to GWEP1332 Part A. Part B is
      a 1:1 randomized, double blind placebo-controlled 12-week comparison of GWP42003-P versus
      placebo. The aim of Part B is to assess the antiepileptic efficacy of GWP42003-P as an
      adjunctive antiepileptic treatment compared with placebo, with respect to the percentage
      change from baseline in convulsive seizure frequency in children and young adults.

      Following establishment of initial eligibility and baseline measurements, subjects will
      enter Part B and begin a 28-day baseline observation period. Subjects who have experienced
      least four convulsive seizures (tonic-clonic seizures and/or drop attacks) during the
      baseline period and who meet all of the other inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria
      will be eligible to continue in the study.

      Eligible subjects will then be randomized to receive either GWP42003-P or placebo on a 1:1
      basis, and will titrate up to the dose that was identified in Part A as the maximum
      tolerated dose (up to 20 mg/kg/day: to be confirmed following completion of Part A by an
      independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee who will review unblinded safety and
      pharmacokinetic data from Part A).

      Subjects will receive investigational medicinal product for 12 weeks, consisting of a
      seven-day titration period, followed by an 11-week stable dose period.

      Efficacy and safety will be monitored at various clinic visits and via telephone.

      Efficacy measures include:

        -  Assessing changes from baseline in non-convulsive seizure frequency, sleep disruption,
           daytime sleepiness and conducting behavioral assessments in subjects taking GWP42003-P
           as an adjuvant treatment, when compared with placebo.

        -  Assessing the safety of GWP42003-P when compared with placebo. After completion of the
           Part B treatment period, subjects will be offered the option of entering an open label
           extension study.
