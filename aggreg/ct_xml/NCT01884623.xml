          -  Patients with nasopharyngeal cancer, paranasal sinus, or cervical lymph nodes
             metastasis of unknown origin.

          -  Prior systemic chemotherapy for the squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck, except
             if given as part of a multimodal treatment for locally advanced disease which was
             completed more than 6 months prior to study entry.

          -  Prior anti-EGFR therapy.

          -  Surgery (excluding prior diagnostic biopsy) or irradiation within 4 weeks before
             study entry.

             excipients.

             laboratory abnormality requiring further investigation that may cause undue risk for
             the patient's safety, inhibit protocol participation, or interfere with
             interpretation of study results, and in the judgment of the investigator would make
             the patient inappropriate for entry into this study
