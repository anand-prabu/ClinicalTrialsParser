Fifty\n      patients of moderate palmer arsenical keratosis patients from an arsenic affected area will\n      be recruited on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria and had been drinking arsenic\n      contaminated water for more than six months. They will be divided into two groups each will\n      consist of twenty five members. One group will  be provided  A. indica plus 6% salicylic\n      acid  ointment to apply on palm overnight daily for 12 weeks. Another group will be provided\n      6% salicylic acid ointment . Water and nail sample will be collected before starting\n      recruitment to confirm diagnosis. Then again nail sample will be collected before and after\n      the study to see the level of arsenic in skin. Effects will be observed after every two\n      weeks and change will be detected as nil, mild reduction, moderate reduction and fully\n      cured."
