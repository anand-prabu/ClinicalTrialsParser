A secondary objective is to obtain preliminary\n      data for determining the effect of oral VP-16 on Kaposi's sarcoma.\n\n      VP-16 is an antitumor agent. Previous problems with VP-16 include the route of\n      administration and the toxicities. VP-16 has been given intravenously for 3 consecutive days\n      in a 21-day cycle for lung cancer and testicular cancer. VP-16 has also been used in\n      lymphoma therapy. Oral VP-16 would eliminate the need for an intravenous catheter and so a\n      patient could avoid the pain, inconvenience, and potential complications associated with\n      medications administered intravenously. The relative ease of outpatient administration and\n      the potentially significant antitumor activity of oral VP-16 motivates this study. The\n      possibility of weekly drug administration is the other focus of this study."
