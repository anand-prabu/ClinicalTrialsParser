Patients on Arms A, B, C, and D receive vaccine (or vaccine placebo) injections\n      at Weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12. Patients on Arms C and D receive IL-2 by self-injection. HAART is\n      not provided as part of this study.\n\n      Step II: Patients on all arms (A, B, C, and D) who meet inclusion criteria advance to Step\n      II and interrupt HAART for a minimum of 12 weeks. The efficacy of these immunological\n      therapies will be determined by monitoring the dynamics of viral rebound upon cessation of\n      antiviral therapy. After 12 weeks of Step II, patients whose viral load remains below 30,000\n      copies/ml remain on Step II, off HAART, and continue weekly viral load monitoring. Patients\n      will not terminate Step II or resume HAART unless and until their viral load increases to\n      more than 30,000 copies/ml on 3 successive determinations, or their CD4 count decreases to\n      less than 200 cells/mm3 or less than 50 percent of the baseline CD4+ T cell concentration on\n      2 successive occasions."
