  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a dietary supplement containing branched chain
      amino acids will reduce the muscle soreness that sometimes occurs in the days following
      exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Supplementation with branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) has been used to stimulate muscle
      protein synthesis following exercise. The purpose of this study was to determine if
      supplementation with BCAAs in combination with glucose would reduce exercise-induced delayed
      onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Using a double-blind crossover design, 20 subjects (11
      females, 9 males) were randomly assigned to either BCAA (n=10) or placebo (n=10) groups.
      Subjects performed a squatting exercise to elicit DOMS and rated their muscle soreness every
      24 hours for four days following exercise while continuing to consume the BCAA or placebo.
      Following a three-week recovery period, subjects returned and received the alternate BCAA or
      placebo treatment, repeating the same exercise and DOMS rating protocol for the next four
      days.  BCAA supplementation in female subjects resulted in a significant decrease in DOMS
      versus placebo at 24 hours following exercise (p = 0.018).  No significant effect of BCAA
      supplementation versus placebo was noted in male subjects, nor when male and female results
      were analyzed together.  This gender difference may be related to dose per body weight
      differences between male and female subjects.
