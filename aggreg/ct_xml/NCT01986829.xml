  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well cryoablation, radiofrequency ablation, or microwave
      ablation works in treating patients with metastatic sarcoma stable on chemotherapy.
      Cryoablation kills tumor cells by freezing them. Radiofrequency ablation uses a
      high-frequency, electric current to kill tumor cells. Microwave ablation kills tumor cells
      by heating them to several degrees above body temperature.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed high-grade metastatic sarcoma that has been
             stable on 6-12 cycles of one chemotherapeutic regimen (cytotoxic or biologic)
             although a change in chemotherapy is allowed if it is a result of
             toxicity/tolerability rather than progression.  A patient must not have evidence of
             progression at any time while on chemotherapy in order to be eligible for this trial.

          -  Measurable disease defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one
             dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥10 mm with CT scan, PET CT, or MRI
             exam.

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2 (Karnofsky ≥60%)

          -  Normal bone marrow and organ function as defined below:

          -  Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL

          -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcl

          -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x IULN or 3x IULN with normal ALT and AST in patients with
             Gilbert's disease

          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 3.0 x IULN

          -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR Creatinine clearance ≥ 50
             mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  INR&lt;1.5 or patient off Coumadin at the time of ablation

          -  No more than 10 treatable lesions as evaluated by an experienced interventional
             oncologic radiologist for eligibility and lesion accessibility as the ablation of
             more than 10 lesions becomes technically infeasible.  These lesions must be treated
             in a two- to three-week time period from initial interventional radiology evaluation.
              Lung and liver lesions can range from 1 cm to 7 cm for a single lesion and no
             greater than 5 cm for multiple lesions. There are no size criteria for the osseous
             lesions.

          -  The lesions will be amenable to a safe, ultrasound/computed tomographic/fluoroscopic
             guided percutaneous approach. The targeted metastases must be sufficiently
             separateable from the central nervous system, major peripheral motor nerves, bowel,
             and bladder.  All lesions must be amenable to treatment.

          -  If patients have received radiation therapy, there must be a one-month washout
             period.

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and
             for the duration of ablation.  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  Patient (or legally authorized representative if applicable) must be able to
             understand and willing to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  History of other malignancy ≤ 5 years previous with the exception of basal cell or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which were treated with local resection only or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          -  Receiving any other investigational agents simultaneously or within 3 weeks following
             ablation procedure.

          -  Known brain metastases.  Patients with known brain metastases must be excluded from
             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic
             and other adverse events.

          -  Intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia,
             or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.

          -  Patients that wish to continue chemotherapy after ablation, as ablation therapy is
             meant to serve as maintenance therapy in lieu of chemotherapy.

          -  Inclusion of Women and Minorities

        Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.
