Patients with inadequately treated acromegaly may have a higher chance of\n      a number of other diseases such as heart disease, diabetes as well as a shortened life\n      expectancy.  The purpose of this study is to carefully characterize the blood levels of\n      hormones and other substances in the blood in patients with acromegaly over time so that we\n      can gain a better understanding of those factors responsible for the excess morbidity and\n      mortality in acromegaly.\n\n      This study will follow acromegaly subjects during the therapy which has been decided by the\n      patient and patient's physician.  This study will not provide therapy for acromegaly.  A\n      patient qualifies as a possible study participant because the patient have been diagnosed\n      with acromegaly."

Subjects who enter the study 1 year after surgery or later will be\n      seen yearly for at least 5 years .\n\n      At each visit subjects will have an interview and examination with Dr. Freda or her research\n      staff, will complete a questionnaire about symptoms of acromegaly.  You will also have two\n      teaspoons of blood drawn for measurement of the hormones listed above.  At the 3 month and\n      12 month visits subjects will also have blood drawn for measurement of growth hormone and\n      other hormones  at 60, 90 and 120 minutes after they drink an 8 ounce glass of sugar\n      solution (OGTT).\n\n      About 6 teaspoons of blood will be drawn at these visits.\n\n      Subjects will then invited to come at yearly visits for the same procedures as listed above\n      including the questionnaires, examination and blood testing including a OGTT.  At your\n      discretion or at the discretion of the research team the interval may be lengthened to every\n      2 to 3 years at some time in the future.
