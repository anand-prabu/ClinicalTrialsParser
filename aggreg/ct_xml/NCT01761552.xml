  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate that the use of Sugammadex enables physicians to perform early extubation in
      the operating room in ASA 4 &amp; 4E patients

      Primary endpoint:

      • Extubation in the operating room before transfer to the PACU or ICU versus keeping the
      patient intubated when transferred.

      Secondary endpoints:

      • Time to extubation - measure the difference in time from application of the surgical
      dressing until extubation. Atelectasis - comparison of chest x-rays (CXR): prior to surgery,
      on admission to PACU or ICU and 24 hours after admission to PACU or ICU (This is the routine
      practice at Hadassa hospital for ASA IV patients.)
