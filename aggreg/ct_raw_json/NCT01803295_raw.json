            "textblock": "In the proposed study the investigators aim to evaluate the effect of the standard of care\n      dose (40mg) of MMC mixed with TC-3 gel (with sustained release mechanism on the drug) on low\n      risk recurrent NMIBC lesions and to compare our findings to instillation with the standard\n      mode of instillation- 40mg MMC in water in order to examine our hypothesis that MMC mixed\n      with TC-3 gel will have at least non-inferior and even superior results over the standard\n      instillation mode\n\n      The investigators believe that this study is of importance of several aspects:\n\n        1. It evaluates a new mode of bladder instillation that may bypass the drawbacks of the\n           current instillation mode.\n\n        2. If proved effective this mode of treatment might save the need of TURBT performance and\n           serve as a new mode of tumor ablation.\n\n        3. Even if proved partially effective this mode of treatment will diminish tumors size or\n           number thus enable a more limited TURBT procedure.\n\n        4. This mode of treatment will enable immediate medical attendance to the patient's tumor\n           recurrence without the waiting period (resulting from queues in the medical centers)\n           for TURBT, which might improve the patient's prognostic outcome.\n\n        5. If this experimental treatment will prove to have a better ablative effect, this could\n           be translated to a better prophylactic effect of tumor recurrence."

This treatment approach is limited due\n      to rapid dilution the chemotheraputic drug by the incoming urine and clearance by urination.\n\n      TheraCoat core technology is based on a reverse thermal biodegradable gel (TC-3) (low\n      viscosity at 5\u00b0C gel appearance at body temperature)for drug retention in the urinary\n      bladder.\n\n      Prior to instillation, the TC-3 hydrogel, in a liquid state, is mixed with MMC.TC-3 mixed\n      with MMC is instilled to the bladder by a catheter. Following gel insertion to the bladder,\n      the gel solidifies and forms a drug reservoir inside the bladder. Upon contact with urine\n      the gel dissolves and is cleared out from the bladder.\n\n      Intravesical MMC instillation using TheraCoat gel is expected to increase treatment\n      efficiency due to prolongation of treatment duration and consequently improving bladder\n      exposure to MMC.\n\n      Treatment Protocol - Immediately following baseline cystoscopy and tumor diagnosis and\n      patient undergoes 6 weekly instillations followed by 2-4 weeks healing period.\n\n      1st Follow-Up Visit (Pre-Scheduled TURBT Visit): The patient will undergo a second\n      Cystoscopy to compare to the Baseline status and after that a follow-up period: 3,6,9,12\n      months."
