            "textblock": "Background: Preeclampsia is a leading cause of maternal/fetal morbidity/mortality. Pregnant\n      women are often poorly informed on preeclampsia and seeking care too late results in\n      maternal/fetal complications. Many healthcare providers believe that delivering information\n      for low-risk women only make them more anxious.\n\n      Preliminary data: We published that an information pamphlet on preeclampsia increases\n      knowledge, without increasing anxiety, and generates high satisfaction in women hospitalized\n      for preeclampsia.\n\n      Objectives:  Demonstrate that (1) ambulatory low-risk pregnant women will benefit from the\n      pamphlet/video with improved knowledge; (2) without any increase in anxiety, and with great\n      satisfaction.\n\n      Design: Prospective randomized controlled pilot study. Inclusion criteria: consecutive\n      pregnant women aged \u226518 y.o. between 200-326 weeks presenting at the clinic and who\n      read/write French or English. Exclusion criteria: Anticipated delivery or termination within\n      one month. Intervention: pamphlet, magnet and video. Control: no educational tool. At\n      baseline, women in both groups will answer questionnaire #1 on demographics; one month\n      later: self-administered questionnaire #2 on knowledge, anxiety, satisfaction.\n\n      Sample size: N=178 will provide 80% power to find a significant improvement of at least 20%\n      in knowledge score and 96% power to find a difference of at least 1 on scale for anxiety\n      (alpha of 5%). Assuming a drop-out rate of 10%, missing answers <20%, and rate of answered\n      questionnaire #2 of 50%, 400 subjects will be recruited.\n\n      Anticipated results: The tools will improve knowledge by about 20% in intervention group\n      compared to control group. They will not increase anxiety over one point and will be highly\n      appreciated by women."
