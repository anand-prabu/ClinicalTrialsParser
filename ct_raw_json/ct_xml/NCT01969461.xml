  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use among persons with HIV exacerbates health problems and accelerates HIV disease
      progression. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the single most important treatment for people
      living with HIV. However, ART adherence is suboptimal among adolescents and young adults
      living with HIV, the age group with the fastest growing rates of HIV infection, and great
      risk of engaging in risky behaviors such as alcohol use. The proposed study will compare the
      effectiveness of home-based versus clinic-based &quot;Healthy Choices&quot;, a brief, 4- session
      intervention using Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) to address alcohol use, medication
      adherence, and health outcomes in youth living with HIV (YLH) using a repeated measures
      design. Unlike previous trials, Healthy Choices will be tested in a &quot;real world&quot; clinical
      setting and be delivered by community health workers (CHW: already members of the HIV care
      team). The study population will consist of YLH, ages 16-24, who are current patients at 5
      ATN sites. Site staff will recruit potential participants. Youth will be randomized to
      receive Healthy Choices, either clinic-based or home-based delivered by the same CHW in both
      conditions. Outcomes are measured at baseline, 4-, 7-, and 13-months. Data collection for
      biological measures will be through medical record extraction, and self-reported measures
      will occur using a brief Web-based CASI (computer-administered self-interviewing) survey on
      an iPad. All intervention sessions will be audio-recorded for MITI fidelity coding, and
      investigators will support local supervisors during the active intervention phase. We will
      conduct qualitative interviews with CHWs, supervisors and organization leaders at the end of
      the trial to obtain information about barriers and facilitators of implementation. Thus, the
      proposed trial will allow us to use a Type 1 Effectiveness-implementation hybrid design to
      pilot a sustainable model of MI implementation in real-world youth care settings towards the
      goals of 1) examining the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and scalability of an
      efficacious behavioral intervention when delivered by CHWs in real-world adolescent HIV care
      settings; 2) gathering information about who responds under what contexts; and 3) increasing
      our understanding of the barriers and facilitators for future implementation. The primary
      hypothesis is that YLH receiving home-based MET will have greater improvements in alcohol
      use and viral load than YLH receiving clinic-based MET.

    <description>The 4-session MET intervention will address alcohol use and HIV medication (ART) adherence. Sessions will be delivered in the clinic or the home by a CHW (outreach worker, etc) already providing services in the clinic. In sessions 1 and 2 (each behavior will get its own session), CHW will elicit the client's view of the problem using MI techniques, building motivation for change by eliciting and reinforcing change talk. The CHW will deliver feedback and discuss the consideration of a behavior change plan option, and the client sets the change plan goal and consolidates commitment. In the last two sessions, the CHW will review the change plan, continue to elicit and reinforce change talk, problem-solve barriers, consolidate commitment, and consider strategies to maintain behavior change.</description>
