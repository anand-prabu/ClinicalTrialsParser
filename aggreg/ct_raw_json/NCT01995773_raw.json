PCOS is associated with obesity, changes in glucose metabolism and low\n      quality of life.\n\n      In the present study, hormonal profile, glucose metabolism, adrenal functon, androgen\n      levels, cortisol metabolism, anflammatory response, ovarian morphology, body composition,\n      pfysical activity and quality of life is studied in 40 healthy women. The results will be\n      compared with results from studies on women with PCOS in order to investigate any\n      differences in these parametres."
