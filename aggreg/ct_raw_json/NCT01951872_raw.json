The aim of Study 1 is\n      to recruit and identify individuals who are interested in receiving treatment to reduce or\n      quit caffeine consumption. Individuals will be recruited from Baltimore, MD and surrounding\n      communities via flyers and newspaper and radio advertisements. Those who are eligible will\n      be invited to come to the Behavioral Pharmacology Research Unit located on the Johns Hopkins\n      Bayview Medical Center campus in Baltimore, MD. After consent is obtained at intake (consent\n      form A), a series of questionnaires will be completed (e.g., demographics, caffeine history,\n      medical and psychiatric history, mood), followed by a structured clinical interview that\n      will assess caffeine use and dependence. Individuals who meet eligibility criteria will be\n      offered the opportunity to receive assistance to reduce or quit caffeine. Those who consent\n      (consent form B) to enroll in the second phase of the project will be randomly assigned to\n      one of two conditions: 1) immediate treatment or 2) delayed treatment. The conditions will\n      be identical with the exception of a 6 week delay for the delayed treatment group.\n      Participants will receive a caffeine reduction and cessation treatment manual during a brief\n      treatment session at week 1. Treatment progress will be assessed during a study session\n      approximately 7 weeks post-treatment, during a telephone interview approximately 8 weeks\n      post-treatment, and during a follow-up telephone call approximately 27 weeks after the\n      treatment session. Progress will be assessed via questionnaires, food diaries, and salivary\n      caffeine measures."
