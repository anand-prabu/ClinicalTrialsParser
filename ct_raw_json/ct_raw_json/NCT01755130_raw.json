The subject of this project is to successfully obtain diagnostic imaging of breast tumors with new imaging technology, laser Optoacoustic Tomography system.\nPart 2 Year 5:  Goal of part 2 to estimate and compare the false positive rate of LOUIS-3D compared to standard of care ultrasound.  Patients will have had a positive standard of care ultrasound requiring a biopsy (gold standard).  The LOUIS-3D images will be obtained within 7 days of the standard of care ultrasound."

            "textblock": "If you agree to take part in this study, you will have the LOUIS-3D imaging procedure either\n      on the same day or within 10 days of a regular scheduled visit for a mammogram, ultrasound,\n      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, or any other breast imaging procedure, between 1 and\n      7 days before your scheduled biopsy. The results of the LOUIS-3D imaging scans will be\n      compared with the results of your other imaging scan(s).\n\n      For the LOUIS-3D procedure, you will lay down on a specially-designed breast exam table and\n      you will place your breast in a bowl-like imaging cup. The imaging cup will be filled with a\n      gel that will help send signals to the imaging machine.\n\n      The procedure will produce 2 types of images. For the first type, the imaging cup will\n      deliver light from a laser that will travel into your breast and tumor. The light is\n      designed to detect acoustic waves which produce an image. Even though all light will be\n      contained in the imaging cup, you will wear laser safety goggles during the procedure.\n\n      For the second type of image, the imaging cup will deliver an ultrasound to your breast\n      which will produce an ultrasound image.\n\n      During the scans, the imaging cup will rotate around the breast to create      3-dimensional\n      pictures. The scans may be repeated several times. The entire LOUIS-3D procedure should take\n      about 30 minutes to complete.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You will be off study after the LOUIS-3D imaging procedure is complete.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  The LOUIS-3D device is not FDA approved or commercially\n      available. The use of the LOUIS-3D device to detect and monitor changes in breast tumors is\n      investigational.\n\n      Up to 96 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."
