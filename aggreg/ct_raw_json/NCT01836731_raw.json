The Ministry of\n      Health in Rwanda has committed to rolling out a program designed along similar lines, the\n      Community Based Environmental Health Promotion Program (CBEHPP), in all 15000 villages\n      across Rwanda. The main objective of the program is to achieve 'zero open defecation' in all\n      villages of Rwanda, at least 80% hygienic latrine coverage and improvements in a range of\n      health behaviors such as the use of mosquito nets, hand-washing with soap and the use of\n      household water treatment.\n\n      To evaluate the impact of the program on health, other socio-economic outcomes and community\n      functioning, a single district has been chosen where 150 communities will be randomized to\n      receive the intervention immediately or 18 months later. The evaluation is led by US based\n      Innovation for Poverty Action (IPA) through researchers based at the National University of\n      Rwanda, Georgetown University, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and New York\n      University.  The research team will work in close collaboration with the implementing team,\n      which consists of the Ministry of Health, Rwanda and Africa AHEAD.\n\n      The study will span three years, beginning in May 2013, and ending in late 2015."

            "textblock": "Preventable diseases such as respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases and malaria account\n      for a large share of mortality in low income economies. For example, diarrheal  diseases\n      kill nearly 2.5 million people worldwide and account for a considerable share of under five\n      mortality in low income countries.  Broad-based economic development that includes\n      improvements in infrastructure and service delivery can address the challenges associated\n      with the infectious disease burden. But for many countries, these improvements are far in\n      the future and/or very costly. Behavior change of individuals can also address these\n      challenges and more importantly can be done now and relatively cheaply. Understanding how to\n      produce this behavior change in needy contexts is crucial to the short and medium term\n      response to the high costs imposed by these diseases. This protocol outlines an evaluation\n      of an intervention aimed at producing sustainable behavior change around health, hygiene and\n      sanitation. The evaluation consists of two parts: firstly to evaluate the health and\n      socio-economic effects of a well-designed and supported community health club intervention.\n      Secondly to examine whether the intervention can deliver health and other benefits utilizing\n      the resource base available in this context. The answer to this latter question informs the\n      scalability of the intervention. The overall objective of the study is to evaluate whether\n      and how community hygiene/health clubs are an effective and sustainable response to\n      addressing broad health, sanitation and hygiene needs in low-income countries.\n\n      A particular challenge associated with health interventions, is the extent to which\n      free-rider problems mediate the adoption of improved behaviors. The community health club\n      approach with regular meetings, is well placed to address these collective action\n      challenges. Community health clubs provide a vehicle to inform and incentivize households to\n      change their behavior in relation to a range of health outcomes. The information component\n      arises from the six month long weekly courses covering a wide range of health, hygiene and\n      sanitary subjects and facilitated by a community health worker. The incentives for\n      sustainable behavior change follow from the social sanctions and rewards that club members\n      can impose/bestow on members accordingly. As with other behavior change programs that have\n      incorporated information components that emphasize the benefits of better health behavior,\n      the evidence base for what works in this domain remains thin. The community health club\n      approach is appealing largely because it mobilizes local resources and is plausibly cheaper\n      and more sustainable than other top-down interventions.\n\n      To evaluate the impact of the program on health, other socio-economic conditions and\n      community functioning, a single district has been chosen where communities will be randomly\n      assigned to receive the intervention immediately or 18 months later. The evaluation is led\n      by US-based Innovation for Poverty Action (IPA) through researchers based at the National\n      University of Rwanda, Georgetown University, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine\n      and New York University.  The research team will work in close collaboration with the\n      implementing team, which consists of the Ministry of Health, Rwanda and Africa AHEAD.\n\n      The evaluation will measure impact heterogeneity with respect to key inputs that predict\n      success of CHCs, including training and competence of CHWs, the quality of training\n      materials, and community functioning.  The evaluation will also document in detail the cost\n      structure of the low- and high-resource versions of CHCs in order to inform the MOH about\n      the most effective strategies for successful scale up of CHCs nationwide.  More broadly,\n      other governments, donor organizations and foundations will benefit from rigorous evidence\n      on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using health clubs to address health and\n      sanitation challenges."
