  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether is is feasible and acceptable to deliver a
      telephone based coaching intervention compared with education alone in community dwelling
      older adults (age 60 and older) after a fall related hip fracture.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial design to inform the development of
      a larger scale study to test effectiveness of a clinician supported telephonic self
      management intervention for older adults after hip fracture. The primary aim is to determine
      feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, and the secondary aim is to measure
      statistical trends on quality of life at 4 months after fracture in community dwelling older
      adults. In parallel, we will conduct a process evaluation to ascertain key features of the
      intervention via qualitative interviews of participants and health care professionals
      involved in delivery of the intervention.
