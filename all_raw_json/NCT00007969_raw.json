Determine the clinical response in\n      patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine whether this regimen induces systemic\n      cellular and humoral immune responses to melanoma antigens in these patients. IV. Determine\n      the ablation of cutaneous tumors in patients treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo photodynamic therapy with verteporfin\n      and Detox-B adjuvant. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for a total of 3 courses, each to a\n      different melanoma lesion. Both non-treated and treated tumors are measured prior to study\n      and at months 2, 4, and 6. Immune profile is also assessed prior to study and at months 2,\n      4, and 6.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months."
