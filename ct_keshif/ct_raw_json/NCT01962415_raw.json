            "textblock": "Umbilical cord blood transplant (UCBT) has been shown to be an effective treatment for a\n      wide variety of non-malignant disorders (NMD) as well as malignant disorders also known as\n      cancer. Before a patient can receive a UCBT, doctors need to reduce the chance that the\n      patient's body will reject the cord blood cells. This is usually done by using chemotherapy\n      or radiation therapy given to eradicate the patient's immune cells, which originate from\n      stem cells in the bone marrow. If the therapy is is administered at or near at it's maximum\n      tolerated dose, it is called myeloablative conditioning (MAC), referring to the fact that\n      most MAC regimens ablate irreversibly most if not all stem cells residing in the bone\n      marrow. While ultra high doses of chemotherapy is very effective for treating leukemia where\n      there are cancerous stem cells, for those without cancer or leukemia this high/maximum\n      intensity is not essential and poses lots of dangerous toxic side effects.\n\n      In this research study, instead of using the standard myeloablative conditioning, the study\n      doctor is using reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC), in which lower doses of chemotherapy\n      will be used.  Although the lower doses may not eradicate every single stem cell in the bone\n      marrow, nevertheless in the presented combination it still intends to eliminate already\n      formed immune cells, paving the way to successful engraftment of donor cord blood cells.\n      Engrafting cord blood cells can outcompete and reject the patients' few surviving stem\n      cells. With reduced-intensity conditioning, the side effects on brain, heart, lung, liver,\n      and other organ functions are usually less severe, and the patients can have a better\n      long-term recovery. There is also realistic hope that after lower doses of chemotherapy many\n      patients will avoid becoming sterile.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to collect data from the patients undergoing reduced-intensity\n      conditioning before UCBT, so that the study doctor can compare it to the standard\n      myeloablative conditioning with the expectation that there will be full therapeutic benefits\n      paired with better survival rate and improved quality of life following the reduced\n      intensity approach compared to myeloablative regimen.\n\n      Patients age 2 months to 30 years old who have a non-malignant disease that can be treated\n      with an umbilical cord blood transplant will be considered for this study. A full list of\n      eligibility criteria appears later in this record."

            "textblock": "Umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplant following myeloablative conditioning (MAC) has been\n      demonstrated to be safe and curative for a variety of malignant and non-malignant diseases\n      (NMD), with unrelated UCB offering an alternative donor source for those patients without a\n      related or unrelated bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell source.  MAC carries a\n      significant risk for transplant-related mortality (TRM), ranging from 20-30% in the first\n      year following UCBT, and for long-term morbidity and mortality from effects on growth and\n      fertility as well as risk for secondary malignancy.  RIC regimens with well below the\n      maximum tolerated doses ( MTD) of chemotherapy  offer the potential for decreased morbidity\n      and TRM which is attractive for patients with NMD.  Despite lower overall doses of\n      chemotherapy we have demonstrated that cord blood cell engraftment can remain  stable at\n      very high ( typically >95%) levels for long-term and leading to full therapeutic benefits.\n      In addition, RIC regimens may offer improved neurocognitive outcomes when compared to\n      historical MAC regimens since it is based on less neurotoxic chemotherapy and possibly lower\n      doses of steroids if there is lesser incidence and severity of GVHD that in combination\n      could also lead to improved immune reconstitution following UCBT.\n\n      Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens rely on relatively high doses of\n      immunosuppressive therapy, such as fludarabine (Flu) in combination with T-cell depleting\n      antibodies (e.g. anti-thymocyte globulin [ATG] or alemtuzumab), in the setting of decreased\n      myelosuppressive therapy, including lower dose alkylating agents (e.g. busulfan [Bu],\n      cyclophosphamide [Cy], melphalan [Mel], thiotepa (TT).\n\n      In this protocol, we will combine RIC with UCBT in eligible subjects, and collect data as\n      described in the endpoints section.\n\n      The subjects will be stratified according to type of primary disease and degree of immune\n      competence each of the three strata will use a different amount of alemtuzumab prior to\n      transplant.\n\n      Male and female subjects aged 2 months to 30 years (inclusive) who meet all of the\n      eligibility criteria will be considered for this study. Non-malignant disease populations\n      amenable to stem cell treatment, listed in the eligibility section, will be considered\n      appropriate for this study."
