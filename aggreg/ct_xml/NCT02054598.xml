  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-site randomized, controlled trial testing the effect of a combined
      intervention that includes a colorectal cancer (CRC) screening decision aid plus patient
      navigation in a diverse, primary care patient population in clinical sites in North Carolina
      and New Mexico.

      Our primary aim is to determine the effect of the intervention on CRC screening completion
      six months after the index visit among all enrolled participants and among Latinos.
      Secondarily, we will determine how this intervention affects screening-related knowledge,
      self-efficacy, intent, and clinical communication, and examine whether these factors mediate
      the effect of the intervention on screening test completion. Lastly, we will explore whether
      insurance status, ethnicity, and patient language preference moderate the effect of the
      intervention on screening.

    <description>A blinded medical record review will be used to determine the primary outcome of 6 month Colorectal cancer screening status. To ensure optimal capturing of screening test completion, we will ask participants whose medical record does not contain evidence of screening to verify non-completion during the 6 month phone survey.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients 50 to 75 years old  who are not current with colorectal cancer (CRC)
             screening, defined as not having completed a home fecal occult blood test (FOBT)
             within the past year; a flexible sigmoidoscopy within the past five years; or a
             colonoscopy within the past ten years.

          -  Have an appointment at one of the clinic sites

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Will include: inability to speak either English or Spanish, severe illness at the
             time of the clinic visit, co-morbidity that is estimated to limit life-expectancy to
             less than 5 years as estimated by the treating nurse or provider, severe cognitive,
             visual, or hearing impairment that would preclude Decision Aid (DA) viewing. We will
             also exclude patients who are at elevated risk for CRC, defined as having ever been
             diagnosed with CRC, a precancerous (adenomatous) polyp, or inflammatory bowel
             disease.
