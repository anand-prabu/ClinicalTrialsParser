  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of three different glycemic
      treatment conditions (tight, conventional, and standard) in the intraoperative period on: 1)
      postoperative surgical site infections, and 2) postoperative procalcitonin, and C-reactive
      protein levels in patients undergoing open-heart surgery. Secondary aims of the study were
      to investigate the effects of the three glycemic treatment conditions on: 1) intraoperative
      blood glucose; 2) intraoperative glycemic stability; and 3) intensive care unit length of
      stay, in patients undergoing open-heart surgery.

      An experimental design with a multilevel, single factor, within-subjects design was
      utilized. Patients were nested within anesthesia provider teams. The design was
      counterbalanced by means of a Latin square, where each of three anesthesia provider teams
      dispensed each of three glycemic treatment conditions once.

    <time_frame>six weeks postoperatively</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The presence or absence of deep, or/and superficial sternal wound infection and deep, superficial harvest site infection within in six weeks postoperatively was a primary outcome variable. Infection assessment was performed during the intensive care phase, at hospital discharge, two-week post hospital discharge and six-week post hospital discharge by independent blinded researchers that were part of the cardiothoracic team.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein concentrations were collected in addition to clinical signs for indications of infection. These biomarker concentrations were collected the morning of surgery, after successful separation from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and every morning for five days postoperatively. Values were drawn by anesthesia providers and intensive care unit (ICU) registered nurses or laboratory personnel with the standard morning blood work, and trended over the six-day period.</description>

    <time_frame>Intraoperative</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Blood glucose values were obtained every 30 minutes in the intraoperative period, and were drawn and recorded by the certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) performing the anesthetic.</description>

    <time_frame>Number of ICU days, on average 5- 7 days</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Length of intensive care unit stay was measured by the total number of days each patient stayed in the intensive care unit. On average this was 5-7 days.</description>

    <time_frame>Intraoperative</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Intraoperative glycemic stability was operationalize as how often blood glucose levels were maintained as normal or maintained in the preset target ranges for each group. If intraoperative blood glucose levels fell outside of normal or, the preset target ranges, for each protocol, 3 consecutive blood glucoses (1.5 hours) despite insulin therapy a marker of inadequate glycemic control was recorded.</description>

    <description>The tight glycemic group received a continuous intravenous infusion of regular insulin in the intraoperative period titrated per a modified Portland Protocol from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Tennessee. The initial bolus of insulin and insulin infusion was initiated prior to induction of anesthesia if the morning blood glucose was greater than 149 mg/dl or any time intraoperatively the blood glucose elevated above 149 mg/dl.The titration of insulin for the tight glycemic group maintained blood glucose levels between 110-149 mg/dl throughout the intraoperative period. The intraoperative blood glucose was titrated to blood glucose levels sampled every 30 minutes.Upon transfer to the intensive care unit the protocol ended and all subjects received the same glycemic control.</description>

    <description>The conventional glycemic group received a continuous intravenous infusion of regular insulin in the intraoperative period titrated per a modified Portland Protocol from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Tennessee. The initial insulin bolus and infusion was initiated prior to induction of anesthesia if the morning blood glucose was greater than 180 mg/dl or any time intraoperatively that the blood glucose elevated above 180 mg/dl. The insulin infusion was titrated throughout the intraoperative period to maintain blood glucose levels between 150-180 mg/dl.The intraoperative blood glucose was titrated to blood glucose levels sampled every 30 minutes. Upon transfer to the ICU the intraoperative protocol ended and all subjects received the standardized glycemic control for the ICU.</description>

    <description>The standard glycemic group received intravenous injections of regular insulin in the intraoperative period titrated per the usual care protocol utilized at the study site. The initial bolus of insulin was initiated prior to induction of anesthesia if the morning blood glucose is greater than 180 mg/dl or any time intraoperatively that the blood glucose rises above 180 mg/dl. The intraoperative blood glucose was titrated to blood glucose levels sampled every 30 minutes.Upon transfer to the ICU the intraoperative protocol ended and all subjects received the standardized glycemic control for the ICU.</description>
