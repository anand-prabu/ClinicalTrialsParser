This study also evaluates the correct dosages of\n      ABC to be used in future studies.\n\n      Early aggressive therapy may be the best chance to slow disease progression in infants who\n      may have been infected with HIV by their mothers. Early HIV suppression may significantly\n      reduce viral levels and allow for restoration of the immune system, providing improved\n      control over HIV infection. Therefore, it is important that the safety and tolerance of ABC\n      in combination with ZDV be examined as potential early therapy in newborn and young infants."

The rationale for early\n      aggressive therapy is that this may be the best chance to significantly reduce the long-term\n      progression and subsequent impact of HIV-1 infection in vertically infected infants. Early\n      ablation or enhanced suppression of HIV-1 replication may significantly reduce total viral\n      load and may allow maturation, preservation, or reconstruction of immune function at a stage\n      early in infection providing improved control of HIV-1 infection and reduced disease\n      progression.\n\n      This study is divided into 3 sections, as follows: Part 1A is a single-dose study in\n      neonates 0 to 72 hours of age. If four of four patients reach the minimal therapeutic level\n      with less than Grade 3 toxicity, the ABC dose is escalated. Part 1B is also a single-dose\n      study in infants 21 to 28 days of age, starting with the dose identified in Part 1A. If four\n      of four patients reach the minimal therapeutic level with less than Grade 3 toxicity, the\n      dose is escalated again. Finally, Part 2 is a multi-dose study to examine a dosing regimen\n      for ABC and ZDV for neonates 0 to 72 hours of age. The dosing regimen for ABC is the dose\n      defined in Part 1A for the first 3 weeks (0 to 3 weeks of age) followed by the dose defined\n      in Part 1B for the second 3 weeks (3 to 6 weeks of age). All patients receive 6 weeks of\n      standard ZDV therapy.\n\n      [AS PER AMENDMENT 9/24/97: This study is divided into sections, as follows: Part 1A is a\n      single-dose study in neonates 0 to 48 hours of age. ABC dose escalations are made until a\n      dose is identified that meets toxicity guidelines and demonstrates a minimal target area\n      under the concentration curve (AUC) of 2,000 ng-hr/ml. Part 1B is a similar single-dose\n      study in infants 3 to 7 days of age with escalation as per part 1A. Part 1C is an identical\n      single-dose study in infants 21 to 28 days of age but starting at the dose identified in\n      Part 1B. Part 2 is a multi-dose study to examine a 6-week dosing regimen for ABC and ZDV for\n      infants 0 to 48 hours of age. The dosing regimen for ABC is defined in Part 1A for the first\n      48 hours of life, the dose defined in Part 1B for Days 3 through 20 of life, and the dose\n      defined in Part 1C for Days 21 through 42 of life.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/29/98: Enrollment to\n      Parts 1A and 1B will remain open; Part 1A will enroll a minimum of 4 patients as planned,\n      and Part 1B will enroll 3 additional patients.]"
