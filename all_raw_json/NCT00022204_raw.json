Compare the normal\n      tissue injury and quality of life in patients treated with this regimen vs placebo.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are\n      randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral vitamin E and oral\n      pentoxifylline twice daily for 6 months. Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily\n      for 6 months. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.\n      Patients are followed at 6 and 12 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
