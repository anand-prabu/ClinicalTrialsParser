      The aim of this study is to examine the effects of concentrated pomegranate juice on serum
      lipid profile and some inflammatory factors in patients with type 2 diabetes. Forty patients
      aged between 25-60 years old from both sexes are recruited. Patients consume 50gr/day
      concentrated pomegranate juice for 4 weeks. Anthropometric and blood pressure measurements,
      3-days food-record questionnaire ,physical activity and fasting blood samples were collected
      at the beginning and at the end of the study. Fasting blood sugar, lipid profile, TNF- a,
      IL-6,hs -CRP and adiponectin levels are measured. LDL are calculated by formula. The
      participants are asked not to change their regular diet, medicine and activity during the
      study.
