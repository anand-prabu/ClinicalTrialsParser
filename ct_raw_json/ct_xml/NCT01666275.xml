  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolomics is the study of metabolic pathways and the unique biochemical molecules which
      result from the regulatory response to physiological stressors, disease processes, or drug
      therapy. By measuring changes in metabolite concentrations, the range of biochemical effects
      and therapeutic intervention can be determined.

      Aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a chronic inflammatory disease
      characterized by chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal polyposis, asthma, and airway reactivity to
      aspirin and/or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This reaction to aspirin
      during challenge/desensitization is equivalent to an allergic drug reaction however we are
      able to evaluate these specific reactions in a controlled, clinical environment. This
      population of patients undergoing aspirin desensitization is ideal for studying metabolomics
      as serial blood sampling can be performed in patients before, during a reaction, and after
      aspirin desensitization, thereby allowing each patient to serve as his or her own biological
      control. The investigator hopes that this study of metabolomics will allow for better
      methods of identifying anaphylaxis in the future.
