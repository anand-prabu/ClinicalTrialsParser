The primary outcome of\n      this Phase 2 study will be musculoskeletal and hepatic toxicity, defined by clinical and\n      laboratory criteria, with a 3-month follow-up period (\u00b1 1 week). Secondary outcomes will\n      include neurological outcome (National Institute of Health (NIH) Stroke Scale), functional\n      outcomes (Barthel Index), and handicap (modified Rankin scores). Effects on inflammatory\n      markers and lipid levels will also be assessed."

Satisfies the criteria for ischemic stroke: acute focal neurological deficit of\n             likely ischemic vascular origin.\n\n          3. Patient or legally authorized representative has provided written informed consent\n             prior to study entry. Patient who regains capacity provides his/her written consent\n             to remain in the study.\n\n          4. Patient can receive the first treatment dose within 0-24 hours of stroke onset.  For\n             patients found with stroke on awakening, it will be assumed that the stroke occurred\n             the last time that the patient was known to be normal.\n\n          5. Patient has pretreatment brain CT scan compatible with ischemic stroke and excludes\n             hemorrhagic and non-vascular etiologies of symptoms.\n\n          6. Patients taking statins at time of stroke may be included.\n\n          7. Patients receiving standard dose intravenous tPA or mechanical interventional\n             procedures may be enrolled.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Brain imaging study shows a lesion other than ischemic stroke that could explain\n             patient's symptoms (intracranial or subarachnoid hemorrhage, arteriovenous\n             malformation, aneurysm, multiple sclerosis, tumor, abscess or other). Asymptomatic\n             meningiomas are allowed.\n\n          2. Mild stroke, defined as NIH Stroke Scale <2.\n\n          3. Weight < 50 kg.\n\n          4.

History of intolerance or allergic reaction to any statins (myotoxicity, hepatic\n             dysfunction, rash, etc.)\n\n          6. Use of drugs within past 30 days that utilize the cytochrome CYP3A pathway\n             (cyclosporine, itraconazole, ketoconazole, erythromycin, azithromycin,\n             clarithromycin, nefazodone).\n\n          7. Use of drugs within past 30 days that increase risk of myotoxicity with statins\n             (gemfibrozil, other fibrates, niacin, amiodarone, verapamil).\n\n          8. Baseline major electrolyte disturbances (sodium <125 or >150, potassium <3.0 or\n             >5.5).\n\n          9. Recent major trauma (<3 months).\n\n         10. Hypothermia (body temperature < 96F).\n\n         11. Baseline hypoxia (defined as oxygen saturation <92% on room air).\n\n         12. History of likely or proven systemic viral infection within 30 days.\n\n         13. Known HIV infection or use of protease inhibitors.\n\n         14. Endocarditis likely as cause of stroke.\n\n         15. Mitochondrial disorder likely as cause of stroke.\n\n         16. Pregnancy or lactation.\n\n         17. History of rhabdomyolysis, myopathy, or other severe muscle disease.\n\n         18.

Unstable cardiovascular (includes uncontrolled hypertension), pulmonary,\n             gastrointestinal, hepatic or musculoskeletal disease.\n\n         21. Patient has evidence of severe congestive heart failure or has history of end-stage\n             cardiovascular disease (e.g. CHF NYHA Class III or IV or unstable angina).\n\n         22. Abnormal ECG showing: Hemodynamically significant arrhythmia or frequent PVCs\n             (>5/minute) (controlled atrial arrhythmia will not be an exclusion); evidence of\n             acute myocardial infarction; Mobitz Type II 2nd degree AV block or 3rd degree AV\n             block; ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.\n\n         23.

Severe behavioral or social problems that may interfere with the conduct of clinical\n             study procedures.\n\n         28. Patient unlikely, in the investigator's opinion, to complete the study and return for\n             follow-up visits for any reason."
