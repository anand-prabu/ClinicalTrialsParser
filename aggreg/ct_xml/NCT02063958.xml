      Study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SNX-5422 when given in
      combination with everolimus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) plays a central role in the maturation and maintenance of
      numerous proteins, for example HER2 and mutated EGFR, that are critical for tumor cell
      viability and growth; SNX-5422 is a pro-drug of SNX-2112, a potent, highly selective,
      small-molecule inhibitor of the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Hsp90 has
      been found to be expressed in 95% of subjects with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

      This study will determine the MTD of SNX-5422 when given in combination with everolimus in
      patients with neuroendocrine tumors.The clinical starting dose of 50 mg/m2 qod for SNX-5422
      in combination with daily everolimus is 50% of the SNX-5422 qod mono-therapy MTD. The choice
      to continue once every other day SNX-5422 dosing is based on the safety and efficacy
      profiles from prior studies, so that drug holidays are interspersed into weekly dosing. The
      planned subsequent dose levels are 75% and 100% of the SNX-5422 qod mono-therapy MTD.

    <description>Measurements from tumor imaging within 1 month prior to the screening visit will be used as the baseline assessment. This assessment will be performed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1). Follow-up imaging of known sites of the disease, preferably by CT scan, will be performed at intervals appropriate to the subject's disease and clinical findings.</description>

    <description>Open-label administration of SNX-5422 capsules dosed in the morning once every other day (qod) for 21 days (11 doses), followed by a 7 day drug free period. Dose escalation will be based on safety defined as 1 or less dose limiting toxicities during the first 28 day cycle at any dose level. Dose escalation will not exceed a dose of 100 mg/m2 SNX-5422 qod even if the MTD has not been identified. Subjects will receive daily oral everolimus in the PM about the same time every day for 28 days.</description>
