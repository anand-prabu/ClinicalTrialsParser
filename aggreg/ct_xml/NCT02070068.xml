  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Operations on the liver, bile ducts, and gallbladders are some of the most commonly
      performed abdominal operations in the United States. Cholecystectomy, removal of the
      gallbladder, is the most common of these with more than 750,000 performed annually. Injury
      to the common bile duct (CBD) during these procedures occur infrequently (approximately 0.1%
      to 0.5%), but it is an important source of patient morbidity. Serious injuries often require
      at least one surgical repair, and these repairs have variable long-term outcomes. Techniques
      to allow the visualization of the bile ducts may prevent such an injury, by providing vital
      information about the presence of gallstones in the CBD and show a surgical road map of the
      ducts. Near-infrared (NIR) cholangiography has the advantage over standard cholangiography
      of not exposing patients and healthcare providers to radiation. This technique also allows
      the superimposition of the cholangiogram onto the normal image.

      This study is being conducted to optimize an imaging technique called PINPOINT. Images will
      be obtained during clinically necessary operations. The images will be evaluated to
      determine the best method for locating and outlining the anatomy. The information learned
      will guide the future use of PINPOINT in laparoscopic procedures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be eligible for the study, subjects must fulfill all of the following criteria:

          1. Subjects who are healthy men or women 18 years of age or older.

          2. Subjects who are scheduled for laparoscopic biliary or hepatic operations.

          3. Subjects who sign an approved informed consent form for the study.

          4. Subjects who are willing to comply with the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:

          1. Subjects with a known allergy or history of adverse reaction to ICG, iodine or iodine
             dyes.

          2. Subjects who, in the Investigator's opinion, have any medical condition that makes
             the subject a poor candidate for the investigational procedure, or interferes with
             the interpretation of study results.

          3. Subjects who are pregnant or lactating females.

          4. Subjects, who are actively participating in another investigational clinical study
             and who, in the Investigator's or Sponsor's opinion, should not be enrolled in this
             study.
