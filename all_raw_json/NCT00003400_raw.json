Combining more than one drug with peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of high dose chemotherapy plus peripheral\n      stem cell transplantation followed by combination chemotherapy in treating patients with\n      metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy."

Evaluate the complete and partial remission rates and event free and overall\n      survival of patients with metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer treated with high\n      dose chemotherapy plus peripheral stem cell transplantation followed by consolidation\n      chemotherapy. II. Evaluate the toxic effects associated with this treatment in these\n      patients. III. Evaluate the quality of life, and need for analgesics, in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by stage of disease and extent of metastatic disease.\n      Patients receive daily filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously for 4 days until peripheral blood\n      stem cells are collected. Patients then receive carmustine IV over 2 hours on day -2 and\n      melphalan IV over 20 minutes on day -1. Stem cell infusion will be on day 0. At 3, 6, 9, and\n      12 months after transplant, patients receive vinorelbine IV over 10 minutes and cisplatin IV\n      over 24 hours. Quality of life and pain are assessed before the transplantation, just before\n      discharge after transplantation, prior to each consolidation course, and then at 3, 6, and\n      12 months after the final course of chemotherapy. Patients are followed at least every 3\n      months for the first 2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
