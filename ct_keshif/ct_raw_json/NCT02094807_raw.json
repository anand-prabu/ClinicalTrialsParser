In total 60 patients will be randomized to\n      either surgical or conservative management of rib fractures. 3D reconstructions of computed\n      tomography images of the Thorax done at admission to hospital will be used in order to\n      evaluate injury according to Lung Injury Scale and Chest wall Injury Scale and for\n      calculating radiological lung volumes and plan surgical procedure in the intervention group.\n      Surgery will be performed as soon as possible after randomization. MatrixRIB\u00ae (DePuy\n      Synthes) Fixation system is used for stabilizing rib fractures with plates and angular\n      locked screws. Unless there is a medical indication or the patient has a chest tube\n      pre-operatively, thoracotomy will be avoided. In cases where thoracotomy is done the\n      patients will receive an anterior and posterior chest tube and wound drain with active\n      suction. All patients, both in the intervention and in the control group will be offered\n      thoracic epidural anaesthesia. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy iv is given as long as the\n      patient has chest tubes. Thrombotic prophylaxis with LMWH is given until the patient is\n      mobilized but for a minimum of 7 days. Patients will be followed-up 6 weeks, 6 months and 1\n      year post-operatively by surgeon and physiotherapist. A low-dosage computer tomography of\n      the thorax will be done after 6 months in order to evaluate healing of the rib cage,\n      possible non-union or dysfunction of osteosynthetic material and measure remaining lung\n      volume. This examination will be compared to the initial computer tomography image done when\n      the patient was admitted. At follow-ups complaints, possible late complications, usage of\n      analgesia and return to work will be recorded. Evaluated instruments, EQ-5D-5L, VAS with\n      Pain-O-Meter (POM) and Disability Rating Index (DRI) will be used to evaluate quality of\n      life, pain and physical function. Range of motion in the thorax, thoracic spine and\n      shoulders will be evaluated for every patient.  Breathing movements will be measured by\n      using a Respiratory movement measuring instrument (RMMI, ReMo Inc) and lung function tests\n      will be performed in a standardized manner."
