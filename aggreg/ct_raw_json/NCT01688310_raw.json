            "textblock": "Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) is a priority preventive intervention and\n      Mozambique is a priority country for VMMC scale-up. PEPFAR recently estimated that one HIV\n      infection would be prevented between now and 2025 for every seven circumcisions performed in\n      Mozambique. Sofala Province, where the study will be conducted, has an HIV prevalence of 13%\n      among men and 18% among women. Approximately 8% of men aged 15-49 in Sofala Province, where\n      the study will take place, are currently circumcised.\n\n      In spite of their widely acknowledged drawbacks, open surgical techniques are the only VMMC\n      techniques the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program currently allows\n      in Africa. According to the Framework for Clinical Evaluation of Devices for Adult Male\n      Circumcision (WHO, 2011): \"WHO and other health authorities wish to identify one or more\n      devices that (a) would make the VMMC safer, easier, and quicker; (b) would have more rapid\n      healing than current methods and/or might entail less risk of HIV transmission in the\n      post-operative period; (c) could be performed safely by health-care providers with a minimal\n      level of training; and (d) would be cost-effective compared to standard surgical methods for\n      male circumcision scale up.\"\n\n      This proposed randomized controlled trial will provide important data which will inform and\n      enable the Mozambican government and PEPFAR to more effectively scale-up circumcision\n      services. The investigators postulate that VMMC using the Gomco clamp coupled with tissue\n      adhesive meets WHO criteria for the ideal method: it is much easier to learn, faster, safer\n      for both surgeons and patients, heals sooner, and is more cost effective than any other\n      currently available technique.\n\n      The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing this\n      minimally-invasive circumcision technique to the open surgical technique:\n\n        -  Gomco clamp with tissue adhesive:  100 men\n\n        -  Open surgical circumcision:     100 men\n\n      The Gomco clamp is an FDA-approved device widely used in the US, but there are few data on\n      its use in Africa. Tissue adhesive is widely used in multiple areas of medicine;\n      specifically, multiple observational studies and RCTs have shown cyanoacrylate tissue\n      adhesives to be superior to suture closure in circumcision in boys. The investigators refer\n      to Gomco clamp circumcision coupled with tissue adhesive as a 'new' technique because these\n      two independently-validated components have only been coupled in observational studies among\n      men, and in randomized controlled trials among pre-pubertal boys, but never before in an RCT\n      among adult men. The open surgical method is PEPFAR-approved and will serve as the control\n      intervention.\n\n      Population:  Men > 18 years of age who desire male circumcision Sample size: 200 (100 men in\n      each group) Study design:  Randomized controlled trial Intervention:  Gomco clamp\n      circumcision plus tissue adhesive vs. open surgical circumcision Follow-up visits: 2 days, 7\n      days, 14 days and 28 days. Optional 42 day follow-up if not completely healed by 4 weeks."
