Clinical parameters (plaque index, bleeding index and gingival index)will be\n      measured and the plaque samples are  collected from subjects  from each group for\n      microbiological analysis. All the participants will undergo scaling, and they were\n      instructed to refrain from tooth cleaning procedures and were advised to use the prescribed\n      mouth wash twice daily for 4 days. All volunteers were recalled on 5th day for clinical and\n      microbiological analysis. Statistical analysis and results are awaited"
