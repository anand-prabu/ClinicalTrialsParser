The registry will collect prospective patient\n      related and functional outcomes (including use of assistive devices), medication use and\n      imaging data on patients with confirmed osteoarthritis, and the effect of different medical\n      interventions that include PRP, Synvisc / Orthovisc /Euflexxa, bracing, suggested exercises,\n      supplements, and diet. Information from the data collection will be used to compare outcomes\n      of non-surgical alternatives with the end point being knee arthroplasty.  The information\n      results will enhance our knowledge of the long-term efficacy and effectiveness of\n      non-surgical interventions intended to treat the progression of osteoarthritis.\n\n      Hypotheses:\n\n        -  Different non-surgical interventions such as PRP, Synvisc\u00ae, Orthrovisc\u00ae, Euflexxa,\n           bracing, physical therapy, and a prescribed combination of exercise, diet, and\n           supplements will demonstrate statistically significant differences in patient pain and\n           functional outcomes compared to usual interventions including use of NSAIDs,\n           corticosteroid injections, and use of assistive devices such as canes.\n\n        -  Non-operative interventions for knee osteoarthritis will be associated with different\n           rates of breakdown of articular cartilage and different rates of progression of\n           osteoarthritis as evidenced by MRI or joint space narrowing on standing knee films?\n\n        -  Education about available non-operative treatment methods may change time the end point\n           of total or partial knee replacement for patients with knee osteoarthritis of varying\n           severity.\n\n        -  Different non-operative interventions will be associated with different times to total\n           or partial knee arthroplasty in patient with knee osteoarthritis of similar severity.\n\n        -  An electronic data capture system (EDC) for osteoarthritis patients will improve\n           patient care and patient outcomes."
