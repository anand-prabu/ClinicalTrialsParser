II. Determine the tolerability and safety of this regimen in these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily for 14 days. Treatment continues\n      every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-35 patients will be accrued for this study."
