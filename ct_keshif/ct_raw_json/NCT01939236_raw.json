And according to the nature of the clinical presentation, HF is divided\n      into acute or chronic HF.\n\n      In 2003, a random sample survey of 15,518 urban or rural residents between 35 and 74 years\n      old was made in China: the prevalence rate of heart failure was 0.9%, and according to the\n      result, there was about 4,000,000 HF subjects in China.\n\n      In China, the integrative treatment of western and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for HF\n      is common and has been developed as a treatment model. TCM has been used in China and other\n      south and east Asia countries for thousands of years. Syndrome differentiation and treatment\n      variation are the basic principles in understanding and treatment of diseases. Investigators\n      would like to test the hypothesis that it is efficacy and safety for patients to take TCM\n      granules according to syndrome differentiation.\n\n      The specific aims for the study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TCM in treating\n      chronic heart failure (CHF)."
