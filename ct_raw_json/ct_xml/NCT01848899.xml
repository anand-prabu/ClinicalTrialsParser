  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine how two different types of iodinated contrast media
      (CM) agents, low-osmolar ionic ioxaglate and iso-osmolar non-ionic iodixanol, affect
      specific markers of thrombogenesis and platelet function in patients undergoing coronary
      angiography, and if the use of bivalirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor used during
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), affects any contrast-related changes in
      thrombogenesis and platelet function.

      Currently more than 1 million percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) are performed in the
      United States annually. Despite the use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant pharmacotherapy,
      thrombotic complications of PCI continue to cause significant morbidity, especially in
      already high risk patients. In addition to adjunctive anti- thrombotic and anti-platelet
      therapy, the type of contrast agent used may also affect thrombus formation by directly
      affecting specific coagulation factors, fibrinolytic factors, and platelet degranulation,
      aggregation, or adhesion.

      Optimizing thrombotic risk in patients requiring coronary angiography with or without
      intervention is paramount to patient care. This is especially true if a type of contrast
      agent is found to have a superior role in reducing factors known to increase peri-procedural
      thromboembolic events.

    <description>The study will be a prospective, randomized study of patients (n=100) undergoing coronary angiography. Patients will be randomly assigned to either receive ioxaglate or iodixanol during coronary angiography. The primary outcome measure will be a change in thrombin generation test from baseline to after coronary angiography. Secondary outcomes will include a change in other markers of platelet activity and thrombogenesis between baseline and after coronary angiography. In addition, in patients undergoing PCI, differences in markers after the administration of bivalirudin and after PCI will be evaluated.</description>
