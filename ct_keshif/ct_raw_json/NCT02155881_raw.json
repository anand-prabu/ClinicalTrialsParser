The overall time to participate in this\n      study is up to 5 weeks. Participants will make 3 visits to the clinic, and will be contacted\n      by telephone 14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment."

Any condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, can be clinically\n             significant and/or affect the participant's ability to participate in the clinical\n             trial.\n\n         14. Exposure to systemic corticosteroids for any indication, chronic or intermittent\n             (e.g.: contact dermatitis), during the past 2 months, or presence of an underlying\n             condition that can reasonably be expected to require treatment with corticosteroids\n             during the course of the study.\n\n         15.
