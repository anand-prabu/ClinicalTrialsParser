No studies have shown what the best insulin regimen is for CABG patients\n      with type 2 diabetes after going home from the hospital.  Accordingly, patients with high\n      blood sugar and diabetes after cardiac bypass surgery will be followed for 3 months to look\n      at how well their treatment(s) for diabetes work after discharge. Patients with diabetes\n      will be discharged (sent home) on diabetes pills or with insulin glargine injections based\n      on their sugar control. Patients with admission  A1c < 7% (a laboratory value that shows the\n      average sugar level in the body over 3 months) will be discharged on the same diabetes\n      medications that they used before coming to the hospital.. Those with an A1c between 7% and\n      9% will be discharged on insulin glargine at 50-80% of the dose used in the hospital and\n      their home diabetes pills. Those with an A1c > 9% will be discharged on glargine at 80-100%\n      of  the dose used in the hospital in addition their home diabetes pill or with insulin\n      glargine and insulin glulisine. The primary outcome will be a change in A1c at 4 and 12\n      weeks after discharge.  Approximately 300 patients will be enrolled in CABG discharge trial."
