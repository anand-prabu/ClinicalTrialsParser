    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy
      of Zelboraf (vemurafenib) in Chinese patients with BRAFV600 mutation-positive unresectable
      or metastatic melanoma. Patients will receive Zelboraf 960 mg orally twice daily until
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

             treatment

          -  Adequate hematologic, renal, and liver function as defined by protocol

          -  Fertile men and women must use an effective method of contraception during treatment
