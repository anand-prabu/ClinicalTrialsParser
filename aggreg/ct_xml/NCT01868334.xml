  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether or not the 4 Pillars Toolkit increases adult
      Influenza, pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV), tetanus, adult diphtheria and
      acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap/Td) vaccination rates.  The vaccines are all FDA licensed
      vaccines and to be used according to national guidelines.  The investigators will conduct a
      randomized cluster trial of this  toolkit in diverse primary care practice with electronic
      medical records (EMRs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This intervention is a two-region, two-year, stratified randomized cluster trial in 24
      primary care practices with EMRs. These practices will be randomly assigned to be
      intervention or control sites to test this 4 Pillars Toolkit intervention package of
      evidence-based techniques tailored to their practice structure and culture; one set of
      practices randomized to intervention in year 1 and the other to control. In year 2, the
      other set of practices will receive the intervention and community controls may be sought.

      These diverse practices consist of: 18 diverse practices from UPMC in western Pennsylvania
      and 6 diverse practices from large community health centers in a PBRN in Texas.

    <description>12 diverse clinical practices will receive no additional assistance in Year 1 to increase their adult influenza, PPSV, Tdap/Td vaccination rates, they will follow guidelines for usual care. In Year 2 however they will become intervention sites and receive the 4 Pillars Toolkit for use in increasing vaccination rates</description>

    <description>Extend Vaccination Season: Begin vaccinating for influenza as soon as vaccine arrives; use every visit as opportunity to vaccinate; extend the season for influenza by vaccinating in January and beyond.
Use Express Vaccination services such as influenza vaccination clinics, Open access vaccine scheduling (for all vaccines), or dedicated vaccination station. When giving influenza vaccination, screen for need for PPSV/Tdap.</description>
