            "textblock": "High levels of psychological stress have been reported by 90% of patients with MS\n      experiencing disease exacerbation, and approximately 39% of those with more stable disease\n      course. These stress levels are comparable to patients with a clinical diagnosis of major\n      depression. Cognitive dysfunction affects approximately 40% of community surveyed MS\n      patients, and stress may exacerbate the cognitive burden. Studies have shown that Cognitive\n      Behavior Therapy (CBT) is effective in treating psychological stress. Studies have also\n      shown that exercise is beneficial to mood and cognitive function. Therefore the proposed\n      study will test the comparative benefits of combining CBT and Exercise as an intervention\n      for stress and cognitive dysfunction in MS subjects. The 2 active treatment conditions will\n      be compared with a waitlist control condition.\n\n      There are 4 broad aims to this study: 1) to compare the relative efficacy of CBT, Exercise,\n      and CBT-Exercise for stress in MS, 2) to examine the extent to which neuropsychological\n      features of stress and MS, especially working memory and executive functioning, improve\n      following treatments, 3) to determine the extent to which neuropsychological factors are\n      associated with successful treatment response and improved quality of life, and 4) to\n      determine if combined CBT-Exercise confers greater benefits on measures of stress and\n      neuropsychological functioning compared with Exercise alone.\n\n      The study hypotheses are: 1) All active treatment conditions will lead to significantly\n      greater improvement on measures of stress at post-treatment and follow-up compared to\n      waitlist controls, 2) Combined CBT-Exercise will lead to comparatively greater symptom\n      reduction compared to all other conditions at post-treatment and follow-up assessments on\n      measures of stress, 3) All active treatment conditions will lead to significant improvement\n      in neuropsychological functioning (particularly measures of working memory and executive\n      functioning) at post-treatment compared to controls, and 4) Combined CBT-Exercise will lead\n      to greater improvement in neuropsychological functioning compared to all other conditions at\n      post-treatment.\n\n      The study design allows for examination of the potential additive benefits of CBT and\n      Exercise to usual therapy for patients, and its feasibility as a viable treatment model for\n      MS outpatient clinics and community-based intervention programs. This study will shed light\n      on the treatment of sub-threshold symptoms that are strikingly common in MS population, but\n      often overlooked in favour of more concrete diagnoses (e.g. major depression disorder). This\n      proposed study will also be the first to determine whether evidence-based non-medical\n      treatments for stress and mood disturbances in MS reduce underlying cognitive substrates\n      associated with the illness and known to be exacerbated by stress."
