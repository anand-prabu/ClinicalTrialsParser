The study will consist of Screening (1 day), Open-Label Treatment and Follow-up (3\n      weeks) phase. Subjects will initially receive a starting dose of retigabine IR at 900\n      milligram (mg)/day and the same concurrent antiepileptic drug (AED) regimen that they were\n      receiving at the final visit of the Transition Phase of the parent study. After the first\n      week of the OLE study, the dose of retigabine IR may be adjusted to between 600 and 1200\n      mg/day, with dose adjustments in increments or decrements of 150 mg/week, based on efficacy\n      and tolerability. In addition, the dose and number of concurrent AEDs may also be adjusted\n      to meet each individual subject's needs. The efficacy and safety issues will be assessed\n      throughout the study; subjects will be instructed to call the investigator if they\n      experience any efficacy or tolerability issues between the study visits. As the duration of\n      the study will be determined based on the following four conditions: 1) regulatory approval\n      and commercialisation of retigabine IR; 2) retigabine IR is not approved by the regulatory\n      authorities; 3) the study is terminated by the Sponsor for reasons including, but not\n      limited to, safety issues; or 4) the subject is withdrawn or withdraws consent, 4 years will\n      be considered as a guide to the duration of the study. The safety and tolerability endpoints\n      are incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs); proportion of subjects with AEs leading\n      to discontinuation; change from Baseline in vital sign measurements and weight; change from\n      Baseline in electrocardiogram parameters; change from Baseline in haematology, chemistry,\n      and urinalysis parameters; changes from Baseline in American Urological Association Symptom\n      Index and post-void residual bladder ultrasound volumes; and summary of the Columbia-Suicide\n      Severity Rating Scale.  Efficacy will be assessed by calculating the percent change from\n      Baseline (parent study) in 28-day total POS frequency for the entire open-label Treatment\n      Phase of this OLE study. This will also be calculated based on duration of exposure.\n      Responder rate (defined as a >/=50% reduction from Baseline in 28-day total POS frequency)\n      will also be summarised for the entire open-label Treatment Phase and by duration of\n      exposure."
