  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The analgesic effect of dexamethasone is not well described, but studies have shown that
      dexamethasone can be a safe part of a multimodal analgesic strategy after surgery. Our
      purpose is to investigate if dexamethasone in combination with paracetamol and ibuprofen has
      an increased analgesic effect compared to paracetamol and ibuprofen alone, on postoperative
      pain after spine surgery. Our hypothesis is that dexamethasone can reduce postoperative pain
      and reduce opioidconsumption and side effects compared to placebo.

      The analgesic effect of dexamethasone is not well described, but studies have shown that an
      intermediate dosis of dexamethasone (0.11-0.2 mg/kg) can be a safe part of a multimodal
      analgesic strategy after surgery. Dexamethasone has an opioid-sparing effect and reduces
      pain during rest and mobilisation. Our purpose is to investigate if dexamethasone in
      combination with paracetamol and ibuprofen has an increased analgesic effect compared to
      paracetamol and ibuprofen alone, on postoperative pain after herniated disk surgery. Our
      hypothesis is that dexamethasone can reduce postoperative pain and reduce opioidconsumption
      and side effects compared to placebo.
