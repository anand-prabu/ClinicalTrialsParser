  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether conversion to everolimus (Zortress®),
      allowing the elimination or reduction of calcineurin inhibitors, will reduce nephrotoxicity
      (measured by increased creatinine clearance) and lengthen overall graft (kidney transplant)
      survival (measured by 2-3 year graft survival).

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether conversion to everolimus (Zortress®),
      allowing the elimination or reduction of calcineurin inhibitors, will reduce nephrotoxicity
      (measured by increased creatinine clearance) and lengthen overall graft (kidney transplant)
      survival (measured by 2-3 year graft survival). Among the worst of the long-term effects of
      chronic immunosuppression are the nephrotoxicity (toxic to kidney cells) of the calcineurin
      inhibitors and the myriad complications of steroids. This protocol evaluates the elimination
      or reduction of calcineurin inhibitors in a protocol that has already successfully
      eliminated the long-term use of steroids. A considerable need remains for safer therapeutic
      agents that inhibit T-cell activation (a white blood cell that attacks foreign cells as part
      of the immune response) via a calcineurin independent or reduced-dose mechanism of action.

          -  Patient on renal replacement therapy.

          -  Patient who experienced biopsy proven rejection.

          -  Patient who has a current severe systemic infection according to the investigator
             judgment requiring continued therapy that would interfere with the objectives of the
             study.

          -  Patients with ongoing wound healing problems, clinically significant infection
             requiring continued therapy or other severe surgical complication in the opinion of
             the investigator.

          -  Presence of intractable immunosuppressant complications or side effects.

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive serum human chorionic gonadotrophin laboratory test (&gt;5 mIU/mL)

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, including women whose career, lifestyle, or sexual orientation
             precludes intercourse with a male partner and women whose partners have been
             sterilized by vasectomy or other means, UNLESS they are using two birth control
             methods.
