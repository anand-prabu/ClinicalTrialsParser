      Service Dogs are trained to assist people with disabilities to accomplish tasks which permit
      the individual to be more functional in their home and social environment. Often the dogs
      are trained to help in the completion of activities of daily living and instrumental
      activities of daily living.  Service Dogs are efficacious for individuals with disabilities,
      such as vision limitations, spinal cord injury and hearing problems. In addition, some
      mental health outcomes have improved with the introduction of a Service Dog.  A research
      study was mandated in the Department of Defense Bill of 2010, to examine the efficacy of
      service dogs for Veterans with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Together with the
      Cooperative Studies Program, the proponents have designed a research study to effectively
      meet the demands of the Bill and to provide timely research into an evolving field.

      Background:  Service Dogs are trained to assist people with disabilities to accomplish tasks
      which permit the individual to be more functional in their home and social environment.
      Often the dogs are trained to help in the completion of activities of daily living and
      instrumental activities of daily living.  Service Dogs are efficacious for individuals with
      disabilities, such as vision limitations, spinal cord injury and hearing problems. In
      addition, some mental health outcomes have improved with the introduction of a Service Dog.
      A research study was mandated in the Department of Defense Bill of 2010, to examine the
      efficacy of service dogs for Veterans with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Together
      with the Cooperative Studies Program, the proponents have designed a research study to
      effectively meet the demands of the Bill and to provide timely research into an evolving
      field.

      Study Primary Objective:  To examine how limitations on activity and quality of life in
      Veterans with PTSD are impacted by the provision of a Service Dog versus an Emotional
      Support Dog.

      Study Design:  A three-year prospective randomized study is proposed which has two
      randomized arms.  Arm one of the study will be Veterans (n=110) randomized to receiving a
      Service Dog, which has been trained for specific tasks to assist with the Veteran's
      disability. Arm two (n=110) of the study will be Veterans randomized to receive an Emotional
      Support Dog (a dog which provide emotional comfort).  All Veterans, after confirmation of
      eligibility will be observed a minimum of three months. During this period, Veterans will be
      required to participate in a Dog Care Course to ensure they are aware of the demands dogs
      place on humans. Once dogs become available, Veterans will be randomized to be paired with a
      Service Dog or Emotional Support Dog. Follow-up will begin at one month post pairing to
      track any dog behavior issues, and will continue every three months after pairing for 18
      months. Primary outcomes to be examined include limitations on activity (as measured by the
      WHO- DAS 2.0), quality of life (measured by the VR-12). Secondary outcomes include PTSD
      symptoms (measured by the PCL-S), Suicidal ideation (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating
      Scale); depression (PHQ-9) and Sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index).  In addition, health
      care utilization, anger management, employment and productivity will also be examined.  This
      multi-site study will be conducted at three locations, Nationwide.
