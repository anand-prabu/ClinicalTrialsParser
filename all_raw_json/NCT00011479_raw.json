It has been shown\n      that young children require a higher abacavir dose based on weight than adults. Older\n      children, or adolescents, may not require as high a dose. This study may provide information\n      as to whether the children's dose or the adult dose is better for HIV-infected adolescents."

This study measures pharmacokinetic data for abacavir in\n      the adolescent population so that an appropriate dosage can be determined.\n\n      Patients are evenly enrolled into 2 groups based on Tanner Stage. Group I patients are\n      Tanner Stage 1 or 2 (pre-pubertal). Group II patients are Tanner Stage 3, 4, or 5\n      (pubertal). Each patient receives a single oral dose of abacavir given as the commercially\n      available oral solution. Pharmacokinetic blood samples are collected before dosing and at\n      0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4, 6, and 8 hours post dose for abacavir concentrations."
