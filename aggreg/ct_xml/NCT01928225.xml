  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer occurs commonly in HIV-infected women in South Africa.  These women have
      poor response to treatment of cervical cancer precursors.  This study will test whether
      giving the quadrivalent vaccine to women prior to surgical treatment of the cervical cancer
      precursor will improve outcomes. We hypothesize that pre-treatment HPV vaccine will result
      in a reduced occurrence or cervical cancer precursors in follow-up.

    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase II trial of
      the quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (qHPV) in HIV-infected women to prevent
      occurrence of cervical HSIL after LEEP/LLETZ. Participants will undergo colposcopy with
      directed biopsies, cervical cytology, and stored HPV testing prior to vaccination.
      Participants will be randomized to the quadrivalent vaccine or saline placebo to be given at
      entry, week 4, and week 26. Women will have LEEP treatment at week 4.  Participants will be
      seen in follow-up for cervical cytology, colposcopy with directed biopsies at weeks 26 and
      52, and stored HPV specimens. Treatment assignment will be unblinded after study follow-up
      is completed for the last study participant.  Women aged 45 or less randomized to placebo
      will be offered open label HPV vaccine after the study is concluded..

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. HIV infection

          2. Women aged ≥ 18 years.

          3. Cervical HSIL on biopsy (i.e. CIN2 and/or CIN3)

          4. For participants of reproductive potential, negative serum or urine pregnancy test

          5. All study participants must agree not to participate in a conception process (e.g.,
             active attempt to become pregnant or in vitro fertilization) during study
             participation (from the time of study entry until week 52).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          3. Cervical cryotherapy or LEEP/LEETZ within one year of entry.

          4. Cervical, vulvar, or vaginal lesions suspicious for cancer, unless biopsies show no
             invasive cancer

          5. Prior receipt of one or more doses of an HPV vaccine.

          6. Receipt of anticoagulants other than aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
             (NSAIDS) within 14 days prior to entry.

             equivalent) , investigational vaccines, interleukins, interferons, growth factors, or
             intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) within 45 days prior to study entry.
