  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities (IDD) have obesity rates that
      exceed those in the general population, consume energy dense diets, and perform very little
      physical activity (PA). Overweight and obesity are independent risk factors for chronic
      disease such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease in both the
      general population and those with IDD.

      The investigators modified the Stop Light Diet (SLDm) to include reduced energy pre-packaged
      meals (PM) for 6 months, encouraged consumption of low energy shakes and 35 fruits and
      vegetables (F/V) per week.  The investigators will compare participants who use the SLDm
      with participants who use a reduced energy and fat diet with meal plans, based off of the
      current American Dietetic Association recommended car for weight reduction plan.

    <description>The experimental diet is the Stop Light Diet modified (SLDm) and includes PM, 35 F/V per week, and low energy shakes. The Investigators will compare this to the RC diet that uses traditional meal plans and includes 35 F/V per week. Weight to be measured following an overnight fast of approximately 12 hours. Weight will be measured in kg. Each person will be weighed in a hospital gown between 8 and 10 am, using a calibrated scale to the nearest 0.1kg.</description>
