This is to\n      determine the normal range for the PSE test in the Danish population.\n\n      Sub-protocol 2: A total of 120 (aprox. 145 to adjust for drop outs) patients with liver\n      cirrhosis from two Danish hospitals will be examined with both CRT and with the test that is\n      the closest we get to a gold standard, namely portosystemic encephalopathy test (PSE). We\n      wish to examine if the CRT test agrees with the PSE test, which may be to time consuming to\n      perform in everyday clinical practice, and with quality of life scores (SF-36 and Sickness\n      Impact Profile). The relationship between the CRT and PSE test and various blood tests and\n      the Charlston co-morbidity score will also be examined.\n\n      Sub-protocol 3: Forty-four of the 120 included patients will, regardless of CRT test result,\n      be randomized to treatment with lactulose, rifaximin and branched chain amino acids (BCAA)\n      or placebo lactulose, rifaximin and BCAA. This is to evaluate whether the CRT method is able\n      to detect a response to treatment, and see if changes in psychometric tests (PSE and CRT)\n      are in accordance with quality of life scores and predicts subsequent development of overt\n      hepatic encephalopathy.\n\n      Perspective: CRT method should, if it proves good enough, continue to be the Danish test of\n      choice and hopefully be more widely used in our country.  The validation of tests for the\n      diagnosis of covert hepatic encephalopathy will give cirrhotic patients with covert hepatic\n      encephalopathy and reduced quality of life the best opportunity to be diagnosed and offered\n      appropriate treatment. If the CRT method is not able to identify a population that benefits\n      from anti-encephalopathy treatment other screening and monitoring tests should be used."
