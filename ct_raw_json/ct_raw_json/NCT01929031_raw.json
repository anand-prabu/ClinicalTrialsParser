The two mandibular third molars may be\n             partial bony impactions or full bony impactions (as long as the trauma rating is not\n             severe and the surgeons do not feel the subject will have extreme post-surgical pain)\n             OR there may be a combination of one full bony impaction with the second mandibular\n             being a soft tissue impaction or partial bony impaction.  Maxillary third molars (or\n             supernumerary teeth) of any type can be extracted;\n\n          -  Use of only the following preoperative medication(s)/ anesthetic(s): topical\n             benzocaine, short-acting local anesthetic (mepivacaine or lidocaine) with or without\n             vasoconstrictor and/or nitrous oxide;\n\n          -  Reliable, cooperative, and of adequate intelligence to record the requested\n             information on the analgesic questionnaire form;\n\n          -  Examined by the attending oral surgeon or physician and medically cleared to\n             participate in the study;\n\n          -  Scheduled to undergo a qualifying surgical procedure;\n\n          -  In good general health, with a BMI of 30 or less, and have no contraindications to\n             any of the study medications or anesthetic drugs;\n\n          -  Subjects have at least a categorical pain score of moderate and a numerical rating\n             scale (NRS) score of 5 or greater within 4.5 hours from the time of the last suture.\n\n        Exclusion criteria:\n\n          -  Presence of a serious medical condition (e.g., poorly controlled hypertension, poorly\n             controlled diabetes, significantly impaired cardiac, renal or hepatic function,\n             hyper- or hypothyroidism);\n\n          -  Use of a prescription or non-prescription drug with which the administration of\n             ibuprofen or any other non steroidal anti inflammatory or caffeine is\n             contraindicated;\n\n          -  Acute local infection at the time of surgery that could confound the post-surgical\n             evaluation;\n\n          -  Females who are pregnant, lactating, of child-bearing potential, or post-menopausal\n             for less than 2 years and not using a medically approved method of contraception\n             (i.e., oral, transdermal, intravaginal or implanted contraceptives, intrauterine\n             device, diaphragm, condom, abstinence, or surgical sterility), or females who test\n             positive on a urine-based pregnancy test;\n\n          -  Presence or history (within 2 years of enrollment) of bleeding disorder(s) or peptic\n             ulcer disease;\n\n          -  History of alcoholism or substance abuse within the last year, or is currently\n             abusing alcohol or other mood-altering drugs (e.g., cannabis).
