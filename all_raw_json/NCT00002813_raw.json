Determine the activity of cisplatin and vinorelbine in terms of response\n      rate, duration of response, time to treatment failure, and survival in patients with\n      advanced, persistent, or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes on\n      days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and cisplatin IV over 4 hours beginning after completion of\n      vinorelbine infusion on day 1. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and\n      then every 6 months for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-62 patients will be accrued for this study within\n      approximately 20 months."
