  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      to evaluate the wall-to-lumen ratio (WLR) of retinal arterioles in hypertensive patients
      with retinal vein occlusion (RVO) before and after dexamethasone intravitreal implant 0.7 mg
      (DEX) compared to a matched control group of normal eyes in non-hypertensive subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the
             full duration of the study;

          -  age &gt; 20 years;

          -  decreased visual acuity as a result of clinically detectable ME associated with
             either CRVO or BRVO;

          -  the duration of macular edema was required to be between 4 and 24 weeks for both CRVO
             and BRVO;

          -  retinal thickness in the central subfield (as measured using optical coherence
             tomography) had to be &gt; 350 µm in the study eye.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  the exclusion criteria were as follows: diabetes; previous intravitreal anti-VEGF
             therapy or intravitreal steroid therapy; previous photodynamic therapy or focal
             laser; active retinal or optic disc neovascularization; active or history of
             choroidal neovascularization; presence of rubeosis iridis; any active infection;
             glaucoma, current ocular hypertension, or a history of steroid-induced intraocular
             pressure (IOP) increase in either eye; or concurrent eye disease in the study eye
             that could compromise visual acuity (e.g., choroidal neovascularization, diabetic
             retinopathy, epiretinal membrane).
