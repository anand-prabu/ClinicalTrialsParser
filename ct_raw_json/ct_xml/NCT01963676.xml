  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigating the effect of non-invasive transcranial current stimulation on auditory
      hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia. Normal neuronal activity is perturbed in
      schizophrenia, so selective targeting of this abnormal activity could serve as a treatment
      for schizophrenia and alleviate symptoms caused by abnormal neuronal activity, such as
      auditory hallucinations.

      AIM 1: To evaluate the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) (2mA for
      20min on five consecutive days) on auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia patients using
      the change in ratings on the Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale (AHRS) by patients before
      and after stimulation. We hypothesize that tDCS will modulate the abnormal neuronal activity
      found in schizophrenic patients and thereby decrease their auditory hallucinations when
      measured after stimulation.

      AIM 2: To evaluate the long term effects of tDCS by having patients give a rating on the
      AHRS after one month has passed since stimulation and comparing this value to their baseline
      score and their score immediately after stimulation. We hypothesize that there will remain a
      significant reduction in auditory hallucination score in participants who received tDCS at
      one month.

      AIM 3: To collect pilot data on a small number of subjects (5) who undergo transcranial
      alternating current stimulation (tACS) instead of tDCS as their stimulation paradigm.
