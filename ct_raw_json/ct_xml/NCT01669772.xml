  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DA-9701 is a new prokinetic agent formulated with Pharbitis Seed and Corydalis Tuber. These
      plants have been used in oriental traditional medicine for the treatment of gastrointestinal
      maladies. In a stage 3 trial, its' efficacy has been compared to that of itopride in
      functional dyspepsia patients and proved to have comparable safety and efficacy. However,
      its' exact effect on the gastrointestinal motility has not been completely elucidated. This
      study will study the effects of DA-9701 on the healthy adult gastrointestinal tract.
