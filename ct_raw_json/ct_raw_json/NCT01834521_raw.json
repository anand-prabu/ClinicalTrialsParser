Key features of the website are self-screening, tailored patient education and self-referral. Self-screening will be performed by an online version of the Dutch Distress thermometer (DT) and Problem List (PL). Patients will receive digital feedback on their DT score immediately after test completion together with information regarding problems reported on the PL, (self)help options and possibilities for referral to professional care. Contact information of one of the investigators will also be available to discuss questions, problems and/or referral needs. Patients may also request a telephone call."

Internet-delivered systems may be well-equipped\n      to meet these demands. The aim of the current study is to assess the effectiveness of a\n      web-based support system. Key features of this system are patient self-screening of physical\n      and psychosocial problems, tailored patient education on reported problems and self-referral\n      to professional care. In this era of high internet usage, we expect that internet is a\n      highly suitable medium to provide tailored support for breast cancer patients and will\n      empower the patient to take control over their convalescence."
