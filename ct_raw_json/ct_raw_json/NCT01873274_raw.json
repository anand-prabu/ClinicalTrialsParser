The study product contained menaquinone-7 (MK-7) and omega-3 fatty\n      acids for vascular health and extra minerals and antioxidants to support general health. It\n      was the first time that such low dose of MK-7 (50 \u00b5g) could significantly improve vascular\n      and general vitamin K-status already after short-term treatment. From the results of this\n      study, it was assumed that the matrix of the dairy product and/or other components in the\n      product, in which the vitamin was offered, contributed to optimal absorption and\n      availability of vitamin K2. In this new study, the uptake and efficacy of MK-7 from the\n      nutrient enriched product is investigated and compared to the uptake and efficacy from a\n      MK-7-containing supplement and a basic dairy product enriched with MK-7."
