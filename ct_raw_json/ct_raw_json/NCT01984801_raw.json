Study SCD117225 will be\n      a randomized, single-blind, three part study, to evaluate the primary irritation potential\n      (Part 1), cumulative irritation potential (Part 2) of two concentrations of GSK1940029 gel\n      applied to the intact skin of healthy subjects, and  the facial irritation potential  of one\n      or two concentrations of GSK1940029 applied to the face of acne patients (Part3). In Part 1\n      and Part 2 the following 6 treatments will be applied using individual patches: (A) 200\n      milligrams (mg) of 0.3% GSK1940029 gel, (B) 200 mg of 1% GSK1940029 gel, (C) 200 mg of\n      0.3%/1% vehicle gel only (vehicle control), (D) 200 microliters (\u00b5L) of sterile distilled\n      water (negative irritant control), (E) 200 \u00b5L of - 0.5% sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) in\n      sterile distilled water for Part 1/0.1% SLS in sterile distilled water for Part 2 (positive\n      irritant control), and (F) Patch only (patch control). Each treatment will be randomized to\n      one of six designated locations on either upper arm or other locations, such as the lower or\n      upper back, within each subject. The same treatment will be reapplied to the same location\n      on subsequent days. Each treatment will be applied daily for 2 days in Part 1, and daily for\n      21 days in Part 2. In Part 3, each patient will apply a thin coat of one or two\n      concentration of GSK1940029 gel or vehicle to acne affected facial/neck skin by hand, once\n      daily for 28 days. Parts within Study SCD117225 and Study SCD117226 will have\n      interdependencies. No significant primary irritation signal in Study SCD117225 Part 1 would\n      allow initiation of Study SCD117226 Part 1 (single dose application). Once safety,\n      tolerability and exposure information are determined in Study SCD117226 Part 1, Part 2 of\n      Study SCD117225  may be initiated along with Part 2 (14-day repeat dose application). No\n      significant cumulative irritation signal (study SCD117225 Part 2) in combination with\n      adequate 14-day safety (study SCD117226 Part 2) would allow initiation of Part 3 of Study\n      SCD117225."
