The technique will be evaluated as a complementary treatment to standard treatment of\n      constipation (patient educational materials about treatments such as stool softeners,\n      laxatives fiber supplements, and increased exercise). Although this technique has been\n      studied for other conditions (for example in pregnant women to prevent birthing-related\n      injuries), and it is recommended anecdotally by some physicians, this would be the first\n      time it will be studied for chronic constipation in a randomized, controlled clinical trial.\n\n      $50 dollars in compensation is provided for about an hour of participant's time."
