These subtypes of NHL are an aggressive group of diseases. At\n      present, in developed countries, 80 to 90% of children with NHL are cured by intensive,\n      risk-adapted chemotherapy.The best protocols include BFM-90, LMB-89 and FAB/LMB/96. However,\n      in developing countries, such as those with low and moderate incomes, the limited\n      availability of resources is an obstacle for using these complicated and intensive\n      protocols.As such, very simple protocols, such as the CHOP protocol, were often used to\n      treat children and adolescents with NHL, thus resulting in poor survival rates. To improve\n      the survival rate of Chinese children and adolescents with NHL, This study was designed to\n      evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of this modified NHL-BFM -90 protocol in Chinese children\n      and adolescents with NHL."
