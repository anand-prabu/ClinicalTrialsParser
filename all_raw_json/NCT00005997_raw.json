Treatment repeats\n      every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts according to hepatic dysfunction. (Cohort I closed\n      to accrual as of 11/1/03.)\n\n        -  Cohort I (closed to accrual as of 11/1/03): Patients receive a fixed dose of\n           rebeccamycin analogue.\n\n        -  Cohort II: Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of rebeccamycin analogue\n           until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose\n           preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-37\n      months."
