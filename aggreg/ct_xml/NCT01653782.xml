  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled study will evaluate the cost effectiveness of a yoga intervention
      compared to two evidence based programs; giving advice to stay active and  guided exercise
      sessions. The first active program includes a six week standardized strength training
      program where the participants are personally instructed by a trained physiotherapist. The
      second active program is a six week standardized kundalini yoga program with group sessions
      twice a week lead by an experienced yoga instructor. Both programs consist of two exercise
      sessions per week and lasts for six weeks. After six weeks the participants are instructed
      to continue practicing their program twice a week on their own. The hypothesis are that a
      kundalini yoga program as an early intervention for Low Back Pain (LBP) is more cost
      effective than the two other interventions studied.

      Participants were recruited through the occupational health services and by advertisement in
      the local press. Study subjects eligible for inclusion were informed of the study either by
      health care personnel at the occupational health care centers or by a research assistant at
      the Karolinska Institutet.  Subjects were informed that if they were eligible to participate
      in the study they would be given the opportunity to participate in one of three approaches
      for treatment of neck and back pain.
