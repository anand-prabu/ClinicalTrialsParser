  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate clinical outcome for patients receiving treatment of suspected premalignant and
      malignant gastrointestinal lesions at Interventional Endoscopy Services. The primary outcome
      is curative endoscopic resection, and the secondary outcomes are complication rates, such as
      infection, bleeding, perforation and death, and one-year survival rates.
