To further investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of WR 6026,\n      and in particular to examine potential correlations between the area under the\n      concentration-time curve and methemoglobinemia or other toxicities.\n\n      In recent animal studies, WR 6026 demonstrated inhibitory activity against Pneumocystis\n      carinii pneumonia (PCP). This study will assess the safety and tolerance of this drug in\n      HIV-infected patients who do not have PCP."

This study will assess the safety and tolerance of this drug in\n      HIV-infected patients who do not have PCP.\n\n      Escalating doses of WR 6026 will be studied in successive patient cohorts. Four patients\n      will be randomized to active drug or placebo in a 3:1 ratio at each dose level until\n      moderate toxicity is demonstrated. If one patient at a given dose level experiences WR\n      6026-related moderate or worse toxicity, the sample size for all subsequent dose levels will\n      be doubled. If two or more patients at a given dose level experience moderate or\n      dose-limiting toxicity, an additional four patients (randomized in the same 3:1 ratio) will\n      be entered at that level, and sample size at all subsequent dose levels will be doubled.\n      Dose escalation will continue until three of six patients receiving active drug at a given\n      dose level experience dose-limiting or worse toxicity, or until two of six patients at a\n      given dose level experience life-threatening toxicity. The MTD will be defined as the dose\n      immediately below the highest dose studied. Eight additional patients will be studied at the\n      presumed MTD to confirm tolerance."
