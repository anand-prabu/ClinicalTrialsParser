Patients receive lipidated HPV-16 E7 peptide vaccine\n      subcutaneously on days 1 and 14 and dendritic cell-HPV-16 E7 peptide vaccine IV over 15-30\n      minutes on days 7 and 21. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease or complete or partial response may\n      receive one additional treatment course, beginning 6 weeks after the end of the first\n      course.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-9 patients receive escalating doses of dendritic cell-HPV-16 E7 peptide\n      vaccine. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose limiting toxicity.\n\n      A parallel cohort of patients receives dendritic cell-HPV-16 E7 peptide vaccine IV over\n      15-30 minutes on days 7 and 14, but does not receive lipidated HPV-16 E7 peptide.\n\n      Patients are followed at one week.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 27 patients will be accrued for this study at a rate of 15\n      patients per year."
