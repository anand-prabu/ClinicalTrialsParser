The treatment the\n      investigators are using in this study is an eye injection of a drug called aflibercept (also\n      called EYLEA). Eylea is FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved for treatment of wet age\n      related macular degeneration.\n\n      The investigators hope that \"treat and extend\" strikes the right balance between making sure\n      patients get all of the treatments needed, but not giving patients too many treatments (so\n      that the side effects of treatments are minimized and so that patients don't have to make\n      more visits than they need to maintain maximum visual gain).  The experimental part of this\n      study is determining this \"right balance\" of eye injections."
