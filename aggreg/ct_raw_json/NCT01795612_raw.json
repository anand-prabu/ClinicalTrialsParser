It contributes to an improvement in the quality of life and to a decrease in\n      the current treatment side effects and mortality. Cancer in association with treatment\n      toxicity and an inactive lifestyle lead to a fall in physical capability and causes problems\n      in daily activities. The physical capacity and the tolerance for exercise fall\n      simultaneously leading to a deconditioning vicious circle which increases physical,\n      psychological and emotional symptoms of fatigue. Therefore, physical activity for health is\n      a valid and relevant way to improve quality of life and to manage cancer patient fatigue.\n      The aim of the study is the assessment of the effects of a physical activity retraining\n      program on aerobic capacity, strength and fatigue, in a breast cancer population treated by\n      adjuvant or n\u00e9oadjuvant chemotherapy."
