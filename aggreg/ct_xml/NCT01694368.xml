      This study is being performed to characterize the composition and morphologic
      characteristics of atherosclerotic coronary artery plaques with intra-coronary near-infrared
      spectroscopy and intravascular ultrasound in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary
      intervention.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is at &gt; 18 years of age

          2. Subject presents to the catheterization laboratory to undergo clinically-indicated,
             invasive coronary angiography

          3. Subject is willing and able to provide informed written consent

          4. Subject is found to have ≥ 1 severe coronary artery stenosis by invasive angiography
             and percutaneous coronary intervention is planned for definitive treatment or found
             to have ≥ 1 intermediate coronary artery stenosis and IVUS planned for lesion
             assessment

          5. Coronary anatomy is deemed suitable for combined NIRS-IVUS by the interventional
             cardiologist performing invasive angiography and intervention

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is pregnant or suspected to be pregnant

          2. Subject is unable to provide informed consent

          3. Subject has coronary artery anatomy deemed by interventionalist as unsuitable for
             NIRS-IVUS
