  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric cerebral malaria (CM) affects more than 3 million children each year killing ~20%
      and leaving one third of survivors with long term neurologic and psychiatric sequelae.
      Seizures occur commonly with CM and are associated with an increased risk of death and
      neuropsychiatric disabilities. In this Malawi-based, dose- escalation, safety and
      feasibility study of enteral levetiracetam in pediatric CM, the investigators will lay the
      groundwork for future efficacy studies aimed at improving seizure control and ultimately
      decreasing the neurologic morbidity of pediatric CM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral malaria (CM) affects ~3 million children each year, primarily in sub-Saharan
      Africa. Antimalarial medications can rapidly clear P. falciparum parasites, but mortality
      rates remain high (12-25%). Survivors do not escape unscathed--~30% experience neurologic
      sequelae including epilepsy, behavioral disorders and gross neurologic deficits. Acute
      seizures occur commonly in CM and are associated with higher neurologic morbidity and
      mortality. Seizure management in malaria endemic regions is challenging because the
      available antiepileptic drugs (AED) induce respiratory suppression and assisted ventilation
      is unavailable. More optimal seizure control may improve neurologic outcomes in pediatric CM
      survivors, especially if the medication used is affordable and can be delivered safely and
      easily in resource limited settings. The investigators propose to conduct a dose-
      escalation, safety and feasibility study of enteral levetiracetam (LVT) for seizure control
      in children with CM and seizures admitted to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre,
      Malawi. Enteral LVT given via nasogastric tube (NGT) rather than an intravenous (IV)
      formulation will be used since LVT has excellent enteral bioavailability and IV formations
      are not affordable in most malaria-endemic regions. LVT will be escalated based upon
      efficacy and toxicity endpoints with efficacy defined as seizure freedom in 75% of children
      during the 24 hours post LVT administration. Generally, only ~20% of children admitted with
      CM and seizures who receive standard AED treatment remain seizure free during the first 24
      hours after admission. Safety assessments will include monitoring for problems related to
      NGT placement and medication delivery, laboratory parameters at 24 hours and 7 days post
      LVT, and overall case fatality rates. If efficacy endpoints are not met but enteral LVT is
      otherwise tolerated, LVT doses of ~3 times the standard dose used for other seizure-related
      conditions will be assessed. Pharmacokinetic (Pk) data on the absorption and elimination of
      LVT in CM will be obtained since enteral formulations are not typically used in critically
      ill children and malaria has been shown to impact drug absorption and elimination for some
      other medications. The safety, feasibility, Pk, optimal dosing and preliminary efficacy data
      from this proposed work will provide the information needed to determine whether to proceed
      with a randomized clinical trial of LVT in pediatric CM patients which would include acute
      seizure control as well as long term neurologic outcomes as critical endpoints. Since
      enteral LVT is relatively affordable for short-term use and could be feasibly delivered in
      resource limited settings, this therapy could potentially be scaled up for broad use
      throughout malaria endemic African countries
